In fact, it is clear that the Fej6r-Riesz inequality (Theorem 1) follows from Theorem 4, Proposition 8, and Fatou's lemma; Hardy's inequality (Theorem 2) is a consequence of Theorem 5, Proposition 8, and Fatou's lemma; and the Hardy-Littlewood inequality (Theorem 3) can be deduced from Theorem 6, Proposition 8, and Fatou's lemma.

A proof of the theorem is usually several pages long [2]. In this note we give a simple proof. Theorem (Descartes's Rule of Signs). Let p(x) = aoxbo + alxbl + ... + anxbn de- note a polynomial with nonzero real coefficients ai, where the bi are integers satisfying 0 < bo < bl < b2 < ... < bn. Then the number ofpositive real zeros of p(x) (counted with multiplicities') is either equal to the number of variations in sign in the sequence ao, ... , an of the coefficients or less than that by an even whole number. The number of negative zeros of p(x) (counted with multiplicities) is either equal to the number of variations in sign in the sequence of the coefficients of p(-x) or less than that by an even whole number In the following we denote the number of variations in the signs of the sequence of the coefficients of p by v(p) and the number of positive zeros of p counting multiplic- ities by z(p). We need the following simple lemma. Lemma. Let p(x) - aoxbo + alxbl + ... + anxbn be a polynomial as in the theorem. If aoan > 0, then z(p) is even; if aoan < O, then z(p) is odd. Proof We consider only the case when ao > 0 and an > 0. The other cases can be handled similarly. Because p(O) > 0 and p(x) -- oc as x -- oc, it is clear that the graph of p crosses the positive x-axis an even number of times, where we count cross- ings without regard to multiplicity. If x = a is a point at which the graph of p touches but does not cross the positive x-axis, then the multiplicity of a is even. If the graph 1The theorem would be false if the positive real roots were counted without multiplicity, as the example 2 - 2x + 1 shows. June-July 2004] NOTES 525 of p crosses the positive x-axis at a multiple zero x = a, then x = a is a zero of odd multiplicity. Thus the multiple zeros contribute an additional even number to z(p), whence z(p) is even. 0 Proof of the theorem. We need prove only the first part of the theorem. Without loss of generality we may assume that bo = 0. We argue by induction on n. It is obvious that for n = 1, v(p) = z(p). Assume that for n < k- 1, v(p) > z(p) and z(p) = v (p)(mod2), and consider the situation for n = k. We need to treat the following cases. Case 1: aoal > 0. In this instance v(p) = v(p'). By the lemma, z(p) - z(p') (mod 2). By the induction hypothesis, z(p') - v(p')(mod 2) and z(p') < v(p'). Thus z(p) - v(p) (mod 2). An appeal to Rolle's theorem gives z(p') > z(p) - 1. It follows that v(p) = v(p') > z(p') > z(p) - 1 > z(p) - 2, so z(p) < v(p). Case 2: aoal < 0. Here v(p') + 1 = v(p) and z(p) - z(p') - 1(mod 2) in view of the lemma. By the induction hypothesis, z(p') - v(p')(mod 2) and z(p') < v(p'). Again we infer that z(p) - v(p)(mod 2). By Rolle's theorem, z(p') > z(p) - 1. Thus v(p) = v(p') + 1 > z(p') + 1 > z(p). E Remark. All steps of the foregoing proof remain valid if we drop the requirement that the bi be nonnegative integers and instead allow them to be arbitrary real numbers (possibly negative) satisfying bo < bi < ... < b,. As a result, the first part of the theorem can be generalized to polynomials with real exponents. Example. Let p(t) = ao + alebIt + a2eb2t . Letting x = ebit yields p(t) = ao + alx + a2xb2/bi = Q(x). Since Q has at most two positive zeros, p has at most two real zeros. ACKNOWLEDGMENT. The author would like to thank the referee for his valuable suggestions. The referee also pointed out that [1] refers to z(p) < v(p) as \"Descartes's Lemma,\" with no mention of the additional fact that z(p) - v(p)(mod 2). The proof that z(p) < v(p) given in [1] is essentially the same as our proof of that fact. REFERENCES 1. J. Bochnak, M. Coste, and M.-F.
