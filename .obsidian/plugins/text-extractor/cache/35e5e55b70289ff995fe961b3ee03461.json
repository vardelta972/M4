All answers must be expressed in simplest form unless speciﬁed otherwise. Only answers written inside the boxes on the answer sheet will be considered for grading. No calculators. 1. If f (x) = x2 and g(x) = ln(x), compute f ′(1) + g′(1). 2. Given that f (x) = x2 + ax − 17, ﬁnd all real values of a such that f (4) = f ′(4). 3. Find the value of a such that ∫ a 1 (3x 2 − 6x + 3) dx = 27. 4. Compute ∫ 4 0 dx √ |x − 2| . 5. Eric and Harrison are standing in a ﬁeld, and Eric is 400 feet directly East of Harrison. Eric starts to walk North at a rate of 4 feet per second, while Harrsion starts to walk South at the same time at a rate of 6 feet per second. After 30 seconds, at what rate is the distance between Eric and Harrison changing? 6. Compute lim x→0 (1 − cos x)2 x2 − x2 cos2 x . 7. Compute ∫ 0 −2 x3 + 4x2 + 7x − 20 x2 + 4x + 8 dx + ∫ 2 0 2x3 − 7x2 + 9x − 10 x2 + 4 dx. 8. Compute lim n→∞ n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x2018x+1 dx. 9. Compute ∫ π 0 2x sin x 3 + cos 2x dx. 10. Fact: The value ln(2) is not the root of any polynomial with rational coeﬃcients. For any nonnegative integer n, let pn(x) be the unique polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that pn(ln(2)) = ∫ 2 1 (ln(x)) n dx. Compute the value of the sum ∞∑ n=0 1 pn(0) .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
