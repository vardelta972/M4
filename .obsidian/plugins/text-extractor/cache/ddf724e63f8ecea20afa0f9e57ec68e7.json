On each of (n+m m ) days, she starts at the lower left corner of a neighborhood that consists of a n × m grid of blocks separated by roads, and travels along the roads to the upper right corner, only going right or up at each intersection. When she gets there, she counts the number of blocks, b, that lie above here path, and adds the monomial qb to the value on her paper. If Amy never took the same path more than once, show that, by the end of the (n+m m ) days, the sum on her paper is equal to the q-binomial coeﬃcient ( n + m m ) q = (n + m)q! (n)q!(m)q! .

Let 2n lamps labeled 1, 2, ..., 2n be given, each of which can be either on or oﬀ. Initially all the lamps are oﬀ. We consider sequences of steps: at each step one of the lamps is switched (from on to oﬀ or from oﬀ to on). Let N be the number of such sequences consisting of k steps and resulting in the state where lamps 1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all oﬀ. Let M be number of such sequences consisting of k steps, resulting in the state where lamps 1 through n are all on, and lamps n + 1 through 2n are all oﬀ, but where none of the lamps n + 1 through 2n is ever switched on. Determine N M . Problem 20 (TST 2006). Let n be a given integer with n greater than 7, and let P be a convex polygon with n sides.
