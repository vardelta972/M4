Then the kth symmetric sum of the roots is equal to (−1) kan−k/an. • Division algorithm: Let a(x) and b(x) be polynomials. There exist unique polynomials q(x) and r(x) with deg(r) < deg(d) and such that a(x) = b(x)q(x) + r(x). • Rational root theorem: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. If p(x) has a rational root r s with r, s ∈ Z and (r, s) = 1 then r | a0 and s | an. • Gauss’s Lemma: If p(x) ∈ Z[x] factors in Q[x], then it factors in Z[x]. • Eisenstein’s Criterion: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, and let q be a prime that divides a0, a1, · · · , an−1 but not an. If q2 ∤ a0 then p(x) is irreducible over the integers (and thus also over the rationals, by Gauss’s lemma). • Descartes’ Rule of Signs: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, and let V be the number of sign changes in the coeﬃcient list an, . . . , a0 where we ignore zero coeﬃcients. If p(x) has N positive roots (counted by multiplicity) then N = V − 2k for some non-negative integer k. (Use this for p(−x) to get the statement for negative roots of p(x). • Rolle’s Theorem: Let p(x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Between any two zeroes of p(x) lies a zero of p′(x). • Lagrange Interpolation: A polynomial of degree at most n with p(ak) = bk, 0 ≤ k ≤ n is given by p(x) = n∑ k=0 bk(x − a0)(x − a1) · · · (x − ak−1)(x − ak+1) · · · (x − an) (a − a0)(a − a1) · · · (a − ak−1)(a − ak+1) · · · (a − an) . • Newtonian interpolation (ﬁnite diﬀerences): A polynomial p of degree at most n with p(k) = bk, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, is given by p(x) = n∑ k=0 ∆ kp(0)(x k ), where ∆p(x) = p(x + 1) − p(x) and ∆kp(x) = ∆(∆ k−1p(x)). 1 MOP 2010, Black Group Polynomials June 14, 2010 • Chebyshev Polynomials: The nth Chebyshev polynomial is deﬁned so that Tn(cos θ) = cos(nθ). They satisfy the recurrence Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) − Tn−1(x) n ≥ 1 with T0(x) = 1 and T1(x) = x. (There are also Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind which satisfy Un(cos θ) = sin(n+1)θ sin θ and have a recurrence of the same form. These are much less common, though.) • Maximum Modulus Theorem: Let p(x) be a polynomial with complex coeﬀcients. Let D be an open region in the complex plane, and let ∂D be the boundary of D. Then maxz∈D∩∂D |p(z)| = maxz∈∂D |p(z)|. What do these problems have in common? 1. Let A1, A2, . . . , An be points in the plane, and BC a segment of length 2. Prove that there exists a point M on BC such that M A1 · M A2 · · · M An ≥ 1 2n−1 . 2 (Vietnam). Find all polynomials P (x) with integer coeﬃcients such that the polynomial Q(x) = (x2 + 6x + 10) · P 2(x) − 1 is the square of a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. 3. Let {Pn(x)}∞ n=1 be a sequence of polynomials such that P1(x) = x2 − 1, P2(x) = 2x2(x2 − 1), and Pn−1(x)Pn+1(x) = (Pn(x)) 2 − (x2 − 1) 2. Let Sn denote the sum of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of Pn(x). For each positive integer n ﬁnd the largest non-negative integer kn such that 2 k divides Sn. 4 (MOP ’03). Let k be a positive integer. Prove that √k + 1−√k is not the real part of a complex number z such that zn = 1 for some positive integer n. 5 (IMO Shortlist 2003). The sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . is deﬁned as follows: a0 = 2, ak+1 = 2a2 k − 1 for k ≥ 0. Prove that if an odd prime p divides an, then 2 n+3 divides p2 − 1. 6 (IMO Shortlist 2003). Let R+ be the set of all positive real numbers. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ that satisfy the following conditions: • f (xyz) + f (x) + f (y) + f (z) = f ( √xy)f ( √yz)f ( √zx) for all x, y, z ∈ R+; • f (x) < f (y) for all 1 ≤ x < y. General Problems 7. Determine all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x) 2+P (1/x) 2 = P (x) 2P (1/x) 2 for all x ̸= 0. 8 (MOP ’08). Let Pn be a polynomial of degree n with real coecients, and let t be a real number with t ≥ 3. For integers n ≥ 0, show that max 0≤k≤n+1 |t n − Pn(k)| ≥ 1 2 MOP 2010, Black Group Polynomials June 14, 2010 9. Let p, q, r be polynomials with real coeﬃcients, such that at least one of the polynomials has degree 2 and at least one of the polynomials has degree 3. Assume that p2 + q2 = r2: Show that at least one of the polynomials both has degree 3 and has 3 (not necessarily distinct) real roots. 10 (USAMO 2002). Prove that any monic polynomial (a polynomial with leading coeﬃcient 1) of degree n with real coeﬃcients is the average of two monic polynomials of degree n with n real roots. 11 (MOP 01). Let P (x) be a real-valued polynomial with P (n) = P (0). Show that there exist at least n distinct (unordered) pairs of real numbers {x, y} such that x − y is a real number and P (x) = P (y). 12 (USAMO 88). A certain polynomial product of the form (1 − zb1)(1 − zb2) · · · (1 − z32) b32 where the bk are positive integers, has the surprising property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving z to a power larger than 32, we are left with 1 − 2z.
