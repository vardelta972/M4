Answer: 0 A polynomial p(x) has a multiple root at x = a if and only if x − a divides both p and p′. Continuing inductively, the nth derivative p(n) has a multiple root b if and only if x − b divides p (n) and p(n+1). Since f (x) has 1 as a root with multiplicity 4, x − 1 must divide each of f, f ′, f ′′, f ′′′. Hence f ′′′(1) = 0. Similarly, x − 2 divides each of f, f ′, f ′′ so f ′′(2) = 0 and x − 3 divides each of f, f ′, meaning f ′(3) = 0. Hence the desired sum is 0. 2. A trapezoid is inscribed in a semicircle of radius 2 such that one base of the trapezoid lies along the diameter of the semicircle. Find the largest possible area of the trapezoid. Answer: 3√ 3 Clearly, a trapezoid with maximal area will have a base equal to the diameter. If x is the height of the trapezoid, then the area of a trapezoid is h(b1+b2) 2 = A(x) = (2 + √4 − x2) · x so the maximum occurs when 0 = A′(x) = 2 + √4 − x2 − x2 √4 − x2 = 2 √4 − x2 + 4 − 2x2 √4 − x2 , which is equivalent to 4(4 − x2) = (2x 2 − 4)2 = 4x4 − 16x 2 + 16. Collecting like terms gives 4x4 = 12x2, and since x ̸= 0 (the degenerate case), we get that x = √3. Thus the desired maximum occurs at x = √3 and so the maximum area is A(√3) = (2 + √4 − 3) · √3 = 3 √3. 3. A sector of a circle has angle θ. Find the value of θ, in radians, for which the ratio of the sector’s area to the square of its perimeter (the arc along the circle and the two radial edges) is maximized. Express your answer as a number between 0 and 2π. Answer: 2 Suppose that the circle has radius r. Then the area of the circle is πr2, so the area of the sector is θ 2π πr2 = 1 2 θr2. The arc of the perimeter of the sector has length θ 2π 2πr = θr, and the two straight edges of the sector each has length r, so the perimeter has length θr + 2r = (θ + 2)r, and hence the square of the perimeter is (θ + 2)2r2. The ratio that we want to maximize is therefore 1 2 θr2 (θ + 2)2r2 = θ 2(θ + 2)2 . To do this, diﬀerentiate to ﬁnd the critical points: 0 = d dθ ( θ 2(θ + 2)2 ) = 2(θ + 2)2 − 4θ(θ + 2) 4(θ + 2)4 = 2(θ + 2) − 4θ 4(θ + 2)3 = 2 − θ 2(θ + 2)3 =⇒ θ = 2. Observe that the derivative is decreasing at θ = 2, which implies that this is a local maximum, as desired. Alternate Solution: Equivalently, we can minimize the reciprocal: 0 = d dθ ( 2(θ + 2)2 θ ) = 2 d dθ (4θ−1 + 4 + θ) = 2 (−4θ−2 + 1) =⇒ θ2 = 4 =⇒ θ = 2. 4. Let f (x) = x3ex2 1−x2 . Find f (7)(0), the 7th derivative of f evaluated at 0. Answer: 12600 SMT 2011 Calculus Test and Solutions February 19, 2011 Since f (n)(0) = ann!, where an is the nth Taylor series coeﬃcient, we just need to ﬁnd the Taylor series of f and read oﬀ the appropriate coeﬃcient. The Taylor series is given by f (x) = x3 ( 1 + x 2 1! + x4 2! + · · · ) (1 + x2 + x4 + · · · ) . The coeﬃcient of x7 is 1 2! + 1 1! + 1 = 5 2 , so f (7)(0) = 7! · 5 2 = 12600. 5. The real-valued inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable function f (x) is such that f (0) = 1, f ′(0) = 2, and f ′′(0) = 3. Furthermore, f has the property that f (n)(x) + f (n+1)(x) + f (n+2)(x) + f (n+3)(x) = 0 for all n ≥ 0, where f (n)(x) denotes the nth derivative of f . Find f (x). Answer: 2e−x − cos x + 4 sin x We solve the diﬀerential equation f + f ′ + f ′′ + f ′′′ = 0. Let f + f ′ = g. Then we need to solve g + g′′ = 0, which has solution g(x) = a cos x + b sin x. Then ex(f + f ′) = (exf ) ′ = aex cos x + be x sin x, so that f = e −x (∫ (aex cos x + be x sin x) dx + c ) = ce −x + a′ cos x + b ′ sin x. Finally, we ﬁnd f (0) = c + a ′, f ′(0) = −c + b′, and f ′′(0) = c − a ′ and solve for a ′, b ′, c. Alternate Solution: Observe that since the given equation holds for all n, by moving the index up one and then subtracting, we get f (n)(x) − f (n+4)(x) = 0, so that f (n)(x) = f (n+4)(x). That is, any function that satisﬁes the given equation must also have the property that the derivatives repeat in cycles of 4. However, as we will see, this is only a necessary property, not a suﬃcient one. The characteristic equation of the given diﬀerential equation is λ n+4 − λn = 0, or λn(λ 4 − 1) = 0. The roots of this equation are 0 and the fourth roots of unity, so a complete set of solutions is given by f (x) = aex + be −x + ceix + de −ix (the terms e ix and e−ix can be written in terms of sine and cosine, as is boxed above). Note however, that aex does not satisfy the original diﬀerential equation as all of its derivatives have the same sign. Relabelling the constants, the solution set is f (x) = ae−x + be ix + ce−ix = ae−x + b(cos x + i sin x) + c(cos x − i sin x). 6. Compute ∫ π −π x2 1 + sin x + √1 + sin2 x dx. Answer: π3 3 Use symmetry around the origin. Substitute x to −x, so the integral is now ∫ π −π x2 dx 1 − sin x + √1 + sin2 x . Add the two integrals, and note that 1 1 + sin x + √1 + sin2 x + 1 1 − sin x + √ 1 + sin2 x = 2 + 2√1 + sin2 x 2 + sin2 x + 2√1 + sin2 x − sin 2 x = 1, so the integral is the same as 1 2 ∫ π −π x2dx = π3 3 . 7. For the curve sin(x) + sin(y) = 1 lying in the ﬁrst quadrant, ﬁnd the constant α such that lim x→0 xα d 2y dx2 SMT 2011 Calculus Test and Solutions February 19, 2011 exists and is nonzero. Answer: 3 2 Diﬀerentiate the equation to get cos(x) + dy dx cos(y) = 0 and again to get − sin(x) + d 2y dx2 cos(y) − ( dy dx )2 sin(y) = 0. By solving these we have dy dx = − cos(x) cos(y) and d 2y dx2 = sin(x) cos 2(y) + sin(y) cos 2(x) cos3(y) . Let sin(x) = t, then sin(y) = 1 − t. Also cos(x) = √1 − t2 and cos(y) = √ 1 − (1 − t)2 = √t(2 − t). Substituting gives d2y dx2 = t 2(2 − t) + (1 − t)(1 − t 2) t3/2(2 − t)3/2 = t −3/2 1 − t + t2 (2 − t)3/2 . Since limx→0 t x = 1, α = 3 2 should give the limit limx→0 xα d2y dx2 = 1 2 √2 . 8. Compute ∫ 2 1 2 tan−1 x x2 − x + 1 dx. Answer: π2√ 3 18 Take y = 1/x, then dx x2−x+1 = − dy y2−y+1 . Note furthermore by the tangent addition formula that tan −1(x) + tan−1(y) = π/2. The original integral is equal to the average of these two integrals: 1 2 (∫ 2 1 2 tan −1 x x2 − x + 1 dx + ∫ 2 1 2 π 2 − tan−1 y y2 − y + 1 dy ) = π 4 ∫ 2 1/2 dx x2 − x + 1 . Substitute x = √3 2 θ + 1/2, then π 4 ∫ 2 1/2 dx x2 − x + 1 = π 4 4 3 √3 2 ∫ √3 0 1 θ2 + 1 dθ = π2√3 18 . 9. Solve the integral equation f (x) = ∫ x 0 e x−yf ′(y) dy − (x2 − x + 1)ex. Answer: f (x) = (2x − 1)e x Diﬀerentiate both sides to get f ′(x) = d dx ex ∫ x 0 e−yf ′(y) dy − d dx (x2 − x + 1)ex f ′(x) = f ′(x) + ∫ x 0 ex−yf ′(y) dy − (x2 + x)ex. But ∫ x 0 ex−yf ′(y) dy = f (x) + (x 2 − x + 1)ex SMT 2011 Calculus Test and Solutions February 19, 2011 so by substituting it we get f (x) + (x2 − x + 1)ex − (x2 + x)ex = 0, and f (x) = (2x − 1)ex. 10. Compute the integral ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos x + a 2) dx for a > 1. Answer: 2π ln a Solution 1: This integral can be computed using a Riemann sum. Divide the interval of integration [0, π] into n parts to get the Riemann sum π n [ ln (a 2 − 2a cos π n + 1) + ln (a 2 − 2a cos 2π n + 1) + · · · + ln (a 2 − 2a cos (n − 1)π n + 1)] . Recall that cos θ = eiθ + e−iθ 2 . We can rewrite this sum of logs as a product and factor the inside to get π n ln [n−1∏ k=1 (a 2 − 2a cos kπ n + 1)] = π n ln [n−1∏ k=1 (a − e kπi/n) ( a − e−kπi/n)] . The terms e±kπi/n are all of the 2n-th roots of unity except for ±1, so the inside product contains all of the factors of a 2n − 1 except for a − 1 and a + 1. The Riemann sum is therefore equal to π n ln a2n − 1 a2 − 1 To compute the value of the desired integral, we compute the limit of the Riemann sum as n → ∞; this is lim n→∞ π n ln a 2n − 1 a2 − 1 = lim n→∞ π ln n √ a2n − 1 a2 − 1 = lim n→∞ π ln a 2 = 2π ln a. (This is problem 471 of R˘azvan Gelca and Titu Andreescu’s book Putnam and Beyond. The solution is due to Sim´eon Poisson.) Solution 2: Let the desired integral be I(a), where we think of this integral as a function of the parameter a. In this solution, we diﬀerentiate by a to convert the desired integral to an integral of a rational function in cos x: d da I(a) = d da ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos x + a 2) dx = ∫ π 0 2a − 2 cos x 1 − 2a cos x + a2 dx. All integrals of this form can be computed using the substitution t = tan x 2 . Then x = 2 arctan t, so dx = 2 1+t2 dt and cos x = cos(2 arctan t) = 2 cos(arctan t)2 − 1 = 2 ( 1 1 + t2 ) − 1 = 1 − t 2 1 + t2 , so our integral becomes d da I(a) = ∫ ∞ 0 2a − 2 1−t 2 1+t2 1 − 2a 1−t2 1+t2 + a2 2 1 + t2 dt = 4 ∫ ∞ 0 a(1 + t2) − (1 − t2) (1 + t2) − 2a(1 − t2) + a2(1 + t2) 1 1 + t2 dt = 4 ∫ ∞ 0 (a + 1)t2 + (a − 1) ((a + 1)2t2 + (a − 1)2)(1 + t2) dt = 2 a ∫ ∞ 0 a 2 − 1 (a + 1)2t2 + (a − 1)2 dt + 2 a ∫ ∞ 0 1 1 + t2 dt. SMT 2011 Calculus Test and Solutions February 19, 2011 In the ﬁrst integral, we do the substitution t = a−1 a+1 u. Then dt = a−1 a+1 du and we have = 2 a ∫ ∞ 0 1 1 + u2 du + 2 a ∫ ∞ 0 1 1 + t2 dt = 2 a ( π 2 + π 2 ) = 2π a . Therefore, our desired integral is the integral of the previous quantity, or I = ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos x + a 2) dx = 2π ln a. Solution 3: We use Chebyshev polynomials1. First, deﬁne the Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind to be Tn(x) = cos(n arccos x). This is a polynomial in x, and note that Tn(cos x) = cos(nx). Note that cos((n + 1)x) = cos nx cos x − sin nx sin x cos((n − 1)x) = cos nx cos x + sin nx sin x, so that cos((n + 1)x) = 2 cos nx cos x − cos((n − 1)x) and hence the Chebyshev polynomials satisfy the recurrence Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) − Tn−1(x). Therefore, the Chebyshev polynomials satisfy the generating function ∞∑ n=0 Tn(x)tn = 1 − tx 1 − 2tx + t2 . Now, substituting x 7→ cos x and t 7→ a −1, we have ∞∑ n=0 cos(nx)a −n = a a − cos x a2 − 2a cos x + 1 . So 2 ∞∑ n=0 cos(nx)a −n−1 = 2a − 2 cos x 1 − 2a cos x + a2 . Then ∫ π 0 2a − 2 cos x 1 − 2a cos x + a2 dx = 2 ∫ π 0 ∞∑ n=0 cos(nx)a −n−1 dx = 2 ∞∑ n=0 ( a −n−1 ∫ π 0 cos(nx) dx) = 2πa −1. Now, since ln(1 − 2a cos x + a2) = ∫ 2a − 2 cos x 1 − 2a cos x + a2 da, we see that ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos x + a 2) dx = ∫ 2πa −1 da = 2π ln a. Solution 4: We can also give a solution based on physics. By symmetry, we can evaluate the integral from 0 to 2π and divide the answer by 2, so ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos x + a 2) dx = ∫ 2π 0 ln √ 1 − 2a cos x + a2 dx. Now let’s calculate the 2D gravitational potential of a point mass falling along the x axis towards a unit circle mass centered around the origin. We set the potential at inﬁnity to 0. We also note that, 1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chebyshev_polynomials SMT 2011 Calculus Test and Solutions February 19, 2011 since the 2D gravitational force between two masses is proportional to 1 r , the potential between two masses is proportional to − ln r. So to calculate the gravitational potential, we integrate − ln r over the unit circle. But if the point mass is at (a, 0), then the distance between the point mass and the section of the circle at angle x is √1 − 2a cos x + a2. So we get the integral − ∫ 2π 0 ln √1 − 2a cos x + a2 dx This is exactly the integral we want to calculate! We can also calculate this potential by concentrating the mass of the circle at its center. The circle has mass 2π and its center is distance a from the point mass. So the potential is simply −2π ln a. Thus, the ﬁnal answer is 2π ln(a). Solution 5: This problem also has a solution which uses the Residue Theorem from complex analysis. It is easy to show that 2 ∫ π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos(x) + a 2) dx = ∫ 2π 0 ln(1 − 2a cos(x) + a2) dx. Furthermore, observe that 1 − 2a cos x + a 2 = (a − eix)(a − e−ix). Thus, our integral is I = 1 2 (∫ 2π 0 ln[(a − eix)(a − e−ix)]dx ) = 1 2 (∫ 2π 0 ln(a − eix)dx + ∫ 2π 0 ln(a − e −ix)dx ) , where the integrals are performed on the real parts of the logarithms in the second expression. In the ﬁrst integral, substitute z = eix, dz = ieix dx = iz dx; the resulting contour integral is ∮ ∥z∥=1 ln(a − z) iz dz. By the Residue Theorem, this is equal to 2πi Resz=0 ln(a−z) iz = 2π ln(a). The second integral is identical. Thus, the ﬁnal answer is 1 2 (4π ln(a)) = 2π ln(a).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
