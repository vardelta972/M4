For any positive integers n and t, if tn + 1 or more objects are placed in n boxes, then at least one box will contain more than t objects. 2. If the average of some real numbers is t, then at least one of the numbers is greater than or equal to t and at least one of them is less than or equal to t. 3. Among six persons, there are always three who know each other or three who are complete strangers. 4. A point (x, y) in the coordinate plane is called a lattice point if x, y both are integers. Suppose that ﬁve lattice points are given in the plane. Prove that you can always choose two of these points such that the segment joining these points passes through another lattice point. 5. A line in the plane of △ABC passes through no vertex. Show that it cannot cut all the three sides of the triangle. 6. A target has the shape of an equilateral triangle with side length 2 cm. Show that if the target is hit 5 times, then there will be two holes at a distance ≤ 1 cm. 7. Ten points are placed within an equilateral triangle of unit side-length. Show that there exists two points with distance at most 1/3 apart. 8. Missy and Mussy are very messy sisters. Their dresser drawer consists of 6 white socks, 2 black socks, 10 blue socks and 8 red socks. What is the minimum number of socks they must remove from the drawer, in order to be certain that they have removed four socks of the same color? 9. Given any set of ﬁve integers, show that you can always choose three of them whose sum is divisible by 3. 10. Suppose that 51 integers are selected from {1, 2, . . . , 100}. Prove that there must exist (a) two of them which are coprime, (b) two of them whose sum is a prime, (c) two of them, say m and n, such that m is divisible by n. 11. Let n be a positive integer which is not divisible by 2 or 5. Prove that there is a multiple of n consisting entirely of ones. 12. Let a be a positive integer which is not divisible by 2 or 5. Prove that there exists a positive integer k such that ak ends with 0001. Show further that there exist inﬁnitely many such k. 13. Suppose that n persons meet in a room and shake hands. Prove that during the greeting ceremony there are always two persons who have done equal number of handshakes. 1 14. The length of each side of a convex quadrilateral ABCD is < 24. Let P be any point inside ABCD. Prove that there must exists a vertex whose distance from P is less than 17. 15. S is a set of n positive integers. None of the elements of S is divisible by n. Prove that there exists a subset of S such that the sum of its elements is divisible by n. 16. Given any set of 10 distinct two-digit numbers, say S, show that one can always choose two disjoint nonempty subsets of S such that their elements have the same sum. 17. Suppose that every point in a plane is coloured using one of two colours. Prove that there will always exist (a) two points of the same colour such that their midpoint also have the same colour, (b) an equilateral triangle with all its vertices of the same color, (c) a rectangle with all its vertices of the same color. 18. Prove that among any seven real numbers x1, x2, . . . , x7, there exist two, say xi and xj, such that 0 ≤ xi − xj 1 + xixj ≤ 1 √3 . 19. Let a1, . . . , a100 and b1, . . . , b100 be two permutations of the integers from 1 to 100. Prove that among the products a1b1, . . . , a100b100, there are two with the same remainder upon division by 100. 20. Suppose that 25 rooks are placed on a 8 × 8 chessboard. Prove that there must exist four rooks, none of which attack each other. (Recall that rooks attack each piece located on its row or column.) 21. Given any real number x and any natural number N > 1, show that there exists integers a and b such that 1 ≤ a ≤ N and |ax − b| < 1/N. 22. A chessmaster has 77 days to prepare for a tournament. He wants to play at least one game per day, but not more then 132 games. Prove that there is a sequence of successive days on which he plays exactly 21 games. 23. 1700 students participated in a true-false test. Knowing that 15 questions were given the test, that none of the students has answered two consecutive questions correctly, and that all of them have answered all the questions, do there exist two identical answer-sheets? 24. A set of numbers S is called sum-free if for any a, b ∈ S (not necessarily distinct), it holds that a + b /∈ S. What is the maximum possible size of a sum-free subset of {1, 2, · · · , 2n + 1}? 25. In the sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, . . . each term starting with the third is the sum of the two preceding terms. But addition is done modulo 10. Prove that this sequence is periodic. 26. Deﬁne the sequence of Fibonacci numbers as: F1 = F2 = 1 and Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 for every n > 2. Prove that, for any positive integer k, there is a Fibonacci number ending with k zeros. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
