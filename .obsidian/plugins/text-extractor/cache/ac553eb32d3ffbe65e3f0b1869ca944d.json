BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN Obsession and Confession Some people think we are fanatics about combinatorial proofs. Ok, we admit it, we are. When we see an identity with a ﬁnite sum and an attractive closed form, we are not satisﬁed until we understand what the identity is counting. For example, the identity obtained by summing the nth row of Pascal’s triangle, n∑ k=0 ( n k ) = 2n, counts the number of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} in two diﬀerent ways. (The left side counts the number of subsets of each size k from 0 to n. The right side counts subsets by deciding, for each element, whether or not it is in the subset.) But what if the sum has negative entries? For instance, if you saw the sum m∑ k=0 (n k ) (−1) k = (−1) m(n − 1 m ), or a scarier looking sum (from a recent problem in this journal [5]) like n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1(−1) j+k(n − 1 j − 1 )(n − 1 k − 1 )( j + k j ) = 2, would you be inclined to try to prove these by counting arguments? Probably not. We confess that there was a time that when we saw alternating sum identities like the ones above, we would attack it with noncombinatorial proof techniques, like induction or generating functions. After all, how can an object be added a neg- ative number of times? Perhaps it can be tackled using the Principle of Inclusion- Exclusion (abbreviated P.I.E.), but that brings another level of complexity to the combinatorial proof. But now we have an alternate opinion. Now when we see an alternating sum, we can usually prove it combinatorially with a method that is as easy as pie and even easier than P.I.E.! As we’ll demonstrate, this technique oﬀers new insights to identities involving binomial coeﬃcients, Fibonacci numbers, derangements, and other combinatorial structures. Solution by Involution We begin with an easy, but important example. Consider the alternating sum of the nth row of Pascal’s triangle, n∑ k=0 ( n k )(−1) k = 0. (1) 1 2 ARTHUR T. BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN Combinatorially, this identity says that the number of even-sized subsets of {1, 2, . . ., n} minus the number of odd-sized subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} is zero, that is, there are as many even subsets as odd subsets. For example, when n = 4, we list the even subsets on the left and the odd subsets on the right. even odd AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO ALTERNATING SUMS: A METHOD TO DIE FOR 3 Description: Describe a set of objects that is being counted by the sum when we ignore the sign. Involution: Find an involution between the objects that are counted posi- tively and the objects that are counted negatively in the sum. Exception: Describe the exceptions, where the involution is undeﬁned. Count these exceptions and note their sign. For example, let’s use the D.I.E. method to prove the following generalization of identity (1). For 0 ≤ m < n, n∑ k=0 (n k )( k m )(−1) k = 0. Ignoring the sign factor, we see that for a ﬁxed choice of k between 0 and n,( n k)( k m) answers the question “From a class of n students, how many ways can you choose a committee X of size k and then choose a committee Y of size m that is a subcommittee of X?” Since the right side of the identity is zero, the challenge (the fun part) is to ﬁnd a simple way to pair up each (X, Y ) object with another object (X′, Y ′) (where Y ′ is a size-m subset of X′) so that the sizes of X and X′ are of opposite parity. Can we toggle the number 1, like before, and pair up (X, Y ) with (X ⊕1, Y )? Not quite. Consider what happens when we try with n = 10, k = 5, and m = 3. If (X, Y ) = ({1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 5}), then toggling with 1 gives (X ⊕ 1, Y ) = ({2, 3, 4, 5}, {2, 3, 5}). Y is a subset of X ⊕ 1 and the parity of the ﬁrst subset changed from odd to even. So far so good. If (X, Y ) = ({6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {6, 8, 10}), then toggling with 1 gives (X ⊕ 1, Y ) = ({1, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, {6, 8, 10}). Again, this poses no problems—everything works ﬁne, provided 1 is missing from Y . But if (X, Y ) = ({1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, {1, 5, 9}), then Y is not a subset of X ⊕ 1 and our hope for a bijective involution is squashed. In general, when 1 is an element of Y (and therefore also an element of X), Y is never a subset of X ⊕ 1. So picking a ﬁxed number like 1 to toggle with X does not create the desired pairing. However, since m is strictly less than n, there is at least one number missing from Y . This forms the basis of the following solution. Description: For a given value of k between 0 and n, ( n k)( k m ) counts ordered pairs (X, Y ) such that Y ⊆ X ⊆ {1, 2, . . ., n}, |X| = k, and |Y | = m. So ∑n k=0 ( n k)( k m ) counts all ordered pairs (X, Y ) where Y ⊆ X, the size of Y is m, and the size of X ranges from zero to n. Involution: Given (X, Y ), let x be the smallest element of {1, 2, . . ., n} such that x is not in Y . Then deﬁne the involution f(X, Y ) = (X ⊕ x, Y ). Note that since x is not in Y , Y remains a subset of X ⊕ x. Exception: Since m < n, the element x always exists, so the involution above is always deﬁned. Thus there are no exceptions, the involution is a bijection, and the right side of the identity is zero. The D.I.E. method has a venerable history. It was ﬁrst used by Fabian Franklin (in [3]) to provide an elegant proof of Euler’s pentagonal number theorem. (See [6] for a nice expostion.) Franklin was one of the ﬁrst graduate students trained in mathematics in the United States. As described in [7], his proof caught the attention of leading European mathematicians, and demonstrated to them that mathematicians trained in America were capable of contributing to research-level mathematics. 4 ARTHUR T. BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN Fibonacci, Binomials, and Polynomials Fibonacci numbers are ideally suited for combinatorial arguments. Deﬁning fn = fn−1 + fn−2 with initial conditions, f0 = f1 = 1, it is easy to prove (as in [1], [2]) that fn counts the ways to tile a 1 × n strip of length n with squares (of length 1) and dominoes (of length 2). For example, f4 = 5 counts the tilings given in Figure 1. Figure 1. The Fibonacci number f4 = 5 counts the 5 tilings of length 4. It has long been known that the partial sums of the sequence of Fibonacci num- bers has a beautiful closed form (speciﬁcally ∑n k=0 fk = fn+2 − 1). Is the same true for the alternating sequence of Fibonacci numbers? Absolutely, and D.I.E. will show us the way. For n ≥ 1, we show that n∑ k=1(−1) kfk = (−1) nfn−1. Description: Since fk counts tilings of length k, ∑n k=1 fk counts tilings of al positive lengths up to length n. Involution: What is the second easiest way to change the parity of the length of a tiling T , where T has length at most n? The easiest way would be to append a square, but that would not be an involution. Instead toggle the last tile of T : If T ends in a square, turn that square into a domino; if T ends in a domino, turn that domino into a square. This is clearly an involution. Exception: The only exceptions occur when T has maximum length n and ends in a square. In this case, toggling the last tile produces a tiling of length n + 1, which is too long for our consideration. The number of tilings of length n that end with a square is fn−1, and all of these tilings are assigned a sign of (−1) n in our summation (since they have length n). Hence, the right side of the identity is (−1) nfn−1, as desired. Delightful identities frequently occur when the involution is not a bijection. But keeping track of the exceptions can be a challenge. To further illustrate, we consider the previous alternating sum with the new twist of multiplying each Fibonacci number by its index. How can D.I.E. bring n∑ k=1 (−1) kkfk into the light? Description: For a given value of k between 1 and n, kfk counts tilings of length k where a coin is placed somewhere on top of the tiling, so there are k choices for the location of the coin. So ∑n k=1 kfk counts tilings of any positive length up to length n with a coin on top. AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO ALTERNATING SUMS: A METHOD TO DIE FOR 5 Involution: Given a tiling T of length at most n, toggle the last tile as before (replace a ﬁnal square with a domino or a ﬁnal domino with a square) while preserving the position of the coin. Exception: Two types of exceptions occur: either T has the maximum pos- sible length n and ends in a square or T has length k and ends in a domino with a coin above cell k. (In the latter case, toggling the last tile would result in the coin being suspended in mid-air.) There are nfn−1 excep- tions of the ﬁrst type (since the coin can go on any of the n cells). For exceptions of the second type we have, for 2 ≤ j ≤ n, fj−2 tilings of length j that end with a domino, each with a sign of (−1) j . This gives f0 − f1 + f2 − · · · + (−1) nfn−2 exceptions of the second type. By the pre- vious identity this reduces to 1 + (−1) n−2fn−3. Combining the number of exceptions of both types gives the identity: For n ≥ 3, n∑ k=1 (−1) kkfk = (−1) n(nfn−1 + fn−3) + 1. Fibonacci numbers interact with binomial coeﬃcients in many beautiful ways. Perhaps the simplest of these comes from the sum of the diagonals of Pascal’s Triangle. Figure 2. Diagonal sums of Pascal’s triangle. The pattern is unmistakable:∑ k≥0 (n − k k ) = fn. A quick combinatorial proof of this is based on the fact that the number of length-n tilings using exactly k dominoes is ( n−k k ) . To see why, note that such a tiling contains k dominoes and n − 2k squares, and thus use a total of n − k tiles. 6 ARTHUR T. BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN From these n − k tiles, we choose k of them to be dominoes, which can be done in ( n−k k ) ways. (We note that when k exceeds n/2, ( n−k k ) = 0, which makes sense combinatorially, since the number of dominoes is at most n/2.) Now consider the alternating sum ∑ k≥0(−1) k( n−k k ) . Figure 3. Diagonal alternating sums of Pascal’s Triangle. Here the data suggests that the righthand side is always 0, 1, or −1. Com- binatorially, this suggests that the number of length-n tilings containing an even number of dominoes is about the same as the number containing an odd number of dominoes. Given a length n tiling T , how can we change the parity of the number of dominoes without changing the length of T ? If T begins with a domino, we can replace the initial domino with two squares. Likewise, if T begins with two squares, we can replace them with a domino, as illustrated in Figure 4. Figure 4. We can toggle an initial domino with an initial pair of squares. But what if T begins with sd, a square followed by a domino? Then we ignore these two tiles and look at what happens next. That is, if the tiling begins sdd, we AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO ALTERNATING SUMS: A METHOD TO DIE FOR 7 replace that string with sdss, and vice versa. Now we are covered unless the tiling begins sdsd (abbreviated (sd) 2), in which case we look at what happens after that. Continuing in this way, we arrive at the identity: For n ≥ 0, ∑ k≥0 (−1) k( n − k k ) =    0 if n ≡ 2 or 5 (mod 6) 1 if n ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 6) −1 if n ≡ 3 or 4 (mod 6). Description: For a given value of k, ( n−k k ) counts square-domino tilings of length n with exactly k dominoes. So ∑ k≥0 ( n−k k ) counts all tilings of length n. Involution: Let T be a tiling of length n. If T begins with exactly j ≥ 0 square-domino pairs, then we write T = (sd) j U , where U is a tiling of length n − 3j that does not begin with sd. If U begins with a domino, then replace that domino with two squares; if U begins with two squares, then replace these two squares with a domino. This involution changes the number of dominoes by ±1. Exception: There is at most one exception, which occurs when U is empty or contains a single square, depending on the value of n (mod 3). Here T = (sd) ⌊n/3⌋ or T = (sd) ⌊n/3⌋s. Notice that if n ≡ 2 (mod 3) (that is, n ≡ 2 or 5 (mod 6)), then no exceptions are possible. If n ≡ 0 or 1 (mod 6), say n = 6t or 6t + 1, then the sole exception, either T = (sd) 2t or (sd) 2ts, contains 2t dominoes. This exceptional tiling contains an even number of dominoes and as such contributes +1 to the alternating sum. If n ≡ 3 or 4 (mod 6), say n = 6t + 3 or 6t + 4, then the sole exception, T = (sd) 2t+1 or (sd) 2t+1s, contains 2t + 1 dominoes. Here the exceptional tiling contains an odd number of dominoes and contributes −1 to the alternating sum. Now consider the similar-looking polynomial identity ∑ k≥0 (−1) k( n − k k )(xy) k(x + y) n−2k = ∑ j≥0 xn−jyj , (2) presented in [9] by algebraic arguments. Since both sides of (2) are polynomials, verifying the equality for all nonnegative integer values of x and y is suﬃcient to prove the identity. We will modify the previous D.I.E. argument—giving combina- torial meaning to the indeterminants x and y. Description: Given nonnegative integers x, y, and k, ( n−k k ) (xy) k(x + y) n−2k counts square-domino tilings of length n with k dominoes (and n − 2k squares) in which each tile is painted with one of x light colors or one of y dark colors as follows: Squares can be painted with any of the x + y colors. The left half of a domino is painted one of x light colors and the right half is painted one of y dark colors, so a domino can be painted xy ways. The sum ∑k≥0 ( n−k k ) (xy) k(x +y) n−2k counts all square-domino tilings of length n subject to the tile painting restrictions using x light and y dark colors. Involution: Scan the tiling from left to right until you encounter a domino or a light square followed immediately by a dark square. If a domino occurs ﬁrst, transform it to a light square-dark square combination by chopping the domino down the middle; if a light-dark pair of squares appears ﬁrst, 8 ARTHUR T. BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN transform them to a domino by gluing them together. This process is clearly reversible and changes the parity of the number of dominoes in the tiling. Exception: The exceptions are those tilings with no dominoes and consisting of j dark squares followed by n − j light squares, for some j ≥ 0. There are ∑ j≥0 xn−jyj such tilings, all of which are counted positively since they contain zero dominoes. P.I.E. can D.I.E.! Alternating sums arise in combinatorial problems solved using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion (P.I.E.) as described in every combinatorics textbook. For in- stance, the number of onto functions from an m-element set to an n-element set is given by f(m, n) = nm − n(n − 1) m + (n 2 )(n − 2) m − (n 3 )(n − 3) m + · · · = n∑ k=0 (−1) k(n k ) (n − k) m, where the ﬁrst term in the sum counts all functions from {1, 2, . . ., m} to {1, 2, . . . , n} with no restrictions. From this, we subtract those functions that do not hit element 1 (there are (n − 1) m of these), as well as those functions that miss 2, those that miss 3, up to those that miss n. But we need to add back those functions that miss 1 and 2 (there are (n − 2) m of these), and so on. But this can also be proved using D.I.E. just as easily. Description: Given k, m, n ≥ 0, ( n k) (n − k) m counts the ways to select a k-element subset X ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} and then create an m-letter word Y from the elements of {1, 2, . . . , n} − X. For example, if n = 9, m = 6, and k = 2, a typical object is (X, Y ) = ({2, 8}, 314159). The unsigned sum, ∑n k=0 ( n k) (n − k) m, counts all pairs (X, Y ) where X is any subset of {1, 2, . . . , n} and Y is an m-letter word created from elements in the complement of X. Involution: Given (X, Y ) let x be the smallest number in {1, 2, . . . , n} that does not appear in Y . Match (X, Y ) to (X ⊕ x, Y ). Y is also an m-letter word made from the elements of {1, 2, . . ., n} − (X ⊕ x) and x is still the smallest element of {1, 2, . . . , n} missing from Y . Furthermore, the size of X ⊕ x diﬀers from and the size of X by ±1. (Our example ({2, 8}, 314159) has x = 2 and k = 2, and it will be matched to ({8}, 314159), which has x = 2 and k = 1.) Exception: The involution fails when no elements of {1, 2, . . ., n} are missing from Y . This requires X to be the empty set and Y to contain every letter from {1, 2, . . . , n}. There are f(m, n) such exceptions, and since k = 0 for these, each of them is counted positively. Another classical application of P.I.E. is counting the derangements of {1, 2, . . . , n}, the number of ways to arrange the integers 1 through n so that no integer lies in its natural position, that is, 1 is not ﬁrst, 2 is not second, and so on. We let Dn denote the number of derangements of {1, 2, . . . , n}. As is well known to all P.I.E.-lovers, Dn = n∑ k=0 (−1) k n! AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO ALTERNATING SUMS: A METHOD TO DIE FOR 9 Here we present a simple proof using D.I.E. Description: Given nonnegative integers k ≤ n, n! 10 ARTHUR T. BENJAMIN AND JENNIFER J. QUINN What happens after you D.I.E.? Applying the D.I.E method to prove an identity often leads to generalizations that are not immediately obvious. It’s important to keep an open mind—not only about the role of particular parameters, but in using the method itself. We show how to prove and then extend in a natural way the identity n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1(−1) j+k(n − 1 j − 1 )( n − 1 k − 1 )(j + k j ) = 2 mentioned at the beginning of the paper. This will require a modiﬁcation of our technique, where we analyze repeated involutions (the method of D.I.E.I.E.?) to obtain the extremely attractive solution. Description: Given positive integers j, k ≤ n, ( n−1 j−1)(n−1 k−1 )(j+k j ) counts or- dered triples (X, Y, Z) where X is a j-subset of {1, 2, . . ., n} that must con- tain 1, Y is a k-subset of {n+1, . . . , 2n} that must contain n+1, and Z is a subset of X∪Y with |Z| = |X|. The unsigned sum ∑n j=1 ∑n k=1 ( n−1 j−1)(n−1 k−1)(j+k j ) counts all such ordered triples (X, Y, Z) as the sizes of X and Y vary be- tween 1 and n. Involution (Part I): Given a triple (X, Y, Z), deﬁne y to be the largest num- ber between n + 2 and 2n such that y does not appear in Z. The mapping that sends (X, Y, Z) to (X, Y ⊕ y, Z) is a sign-reversing involution, since j is unchanged and k increases or decreases by 1. Note that Z remains a subset of X ∪ (Y ⊕ y). Exception (Part I): The involution fails when y does not exist. This re- quires Z to contain all the elements n + 2, . . . , 2n. Therefore the exceptions (X, Y, Z) must satisfy Y = {n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n}. Involution (Part II): Given a triple (X, Y, Z) that has survived as an ex- ception in Part I, deﬁne x to be the largest number between 2 and n such that x either appears in both X and Z or is absent from both X and Z, that is, x ∈ (X ∩ Z)∪ (Xc ∩ Zc). Pair (X, Y, Z) with (X ⊕x, Y, Z ⊕x). Since Z ⊆ X ∪ Y , it remains true that Z ⊕ x ⊆ (X ⊕ x) ∪ Y and |Z ⊕ x| = |X ⊕ x|. Exception (Part II): If |X| < n, then the involution above is always deﬁned since there is one element x, 2 ≤ x ≤ n, that is missing from X and is therefore missing from Z too. Hence the only exceptions occur when |X| = n, forcing X = {1, 2, . . ., n} and |Z| = |X| = n. Thus the only remaining exceptions are of the form (X, Y, Z) = ({1, 2, . . . , n}, {n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n}, Z) where Z contains the elements n + 2, n + 3, . . . , 2n, and one other element. That element could be either 1 or n+1, and these provide the only two exceptions. Both survivors are weighted positively since j +k = 2n and so is even. In the preceding analysis, elements 1 and n + 1 represented the guaranteed members of X and Y respectively. There is no reason to believe we are restricted to specifying only one member of each set. Why not two? three? Why not specify a members of X and b members of Y ? Originally, X and Y were selected from disjoint sets of size n. Did they have to be the same size? Why not choose X from an n-set and Y from an m-set? With very little additional eﬀort, you can modify the above description, involutions, and exceptions to obtain the following AN ALTERNATE APPROACH TO ALTERNATING SUMS: A METHOD TO DIE FOR 11 generalization: n∑ j=a m∑ k=b(−1) j+k( n − a j − a )( m − b k − b )( j + k j ) = ( a + b n − m + b ) . Although this identity (and indeed, all of the indentities in this paper) can be proved by algebraic or computational methods (as described in [4] or [8]), we ﬁnd the D.I.E. approach oﬀers the most satisfying explanation. Summing Up: Why Alternating Sums are Simpler than Positive Sums Although alternating sums may on the surface appear to be harder to explain combinatorially than positive sums, our experience has been the opposite. Given a positive sum with a simple closed form, we have found that the alternating version of that sum usually has a simple (and often simpler) closed form too. For example,∑n k=0 ( n k) = 2n is simple, but the alternating version has the simpler closed form ∑n k=0(−1) k( n k) = 0. The nonexistence of a simple closed form for the partial sum ∑m k=0 ( n k) (as a function of m) can be established by Gosper’s algorithm [8], yet the alternating version of that sum is no trouble at all. Why should alternating sums be simpler than positive sums? Although we don’t have a rigorous answer to that question, the idea shows up in other areas of mathe- matics. From the analysis of inﬁnite series, we know that if a positive sum converges, then its alternating sum must also converge but the converse is not true. From lin- ear algebra, we know that the permanent of an n × n matrix is usually hard to calculate (requiring about n! steps), whereas its alternating sum, the determinant can be computed eﬃciently (in about n3 steps) and it has many nice theoretical properties. Another explanation why alternating sums are often simpler is due to an identity due to Euler. For any polynomial p(x) of degree less than n, ∆np(x) = 0, where ∆f(x) = f(x + 1) − f(x). (Euler’s theorem can be proved easily by induction since ∆nf(x) = ∆n−1(∆f(x)) and ∆f(x) is a polynomial of degree less than n−1.) Some of the sums in this paper can be proved using this method. But from the standpoint of combinatorics, we think that the reason alternating sums are easier than non-alternating sums boils down to this: Matching is easier than counting. References [1] A. T.
