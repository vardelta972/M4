If a summation Sn = ∑n k=0 an,k only has one sum, you can try transforming it to a double sum by considering a generating function f (z) = ∞∑ n=0 Snzn = ∞∑ n=0 n∑ k=0 an,kzn = ∞∑ k=0 ∞∑ n=k an,kzk. If you can ﬁnd a nice form for f (z), then the coeﬃcient of zn will be the desired Sn. • Interpret combinatorially: Sometimes it will be possible to interpret an expression as counting some quantity or computing the probability of some event. In this case, it is often useful to replace the expression by a simpler way of doing the same computation. • Induction: If the series Sn depends on some parameter n, you might be able to write a recurrence for Sn, guess a general form, and then prove it using the recurrence. In particular, the diﬀerence Sn+1 −Sn might itself be a simpler summation. • Manipulation: Techniques for other sums also apply here. You can try to force telescoping or to factor the expression, keeping in mind the binomial expansion. • Take derivatives or integrals: If you have a expression f (z) = ∑∞ n=0 anzn for the series ∑∞ n=0 anzn with f (z) an explicit function, it yields related sums ∫ z 0 f (w)dw = ∞∑ n=0 an n + 1 zn+1 and f ′(z) = ∞∑ n=1 nanzn−1. 2 Useful Facts Fact 1 (Multinomial Theorem). For integer n > 0, we have (x1 + · · · + xk)n = ∑ a1+···+ak=n ( n a1, . . . , ak ) xa1 1 · · · xak k . Fact 2 (Hockeystick Identity). For integer k > 0, we have that m∑ n=k (n k ) = (m + 1 k + 1 ) . Fact 3 (Negative binomial expansion). For integer k > 0 and |z| < 1, we have ∞∑ n=k (n k ) zn−k = (1 − z) −k−1. 1 Fact 4 (Vandermonde convolution). For integers r, m, n > 0, we have r∑ k=0 ( m k )( n r − k ) = (m + n r ) . Fact 5. For integers n, m > 0, we have ∫ 1 0 x n(1 − x) mdx = 1 (n + m + 1)(n+m n ) . 3 Problems Problem 1. Take r such that 1 ≤ r ≤ n, and consider all subsets of r elements of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}. Each subset has a smallest element. Let F (n, r) be the arithmetic mean of these smallest elements. Prove that: F (n, r) = n+1 r+1 . Problem 2. Amy starts with a piece of paper with the number 0 on it. On each of (n+m m ) days, she starts at the lower left corner of a neighborhood that consists of a n × m grid of blocks separated by roads, and travels along the roads to the upper right corner, only going right or up at each intersection. When she gets there, she counts the number of blocks, b, that lie above here path, and adds the monomial qb to the value on her paper. If Amy never took the same path more than once, show that, by the end of the (n+m m ) days, the sum on her paper is equal to the q-binomial coeﬃcient ( n + m m ) q = (n + m)q! (n)q!(m)q! . (Here (a)q! denotes the q-factorial (1 + q)(1 + q + q2) · · · · · (1 + q + q2 + · · · + qa−1).) Problem 3. Let S = {1, 2, . . . , n} for some integer n > 1.

Each side and each diagonal of a regular n-gon is labeled with a number from the set {1, 2, . . . , r} in a way such that the following two conditions are fulﬁlled: 1. Each number from the set {1, 2, . . . , r} occurs at least once as a label. 2. In each triangle formed by three vertices of the n-gon, two of the sides are labeled with the same number, and this number is greater than the label of the third side.
