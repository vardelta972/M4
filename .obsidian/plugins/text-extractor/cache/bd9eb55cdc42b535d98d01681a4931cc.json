The following example illustrates some basic methods: 1. Determine the polynomials P for which 16P(x2) = P(2x)2. • First method: evaluating at certain points and reducing degree. Plugging x = 0 in the given relation yields 16P(0) = P(0) 2, i.e. P(0) = 0 or 16. (i) Suppose that P(0) = 0. Then P(x) = xQ(x) for some polynomial Q and 16x2Q(x2) = 4x2Q(2x)2, which reduces to 4Q(x2) = Q(2x)2. Now setting 4Q(x) = R(x) gives us 16R(x2) = R(2x)2. Hence, P(x) = 1 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com we similarly get 4Q(x2) = Q(4x)2. In either case, Q(x) = R(x2) or Q(x) = xR(x2) for some polynomial R, so P(x) = xiR(x4) for some i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. Proceeding in this way we ﬁnd that P(x) = xiS(x2k) for each k ∈ N and some i ∈ {0, 1, . . ., 2k}. Now it is enough to take k with 2k > deg P and to conclude that S must be constant. Thus P(x) = cxi for some c ∈ R. A simple veriﬁcation gives us the general solution P(x) = 16 ( 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomial Equations 3 had a zero in common, then so do P and Q), it follows that Q(x2) = Q(x)2. Therefore Q(x) = xn for some n ∈ N. Now we have P(x2) = P(x)2 − ax2n. Let P(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + am−1xm−1 + xm. Comparing coefﬁcients of P(x)2 and P(x2) gives us an−1 = · · · = a2m−n+1 = 0, a2m−n = a/2, a1 = · · · = am−1 = 0 and a0 = 1. This is only possible if a = 2 and 2m − n = 0, or a = 0. 6. Find all polynomials P satisfying P(x2 + 1) = P(x)2 + 1 for all x. Solution. By the introducing lemma, there is a polynomial Q such that P(x) = Q(x2 + 1) or P(x) = xQ(x2 + 1). Then Q((x2 + 1)2 + 1) = Q(x2 + 1)2 − 1 or (x2 + 1)Q((x2 + 1)2 + 1) = x2Q(x2 + 1)2 + 1, respectively. Substituting x2 + 1 = y yields Q(y2 + 1) = Q(y)2 + 1 and yQ(y2 + 1) = (y − 1)Q(y)2 + 1, respectively. Suppose that yQ(y2 + 1) = (y − 1)Q(y)2 + 1. Setting y = 1 we obtain that Q(2) = 1. Note that, if a ̸= 0 and Q(a) = 1, then also aQ(a2 + 1) = (a − 1) + 1 and hence Q(a2 + 1) = 1. We thus obtain an inﬁnite sequence of points at which Q takes value 1, namely the sequence given by a0 = 2 and an+1 = a2 n + 1. Therefore Q ≡ 1. It follows that if Q ̸≡ 1, then P(x) = Q(x2 + 1). Now we can easily list all solutions: these are the polynomials of the form T (T (· · · (T (x)) · · · )), where T (x) = x2 + 1. 7. If a polynomial P with real coefﬁcients satisﬁes for all x P(cos x) = P(sin x), prove that there exists a polynomial Q such that for all x, P(x) = Q(x4 − x2). Solution. It follows from the condition of the problem that P(− sin x) = P(sin x), so P(−t) = P(t) for inﬁnitely many t; hence the polynomials P(x) and P(−x) coincide. Therefore P(x) = S(x2) for some polynomial S. Now S(cos2 x) = S(sin 2 x) for all x, so S(1 − t) = S(t) for inﬁnitely many t, which gives us S(x) ≡ S(1 − x). This is equivalent to R(x − 1 4 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Suppose that ai ̸= 0. Then K(i) = 3i + 5i + (−8)i − 2 · 7i = 0. But K(i) is negative for i odd and positive for i = 0 or i ≥ 6 even. Only for i = 2 and i = 4 do we have K(i) = 0. It follows that P(x) = a2x2 + a4x4 for some real numbers a2, a4. It is easily veriﬁed that all such P(x) satisfy the required condition. 10. (a) If a real polynomial P(x) satisﬁes P(x) ≥ 0 for all x, show that there exist real polynomi- als A(x) and B(x) such that P(x) = A(x)2 + B(x)2. (b) If a real polynomial P(x) satisﬁes P(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 0, show that there exist real polynomials A(x) and B(x) such that P(x) = A(x)2 + xB(x)2. Solution. Polynomial P(x) can be written in the form P(x) = (x − a1) α1 · · · (x − ak) αk · (x2 − b1x + c1) · · · (x2 − bmx + cm), (∗) where ai, b j, c j are real numbers such that ai are distinct and the polynomials x2 − bix + ci have no real roots. It follows from the condition P(x) ≥ 0 for all x that all the αi are even, and from the condition P(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 0 that (∀i) either αi is even or ai < 0. This ensures that each linear or quadratic factor in (∗) can be written in the required form A2 + B2 and/or A2 + xB2. The well-known formula (a2 + γb2)(c2 + γd2) = (ac + γbd)2 + γ(ad − bc)2 now gives a required representation for their product P(x). 11. Prove that if the polynomials P and Q have a real root each and P(1 + x + Q(x) 2) = Q(1 + x + P(x) 2), then P ≡ Q. Solution. Note that there exists x = a for which P(a)2 = Q(a)2. This follows from the fact that, if p and q are the respective real roots of P and Q, then P(p)2 − Q(p)2 ≤ 0 ≤ P(q)2 − Q(q)2, and moreover P2 − Q2 is continuous. Now P(b) = Q(b) for b = 1 + a + P(a) 2. Taking a to be the largest real number for which P(a) = Q(a) leads to an immediate contradiction. 12. If P and Q are monic polynomials with P(P(x)) = Q(Q(x)), prove that P ≡ Q. Solution. Suppose that R = P − Q ̸= 0 and that 0 < k ≤ n − 1 is the degree of R(x). Then P(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) = [Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x))] + R(P(x)). Putting Q(x) = xn + · · · + a1x + a0 we have Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) = [P(x)n − Q(x)n] + · · · + a1[P(x) − Q(x)], where all summands but the ﬁrst have a degree at most n2 − n, while the ﬁrst summand equals R(x) · ( P(x)n−1 + P(x)n−2Q(x) + · · · + Q(x)n−1) and therefore has the degree n2 − n + k with the leading coefﬁcient n. Hence the degree of Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) is n2 − n + k. The degree of R(P(x)) is equal to kn < n2 − n + k, from what we conclude that the degree of the difference P(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) is n2 − n + k, a contradiction. In the remaining case when R ≡ c is constant, the condition P(P(x)) = Q(Q(x)) gives us Q(Q(x) + c) = Q(Q(x)) − c, so the equality Q(y + c) = Q(y) − c holds for inﬁnitely many y, implying Q(y + c) ≡ Q(y) − c. But this is only possible for c = 0. 13. Assume that there exist complex polynomials P, Q, R such that Pa + Qb = Rc, where a, b, c are natural numbers. Show that 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomial Equations 5 Lemma 2. If A, B and C are pairwise coprime polynomials with A + B = C, then the degree of each of them is less than the number of different zeroes of the polynomial ABC. Proof. Let A(x) = k ∏ i=1(x − pi) ai, B(x) = l ∏ i=1(x − qi) bi, C(x) = m ∏ i=1(x − ri) ci. Writing the condition A + B = C as A(x)C(x)−1 + B(x)C(x)−1 = 1 and differentiating it with respect to x gives us A(x)C(x) −1 ( k ∑ i=1 ai","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
