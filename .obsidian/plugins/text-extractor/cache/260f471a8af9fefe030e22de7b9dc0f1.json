There is, in addition, a section of miscellaneous problems. Included are problems on several levels of difficulty-some are relatively easy, others rather complex, and a number so abstruse that they originally were the subject of scientific research and their solutions are of comparatively recent date. All of the solutions are given thoroughly and in detail; they contain information on possible generaliza- tions of the given problem and further indicate unsolved problems associated with the given problem and solution. This ancillary textbook is intended for everyone interested in number theory. It will be of especial value to instructors and students both as a textbook and a source of reference in mathematics study groups. 250 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY Modern Analytic and Computational Methods in Science and Mathematics A GROUP OF MONOGRAPHS AND ADVANCED TEXTBOOKS Richard Bellman, EDITOR University of Southern California Published 1.

DIVISIBILITY OF NUMBERS I. There is only one such positive integer: n = 1. In fact, n 2+l = n(n+l)-(n-l); ihus, if n+lln2+1, then n+lln-1 which for p~sitive integer n is possible only if n-l = 0, hence if n = 1. 2. Let x-3=t. Thus, t is an integer =FO such'that t/(t+3)2_3, which is equivalent to the condition tI33-3, or t124. Therefore, it is necessary and sufficient for t to be an integer divisor of 24, hence t must be equal to one of the numbers ±I, ±2, ±3, ±4, ±6, ±8, ±12, ±24. For x = t+3 we obtain the values -21, -9, -5, -3, -1,0,1,2,4,5,6,7, 9, 11, 15, and 27. 3. .For instance, all numbers n in the arithmetic progression 65k+56 (k = 0, 1, 2, ... ) have the desired property. Indeed, if n = 65k+56 with an integer k ~ 0, then n = 1 (mod 5) and n = 4 (mod 13), hence 4n 2+ 1 == o (mod 5) and 4n2+ 1 = 0 (mod 13). Thus, 5l4n 2+ 1 and 1314,r+ 1. 4. We shall prove the assertion by induction. We have 16913 6-26-27 = 676 = 4· 169. Next, we have 33(n+l)+3-26(n+l)-27-(3 311+3-26n-27) = 26(33n+ 3-1). However, 13133-1, hence 13133(ft+l)-I, and 169126(33n+3-1). The proof by induction follows immediately. . 5. We have 2 6 = 64 = 1 (mod 9), hence for k = 0, 1, 2, ... we have also 26k == 1 (mod 9). Therefore 2 6k+2 == 22 (mod 9), and since both sides are even, we get 2 6k+2 = 22 (mod 18). It follows that 2 6k+2 = 18t+2 2 , where t is an integer ~ O. However, by Fermat's theorem, 2 18 = 1 (mod 19), and . 6k+2 therefore 218t = 1 (mod 19) for t = 0, 1, 2, .... Thus 22 = 218t+4 = 24 (mod 19); it follows that 2 26k+2 +3 = 2 4+3 = ° (mod 19), which was to be proved. 6. By Fermat's theorem we have 212 = 1 (mod 13), hence 2 60 = 1 (mod 13), and since 25 = 6 (mod 13), which implies 2 10 = -3 (mod 13), 23 24 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY we get 2 70 = -3 (mod 13). On the other hand, 3 3 = 1 (mod 13), hence 3 69 == 1 (mod 13) and 3 70 = 3 (mod 13). Therefore 2 70+370 == 0 (mod 13), or 1312 7°+37°, which was to be proved. 7. Obviously, it suffices to show that each of the primes 11, 31, and 61 divides 2015-1. We have 2 5 = -1 (mod 11), and 10 == -1 (mod 11), hence 10' == -1 (mod 11), which implies 20' = 1 (mod 11), and 20 15 = 1 (mod 11). Thus 11120 15-1. Next, we have 20 = -11 (mod 31), hence 2()2 == 121 = -3 (mod 31). Therefore 203 == (-11)(-3) == 33 = 2 (mod 31), which implies 20 15 == 2 5 = 1 (mod 31). Thus, 31120 15-1. Finally, we have 3 4 == 20 (mod 61), which implies 2015 == 3 60 = 1 (mod 61) (by Fermat's theorem); thus 61\\20 15-1. 8. Let d = (~~11 ,a-I). In view of the identity (1) and in view of the fact that a-l\\tf-I for k = 0, 1, 2, ... , we obtain dIm. Thus, if the numbers a-I and m had a common divisor 6 > d, we a\"'-1 a\"'-l would have, by (1), the relation ~ 1 and the numbers 1 and a- a- a-I would have a common divisor ~ > d, which is impossible. It follows that d is the greatest common divisor of a-I and m, which was to be proved. 9. For positive integer n, we have 1 3 I 23+ + 3 _ n2(n+ 1)2 T •.. n - 4 (which follows by induction). By induction, we obtain also the identity 1 lS+2s+ ... +ns = 12 n2(n+l)2(2n2+2n-l) for all positive integer n. It follows from these formulas that which proves the desired property. SOLUTIONS 25 10. These are all odd numbers > 1. In fact, if n is odd and > 1, then the number (n-1)/2 is a positive integer, and for k = 1, 2, ... , (n-l)J2 we easily get thus n\\I\"+2\"+ ... +(n-l)\". On the other hand, if n is even, let 2 S be the highest power of 2 which divides n (thus, s is a positive integer). Since 2 S ~ s, for even k we have 2 S\\k\", and for odd k (the number of such k's in the sequence 1, 2, ... , n-l 1-2s- 1 ( is in) we have, by Euler's theorem, I{,- = 1 mod 2~, hence k\" = 1 (mod 2~ (since 2 S - 1!n). Therefore which implies in view of the fact that 2\"+4\"+ ... + (n-2)\" == 0 (mod 2~. Now, if we had n\\I\"+2\"+ ... +(n-1)\", then using the relation 2 sln we would have in = 0 (mod 2~, hence 2 slln and 2 S+ 1In, contrary to the definition of s. Thus, for even n we have n,r 1\"+2\"+ ... +(n-l)\". REMARK. It follows easily from Fermat's theorem that if n is a prime, then nll\"-1+2\"-I+ ... +(n-l),,-I+ 1; we do not know any composite number satisfying this relation. G. Ginga conjectured that there is no such composite number and proved that there is no such composite number n < 101000• 11. Consider four cases: (a) n = 4k, where k is a positive integer. Then a\" = 28IC+1_24k+1+1 = 2-2+1 = 1 (mod 5), b\" = 28k+l+24k+l+1 == 2+2+1 = 0 (mod 5) (since 24 = 1 (mod 5), which implies 24k · 28k = 1 (mod 5»). (b) n = 4k + 1, k = 0, 1, 2, .... Then a\" = 28k+3_24k+2+1 = 8-4+1 = 0 (mod 5), h\" = 28k+3+24k+2+1 == 8+4+1 = 3 (mod 5). 26 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY (c) n = 4k + 2, k = 0, 1, 2, .... Then (d) n = 4k + 3, k = 0, 1, 2, .... Then Thus, the numbers an are divisible by 5 only for n == 1 or 2 (mod 4), while the numbers bn are divisible by 5 only for n = 0 or 3 (mod 4). Thus one and only one of the numbers an and bn is divisible by 5. 12. It is sufficient to take x = 2n-l. Then each of the numbers x, XX, x\",x, ... is odd, and therefore 2n = x + 1 is a divisor of each of the terms of the infinite sequence x+ 1, x\"+ 1, x\"X: + 1, .... . '13. For instance, all primes p of the form 4k+3. In fact, for even x, each of the terms of the sequence x, x\" , xr, ... is even. If any of the terms x of the sequence XX + 1, XXX + 1, XXX + 1, ... were divisible by p, we would have for some positive integer m the relation plxlm + 1, hence (X\"')2 = -1 (modp). However, -1 cannot be a quadratic residue for a prime modulus of the form 4k+3. 14. From the binomial expansion it follows that for n > 1 (which can be assumed, in view of 12121-1), all terms starting from the third term contain n in the power with exponent ~ 2. The second term equals {i)n = n'1.. Thus, n'1.!(l+n)\"-l, which was to be proved. 15. By Problem 14, we have for positive integers m the relation m 21(m+ l)m-l. For m = 2n-l, we get, in view of (m+ 1)'\" = 2 1 ('!n- 1), the relation (2n_l)212c:~n-l)n_l, which was to b~ proved. SOLUTIONS 27 16. We have 312 3+1, and if for some positive integer m 3 111 /23 111+1, then 23 111 = 3\"'k-l, where k is a positive integer. It follows that where t is a positive integer. Thus, 3m+1123m+l + 1, and by induction we get 3 111 12 3m + I for m = I, 2, .... There are, however, other positive integers n satisfying the relation nl2n+ 1. In fact, if for some positive integer n we have nI2\"+ 1, then also 2\"+ 112211+1+ I. Indeed, if' 2\"+ 1 = kn, where k is an integer (obviously, odd), then 2\"+112k\"+1 = 2 211 + 1+1. Thus, 912 9+1 implies 51312 513+ 1. Suppose now that n is a prime and nI2\"+I. By Fermat's theorem we have then n\\2\"-2, which implies, in view of nl2n+ 1, that n13. Since n is a prime, we get n = 3. Indeed, 312 3+ 1. Thus, there exists only one prime n such that nI2\"+1, namely n = 3. 17*. We shall prove first the following theorem due to O. Reutter (see [17]): If a is a positive integer such that a+ 1 is not a'power of 2 with integer ex- ponent, then the relation nla\"+ I has infinitely many solutions in positive integers. If a+ I is not a power of 2 with integer exponent, then it must have a prime divisor p > 2. We have therefore p/a+l. LEMMA. If for some integer k ~ 0 we have pk+l1aP\" + I, where a is an integer > 1, and p is an odd prime, then pk+2lapk+l + 1 . , PROOF OF THE LEMMA. Assume that for some integer k ~ 0 we have pk+lla\"\"+I. Writing apk = b, we get pk+l\\b+l, hence b == -I (mod p1c+l). Since p is odd, we obtain a pk+1 +1 = bP+I = (b+l)(bP- 1-b P- 2+ ... -b+I), (1) and (since b = -I (modpk+l) which implies b =-1 (modp» we get the relations b 21 = I (mod p) and b 21- 1 = -1 (mod p) for I = I, 2, .... Therefore bP- 1-b P- 2+ ... -b+l = 1-1+1- ... +1 == 0 (modp), . 28 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY which shows that the second term on the right-hand side of (1) is divisible by p. Since the first term is divisible by pk+l, we get pk+2Ial'+1 + 1, which proves the lemma. The lemma implies by induction that if pla+ 1, then pk+llapk + 1, and pk\\aP\" + 1 for k = 1, 2, .... Thus there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that nla n+ 1, which proves the theorem of O. Reutter. Since even positive integers satisfy the conditions of Reutter's theorem, it suffices to assume that a is an odd number > 1. If a is odd, then 21a 2+ 1, and tf is of the form 8k+ 1. Thus, cr+ 1 = 8k+ +2 = 2(4k+l) is a double odd number. We shall prove the following lemma: LEMMA. If a is odd> 1, the numbers sand a'+ 1 are double odd numbers, and slas+ 1, then there exists a positive integer SI > s such that 81 and aS1+ 1 are double odd numbers and slla St+ 1. PROOF. Since slas+l and both sand as+l are double odd numbers, we have as+l = ms, where m is odd. Thus as+lld\"s+l = aa s+l+1, hence as+llaa s +l+1. Since as+l is even, aa s+l+1 is a double odd number. For SI = a s+ 1 we have therefore sl!a St+ 1, where S1 and a S1+ 1 are double odd numbers. In view of the fact that a > 1, we have SI > s. This proves the truth of the lemma. Since a is odd, we can put s = 2, which satisfies the conditions of the lemma. It follows immediately that there exist infinitely many positive integers n, such that nl~+ 1, which was to be proved (see [35]). 18*. We shall prove that if n is even and such that n12 11+2 and n-112n+l (which is true, for instance, for n = 2), then for the number nl = 2\"+2 we also have nl12n1+2 and nl-112n1+1. In fact, if nJ2\"+2 and n is even, then 2 n + 2 = nk, where k is odd, hence and for nI = 2 n+2 we have Next, we have n-112 n+l, which implies 2 11+1 = (n-l)m, where m is odd. We obtain therefore 2n- 1+ 112(n-l)lJI+ 1 = 2 2n+1+ 1, which yields 2 11+2122n+2+ +2, or nlI2n1+2. SOLUTIONS 29 Since HI = 2\"+2 > H, there are infinitely many even numbers n satis- fying our conditions. Starting from n = 2, we get successively numbers 2, 6, 66, 2 66+2., .... However, C. Bindschedler noticed that this method does not lead to all numbers n for which n12 n+2 since we have, for instance, 94612 946+2. See a solution to my problem 430 in Elemente der Mathematik, 18 (1963), p. 90, given by C. Bindschedler. 19. If a is a positive integer, and r denotes its remainder upon dividing by 10, then a 10+ 1 is divisible by 10 if and only if r10+ 1 is divisible by 10. It suffices therefore to consider only numbers r equal to 0, 1, 2, ... , 9, and for these numbers we easily check that only 3 1°+ 1 and 7 1°+ 1 are divisible by 10. Thus, all numbers a such that a10+ 1 is divisible by 10 are of the form 10k+3 and IOk+7 for k = 0, 1,2, .... 20*. Suppose that there exist positive integers n > 1 such that n/2n-l, and let n denote the smallest of them. By Euler's theorem, we have then nI29'C n)-1. However, the greatest common divisor of numbers 2a_1 and 2b_1 for positive integers a and b is the number 24-1, where d= (a, b). For a = nand b = cp(n), d = (n, cp(n)) , it follows that nI24-1. However, since n > 1, we have 24-1 > 1, which implies d > 1 and 1 < d ~ q;(n) < n, and d/nI24-1 contrary to the definition of n. 20a. Such are, for instance, all numbers of the form n = 3 k, where k = I, 2, .... We shall prove it by induction. We have 3/2 3+ I. If for some positive integer k we have 3 k l23 k + I, then, in view of the identity and in view of the remark that (since 43 k gives remainder 1 upon dividing by 3), the second term of the formula for 23k + 1 + 1 is divisible by 3, which implies 3k+1123k+l + 1. 21. There is only one such odd number n, namely n = 1. In fact, suppose that there exists an odd number n > 1 such that n/3n+ 1. Thus we have nI9\"-I. Let n be a least positive integer> 1 such that nI9n-l. In view ofnI9<p(n)-I, for d=(n,cp(n)) we shall have nI9d-l. Moreover, d>l since if d were equal to I, we would have nlS which is impossible since n 30 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBeR THEORY is odd. Thus 1 < d ~ q;(n) < n, and dlnI9cf-l, contrary to the definition of the number n. Thus there is no odd number n > 1 such that n13 11+ 1. 22. Clearly, n cannot be divisible by 3. Thus n is of one of the forms 6k+ 1, 6k+2, 6k+4, or 6k+5 where k = 0, 1, 2, .... If n = 6k+ 1, then, in view of 2 6 == 1 (mod 3), we have n2 11 + 1 == (2 6)k2+ 1 == 2+ 1 = 0 (mod 3). Thus 31n2 11+ 1. Ifn = 6k+2, then n 2 11+ 1 == 2 (2 6)k2 2+ 1 == 8+ 1 = 0 (mod 3), hence 3\\n2n+ 1. If n = 6k+4, then n2 11+1 == 4(2 6)k2 4+1 == 2'+1 == 2 (mod 3). Finally, if n = 6k+S, then n2n+l = 5(2 6)k2s+1 = 2 (mod 3). Therefore, the relation 31n2 11+ 1 holds if and only if n is of the form 6k+ 1 or 6k + 2, k = 0, 1, 2, .... 23. If p is an odd prime and n = (P-l)(kp+ 1) where k = 0, 1, 2, ... , then n = -1 (modp) and p-lln. By Fermat's theorem, it implies 211 = 1 (modp), hence n2t1+1 == 0 (modp). REMARK. It follows from this problem that there exist infinitely many composite numbers of the form n2 11+ 1 where n is a positive integer. The numbers of this form are called Cullen numbers. It was proved that for 1 < n < 141 all numbers of this form are composite, but for n = 141 the number n2 11 + 1 is prime. It is not known whether there exist infinitely many prime Cullen numbers. 24. Let n be a given positive integer, and let k > 1 be a positive integer such that 2k > n. Let p be a prime> 2 k - 1k. Since k > 1, for x = 2k, Y = 2p we have x,r y, and rly', because r = 2k2k and y' = (2p)2p, where 2p > 2kk. Thus, for instance, 4 4110 10, but 4,rl0, 8 8112 12 but 8,r12, 9 9121 21 but 9%21. 25*. For positive integers n we have obviously qJ(n)!n !. In fact, it is true for n = 1; if n > 1, and if n = q~lq:2 ... q~k is a decolJjposition of n into primes, where ql < q2 < ... < qk, then . qJ(n) = qf1- t q:2- 1 ••• q:k-1(ql-1) ... (qk-1) and we have q~1-lq:2-1 ... q~k-lln, while ql -I < qk ~ n, which implies that qk-1 < nand q1-1 < q2-1 < ... < qk-1 are different positive integers smaller than n. Thus (ql-1)(q2-1) ... (qk-1)1 (n-l)!, and it follows that qJ(n)/(n-l)!n = n!. If n is odd, then (by Euler's theorem) nI2fJ(II)-112n!-I, hence nI2n!-I, which was to be proved. 26. By Fermat's theorem, we have 24 = 1 (mod 5) and 212 = 1 (mod 13). SOLUTIONS 31 Since 23 - 3 (mod 5) and 24 = 3 (mod 13), we get 2 4k+ 3 == 3 (mod 5) and 2121+4 == 3 (mod 13) for k = 0, 1, 2, .... Therefore 5124.t +3-3 and 13/212\"+4_3- for k = 0, 1, 2, .... Next, 2 6 == -1 (mod 65), which implies that 212 == 1 (mod 65) and there- fore 2\"+ 12 - 3 == 2\"- 3 (mod 65), which shows that the sequence of remainders modulo 65 of the sequence 2\"-3 (n = 2, 3, ... ) is periodic with period 12. To prove that none of the numbers 2\"-3 (n = 2, 3, ... ) is divisible by 65 it is sufficient to check whether the numbers 2~-3 for n = 2, 3, ... , 13 are divisible by' 65. We find easily that the remainders upon dividing by 65 are I, 5, 13,29,61,60, 58, 54,46,30,63,64, and none of these remainders is zero. 27*. It is known (see, for instance, Sierpiilski, [37, p. 215]) that the four smallest composite numbers n, such that nI2\"-2, are 341, 561, 645, and 1105. For 341, we have 341,¥3341-3 since, by Fermat's theorem, 330, = 1 (mod 31), which implies 3330 = 1 (mod 31), hence 3341 = 3 11 (mod 31). In view of 33 == -4 (mod 31), we get 39 == -64 = -2 (mod 31), hence 311 = -18 (mod 31). Therefore 3 341_3 = 3 11-3 = -21 (mod 31), and 31 ,r 3341_ 3, which implies 341 = 11 · 31 ,r 3341_ 3. On the other hand, 561 = 3 ·11 · 1713561-3 since 1113 1°-1 which implies 111339°-1 and 11/3341-3, and also 171316-1 which implies 17\\3 16• 3s-1 = 356°_1. Thus 1713s61-3. Thus, the least composite number n such- that n/2\"-2 and nI3\"-3 is the number n = 561. The number 645 is not a divisor of 3645_3 since 645 = 3 · 5 · 43, while 342 = 1 (mod 43) which implies 342.15 == 1 (mod 43). Thus 3630 = 1 (mod 43), and 3645 == 3 1S (mod 43). Since 34 = -5 (mod 43), we have 36 = -45 = -2 (mod 43), 3 12 = 4 (mod 43), 3 15 == 108 = 22 (mod 43). Therefore 3645_3 = 19(mod 43), which implies 43,¥ 3645_3. Onthe other hand, we have 1105\\31105-3. Indeed, 1105 = 5· 13 · 17, 34 == 1 (~od 5), and 3 1104 == 1 (mod 5), and 5131105-3. Next, 3 12 = 1 (mod 13), 3 1104 = 1 (mod 13) and 13131105_3. Finally, 316 == 1 (mod 17), and since 1104 = 16 · 69, we get 31104 = 1 (mod 17), which implies 17131105-3. Thus, two smallest composite numbers for which n\\2\"-2 and nI3\"-3 are 561 and 1105. REMARK. We do not know whether there exist infinitely many composite numbers n for which n\\2\"-2 and n)3\"-3. This assertion would follow from a conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning prime numbers ([22]). For prime num- bers n, both relations nI2\"-2 and nI3\"-3 hold because of Fermat's theorem. 32 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 28*. In view of n % 3\"-3 and Fermat's theorem, the number n must be composite, and the least composite n for which nI2\"-2 and n % 3\"-3 is n = 341. In the solution to Problem 27 we proved that 341,t3 341-3. Thus, the least number n such that n12n-2 and n,t 3 11-3 is n = 341. REMARK. A. Rotkiewicz proved that there exist infinitely many positive integers n, both even and odd, such that nI2\"-2 and n,t 3\"-3. 29. Number n = 6 has the desired property. In fact, if n % 2\"-2, then n must be composite. The least composite number is 4, but 4,t 3 4-3 = 78. Next composite number is 6, and we have 6,t 2 6-2 = 62, while 613 6-3 since 36-3 is obviously even and divisible by 3. REMARK. A. Rotkiewicz proved that there exist infinitely many com- posite numbers n, both even and odd, such that n\\3\"-3 and n % 2\"-2. 30. If a is composite, we may put n = a since obviously altf-a. If a = 1, we can put n = 4 since 4114-1. If a is a prime> 2, we may put n = 2a since in this case a is odd, and the number a 2a-a is even; thus, cJ2a_a, being divisible by an odd number a and by 2, is divisible by 2a. It remains to consider the case a = 2. Here we can put n = 341 = 11·31 since 34112 341-2; the last property can be proved as follows: we have 11\\2 1°-1 = 1023, hence 1112 34°-1, and 1112 341-2. Next, 31 = 25-112340-1, hence 3112 341-2. Thus the number 2 341_2 is divisible by 11 and 31, hence also by their product 341. REMARK. M. Cipolla proved that for every positive integer a there exist infinitely many composite numbers n such that nia\"-a. (See [5].) We do not know~ however, whether there exist infinitely many composite numbers n such that nla\"-a for every integer a. The least of such number is 561 = 3·11·17. From a certain conjecture of A .. Schinzel concerning prime numbers ([22]) it follows that there are infinitely many such composite numbers. 31. The cube of an integer which is not divisible by 3 gives remainder 1 or -1 upon dividing by 9. Thus, if none of the numbers a, b, c were di- visible by 3, then the number a 3+b3+c3, upon dividing by 9, would give the remainder ± 1 ± 1 ± 1 which is not divisible by 9 for any combination of signs + and -. It follows that if 9Ia 3+b3+c 3, then 3labc, which was to be proved. 32. The proof is analogous to the proof in Problem 31 since the number ± 1 ± 1 ± 1 ± 1 ± 1 is not divisible by 9 for any combination of signs + and - . SOLUTIONS 33 33. The condition (x, y) = 1 is necessary since, for instance, 152 +202 = 5\\ while 7,t 15·20. Now, if (x, y) = 1 and x, y, z are positive integers such that r+y2 = z\\ then, as we know from the theory of Pythagorean equation, there exist integers m and n such that for instance x = m2_n2, y = 2mn, Z2 = m2+n2• Suppose that 7,ty; thus 7,tm and 7 ,tn. It is easy to see that the square of an integer not divisible by 7 gives, upon dividing by 7, the remainders 1, 2 or 4. Since 1 +2, 1 +4, and 2+4 cannot be such re- mainders, neither they are divisible by 7, it follows from equation z2 = m2+ +n2 that the numbers m and n must give the same remainders upon dividing by 7. Thus 71x = m2-w. 34. The square of an integer not divisible by 7 gives upon dividing by 7 the remainder 1, 2, or 4, hence the sum of such squares gives the remainder 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Thus, if a and b are integers such that 71a2+b2, then one of them, hence also the other, must be divisible by 7. 35*. The numbers x = 36k+14,y = (12k+5) (18k+7), k = 0, 1,2, ... , have the desired property. In fact, we have obviously x(x+ 1)ly(Y+ 1) since x(x+l) = 2·3(12k+5) (18k+7) = 6y, while 61y+ 1. The number y is not divisible by x since y is odd, while x is even. The number y is not divisible by x+ 1 since 3jx+ 1, while 3,t y. The number y+1 is not divisible by x since 18k+71x and 18k+7Iy, hence 18k+7 ,ty+1. Finally, the number y+l is not divisible by x+1 since 12k+5Ix+l and 12k +5Iy, hence 12k+5,t y+ 1. For k ± 0, we obtain x = 14, y = 35, and it is easy to show that there are no smaller numbers with the required property. 36. For s < 10, we have of course ns = s. Next, studying successive multiples of s, we obtain njO = 190, nll = 209, n12 = 48, n13 . 247, n14 = 266, nlS = 155, n16 = 448, n17 = 476, n18 = 198, n19 = 874, n20 = 9920, n21 = 399, n22 = 2398, n23 = 1679, n24 = 888, n2S = 4975. Finally, we have nlOO = 19999999999900. In fact, two last digits of every number divisible by 100 must be zero, and the sum of digits of every number smaller than 199999999999 is obviously smaller than 100. See Kaprekar [11]. 37*. Let s be a positive integer, s = 21J5{1t, where IX and (J are integers ;;::: 0, and t is a positive integer not divisible by 2 or 5. By Euler's theorem we have l()9'<t) == 1 (mod t). Let n = 10IJ+P(10<P(t)+ 1 OZ<p(t) + ... + 10sq;(I»). 34 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMB.R THEORY We have 1()9'!1)+ IQ29'<t)+ ... + l()\"9'<t) == S == 0 (mod t) (since tis), and in view of 2\"'5'll()11H, the number n is divisible by s. On the other hand, it is clear that the sum of decimal digits of the number n equals s. 38*. (a) The theorem is obviously true if the number has no prime divisor of the form 4k+3. Suppose that the theorem is true for all numbers, whose expansion into primes in first powers (hence not necessarily distinct) contains s ;;:, 0 primes of the form 4k+3. Let n be a positive integer, whose expansion into primes in first powers (hence not n~essarily distinct) contains s+1 prime factors of the form 4k+3. Then we have n = mq, where the ex- pansion of m into primes in first powers contains s factors of the form 4k+ +3, and qis a prime of the form 4k+3. Let g denote the number of integer divisors of m which are of the form 4k+ I and let h denote the number of integer divisors of n which are of the form 4k+3. By assumption (concern- ing s) we have g ;;::: h. Now, the integer divisors of the form ~+ 1 of mq are of course the divisors of the form 4k+ 1 of m (the number of these divisors being equal to g), and also the products of integer divisors of the form 4k+ + 3 of m by the number q; the number of these divisors is h. Thus, the number mq will have g+h integer divisors of the form 4k+ 1. On the other hand, integer divisors of mq of the form 4k+3 will be the integer divisors of the form 4k+3 of m (the number of those divisors being h), and the products of the divisors of the form 4k+ I of m by q (the number of those divisors is g). However, among the latter there may be divisors which are divisors of the form 4k +3 of m. Thus the total number of integer divisors of the form 4k+3 of mq is ~ h+g (and, perhaps, < h+g). The theorem being true for every number mq, we obtp..in by induction (with respect to s) that the theorem is true for positive integer s. (b) The number 3211- 1 (n = 1,2, ... ) has as many integer divisors of the form 4k+ 1 (namely, 1, 32, 34, ... , 3211- 2) as divisors of the form 4k+3 (namely 3, 33, 35, ... , 3211- 1). (c) The number 3211 (where n = 1,2, ... ) has n+1 divisors of the form 4k+1 (namely 1,32,3 4, ... ,3 211) and only n divisors of the form 4k+3 (namel, \" 33, ... , 3211- 1). The number 5\" has all n+ 1 divisors of the form 4k+l, an.d has no divisor of the form 4k+3. 39. Let'l, '2, and·'3 be the remainders upon dividing the integers -a, -b, and -c by n. ThuS\"1> '2, and'3 are integers from the sequence 0,1,2, ... ... , n-l, and since there is at most three different among the numbers 'I> SOLUTIONS 3S '2, '3, while n > 3, there exists a number, in this sequence such that, :f: '1, , #: '2, and, ¢ '3. If we had nla+r, then in view of -a = '1 (mod n) we would have n\\r-r). However, rand rl are integers ~ 0 and < n, and if their difference is divisible by n, then we must have r = rl contrary to the definition of r. In a similar way we show that n,t b+r and nA' c+r. Thus, we can put k = r. 40. We easily show by induction that for positive integers n we have 211 ~ n+l, which implies that 2\"+1122\" and 22,,+1_11222\"_1. Therefore F\" 'J!' II + 1 2\" 211 +1 == 2 +112 2 -1122 -1122 -2 = 2Fn-2, and F,.12Fn-2, which was to oe proved. REMARK. T. Banachiewicz suspected that this relation led P. Fermat to his conjecture that all numbers Fn (n = 1, 2, ... ) are primes. During Fermat's times it was thought that the so-called Chinese theorem is true, namely the theorem asserting that if an integer m > 1 satisfies the relation mJ2m-2, then m is a prime (it was checked for first several hundred integers). This breaks down, however, for m = 341 = 11 · 31, which was not known then. II. RELATIVELY PRIME NUMBERS 41. Numbers 2k+l and 9k+4 are relatively prime since 9(2k+l)- -2(9k+4) = I. Since 9k+4 = 4(2k-I)+(k+8), while 2k-1 = 2(k+8)- -17, we have (9k+4, 2k-l) = (2k-l, k+8) = (k+8, 17). If k = 9 (mod 17), then (k+8, 17) == 17; in the contrary case, we have 17Ik+8, hence (k+8, 17) = 1. Thus, (9k+4, 2k-l) = 17 if k = 9 (mod 17) and (9k+4, 2k-l) = 1 if k ;s 9 (mod 17) . . 42. We show first that if for some positive integer m we have m triangular numbers al < a2 < ... < am which are pairwise relatively prime, then there exists a triangular number t > am such that (t, aI, a2, ... , am) = 1. In fact, let a = al a2 ... am; the numbers a+ 1 and 2a+ 1 are relatively prime to a. The number (2a+l) (2a+2) am+l = t2Q+ 1 = 2 = (a+l) (2a+l) is a triangUlar number > am; being relatively prime to a, it is relatively prime to every number aI, a2, ... , am. 36 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY It follows that if we have a finite increasing sequence of pairwise relatively prime triangular numbers, then we can always find a triangular number exceeding all of them and pairwise relatively prime to them. Taking always the least such number we form the infinite sequence t1 =1, t2=3, t4 =10, t13 =91, t22=253, of pairwise relatively prime triangular numbers. 43. We shall prove first that if for some positive integer m the tetra- hedral numbers al < a2 < ... < am are pairwise relatively prime, then there exists a tetrahedral number T > am such that (T, al, a2, ... , am) = 1. In fact, let a = ala2 ... an- Put T = T6a+1 = (6a+l) (3a+l) (2a+l); clearly T is prime relatively to a, hence relatively to each of the numbers at, ... , am, and T> a ~ am. Thus, we can define the required increasing sequence of pairwise relatively prime tetrahedral numbers by induction: take Tl = 1 as the first term of the sequence, and, after having defined m first pairwise relatively prime tetra- hedral numbers of this sequence, define the m + 1 st as the least tetra- hedral number exceeding all first m terms, and being relatively prime to each of them. In this manner we obtain the infinite increasing sequence of pairwise relatively prime tetrahedral numbers Tl =1, T2 = 4, Ts = 35, T17 = 969, 44. Let a ,and b be two different integers. Assume for instance a < b, and let n = (b-a)k+ I-a. For k sufficiently large, n will be positive integer. We have a+n = (b-a)k+l, b+n = (b-a) (k+l)+l, hence a+n and b+n will be positive integers. If we had dla+n and dlb+n, we would have dla-b, and, in view of dla+n, also dll, which implies that d = 1. Thus, (a+n, b+n) = 1. 45*. If the integers a, b, c are distinct, then the number h = (a-b) (a-c) (b-c) is different from zero. In case h :F ± 1, let Ql, ... , qs denote all prime> 3 divisors of h. If two or more amo~g numbers a, b, c are even, put r = 1, otherwise put r = O. Clearly, at least two of the numbers a+r, b+r, c+r will be odd. If SOLUTIONS 37 a, b, c give three different remainders upon dividing by 3, put ro = O. If two or more among a, b, c give the same remainder e upon dividing by 3, put ro = I-e. Clearly, at least two of the numbers a+ro, b+ro, c+ro will be not divisible by 3. Now, Jet i denote one of the numbers 1, 2, ... , s. In view of Problem 39 (and the fact that qi > 3), there exists an integer r/ such that none of the numbers a+rh b+rh c+ri is divisible by qt. According to the Chinese remainder theorem, there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that n == r (mod 2), n == ro (mod 3), and n==ri(modqi) fori=1,2, ... ,s. We shall show that the numbers a+n, b+n and c+n are pairwise relatively prime. Suppose, for instance, that (a+n, b+n) > 1. Then, there would exist a prime q such that q\\a+n and qjb+n, hence q\\a-b, which implies q\\h and h::F ±1. Since n == r (mod 2) and at least two of the numbers a+r, b+r, c+r are odd, at least two of the numbers a+n, b+n, c+n are odd, and we cannot have q = 2. Next, since n == ro (mod 3) and at least two of the numbers a+ro, b+ro, c+ro are not divisible by 3, at least two of the numbers a+n, b+n, c+n are not divisible by 3, and we cannot have q = 3. Since q\\h, in view of the definition of h, we have q = qi for a certain i from the sequence 1, 2, ... , s. However, in view of n == rj (mod q,), or n == ri (mod q), and in view of the fact that none of the numbers a+rh b+ri, c+ri is divisible by qh none of the numbers a+n, b+n, c+n is divisible by q/ = q, contrary to the assumption that q\\a+n and qJb+n. Thus, we proved that (a+n, b+n) = 1. In a similar way we show that (a+n, c+n) = 1, and (b+n, c+n) = 1. Therefore the numbers a+n, b+n, and c+n are pairwise relatively prime. Since there are infinitely many such numbers n, the proof is complete. 46. Such numbers are for instance a = 1, b = 2, c = 3, d = 4. In fact, for odd n, the numbers a+n and c+n are even, hence not relatively prime, and, for even n, the numbers b+n and d+n are even, hence not relatively prime. 47. If n is odd and> 6, then n = 2+(n-2), where n-2 is odd and > 1, and we have (2, n-2) = 1. The following proof for the case of even n > 6 is due to A. Mq,kowski. If n = 4k, where k is an integer > 1 (since n > 6), then n = (2k-1)+ 38 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY +(2k+l), and 2k+l > 2k-l > 1 (since k > I). The numbers 2k-l and 2k+l, as consecutive odd numbers, are relatively prime. If n = 4k+2, where k is an integer > 1 (since n > 6), we have n = = (2k+3)+(2k-l), where 2k+3 > 2k-l > 1 (since k > 1). The numbers 2k +3 and 2k-I are relatively prime since if 0 < d12k+3 and dI2k-l, then d\\(2k+3)-(2k-l) or d14. Now, d as a divisor of an odd number must be odd, hence d = 1, and (2k+3, 2k-l) = 1. 48*. If n is even and> 8, then n = 6k, n = 6k+2 or n = 6k+4, and in the first two cases k is an integer> 1, and in the third case, k is a positive integer. The formulae 6k = 2+3+(6(k-l)+1), 6k+2 = 3+4+(6(k-l)+1), 6k+4 = 2+3+(6k-l) show easily that n is a sum of three pairwise relatively prime positive integers. Suppose now that n is odd and > 17. We consider six cases: n = 12k + 1, n = 12k+3, n = 12k+5, n = 12k+7, ':l = I2k+9, and n = I2k+Il, where in the first three cases k is an integer> 1, and in the last three cases k is a positive integer. We have I2k-l = (6(k-l)-I)+(6(k-l)+5)+9, where the numbers 6(k-I)~I, 6(k-l)+5, and 9 are> 1 and relative,ly prime; in fact, the first two are not divisible by 3, and are relatively prime since dI6(k-I)-1 and dI6(k-I)+5 would imply d/4, while the numbers considered are odd. Ifn = 12k+3, then we have n = (6k-I)+(6k+l)+3; if n = 12k+5, then we have n = (6k-5)+(6k+l)+9; if n = 12k+7, then we have n = (6k+5)+(~k-l)+3; if n = 12k+9, then we have n = (6k-I)+(6k+l)+9; if n = 12k+l1, then we have n = (6(k+l)-S)+(6(k+I)+1)+3, and we easily check that in each case we have three terms > 1 and pairwise relatively . prIme. The number 17 does not have the desired property since in the case 17 = a+b+c, all three numbers a, b, c (as > 1 and pairwise relatively prime) would have to be odd and distinct. We have, however, 3+5+7 = 15 < 17, 3+5+11 > 17, and in case 3 < a < b < c, we have a ~ 5, b ~ 7, c ~ 9, SOLUTIONS 39 hence a+b+c ~ 5+7+9 ~ 21 > 17, which shows that 17 does not have the desired property. 49*. We shall present the proof based on an idea of A. Schinzel (see [19]). Let k denote a given positive integer and let m be the positive integer whose expansion into prime powers is m = qflq~2 ... q~'. Let I(x) = x(x+2k) and let i denote one of the numbers 1, 2, ... , s. We cannot have qilx(x+2k) for all integer x since then for x = 1 we would have qil2k+ 1, and for x = -1 we would have qd2k-l, and q;!(2k+l)-(2k-l) = 2, which is impossible in view of qjl2k+ 1 (and, in consequence, qiI1). Therefore there exists an integer Xj such that qi,r Xi(Xi+2k) = I(xj). By the Chinese remainder theorem, there exists a positive integer Xo such that Xo == Xi (mod qj) for i = 1,2, ... , s, which yields I(xo) == I(xt) ~ 0 (mod qi) for i = 1,2, ... , s. We have therefore (f(xo), q;) = 1 for i ~ 1,2, ... , s, which (in view of the expansion of m into prime factors) gives (f(xo), m) = 1, or (xo(xo+2k), m) = 1. Thus, if we put a = xo+2k, b = xo, we shall have 2k = a-b, where (a, m) = 1, (b, m) = 1, which proves the theorem. REMARK. Since adding arbitrary multiples of m to a and b does not change the fact that 2k = a-b and (ab, m) = 1, we proved that, for every m, every even number can be represented in infinitely many ways as a dif- ference of positive integers relatively prime with m. We do not know whether every even number is a difference of two primes. From a certain conjecture on prime numbers of A. Schinzel ([22]), it follows that every even number can be represented as a difference of two l'rimes in infinitely many ways. ' 50*. We shall present the proof given by A. Rotkiewicz. If u\" is the 'nth term of the Fibonacci sequence. and if m and nare positive integers,then (um• u,,) = Um,,, (see [27, p. 280, problem 5]). Since Ul = 1, we see that if Pk denotes the kth successive prime. then every two terms of the increasing infinite sequence are relatively prime. Instead of PI< we could take here 22k + 1 since it is well known that (22m + 1, 22\"+1) = 1 for positive integers m and n =I: m. 51*. We know that every divisor> 1 of the number F\" = 22\"+1 (n = 1,2, ... ) is of the form 2,,+2k+ 1 where k is positive integer (see,. for instance, [37, p. 343, Theorem 5]). Since for positive integers nand k we 40 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY have 2,,+2k+ 1 ~ 2 n+ t + 1 > n, all > 1 divisors of F\" must be > n, hence (n, F~) = 1, which was to be proved. 51a. We easily check that (n, 2\"-1) = 1 for n = 1,2, 3,4, 5, while (6,26-1) = 3. For k = 1,2, ... , we have 312 6-1126k-l, hence (6k, 26k_l) ~ 3 for k = 1, 2, .... The least such nunlber n is equal to 6. III. ARITHMETIC PROGRESSIONS 52. Let m be a given integer> 1. The numbers m!k+l for k = 1, 2, ... ... , m are relatively prime since for positive integers k and 1 with k < 1 ~ m if d > 1 were the common divisor of m!k+l and m!l+l, we would have dll(m!k+l)-k(m!l+l) = l-k < m, hence 1 < d < m, and dim!. This, in view of dlm!k+l, gives dll, contrary to the assumption that d > 1. 53. The required property is satisfied, for instance, by all terms of the arithmetic progression 2 kt+2k - 1 (where t = 0, 1, 2, ... ) since in the expansion of n = 2 kt+2k - 1 into primes, the number 2 enters with the exponent k-l; from the well-known formula for the number of positive integer divisors it follows immediately that the number of positive integer divisors of the number n is divisible by k. 54. The required property holds for an arbitrary positive integer x and for y = 5x+2, Z = 7x+3 since in this case the numbers 'x(x+l) =, x2+x, y(y+l) = 25x2+25x+6, z(z+l) = 49r+49x+12 form the arithmetic progression with the difference 24r+24x+6. REMARK. One can show that there are no four increasing positive integers x, y, Z, t such that the numbers x(x+ 1), y(y+ 1), z(z+ 1), and t(t+ 1) form an arithmetic progression since then the numbers four times greater and increased by one, i.e. the numbers (2x+ 1)2, (2y+ 1)2, (2z+ 1)2, and (2t+ 1)2 would also form an arithmetic progression, contrary to the theorem of Fermat asserting that there are no four different squares of integers which form an arithmetic progression (the proof can be found in the book by W. Sierpinski [37, p. 74, theorem 8]). 55. If the sides of a rectangular triangle form an arithmetic progression, then we can denote them by b-r, band b+r where band r are positive integers, and we have (b-r)2+b2 = (b+r)2, hence b = 4r, which gives the SOLUTIONS 41 rectangular triangle with sides 3r, 4r, and 5r, where r is an arbitrary positive integer. Thus, all rectangular triangles whose sides are integers forming an arithmetic progression are obtained by increasing integer number of times the triangle with sides 3, 4, 5. 56. Triangular numbers In = !n(n+ 1) are odd for n = 4u+ 1 (u = 0, 1,2, ... ) and even for 41n. Thus both progressions with difference 2 contain infinitely many triangular numbers. On the other hand, the pro- gression 3k+2 (k = 0, 1,2, ... ) does not contain any triangular number since if 31n, then 3ltn ; similarly, if n = 3u+2 for u = 0, 1,2, ... , then 311ft ; . u(u+I) finally, if n = 3u+l, where u = 0,1,2, ... , then tn = 9 2 +1, hence dividing by 3 yields the remainder 1. 57. It is necessary and sufficient for b to be a quadratic residue for modulus a. In fact, if for some positive integer x and some integer k ~ ° we have xl = ak+b, then xl == b (mod a), and b is a quadratic residue for modulus a. Conversely, if b is a quadratic residue for modulus a, then there exist infinitely many positive integers x such that xl == b (mod a), hence xl = ak+ +b, where k is an integer, and consequently, is positive for sufficiently large x. 58*. We shall give the proof due to A. Schinzel. Let Pk denote the kth successive prime. Let s be an arbitrary positive integer and let P = PIP2 ... p~. By the Chinese remainder theorem, for every positive integer k ~ s there exists a positive integer ak such that ak == ° (mod P/Pk), and ak == -1 (mod Pk)' Put Q = 1131 213: ... sa,. The numbers kQ (k = 1,2, ... , s) form an increasing arithmetic progression with s terms. By the definition of the numbers ale (k = 1,2, ... , s), we have Pklak+ 1 and Pklan if k :f:. n, where n is a positive integer> s. The numbers s QIe = k(ak+l)/Pk n na\"/p,, ft=1 n.pk are natural, and we easily see that kQ= Qf\" for k = 1, 2, ... , s, thus the numbers kQ (k = 1,2, ... , s) are powers of integers with integer expo- nents > 1. 59. The desired theorem is clearly equivalent to the theorem that in every infinite increasing arithmetic sequence of integers there exists a term 42 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY which is not a power with integer exponent > 1 of any integer. Thus, let ak+b (k = 0, 1, 2, ... ) be an infinite arithmetic progression, where a and b are positive integers. There exists a prime p > a+b. Since (a,p2) = 1, the equation ax-p2y = 1 has a solution in positive integers x, y. Let k = (p-b)x; this will be a positive integer (since p > b), and we shall have. ak+b = p2y (P-b)+p. Thus the term ak+b of our progression is not divisible by p2, and therefore cannot be a power of a positive integer with integer exponent > 1. 60. Out of every four consecutive positive integers one must be of the form 4k+2, where k is an integer ~ O. No such number, as an even number which is not divisible by 4, can be a power of a positive integer with integer exponent > 1. REMARK. A. M~kowski proved that there are no three consecutive positive integers such that each of them is a power with integer exponent > 1 of a positive integer, but the proof is difficult (Khatri [13]). There exist, however, two consecutive numbers such that each of them is a power with integer exponent > 1 of a positive integer. Such numbers are, for instance, 22 = 8, 3 2 = 9. Catalan's problem whether there are any other pairs of such integers is open. S. Hyyro [10] proved that in any such pair both bases are> 1011 • 61. The solution follows immediately from Problem 58, it can, however, be proved in a simpler way. Let m > 1 be an integer, and let ql (i = 1, 2, ... , m) be primes such that a < ql < q2 < ... < qm. By the Chinese remainder theorem, th~re exists a positive integer x such that ax = -b -aj (mod q~) for j = 1,2, ... , m. Thus qJla(x+j)+b for j = 1,2, ... , m. Thus m consecu- tive terms of the progression ak+b, namely the terms a(x+i)+b for j = 1, 2, ... , m, are composite. 62*. We can assume, of course, that m is ~an integer> 1. Let P denote the product of all prime divisors of m which are the divisors od a, and let P = 1 if there are no such divisors. Let Q denote the product of all prime divisors of m which are divisors of b, and let Q = 1 if there are no such divisors. Since (a, b) = 1, we have (P, Q) = 1. Finally, let R denote the product of all prime divisors of m which do not divide a or b, and if there are no such divisors, let R = 1. Obviously, we have (R, P) = 1 and (R, Q) = 1. We shall show that (aPR+b, m) = 1. In fact, if it were not true, there would exist a prime p such that plm, and plaPR+b. If we had piP, then plaP R +b would imply plb, hence plQ, contrary to the fact that (P, Q) SOLUTIONS 43 = 1. If we had plQ, then we would have plb, hence plaPR, which is im- possible since (a, b) = 1, (b, P) = 1, (b, R) = 1. Finally, if we had plR, we would have plb, hence plQ, contrary to the fact that (R, Q) = 1. Thus, we proved that (aPR+b, m) = 1, and it follows that (a(km+PR)+b, m) = 1 for k = 0, 1, .... Therefore our progression contains infinitely many terms relatively prime with m, which was to be proved. 63. Let b be the first term of our progression and let a be its difference; thus the numbers a and b are positive integers. Let x denote the remainder obtained from dividing b by a; we have therefore b = al+r where t is an integer ~ 0, and r is an integer such that 0 ~ r < a. Let s be an arbitrary positive integer, and let Cl> C2, ••• , c. with Cl of.: 0 be an arbitrary sequence of decimal digits. Let N denote the s-digit integer, whose consecutive digits ar,e Cl> C2, ••• , C •• Obviously there exists a positive integer n such that 10\" > 20(/+1). The nUmber NIO\"/a-t will be > 1. , Let k be the least positive integer greater than NlO\"/a-t; thus, we shall have k-l ~ NlO\"/a-t, hence k 1 ---- NlO' 2 (N+I)lO\" + ~ --- + -I < -t a a since 10\" > 2a. We have therefore NIO\" < a(k+t) < ak+at+r = ak+b < a(k+t+I) < (N+l) 10\" = NIO\"+IO\" and it follows that the first s digits of the number ak+b are the same as the first s digits of the number N, i.e. the digits Cl> Cz, •.. , c •• 64. If the terms Uk, u\" and Urn of the Fibonacci sequence form an arithmetic progression, then we must have u, > I, and therefore I > 2 (since U2 = I), and m > 3. Moreover, Um = u,+(U,-Uk), which implies that Urn < u,+u, < u,+u/+1 = U1+2. Thus Urn < u,+2and it follows that Urn ~ U'H. On the other hand, UII! > u\" hence Urn ~ U'H, and we must have Urn = Ul+l. Therefore (since 1 > 2) we have m = 1+ I. We have thus Uk = 2u,-um = U,-(UI+I-U,) = U,-U'_1 = UI-Z, which implies that k = 1-2. Thus, if the terms Uk, UI, and' Um of the Fibonacci sequence form an increasing arithme- tic progression, we must have 1 > 2, k = 1-2 and m = 1+1. On the other hand, for any integer I> 1 the numbers UI_2, U\" and U/+1 form an arithmetic progression with the difference UI_l. If n were an integer> 1+ 1, we would have n ~ 1+2, hence U\" ~ U1+2. and Un-UHI ~ UH2-UI+1 = U, > UI_1 44 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY (since 1 > 2). It follows that there are no four terms of the Fibonacci sequence which form an arithmetic progression. 65*. We know [27, p. 279, problem 3] that if m is a positive integer, then the remainders of dividing successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence by m form a periodic sequence with pure period. For m = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, the remainders upon dividing the terms of the Fibonacci sequence by m are respectively (we show here only first few remainders, and not all of them): for m = 2: 1, 1, 0, ... , for m = 3: 1, 1, 2, 0, ... , for m = 4: 1, 1, 2, 3, 1,0, ... , for m = 5: 1, 1, 2, 3, 0, 3, 3, 1, 4, ... , for m = 6: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 1, 3, 4, 1, 5, 0, ... , for m = 7: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 1, 6, 0, 6, 6, 5, 4, ... . Since for every positive integer m ~ 7 all possible remainders modulo m appear in the above sequences, we see that each of the arithmetic progressions with the difference m ~ 7 contains infinitely many terms of the Fibonacci sequence. We shall show now that the progression 8k+4 (k = 0, 1, 2, ... ) does not contain any term of the Fibonacci sequence. Since Ul = U2 = 1 and U,,+2 = U,,+Un+l for n = 1, 2, ... , we easily see that the numbers Ul, U2, ... , U14 give the following remainders upon dividing by 8: 1. 1. 2, 3, 5, 0, 5, 5,2, 7, 1, 0, 1, 1. It follows that 81u13~Ul and 8IuI4-u2. Thus, for n· = 1 we have 8Iu\"+12-un and 8Iu\"+13-U\"+1 . Suppose now that these two formulas hold for some positive integers n. We have then 8Iun+12+U,,+13-(U,,+Un+1) or 8Iu,,:\"14-Un+2 (since 8Iun~13-U\"+I). It follows by induction that 8Iun+12-u\" for n = 1, 2, ... , which shows that the sequence of consecutive remainders modulo 8 of the Fibonacci sequence is periodic and has a pure twelve-term period. From the first fourteen remainders modulo 8 we see that these remainders may be only 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Thus there are no remainders 4 or 6, which implies that the progressions 8k+4 and 8k+6 do not contain any term of the Fibonacci sequence. These are the progressions of integer terms with the desired property, and with the least possible difference. SOLUTIONS 45 66*. The progression llk+4 (k = 0, 1,2, ... ) has the required prop- erty. As in the solution of Problem 65, we prove by an easy induction that 11IUn+10-un for n = 1,2, .... It follows that the sequence of remainders modulo 11 of the Fibonacci sequence is periodic, with period 10; we easily find this sequence to be 1,1,2,3,5,8,2,10,1,0, .... The number 4 (and also 6, 7, and 9) does not appear in this sequence. 67. Suppose that we have n terms of our progression which are pairwise relatively prime (for n = 1 we can put kt = 1). Let m = (akt +b)(ak2+b) ... (akll+b). From Problem 62* it follows that there exists a positive integer kll+1 such that (akll+1 + b, m) = 1, hence (akn+1 +b, aki+b) = 1 for i = 1,2, ... , n. The numbers are therefore pairwise relatively prime. Thus we defined by induction the infinite sequence kb k 2 , ... such that the sequence akl+b (i = 1,2, ... ) contains only relatively prime terms of the original arithmetic progression. 68*. Let d = (a, a+b). Thus we have a = dab a+b = dc, where (ab c) = 1 and c> 1 (since d ~ a, while de = a+b > a). In view of (ab c) = 1 and of Euler's theorem, we have &<al) == 1 (mod at), hence c\"qJ{al) == 1 (mod at) for integer n. Therefore c\"qJ{al)-1 = t\"at with some positive integer tn which (since c > 1 and n is arbitrarily large) can be made arbitrarily large. Moreover, we have The term a(ct,,+I)+b of our progression (which can be arbitrarily large) has therefore those and only those prime divisors which are the prime divisors of the number de > 1. Thus, in our progression there exist infinitely many terms with the same set of prime divisors, which was to be proved (see P6lya [14]). 69. From the theorem of Lejeune-Dirichlet it immediately follows that the theorem is true for s = 1. Suppose now that the theorem is true for some positive integer s. Thus, if Ca, b) = 1, then there exists a number ko such that ako+b = q] q2 ... qs, where ql < q2 < ... < q. are 46 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY primes. By the theorem of Lejeune-Dirichlet, there exist infinitely many integers k such that ak+I = q is a prime> qs. For t = qlq2 ... qsk+ko we get at+b = ql q2 ... qsak+ako+b = ql q2 ... qs(ak+ 1) = ql q2 ... qsq. Therefore the theorem is true for s+ 1. By induction it follows that the theorem is true for every positive integer s, which was to be proved. 70. If p is a prime, then one of the numbers p,p+l0, and p+20 must be divisible by 3 (since p+l0 = p+l (mod 3) and p+20 == p+2 (mod 3), and out of every three consecutive integers, one must be divisible by 3). Thus, if all our numbers are primes, then one of them, hence the least, must be equal to 3 and we have p = 3, p+IO = 13, p+20 = 23. Therefore there exists only one arithmetic progression of difference 10 consisting of three primes, namely 3, 13, 23. We show easily that there is no arithmetic sequence of difference 10 consisting of four (or more) primes since ifp, p+ 10, p+20, and p+30 were primes, then, as we showed, we would have p = 3, while p+30 = 33 = 3 · 11 is not a prime. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that there exist infinitely many primes p such that p + lOis also a prime, for instance 7 and 17, 13 and 23, 19 and 29, 31 and 41, 37 and 47, 61 and 71, 73 and 83, 79 and 89. 71. There are no such progressions since one of the numbers p,p+l00, and p+200 must be divisible by 3, and if these numbers are primes, then p = 3. But in this case p + 200 = 203 = 7 · 29 is composite. REMARK. In a similar way we show that there are no progressions with difference 1000 formed of three or more primes since 1003 = 17 · 53 is com- posite. On the other hand, from a conjecture of A. Schinzel ([22]) it follows that there are infinitely many primes p such that p+ 1000 is also a prime, such as 13 and 1013, 19 and 1019, 31 and 1031, 61 and 1061, 97 and 1097, 103 and 1103, 1039 and 2039. 72*. If the difference of our progression were odd, then every second term of our progression would be even, which is impossible if our progression is to be formed of ten primes. Thus, the difference must be even. If the first term were equal 2, then the next term would be even, and hence composite. Therefore the first term of our progression is an odd prime, and it follows that all terms must be odd primes. We shall use the following theorem due essentially to M. Cantor: If 11 terms of an arithmetic progression are odd SOLUTIONS 47 primes, then the difference of the progression is divisible by every prime < n (see, for instance, [37, p. 121, theorem 5]). It follows, for n = 10, that the difference of our progression must be divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, hence by 210. We shall try first to find an arithmetic progression with the difference 210 formed of 10 primes. Since the number 210 (the difference of our progression) is divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7, the first term cannot be equal to any of these primes. It cannot be equal to 11 since in this case the second term would be 221 = 13 . 17. Thus the first term of the progression is > 11, and none of the terms is divisible by 11. The remainder of 210 upon division by 11 equals 1. If the first term would give the remainder > 1 upon dividing by 11, then with every next term this remainder would increase by 1, and one of the terms of the sequence would be divisible by 11, which is impossible. Therefore the first term of the sequence must give the remainder 1 upon dividing by 11, and being odd, it must be of the form 22k+ 1, where k is a positive integer. The successive primes of this form are 23,67,89,199, .... The first term cannot be 23 since then the sixth term would be 1073 = 29 . 37. If the first term were 67, then the fourth term would be 697 = 17·41. If the first term were 87, then the second term would be 229 = 13 . 23. If, however, the first term is 199, then we obtain a progression of ten successive primes 199,409,619,829,1039,1249,1459,1669,1879,2089. Thus we found a progression with difference 210 formed of ten primes. Suppose now that we have an increasing arithmetic progression formed of ten primes, with the difference r other that 210. Then r must be divisible by 210 (by the theorem of Cantor) and different from 210, hence r ;:, 420. In this case, however, the second term of our progression would exceed 420, hence it would exceed the second term 409 of the progression which we found, and obviously, the next terms would also exceed the terms of the progression which we found. Thus, the progression with first term 199 and difference 210 is the ten-term increasing progression formed of primes with the least possible last term. REMARK. The longest increasing arithmetic progression formed of primes known up to date is the progression of thirteen terms with the first term 4943 and difference 60060 found by W. N. Seredinsky from Moscow. From a conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes it follows that there exist 48 50 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY infinitely many progressions with difference 30030 formed of thirteen primes (see [22, p. 191, C},4])' However, no such progression has been found as yet. 73. F or instance, the progression 30k + 7 (k = 1, 2, 3, ... ) has the required property. Indeed, if we had 30k+7 = p+q, then in view of the fact that 30k + 7 is odd, one of the numbers p and q would be even, and equal to 2 as a prime. Suppose q = 2; then p = 30k+5 = 5(6k+I) which is impossible if p is to be a prime. If 30k+ 7 = p-q, where p and q are primes, then we would have q = 2 and p = 30k+9 = 3(IOk+3) which is also impossible. REMARK. One can prove (but the proof is difficult) that there exist in- finitely many even numbers which can be represented both as sums and as differences of two primes. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel con- cerning primes it follows that there exist infinitely many odd numbers which are both sums and differences of two primes. See SierpiIiski [34]. IV. PRIME AND COMPOSITE NUMBERS 74. It suffices to take p = 3, q = 5. If n is even and> 6, then we have n-l~ 6, and p < q < n-I. The numbers n-p = n-3 and n-q = n-5 as consecutive odd numbers are relatively prime. 75. There is only one such prime, namely 5. In fact, suppose that the prime r can be represented both as a sum and as a difference of two primes. We must have obviously r > 2, hence r is an odd prime. Being both a sum and a differe~ce of two primes, one of them must be even, hence equal 2. Thus we must have r = p+2 = q-2, where p and q are primes. In this case, however, p, r = p+2, and q = r+2 would be three consecutive odd primes, and there is only one such a triplet: 3, 5, and 7 (since out of every three consecutive odd numbers one must be divisible by 3). We have there- fore r = 5 = 3+2 = 7-2. 76. n = 113, 139, 181; m = 20, 51, 62. 77. By the well-known Fermat theorem, every prime of the form 4k+l is a sum of squares of two positive integers (see, for instance, [37, p. 205, Theorem 9]). Thus, if p is a prime of the forn14k+ 1, then we have p = a 2+b 2, where a and b are positive integers (of course different since p is odd). Assume, for instance, a > b. Then p2 = (a2-b 2)2+(2ab)2, hence p is a hypotenuse of a rectangular triangle whose two other sides are a2-b 2 and 2ab. We SOLUTIONS 49 have, for example, 52 = 32+42,132 = 52+122,172 = 152 +82, 292 = 212+ +202 • 78. 132+1 = 72+112, 172+1 = 112+132, 232+1 = 132+192, 312+1 = 112+292. REMARK. The identity (5x+13)2+1 = (3x+7)2+(4x+l? shows that if p = 5x+13, q = 3x+7, and, = 4x+l are primes, thenp2+1 = q2+,2. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that there are infinitely many such systems of primes. 79. Note first thatifp, q,', 8, and t are primes and q2+q2 = ,2+82+t2, then each of the numbers p and q must be different from each of the numbers \" 8, and t. In fact, if we had, for instance, p = \" then we would also have q2 = 8 2+t2 which is impossible since this equation cannot have solution in primes q, 8, and t. Indeed, the numbers 8 and t could not be both odd nor could they be both even (since in this case we would have q = 2, which is impossible in view of the fact that the right-hand side is > 4). If we had 8 = 2, then the number 4 would be a difference of two squares of positive integers which is impossible. If p2 +q2 = ,2+ 8 2 + t 2, then it is not possible that all numbers p, q, \" 8, t are odd. If p is even, then p = 2, and the numbers q, , , 8, t are odd. Since the square of an odd number gives the remainder 1 upon dividing by 8, the left-hand side would give the remainder 5, and the right-hand side would give the remainder 3, which is impossible. If both p and q are odd, then the left-hand side gives the remainder 2 upon dividing by 8, while on the right-hand side one (and only one) of the numbers must be even, for instance , = 2. Then, however, the right-hand side would give the remainder 6 upon dividing by 8, which is impossible. 80*. We present the solution found by A. Schinzel. There is only one solution, namely p = q = 2, , = 3. To see that, we shall find all solutions of the equation p(p+l)+q(q+l) = n(n+l) where p and q are primes and n is a positive integer. Our equation yields p(p+l) = n(n+l)-q(q+l) = (n-q)(n+q+l), and we must have n > q. Since p is a prime, we have either pln-q or pln+q+l. If pln-q, then we have p::::;; n-q, which implies p(p+l) ::::;; (n-q)(n-q+l), and therefore n+q+l ::::;; n-q+l, which is impossible. Thus we have pln+q+ 1, which means that for some positive integer k n+q+l = kp, which implies p+l = k(n-q). (1) 50 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY If we had k = 1, then n+q+ 1 = p and p+ 1 = n-q, which gives p-q = n+ 1 and p+q = n+ I, which is impossible. Thus, k > 1. From (I) we easily obtain 2q = (n+q)-(n-q) = kp-l-(n-q) = k[k(n-q)-I]-I-(n-q) = (k+I)[(k-l)(n-q)-I]. Since k ~ 2, we have k+l ~ 3. The last equality, whose left-hand side has positive integer divisors I, 2, q, and 2q only, implies that either k+ 1 = q or k+l = 2q. If k+l = q, then (k-I)(n-q) = 3, hence (q-2)(n-q) = 3. This leads to either q-2 = I, n-q = 3, that is q = 3, n = 6, k = q-I = 2, and, in view of (1), P = 5, or else, q-2 = 3, n-q = I, which gives q = 5, n = 6, k = 4, and in view of (I), p = 3. On the other hand, if k+l = 2q, then (k-I)(n-k) = 2, hence 2(q-I)(n-q) = 2. This leads to q-I = 1 and n-q = 1, or q = 2, n = 3, and, in view of (I), p = 2. Thus, for positive integer~ n, we have the following solutions in primes p and q: I) p = q = 2, n = 3; 2) p = 5, q = 3, n = 6, and 3) p = 3, q = 5, n = 6. Only in the first solution all three numbers are primes. REMARK. If we denote by tn = !n(n+l) the nth triangular number, then we can express the above theorem as follows: the equation tp+t4 = tr has only one solution in prime numbers, namely p = q = 2, r = 3. 81*. Such numbers are, for instance, p = 127, q = 3697, r = 5527. It is easy to check (for instance, in the tables of prime numbers) that these numbers are primes, and that the numbers p(p+l), q(q+l), and r(r+l) form an arithmetic progression. We shall present a method of finding such numbers. From the identity n(n+l)+(4In+20)(41n+21) = 2(29n+14)(29n+15) it follows that for a positive integer n, the numbers n(n+I), (29n+14)(29n+15), and (41n+20)(41n+21) form an arithmetic progression. If for some positive integer n the numbers n, 29n+14, and 41n+20 were all primes, we would have found a solution. Thus, we ought to take consecutive odd primes for n and check whether the numbers 29n+14 and 41n+20 are primes. SOLUTIONS 51 The least such number is n = 127 which leads to the above solution. We cannot claim, however, that in this manner we obtain all triplets of primes with the required properties. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that there exist infinitely many primes n such that the numbers 29n+14 and 41n+20 are also primes. The above problem may be expressed as follows: find three triangular numbers with prime indices, which form an increasing arithmetic progression. 82. There is only one such positive integer, namely n = 4. In fact, for n = 1, the number n+3 = 4 is composite; for n = 2, the number n+ 7 = 9 is composite; for n = 3, the number n+l = 4 is composite; and for n > 4, all our numbers exceed 5, and at least one of them is divisible by 5. The last property follows from the fact that the numbers 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, and 15 give upon dividing by 5 the remainders 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, and 0, hence all possible remainders. Thus, the numbers n+l, n+3, n+7, n+9, n+13, and n+15 give also all possible remainders upon dividing by 5; therefore at least one of them is divisible by 5, and as > 5, is composite. On the other hand, for n = 4 we get the prime numbers 5,7,11,13,17, and 19. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning the prime numbers ([22]) it follows that there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that each of the numbers n+l, n+3, n+7, n+9, and n+13 is a prime. This is, for instance, the case where n = 4, 10, 100. See also Sierpinski [33, p. 319, P2]. 83. 2 = 14+1 4, 17 = 14+24,97 = 24+34, 257 = 14+44, 641 = 24+54. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that there exist infinitely many primes which can be represented as sums of two fourth powers on positive integers, and, generally, for every positive integers n there exist infinitely many primes of the form cfn +b2 I where a and b are positive integers. 84. Let Pk denote the kth prime, and for positive integer n, let Pkn be the largest prime ~ 6n+l. Since the numbers 6n+2 = 2(3n+l), 6n+3 = 3(2n+I), and 6n+4 = 2(3n+2) are composite, we have Pkn+1 ~ 6n+5, and Pkn+l-Pkn ~ (6n+5)+(6n+ I) = 4, hence the primes Pkn and Pkn+l are not twin primes. Since Pkn+l ;;;:: 6n+5, and n can be arbitrary, there are infinitely many such numbers Pkn and Pkn+l. Note, however, that in the 52 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY pair Pkn, Pkn+1 the number Pkn may be the larger of a pair of twin primes, and Pk +1 may be the smaller in another pair of twin primes. Thus, for n = 1, n , we get Pkn = 7, which is the larger in the pair 5, 7 of twin primes, and Pkn +l = 11, which is the smaller in the pair 11, 13. For n = 2, we get Pk = 13, n which is the larger in the pair 11, 13, while Pkn+l = 17, which is the smaller in the pair 17,19. For n = 17, we get Pkn = 103 = 6 '17+1, which is the larger in the pair 101, 103, while Pkn+l = 107, which is the smaller in the pair 107, 109. 85. By the theorem of Lejeune-Dirichlet on arithmetic progressions, there exist infinitely many primes in the progression 15k + 7 (k = I, 2, ... ). None of these numbers can belong to a pair of twin primes since (15k+7)+2 = 3(Sk+3), and (15k+7)-2 = 5(3k+1) are composite (since k > 0). 86. If for a positive integer n the number n 2_1 is a product of three different primes, then (in view of 22 -I = 3) we have n > 2. Next, in view of the identity n 2-1 = (n-l)(n+I), the number n must be even since otherwise the factors on the right-hand side would be even, and 2 2\\n 2-1. Moreover, the numbers n-l and n+ 1 (which are both > I since n° > 2) cannot be both composite since in this case n 2-1 could not be a product of three different primes. Thus, one of the numbers n-l and n+ 1 must be a prime, and the other one must be a product of two primes. For n = 4, we get n-l = 3, n+ 1 = 5, and this condition is not satisfied. Similarly, for n = 6, we get n-I = 5, n+l = 7; for n = 8, we have n-I = 7, n+l = 9 = 3 2• For n = 10, we have n-l = 3 2, and for n = 12 we have • ° n-l = 11, n+l = 13. For n = 14, we have n-l = 13, n+l = 15 = 3· 5. Thus, the least positive integer n for which n 2-1 is a product of three dif- ferent primes is n = 14, for which n 2-1 = 3 · 5 · 13. Since 16 2-1 = 3 · 5 ·17, we see that the next number which satisfies the required property is n = 16. Now, 18 2-1 = 17 '19, 20 2-1 = 19 ~21 = 3· 7 ·19, and the third such number is n = 20. Next, 222-1 = 3 · 7· 23, and the fourth of the . required numbers is n = 22. Continuing in this way we find easily the fifth such number to be n = 32, for which 32 2 -1 = 3 · 11 · 31. Thus, the first five integers n for which n 2-1 is a product of three different primes are 14, 16, 20, 22, and 32. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that there are infinitely many such numbers n. More generally, for every s > 1 there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that SOLUTIONS 53 n2-1 is a product of s different primes. Obviously, for s = 2 the numbers n-l and n+ 1 form then a pair of twin primes. 87. The five least positive integers n for which n2+ 1 is a product of three different primes are n = 13,17,21,23, and 27. We have 132+1 = 2·5·17, 172+1 = 2·5·29, 212+1 = 2·13· 17, 232+1 = 2·5·53. For n = 112, we have 1122+1 = 5·13 ·193. REMARK. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that for every s there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that n2+ 1 is a product of s different primes. 88*. Suppose that each of the numbers n, n+l, and n+2, where n > 7, has only one prime divisor. None of these numbers is divisible by 6, which implies that n must be of the form 6k+l, 6k+2 or 6k+3, where k is a positive integer. If n = 6k+l, then the number 6k+2, being even and having only one prime divisor, must be of the form 2m ; now, since n > 7 which implies 6k+2 = n+l > 8, the number m must be > 3. The number n+2 = 6k+3 is divisible by 3, and if it has only one prime divisor, it must be of the form 3'. Since 6k+3 = n+3 > 9, the number s must be > 2. Moreover, we have 3'-2\"' = I; this equation, however, has only two integer solutions, namely s = m = I and s = 2, m = 3 (see Problem 185). If n = 6k+2, then n = 2\"' and n+1 = 6k+3 = 3' where m > 2 (since n > 6). We get 3s_2m = I, which is impossible for m > 3. Finally, if n = 6k+3, then n = 3', n+1 = 2\"' and in view of n > 7 we get s ~ 2, m > 3, while the equation 2m - 3\" = 1 has only one integer solu- tion, namely m = 2, s = 1 (see Problem 184). Thus, the assumption that for integer n > 7 none of the numbers n, n+ 1, and n+2 has more than one prime divisor led to a contradiction. On the other hand, for n = 7 we have n+ I = 23, n+2 = 32, and each of the numbers n, n+l, and n+2 has only one prime divisor. 89. n = 33 (n = 3·11, n+1 = 2·17, n+2 = 5·7), n = 85 (n = 5'17, n+l = 2·43, n+2 = 3·29), n = 93 (n = 3·31, n+l = 2'47, n+2 = 5·19), n = 141 (n = 3'47, n+l = 2·71, n+2 = 11·13), n = 201 (n = 3·67, n+l = 2·101, n+2 = 7·29). There are no four consecutive positive integers such that each of them is a product of two different primes since out of each four consecutive numbers S4 lSO PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY one must be divisible by 4. An example of four consecutive positive integers such that each of them has exactly two different prime divisors are numbers 33 = 3'11, 34 = 2·17, 35 = 5·7, 36 = 22'32. REMARK. We cannot prove that there exist infinitely many positive in- tegers n such that each of the numbers n, n+ I, and n+2 is a p~oduct of two different primes; this follows from a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel con- cerning primes. See [22, p. 197, consequence C7]. 90. Suppose that there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that both nand n+ I have only one prime divisor. We can assume n > I, and since one of the numbers nand n+ 1 is even and the other odd, we must have for some odd prime p the relation pk_2m = ±I where k and mare positive integers. Thus we get pk = 2m±l. Since a Mersenne number> 1 cannot be equal to a power with exponent> 1 of any prime (see [37, p. 335, theorem 2]), in the case pk = 2m-I we must have k = I, and 2m-l = p is a Mersenne prime number. On the other hand, if pk = 2m+ I, then either k = I, in which case p = 2 m + I is either equal to 3 or (if m > 1) is a Fermat prime, or else we have k > 1 in which case we get 2 m = pk_1 = (p-I) (pk-l+pk-2+ ... +1). Since the left-hand side is even, the number k must be even; thus k = 2/, where 1 is a positive integer, and we have 2m = (pi-I) (p'+I). Therefore the numbers pl-I and p' + 1 are powers of 2 which differ by 2, which implies that pl_1 = 2, pl+1 = 4, hence pi = 3, and p = 3, 2 m = 2·4 = 8, and m = 3, which yields 3 2 = 23 + I. We proved, therefore that if for n > 8 the numbers nand n+ 1 have one prime divisor each, then either n is a Mersenne prime or n+ I is a Fermat prime. Conversely, if Mm = 2m-I is a Mersenne prime, then the numbers Mm and Mm+1 = 2 m have one prime divisor each. If Fk = 22k+l is a Fermat prime, then each of the numbers Fk-I = 22k ~nd Fk has one prime divisor each, which completes the proof of our theorem. See [26, p. 209]. REMARK. Up to date we know only 29 positive integers n such that n and n+ 1 have one prime divisor each. The least five are n = 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and the largest of them is n = 211213_1. 91. We have 22_1 = 3, 24-1 = 3·5 and 22k_1 = (2k_l) (2k+I). If for n = 2k > 4 the number 22k-l were equal to the product of two primes, ~hen the numbers 2k -1 and 2k + 1 would have to be primes. Since these SOLUTIONS ss numbers are consecutive odd numbers, we must have 2k-l ~ 5, hence k ~ 2. In view of k > 1, we must have k = 2, contrary to the assumption that k > 2. Therefore the numbers 2n-l are, for n even and > 4, equal to the product of at least three natural numbers. For odd n, we have 23-1 = 7, 25-1 = 31, 27-1 :J:: 127, 2 9-1 = 7'73, 211-1 = 23·89, 213-1 = 8191, which is a prime, 215_1 = 7·31·151, the numbers 217_1 and 2 19_1 are primes, and 221_1 = 7 ·127· 337, while 223_1 is already > 10 6• Thus, all positive integers of the form 2n-l which are < 10 6 and which are equal to the product of two primes are 24-1 = 3·5, 2 9-1 =-7·73 and 211_1 = 23·89. REMARK. The Mersenne numbers exceeding million which are known to be the product of two different primes are numbers M,. = 2n-l for n = 23, 37, 49, 67, and 101. We do not know whether there are infinitely many such numbers. 92. Since k ~ 3, we have PIP2 ... Pk ~ PIP2P3 = 2· 3 · 5 > 6, and in view' of Problem 47, we have PIP2 ... Pk = a+b where a and bare> 1 and rel- atively prime, hence also prime with respect to the product PIP2 ... Pk. Since a and bare> 1, they have different prime divisors; let pia, qlb, and suppose that P < q. Since (P,PIP2 .•• Pk) = 1, we have p ~ Pk+l, and in view of q > p, also q ~ Pk+2' Therefore p+q ~ a+b and we have Pk+l +Pk+2 ~ ~ PIP2 ... Pk, which was to be proved. 93. Let m denote an arbitrary integer > 3, and let n be an integer such, that n > PIP2 ... Pm. Then there exists an integer k ~ m ~ 4 such that PIP2 ... p\" ~ n < PIP2 ...

Pm we have qnln < 11m which shows that the ratio qnln tends to zero as n tends to infinity, which was to be shown. 94. Let n be an integer > 4. We have either n = 2k where k > 2 or S6 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY n = 2k+l where k > 1. If n = 2k, where k > 2, then by Chebyshev's theorem there exists a prime p such that k < p < 2k, and we have p > 2 since p > k > 2. Thus n = 2k < 2p < 4k = 2n, and in view of p > 2, the number 2p is a product of two different primes, and n < 2p < 2n. If n = 2k+ 1 where k ~ 2, then by Chebyshev's theorem there exists a prime p such that k < P < 2k, hence 3 ~ k+l ~p < 2k and n ~ 2k+l < 2k+ +2 ~ 2p < 4k < 4k+2 = 2n, and again we have n < 2p < 2n, while 2p is a product of two different primes. Let now n be an integer > 15. If n = 16, 17, ... , 29, then the number 30 = 2· 3· 5 lies between nand 2n. We can therefore assume that n ~ 30. We have then n = 6k+r, where k is an integer ~ 5, and r is the remainder obtained from dividing n by 6, i.e. r satisfies the inequality 0 ~ r ~ 5. By Chebyshev's theorem, there exists a prime p such that k < p < 2k, hence p > 5 and k+l ~p < 2k. It follows that n = 6k+r < 6(k+l) ~ 2·3·p < 12k ~ 2n, hence n < 2· 3·p < 2n, and 2· 3·p is a product of three dif- ferent primes. 95. Let Pk denote the kth consecutive prime, and let s be an arbitrary in- teger > 1. Let n > PIP2 ... PfP We shall show that between nand 2n there exi~ts at least one positive integer which is a product of s different primes. Let n = kpIP2 ... PS-l +r, where r is the remainder of dividing n by PIP2 ... Ps-l, hence, in view of n > PIP2 ... Ps, we have k > Ps and 0 ~ r < PIP2 ... Ps-l' By the Chebyshev theorem, there exists a prime P such that k < p < 2k, hence P > Ps and k+ 1 ~ p < 2k. It follows that n = PIP2 ... pS_lk+r < PIP2 ... PS-l(k+ 1) ~ P1P2 ... Ps-JP < 2PIP2 ... Ps-l k ~ 2n, hence n < PIP2 ... Ps-IP < 2n. The number PIP2 ... PS-IP is, in view of P > Ps, equal to the product of s different primes. REMARK. An elementary proof of the Chebyshev theorem is given in SierpiIiski [37, p. 137, theorem 8]. 96. We easily check that the nth term of our sequence equals to 1(10\"-7). We have 10 2 = 15 = -2 (mod 17), hence 10 8 = 16 == -1 (mod 17). Thus 10 9 = -10 = 7 (mod 17), and since 10 16 = 1 (mod 17), we get 10 16k+ 9 == 7 (mod 17) for k = 0, 1, 2, .... Thus 1711(1 016k+9 - 7), and since the num- bers i(1016k+ 9-7) for k = 0,1,2, ... are ~ 1(10 9-7) > 17, they are all composite. As it was checked by A. M~kowski in the tables of primes, the numbers l(10\"-7) are primes for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. The least composite number of this form is therefore 1(10 9-7) = 333333331. SOLUTIONS 57 The problem arises whether there are other composite numbers of the considered form, besides those which we found. We have 10 2 = 5 (mod 19), hence 10 4 = 25 == 6 (mod 19) and 10 12 = 6 3 = 7 (mod 19), and since 10 ISk = 1 (mod 19), we get 1911(101sk+12-7) for k = 0, 1, 2, .... Thus, for in- stance, the number 1(10 12-7) is composite. We do not know, however, whether there are other primes of this form besides the ones which were given above, and if so, whether there are infi~itely many of them. 97. The number n = 5, since 14+24 = 17, 24+34 = 97, 3 4+44 = 337, and 44+54 = 881 are primes, while 5 4+64 = 1921 = 17 ·113. 98. All numbers of the form 10 6k+ 4+3, where k = 0, 1, 2, ... , are com- posite since they are divisible by 7. In fact, we have 10 4 = 4 (mod 7), and by the Fermat theorem, 10 6 = 1 (mod 7). Thus, for integer k we have 10 6k+4+3 = 10 4+3 = 4+3 = 0 (mod 7). REMARK. We do not know whether among numbers of the form 10\"+3 for n = 1, 2, ... there exist infinitely many primes. Such numbers are prime for n = 1 and n = 2, but are composite for n' 3 and n = 4 (since 1003 = 17·59 and 7110 4+3). 99. For integer n we have the identity (1) Since 512 2+112 4n+ 2+1 and for integer n > 1 we have 22n+l_2n+l+1 = 2~+1(2~-1)+1 ~ 2 3.3+1 = 25, it follows that at least one of the factors on the right-hand side is divisible by 5, and (for n > 1) upon division by 5 it gives the ratio exceeding one. Therefore ! (24m +2 + 1) is, fot n = 1, 2, ... , equal to the product of two integers > 1, hence is composite .. 100. Let m be an arbitrary integer> 1, and let n = m!+k, where k = 2, 3, ... , m. We have k < m!+k and klm!+k, hence. 2k-l < 2m!+k_l and 2k-112mt+k-l. Thus the numbers 2m!+k-l are ~omposite for k = 2, 3, ... ... , m, hence for m-l consecutive terms of the sequence 2\"-1. 101. In order to obtain a prime from number 200, one hasto change its last digit into an odd number. We have, ho~ever, 31201, 71203, 51205, 31207, and 111209. Thus, by changing only one digit~ one cannot obtain a prime from number 200. REMARK. We do not know whether, by changing two digits, one can obtain a prime out of every number. On the other hand, it is easy to prove S8 250 PROBLEMS N NUMBER THEORY that there exist infinitely many positive integers n such that no change of its (decimal) digit would result in a prime. For instance, for n = 2310k-210 (where k = I, 2, ... ) we would have to change its last digit (that is, 0), (ob- viously, to one of the numbers 1, 3, 7 or 9) while it is easy to see that 11 In + 1, 3In+3, 71n+7 and 3In+9. 102. Suppose that the theorem T is true. Theorem Tl is obviously true for n = 2 and n = 3. Assume that n is an integer > 3. If n is even, that is, n = 2k, then, in view of n > 3, we have k > 1 and by theorem T there exists a prime p such that k < p < 2k, hence p < n < 2p, and p divides only one factor in the product n! = 1 ... n. If n = 2k+l where (in view of n > 1), k is an integer > 1, then by theorem T there exists a prime p such that k < p < 2k < n, hence k+ 1 ~ p which implies 2k+ 1 < 2p and p < n < 2p. As before, p enters in the expansion of n! into primes with exponent 1. We showed, therefore, that T implies TI • Suppose now that Tl holds, and let n denote an integer> 1. By theorem T I , there exists a prime p which enters in the expansion of (2n)! into primes with the exponent 1. We have, therefore p ~ 2n < 2p (since if we had 2p ~ 2n, then in the product (2n)! = 1·2· ... · (2n-l)2n we would have factors p and 2p, and p would enter with the exponent ~ 2 contrary to theorem T]). We have, therefore, n < p < 2n (since, in view ofn > 1, the equationp = 2n is impossible for primep). Thus, theorem T follows from theorem T1 , which shows that T and Tl are equivalent. 103. In the expansion of II! into primes, the primes 7 and 11 enter ob- viously with exponents 1. We may, therefore, assume that n > 11, which implies in the case n = 2k, as well as in the case n = 2k+l, that k > 5. By the theorem we are going to use, there exist two primes p, and q > p such that k < p < q < 2k. We obtain therefore at least p < q < n, and P ~ k+ + 1, which implies 2q > 2p > n. Thus, both primes p and q enter in the ex- pansion of n! with exponent 1. As regards the number 10!, only the prime 7 enters Its expansion with exponent 1. 104. Let n be a given positive integer. By the theorem of Lejeune-Dirichlet on arithmetic progressions, there exists a prime of the form p = 6\"k+ +2.3 211 - 1_1, where k is a positive integer. It follows (in view of 2 11 - 1 ~ n for positive integer n), that 3 111p+ 1, and the number p+ 1 has more than n different positive integer divisors (for instance, 1, 3, 3 2, ••• , 3 11 ). On the other hand, by Euler's theorem we have 39'(211) = 1 (mod 2 ,), hence 2-\"132: a - 1_1, SOLunONS S9 which implies that 2N/p_1 and the number p-I has more than n different positive integer divisors (for instance, 1,2,22, ••• ,2\"). lOS. P= 131. We have herep-I =2·5·13andp+1 =2 2 .3.11. 106*. Let n be a given positive integer, and let Pi denote the ith prime. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there exists a positive integer b such that b == I (mod P1PZ ... Pn), b == -I (mod Pn+1Pn+2 ... pz,,) and b == -2 (modpzn+1P2,,+z ... P3n)' We have (b,PIPZ ... P3n) = I, and by the theorem of Dirichlet, there exists a positive integer k such that the number P = PIPZ ... P3nk+b is a prime. We shall have then P1PZ ... Pnlp-I, Pn+1Pn+Z ... Pznlp+ I, and PZn+1P2n+2 ... hnlp+2, hence each of the numbers p-I, p+l, and p+2 has at least n different prime divisors: 107. Let Pt denote the kth prime. For positive integer n, s and m, write aJ = P(j-ljll+lPej-ljll+2 ... pjn for j = 1,2, ... , m. We have (a\" aJ) = I for I ~ i <j ~ m. and by the Chinese remainder theorem, there exists a positive integer x such that x== -j(modaj) for j= 1,2 •... ,m. Thus we have ajlx+j for j = 1,2, ... , m, which implies that each of the numbers x+j U= 1,2, ... , m) has at least m different prime divisors, each of these divisors appearing in at least sth power. Therefore the sequence x+ I, x+ 2, ... , x+m satisfies the required conditions. 108. If for a positive integer m the number m! is divisible by a prime P, then P must divide at least one of the factors in the product m! = 1·2· .... m, hence we must have P ~ m. Thus, if m! is divisible by an integer n > m, then n must be composite. It follows that if for some integer n > I the num- ber (n-l)! were divisible by n or n+2, then n or n+2 would be composite. Thus. the condition is necessary. Suppose now that for an odd n > I the number (n-I)! is not divisible by nor n+2. We shall show that the numbers nand n+2 are primes. It suffices to assume that n ~ 7 since forn = 3 and n = 5 the numbers nand n+2 are primes. If n were composite, we would have n = ab, where a and bare positive integers < n, hence a ~ n-l and b ~ n-1. Thus a and b would appear as factors in the product (n-l)! = 1·2· ... ·(n-l). In case a,# b, 60 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY we would have n = abICn-I)!, contrary to the assumption. In case a = b, we would have n = a 2, and since n is odd and > 1, a ~ 3, which implies n = a 2 ~ 3a > 2a, hence 2a ~ n -1. Thus, a and 2a are different factors in the product (n-I)! = 1·2· ... ·(n-1), hence n = a21(n-1)! contrary to the assumption. Thus, n is a prime. If the number n+2 were composite, we would have n+2 = ab, where a and b are integers > 1. Since n is odd, the numbers a and b are odd, and therefore ~ 3. Next, since n ~ 7, we have a ~ 1(n+2) ~ len-I), and we have 2a ~ n-1. In a similar way we show that 2b ~ n-I. If a and bare different, then they appear as different factors in the product 1· 2· ... ·(n-I) = (n-I)!, which implies that n+2 = abl(n-I)!, contrary to the assumption. If a = b, then a and 2b are different factors in the product (n-I)!, hence n+212abl(n-I)!, again contrary to the assumption. The condition of the theorem is therefore sufficient. 109. Let m be a given positive integer. We haye' (10m, 10m-I) = 1 and, by the theorem on arithmetic progression, there exists a positive integer k such that p = 10 mk+ 10m-l is a prime. Obviously, the last m-l digits of this number are equal to 9, which implies that the sum of all digits of this number is m. REMARK. A. M~kowski noticed that the theorem remains valid for an arbitrary scale of notation g > I; for the proof, it suffices to replace in the above proof the number 10 by g. See Sierpinski [31], and Erdos [8]. We do not know if the sum of digits of a prime tends to infinity as the prime increases. 110. Let m be a given positive integer. Since (10m+1 , 1) = 1, by the theorem on arithmetic progression, there exists a positive integer k such that p = lom+lk+l is a prime. The last m di.gits of the number p are, ob- viously, m zeros and one. Thus, the prime p in decimal system has at least m digits equal to zero, which was to be proved. REMARK. We do not know whether for every positive integer m there exists a prime, which in decimal system has exactly m zeros. For m = 1, the least such prime is 101; for m = 2, it is 1009. 111. If p is a prime, then the sum of all positive integer divisors of p4 equals l+p+p2+p3+p4. If 1+p+p2+p3+p4 = n'Z where n is a positive in- teger, then we have obviously (2p2+p)2 < (2n)2 < (2p2+p +2)2, and it SOLUTIONS 61 follows that we must have (2n)2 = (2p2+p +l)2. Thus, 4n2 = 4p4+ +4p3+5p2+2p+l, and since 4n2 = 4(p4+p3+p2+p +l), we have p2_2p_ -3 = 0, which implies p13, hence p = 3. If fact, for p = 3 we obtain 1 +3+ +3 2+3 3+3 4 = 112. Thus, there exists only one prime p, namely p = 3, satisfying the conditions of problem. 112. A prime number p has only two positive integer divisors, namely 1 and p. Thus, if the sum of all positive integer divisors of a prime p is equal to the sth power of a positive integer n, then I +p = nS , which implies p = nS-l = (n-I) (n S - 1+nS - 2+ ... +1). We have n > 1, and for s ~ 2 the first factor of the product on the right- hand side is smaller than the second. We obtain therefore a representation of a prime p into a product of two positive integer factors, the first of which is smaller than the second. It follows that the first factor must be equal to 1, hence n-l = 1, or n = 2, and p = 2S-1. Thus, for every integer s ~ 2 there exists at most one prime satisfying the conditions of the problem, and such a prime exists if and only if the number 2\" -1 is a prime. For s = 2, we obtain the number 3; for s = 3, the number 7; for s = 5, the number 31; and for s = 7, the number 127. For s = 4,6,8, and 10, there are no such primes since the numbers 24-1 = 3.5,26-1 = 32 .7,28-1 = 3·5·17 and 210 -1 = 3·11·31 are composite. 113. For primes p > 5, we have which implies p-l 2<--<p-l 2 (P_l)2 = 2 P 2 1 (P-l)I(P-l)!. If for a prime p > 5 and some positive integer m we had then we would have and dividing both sides by p-l we would get p_llp .. -l+ p .. -2+ ... +p+1. . (1) (2) 62 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY However, p-llpk-l, hence pk == 1 (modp-l) for k = 0, 1,2, ... , which implies that pm-l+pm-2+ ... +p+l == m (modp-I), and in view of (2), we findp-llm, hence m ~ p-l. We get, therefore, pm ~ p,-1 > (p_l),-l > (P-I)!, hence pm > (p-l)! + 1, contrary to (I). 114. By the Liouville theorem (see Problem 113), if p is a prime> 5, then we cannot have (P-I)! + 1 = pm for positive integer m. The odd number (P-1)!+1 > 1 has therefore an odd prime divisor q #: p, and from ql(P-l)!+1 it follows that q > p-l, hence (in view of q #: p), we have q > p. Since p can be arbitrarily large, there exist infinitely many primes q such that for some p < q we have ql(P-l)!+ 1, which was to be proved. 115* . We shall give the proof of A. Schinzel. Let a denote an arbitrary positive integer, and let k be an integer :F 1. Further, put k-l = 2 sh, where 2& is the highest power of 2 which divides k-l, and h is an odd number, positive or negative. Choose a positive integer m so 'that 2 2m > a-k, and let I denote an integer such that I ~ s, and I ~ m. If the number 2 2' +k ~ 2 2m + +k > a were composite, we would have a composite number of the desired form, and > Q. Suppose then that the number p = 221 +k is a prime. In view of I ~ sand k-l = 2'h we get p-l = 211+k_1 = 2 sh1, where hI is odd and > O. By the Euler theorem we have 2~hl) = 1 (mod hI), hence also (in view of p-I = 2&ht) 2S -HP(hl) == 2 S (mod p-l). Since I ~ s, we get 21+9'(hl) = 2' (modp-l). By the Fermat theorem we obtain 2 2/+q>(h1 ) +k == 221 +k == 0 (mod p), and, in view of 21 + CP(hl) > 2' we get Thus, the number 2 21+q>(h1 ) +k is composite and > a since p = 211 +k ~ 2 2m + +k > a, which completes the proof. This proof fails for k = 1 since we do not know if there exist infinitely many composite Fermat numbers. Let us note that the weaker version of the theorem, asserting that for every integer k there exists at least one integer n such that 2 2n +k is composite, has been obtained in 1943 by J. Reiner as a special case of a rather complicated theorem; see [16]. To obtain this weaker version from our theorem it suffices SOLUTIONS 63 to note that (for k = 1) the number 225+1 is composite, namely divisible by 641. 116. For instance, all numbers k = 6t-l, where t = 1,2, ... , are ofthis form since for every positive integer n the number 22/1 gives the remainder 1 upon dividing by 3, hence the number 22/1 +k = 22/1_ 1 +6t is divisible by 3 and > 3, thus composite. 117. (a) For positive integer n, the number 22/1_1 is divisible by 3, hence the number 22/1+1_2 = 2(22/1_1) is divisible by 6, and we have 22/1+1 = 6k+ +2 where k is a positive integer. It follows that 222/1+1 +3 = (26)\",22+3 == 22+3 == 0 (mod 7), and 7122211+1+3 for n = 1,2, .... Since 222/1+1+3 ~222 +3> 7, the numbers of the form 22211+1 +3 are composite for n = 1, 2, .... (b) for positive integer n, we have 24/1_1 = 16/1-1 == 0 (mod 5), which implies that 1012411+1-2. Therefore 2411+1 = lOk+2 where k is a positive integer and 22411+1 + 7 == (210)\" . 22 + 7 == 22 + 7 == 0 (mod 11). Thus we have 11122411+1 + 7, and since 22411+1+7 ~ 225 + 7 > 11, the numbers of the form 22411+1 + 7 are all composite for n = I, 2, .... (c) For positive integer n, we have 26n == (26)( == 1 (mod 7), which implies 712611-1 and 28126/1+2_22. Thus, 26/1+2 = 28k+4, where k is a positive integer. It follows that 226n+2 = (228)\",24 == 16 (mod 29), that is, 291226n+2 +13, and since 226n+2 + 13 ~ 228 + 13 > 29, the numbers of the form 226n+2 + 13 are composite for n = 1,2, .... (d) For positive integer n, we have (210)/1 == 1 (mod 11), which implies that 22121011+1_2 and 210/1+1 = 22k+2, where k is a positive integer. It follows that 221011+1 = (222)\". t~ == 4 (mod 23), and 2312210/1+1+19. Since 221011+1 + 19 > 23 for all n = 1,2, ... , the numbers 221011+1+19 are all com- posite. (e) For positive integer n, we have 26/1= (23l/l == (-ll/l == 1 (mod 9), hence 9126/1-1, and 36126/1+2_22, which implies that 26/1+2 = 36k+4 for a positive integer k. It follows that 22611+2 = (236)\" • 16 == (mod 37), hence 37122611+2 +21, and since 226n+2+21 > 37, for n = 1,2, ... , the numbers 226n+2 +21 are composite for n = 1,2, .... 64 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY REMARK. We know of no integer k such that we could prove that among the numbers 2 2n +k (n = 1, 2, ... ) there exist infinitely many primes. 118*. As we know, the numbers Fn = 22~+1 are primes for n = 0, 1, 2, 3,4, while the number Fs =,641p, where p is a prime> 2 16+1 = F4 • We have also (p, 2 32 _1) = 1 since plFs implies (p, Fs-2) = 1. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there exist infinitely many positive integers k satisfying the congruences k = 1 (mod (232-1)641) and k = -1 (modp). (1) We shall show that if k is an integer> p, satisfying congruences (1), then the numbers k · 2n+ 1 (n = 1, 2, ... ) are all composite. The number n can be represented in the form n = 2 m(2t+l), where m and t are integers ~ o. Suppose first that m is one of the numbers 0,.1, 2, 3, or 4. In view of (1) we shall have (2) and since for m = 0, 1,2,3,4 we have FmI2 32-1 and FmI22\"'(2~+1), we obtain, in view of (2), that Fm Ik · 2 n + 1. Since k · 2'''+1 > p > F4 (b~cause k > p), the number k · 2n+ I' is composite. If m = 5, then by (1) we get k· 2 n+l = 2 2s (2t+l)+I(mod 641) and since 641IFsI2 2s(2t+l)+1 we get 6411k· 2 n+l and the number k· 2\"+1 > p > 641 is composite. It remains to consider the case m ~ 6. In this case we have 2 61n, hence n = 26h where h is a positive ,integer, and in view of (1) we have k · 2 n+ 1 = _226h+ 1 (mod p); since pl2 2S + 112 26 -11226h-l, we obtain plk · 2\"+ 1. In view of the fact that k · 2 n + I, > k > p, the number k · 2\"+1 is composite. Thus, the numbers k· 2\"+1 are composite for n = 1, 2, 3, ... , which was to be proved. (See [30].) . REMARK. We do not know the smallest number k for which all numbers k · 2 n+ 1 (n = 1, 2, ... ) are composite. 119*. Let us first note that in the proof of theorem in Problem 118* we could add to congruences (1) the congruence k = 1 (mod 2), and this would result in the following theorem T: There exist infinitely many odd numbers k > p such that each of the numbers k· 2' + 1 (I = 1, 2, ... ) is divisible by at least one of the six primes (3) SOLUTIONS 65 (where p > F4)' Let us denote by Q the product of the six numbers (3). Since these numbers are odd, we have 2~Q) == 1 (mod Q) and consequently, 2~Q) == 1 (mod q), where q denotes any of the numbers (3). Let n be an arbitrary positive integer. By theorem T (for I = n(lP(Q)-I)), the number k . 2/1(tp(QJ-l) + 1 is divisible by at least one of the numbers (3), say by q. We shall have therefore k· 2\"(tp(Q)-1) +1 == 0 (mod q) hence, mUltiplying by 2/1 we obtain k· 2/1tp(QJ+2/1 == 0 (mod q), and since 2~Q) == 1 (mod q) and consequently, 2/1~Q) == 1 (mod q), we get k+2\" == 0 (mod q); since k > p, we 'get k > q and k+2/1 > q; thus, the number k+2/1 is composite, and we showed that there exist infinitely many odd numbers k such that all numbers 2'+k, n = 1,2, ... , are composite. 120. Let k = 2m where m is a positive integer, and let m ~ 2'h where s is an integer ~ 0, and h is odd. We have k. 22/1+ 1 = 22'(2/1-'+hJ+l, and for n > s the number 2/1-'+h is an odd positive integer. Thus we get 22' + 11k· 22:+1, and since n > s, we have k· 22\" + 1 > 22'+ 1 and the numbers k· 22/1+1 are composite for n > s (they are divisible by 22'+1). In particular, if k is a power of 2 with an odd exponent, then all numbers k· 221\\+1 for n = 1,2, ... are divisible by 3. 121. For k = 1, n = 5 since the numbers 22\" + 1 are prime for n = 1, 2, 3, 4 while 6411225+1 and 225+1 is composite. For k = 2, n = 1 since 312· 22+L For k = 3, n = 2 since the number 3.22+1 is prime, while 713.222+1 =49. For k = 4, n = 2 since 4.2 2 +1 = 17 isa prime, while 514.222+1. . For k = 5, n = 1 since 315.22+1. For k = 6, n = 1 since 516.22 +1. For k = 7, n = 3 since 7.2 2+1 = 29 and 7.222+1 = 113 are primes, while 1117 . 223 + 1. For k = 8, n = 1 since 318.22+1. For k = 9, n = 2 since 9.22+1 = 37 is prime, while 519.222 +1. For k = 10, n = 2 since 10.22+1 = 41 is a prime, while 7110.222+1. 122. It follows from the solution of Problem 121 that the numbers k = 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, and 10 do not satisfy the requirements. The number 6 does not satisfy the requirement either since 6· 222 + 1 = 97 is a prime. 66 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY On the other hand, the numbers 2· 222 + 1, 5· 222 + 1, and 8· 22\" + 1 are all composite for n = 1, 2, ... since they are divisible by 3 and exceed 3. REMARK. If k = 3t+ 2, where t = 0, 1, 2, ... , then the numbers k · 22\"+1 (n = 1, 2, ... ) are all divisible by 3 and composite. 123. The numbers 1(2 2 \"+1 +2211 + 1) are positive integers for n = 1, 2, .... lfn is even, then 2\" = 1 (mod 3), hence 211 = 3k+ 1 for some positive integer k, and 2211 = (23)k • 2 = 8 k • 2 == 2 (mod 7), which implies that 2211+1 = (22\")2 == 4 (mod 7). It follows that 2 211+1 +2211 +1 = 4+2+1 = 0 (mod 7). If 11 is odd, then 211 = 2 (mod 3), hence 211 = 3k+2 where k is an integer ~ o. It follows that 2211 = 23 k+2 = 8 k • 4 == 4 (mod 7), while 2 2J1 +1 = (2J II)2 = 42 = 2 (mod 7). Thus, 2 2J1 +1 +22J1 +1 = 2+4+1 == 0 (mod 7). Consequently, the numbers 1(2 2\"+ 1 + 2 2 \" + 1) are divisible by 7 for positive integer n, .and since for n > 1 they are ~ 1(2 23 + 222 + 1) = 91 > 7, they are composite for n = 2, 3, .... Compare with the theorem of Michael Stiffel from the XVllth century; see Elemente der Mathematik, 18 (1963), p. 18. 124. For instance, all numbers of our sequence for n of the form 28k+ 1 (k = 1, 2, 3, ... ) have the desired property. In fact, by the Fermat theorem, we have 2 28 == 1 (mod 29), which implies, for k = 1, 2, ... , that 22. 28k == 1 (mod 29), Thus, for n = 28k+ 1 (k = 1,2, ... ) we have (22n+l)2+2 2 = 25+4 = 0 (mod 29), which means that 291 (22n+ 1)2+22. For k = 1,2, ... we have obviously n = 28k+l ~ 29, which\" implies (22n+l)2+22 > 29. Thus, all numbers of the form (22J1+ 1)2+22 for n = 28k+ 1, k = 1, 2, ... , are composite. 125*. If a is odd and > 1, the numbers tin + 1, being even and > 1, are eomposite (for n = 1, 2, ... ); thus, we may assume that a is even. We 5 4\" 3 have 64112 2 + 1 , hence also 641142 + 1 and 641116 2 + 1 . Next, we easily check that 1712 22+1, 1714 2+1, 1716 23+1, 1718 22+1, 1711()23+1, 17112 23+1, 17114 23+1,1712023+1, ... ,1712223+1,1712423+1,1712622+1,1712823+1, 17130 2+ 1, 17132 22 + 1. For instance, to check that 17128 23 +1 we start from the congruence 28 = 11 (mod 17), which implies 282 = 121 = 2 (mod 17), which in tum yields 28 23 == 222 = -1 (mod 17), and, consequently, 17128 23+1. In view of these formulas, we obtain immediately for k = 0, 1, 2, ... SOLUTIONS 67 171 (34k+2)22 +1, 171 (34k + 4)2 + 1, 171 (34k+6t +1, 171(34k+8t+l, 171(34k+ 10)23 +1, 17/(34k+12)23 +1, 171(34k+14)23 +1, 171 (34k+20?3 +1, 17/(34k+22)23 + 1, 17/ (34k + 24)23 + 1 , 171 (34k+ 26)22 + 1, 171 (34k+28)2 3 +1, 171 (34k + 30)2+ 1, 171 (34k+32)Z2 +1. Using the fact that 51182+ 1 and 131342+ 1, we deduce that for every positive integer a ~ 100, except perhaps numbers SO, 52, 68, 84, and 86, there exists a positive integer n ~ 5 such that al\" + 1 is composite. On the other hand, 502+1 = 2501 = 41· 61, 51522+1,51682+1,25718426+1 and 131862+ 1. Thus, for every positive integer a ~ 100 there exists a positive integer n ~ 6 such that a2n + 1 is composite. REMARK. A. Schinzel proved that for every positive integer a such that 1 < a < 227 there exists a positive integer n such that aln + 1 is composite; see [20]. We do not know whether for every integer a > 1 there exists a positive integer n such that aln + 1 is composite; we cannot prove it, for instance, for the number a = 22194S• On the other hand, we can prove that for n = 221944 the number al+ 1 is composite, and we even know its least prime divisor, namely 5 . 221947+1; see Sierpinski [37, p. 349, Section 6]. 126. Each prime> 5 is obviously of the form 30k+r where k is an integer ~ 0, and r is one of the numbers 1,7, 11, 13, 17, 19,23 or 29. Since there exist infinitely many primes, for at least one of these eight values r there exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+r, where k is a positive integer. It is, therefore, sufficient to consider the following eight cases: (1) There exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+ 1. Let p be one of them, and let n = 7+19+p; this will be an odd composite number since n = 7+19+30k+l = 3(10k+9). Thus, the number n is a sum of three different primes (since p = 30k+ 1 is different from 7 and 19), and n is not a sum of two primes since then one of them would have to be even, hence equa12, and we would have n = 30k + 27 = q + 2, that is, q = 5(6k + 5), whlch is impossible. 68 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY (2) There exists infinitely many primes of the form 30k+ 7. Let p > 7 be one of these primes, and let n = 7 + 13 + p; n is odd and composite since n = 30k+27 = 3(IOk+9) and, in view of p ~ 37, n will be equal to a sum of three different primes. Since n-2 = 30k+25 = 5(6k+S), we see that n satisfies the required conditions. (3) There exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+l1. Letp > II be one of them, and let n = II + 13 + p; thus, n will be odd and equal to a sum of three different primes. Since n = 30k+35 == S(6k+7) and n-2 = 3(30k+l1), the number n satisfies the required conditions. (4) There exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+13. Let p be one of them, and let n = 3 + 11 + p; thus, n will be odd and will equal to the sum of three different primes. Since n = 3(IOk+9) and n-2 = 5(6k+5), the number n satisfies the required conditions. (5) There exist infinitely many primes of the form p = 30k+ 17. Let p be one of them, and put n = 3+7+p. Since n = 3(10k+9) and n-2 = 5(6k+5), the number n satisfies the required conditions. (6) There exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k + 19. Let p be one of them, and let n = 3+5+p. As before, we deduce that n satisfies the required conditions. (7) There exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+23~ Let p be one of them, and let n = 5+7+p. Since n = S(6k+7) and n--:-.2 = 3(10k+l1), the number n satisfies the required conditions. (8) Ther~ exist infinitely many primes of the form 30k+29. Let p be one of them, and let n = S+31+p. Since n = S(6k+13) and ~~2 = 3(lOk+21)\" the number n satisfies the required conditions. The proof is complete. See [28]. 127. If J(x) were a polynomial with integer coefficients such that J(I) = 2, /(2) = 3, /(3) = 5, then g(x) = f(x)-2 would be a polynomial with integer coefficients such thatg(l) = 0, and we would have g(x) = (x-l)h(x), where hex) is a polynomial with integer coefficients. Since /(3) = 5, we have g(3) = f(3)- 2 = 3, which gives 2h(3) = 3; this, however, is impossible since h(3) is an integer. Now let m be an integer> 1, and let () (x-I) (x-2) ... (x-m) gk x = --------x-k for k = 1, 2, ... , m. SOLUTIONS 69 Obviously, gk(X) is a polynomial with integer coefficients of the degree m-I , and such that gk(X) = 0 for every positive integer x ~ m different from k, while gk(k) will be an integer :F O. Let Jk(x) = gk (X)/gk (k) ; obviously, Jk(x) will be a polynomial of the order m-I with rational coefficients such that [k(X) = 0 for every positive integer x ~ m different from k, whileJk(k) = 1. Put f(x) = pJ/;(x)+p,}i(x)+···+Pm[m(X); clearly, this polynomial will satisfy the required conditions:f(x) has rational coefficients and f(k) = Pk for k = 1,2, ... , m. 128*. Proof due to J. Browkin. Let n be a given positive integer. For positive integer k ~ n, define by induction the positive integers tk as follows: let to = 1. Suppose that we have already defined for a positive integer k ~ n the number tk-1. According to the particular case of the theorem of Lejeune-Dirichlet, there exists a positive integer tk such that the number qk = (k-l)!(n-k)!tk+ 1 is a prime, and, in case k > I, it is greater than the number (k-2)!(n-k+I)!tk_1+1 (where we put O! = I). Thus, the numbers ql> q2, ... , qn will be primes, and q1 < q2 < ... < qn. Let n f(x) = 1+ L (-I);-j (x-l)(x-2): .. (x-n) tJ. j-1 X-] Clearly, f(x) will be a polynomial of the order ~ n-I with integer coeffi- cients, and we easily check that f(k) = 1+(k-l)!(n-k)!tk = qk. 129. As an example we may take, for instance~ the polynomial where Pk denotes kth prime. We shall have heref(Pk) = Pk for k = 1,2, ... , m. 130. If the constant term of the polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients were equal 0, then we would have f(O) = 0 and the congruence f(x) ~ 0 (modp) would be solvable for every modulus p. Thus, suppose that the constant term of the polynomial f(x) equals ao and is not zero. Since f(aox) = aoJi.(x), where fi(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients with the constant term equal to 1, it suffices to prove our theorem only for such polynomials. 70 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY Let n be a given positive integer. We have obviously n!lJi(n!)-I, hence f{n!) = n! k + 1, where k is an integer. The absolute value of the polynomial hex) (which is of the order> 0) increases over all bounds with x; for suffi- ciently large n we shall have therefore If(n!)1 = In!k+ 11 > 1, and the number n!k+l has a prime divisor p. In view of pln!k+l we must have p > n, and since pflt(n!), the congruence hex) = 0 (modp) is solvable for a prime modulus p > n. Since n is arbitrary, we deduce that the congruence fi(x) == 0 (modp), and also the congruence f(x) = 0 (modp) is solvable for in- finitely many primes p. 131. There is only one such number, namely k = 1. Then the sequence k+l, k+2, ... , k+l0 (1) contains five primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. For k = 0 and k = 2,' sequence (1) contains four primes. If k ~ 3, then sequence (1) does not contain number 3; as we know, out of each three consecutive odd numbers, one must be divisible by 3. It follows that sequence (1) contains at least one odd composite number. Besides that, sequence (1) contains five even numbers, hence (for k ~ 2) these numbers are composite. Thus, for k ~ 3, sequence (1) contains at least 6 composite numbers, and the numbers of primes cannot exceed 4. REMARK. Sequence (1) contains four primes for k = 0, 2, 10, 100, 190, 820. We do not know whether there exist infinitely many such numbers k. From a certain conjecture of A. Schinzel concerning primes ([22]) it follows that the answer is positive. 132. There exists only one such number, namely k = 1. For this value the sequence k+l, k+2, ... , k+:lOO (1) contains 26 primes. For k = 0, 2, 3 or 4, sequence (1) contains 25 primes. Thus, we may assume that k ~ 5. Sequence (I) contains 50 even numbers, which for k > 1 are all composite. Next, it contains also SO successive odd numbers, and since every three consecutive odd numbers contain one divisible by 3, sequence (I) contains at least 16 numbers divisible by 3, which are all composite for k > 2. Let us compute now the number of terms of sequence (1) which are di- visible by 5, and neither by 3 or 2. All such numbers will be of the form SOLUTIONS 71 30t+r where t is an integer ~ 0, and r is one of the numbers 5, 25. Let us arrange these numbers in the infinite increasing sequence 5, 25, 35, 55, 65, 85, 95, 115, 125, 145, 155, 175, 185, ... (2) and let u,. denote the nth term of this sequence. We easily check that U,,+6- -U,. < 100 for n = 1, 2, .... Let u,. denote the last term of this sequence which does not exceed k. We shall have u,. ~ k < U,.+l < U,,+6 < Un+ 100 ~ k+l00, which shows that sequence (1) contains at least 6 terms of se- quence (2), and, consequently, at least 6 terms divisible by 5, but not divi- sible by 2 or 3, hence composite for k ~ 5. Finally, let us compute the number of terms of sequence (1) which are divisible by 7, but not by 2, 3 or S. These will be the terms of the form 210t+,- where t is an integer ~ 0, and r is one of the numbers 7, 49, 77, 91, 119, 133, 161,203. Let us arrange these numbers in the infinite increasing se- quence 7,49,77,91,119,133,161,203,217,259,287, ... (3) and let '0,. denote the nth term of this sequence. We easily check that'lJII+3- -v,. < 100 for n = 1, 2, .... Let 'V,. denote the last term' of the sequence 'V1, V2, ••• which does not exceed k. We shall have v,. ~ k < V,.+l < V II+3 < '0,.+100 ~ k+l00, which shows that sequence (1) contains at least 3 terms of sequence (3), that is, at least three numbers divisible by 7, but not divisible by 2, 3 or 5. For k ~ 7, all these numbers will be composite. It follows that for k ~ 7, sequence (1) contains at least 50+ 16+6+ +3 = 75 composite numbers, hence at most 25 primes. For k == 5 and k = 6, sequence (1) contains the composite numbers '02, V3, and 'lJ4. Thus, for k > 1, sequence (1) contains at most 25 primes. 133. There are only 6 such sequences, namely those starting from 1, 3, 4, 5, 10, and II. The proof follows from the following lemma: For k > 11, among the numbers k, k+l, ... , k+99 there is at least 76 numbers divisible by either 2, 3, 5, 7 or 11. The proof of the lemma can be obtained if we write in the form of an increasing infinite sequence all numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 or 11. This sequence has the property that if a number r appears in it, then so does the number r+2310, and conversely (since 2310 = 2· 3 · 5· 7· 11). Thus, if r1, r2, ... , rs denote all positive integers ~ 2310 divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 or 11, then all such numbers are contained in s arithmetic progressions 72 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 2310t+rj, where i = 1, ... , sand t = 0, 1, 2, .... Thus, it suffices to write down all positive integers ~ 2310+100 divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7 or 11, and check that in each hundred of the numbers k, k+ 1, ... , k+99 for 1 ~ k ~ 2310 there is at least 76 numbers of this sequence. It would be more difficult to prove that there exists only a finite number of such positive integers k for which sequence (1) contains 24 primes. On the other hand, a certain conjecture concerning primes due to A. Schinzel ([22]) implies that there exist infinitely many numbers k such that sequence (1) contains 23 primes. 134. LEMMA. Out of every 21 consecutive positive integers, at least 14 are divisible by one of the numbers 2, 3, or 5. PROOF. In every consecutive 21 positive integers we have at least 10 divi- sible by 2, and at least 10 consecutive odd numbers, out of which at least 3 are divisible by 3. Thus, it suffices to show that in every sequence of 21 consecutive positive integers there is at least one which is divisible by 5 but not by 2 or 3. Let r denote the remainder of the division of x by 30; we have then x = 30t+r, where t is an integer ~ 0, and 0 ~ r < 30. If r ~ 5, then'x ~ 30t+5 ~ x+20 and the number 30t+5 is a term of the sequence x, x+ 1, ... , x+ 20 which is divisible by 5, but not by 2 or 3. If 5 < r ~ 25, then x ~ 30t+25 < x+20 and the number 30t+25 is a term of the sequence x, i+ 1, ... , x+ 20 which is divisible by 5 but not by 2 or 3. Finally, if 25 ~ r < 30, then x < 30t+35 < x+20, and the number 30t+35 is a term of the sequence x, x+ 1, ... , x+20 which is divisible by 5, but, not by 2 or 3. This completes the proof of the lemma. 0ll;r lem,rna implies immediately that' out of each 21 consecutive positive integers exceeding 5 we have at least 14 composite numbers, hence at most 7 primes. For x = 1,2, and 3, the sequence x, x+l, ... ,'x+20 contains 8 primes each, while for x = 4 and x = 5 this sequence contains 7 primes. Thus, the sequence x, x+ 1, ... , x+20 contains 8 primes for x = 1, 2, and 3. 135. There is only one such number, namelyp = 5. We easily find that, the required property does not hold for p < 5. For p = 5, we obtain primes 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19. If p > 5 and p = 5k with some positive integer k, then p is composite. If p = 5k+l, then p+14 is divisible by 5, h~nce ,composite. If p = 5k+2, then p+8 is divisible by 5, hence composite. If p = 5k+3, then 5/p+12 and p+12 is composite. Finally, if p = 5k+4, then 5/p+6, and p+6 is composite. SOLUTIONS 73 136. We easily find that for integer k > 1 such pairs are m = 2k_2 and n = 2k(2k_2), for which m+1 = 2k-l and n+l = (2k_l)2. REMAR~. P. Erdos posed a problem of existence of other such pairs; see [9, p. 126, problem 60]. A. M~kowski has found a pair: m = 75 = 3.52, n = 1215 = 5.35, for which m+l = 2 2 .19, n+l = 26 .19. v. DIOPHANTINE EQUATIONS 137. The identity 3(55a+84b)Z-7(36a+55b)2 = 3a 2-7b2 implies that if the integers x = a and y = b satisfy the equation 3r-7y2+ + 1 = 0, then the same equation is satisfied by larger integers x = 55a+ +84b and y = 36a+55b. Since the numbers x = 3 and y = 2 satisfy this equation, it has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x, y. 138. Since x(2.x2+y) = 7, the number x must be an integer divisor of number 7, that is, must be equal to one of the numbers 1, 7, -1, - 7. Substituting there values to the equation, we obtain for y the values 5, -97, -9, -99. Thus, our equation has four solutions in integers, namely (1, 5), (7, -97), (-1, -9), (-7, -99). Now let n denote an arbitrary integer > 5, and let x = 7/n, y = n- -98/n1.. Since n > 5, we have n ~ 6, and x, y will be rational and pos- itive; we easily check that they satisfy the equation 2x3+xy-7 = O. 139. We easily see that if x and y satisfy the equation (x-I)2+(x+l)2 = y2+1, (1) then Thus, for every positive i;nteger solution x, y of equation (I), we obtain another solution 2y+3x, 3y+4x in larger integers; since this equation has a solution x = 2, y = 3, it has infinitely many solutions in positive integers. 140. If for positive integers x and y we had x(x+l) = 4y(y+l), then we would also have 3 = [2(2y+l)]2-(2x+l)2 = (4y-2x+l)(4y+2x+3), hence the number 3 would be divisible by a positive integer 4y+2x+3 exceeding 3, which is impossible. 74 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY On the other hand, we easily see that for integer n > 1 and for 3n_3 1- n-2 x= , 4 we have x(x+l) = 4y(y+l). For instance, for n = 2 we get x = 5/3, y = 2/3. Our equation has infinitely many rational solutions x, y. 141 * . Proof due to A. Schinzel. Let p be a prime, and let n be a positive integer; suppose that positive integers x and y satisfy the equation x(x+l) = p2ny (y+l), Since x and x+l are relatively prime, we have either p2nlx or p2nlx+ 1, and hence in each case, x+ 1 ~ p2\". However, our equation is equivalent to the equation Since the left-hand side, and the first factor on the right are both positive integers, the second factor on the right must also be a positive integer. It follows that p2n_l > 2x+l, hence p2n > 2(x+l), which, in view of the previously found relation x+ 1 ~ p2n, gives p2\" > 2p2n, which is impossible. 142. In view of the identity (X_2y)2_2(x-y)2 = -(r-2y2), it suffices to put t = x-2y, u = x-yo 143. The proof follows immediately from the identity (m2+Dn2)2-D(2mn)2 = (m2-Dn2)2. It suffices to choose, for an arbitrary positive integer n, number m such that m 2 > Dn2 and put x = m 2+Dn2, y = 2mn, Z = m 2-Dn 2• 144. If D is odd, then for integer k >..1 the number D+22k- 2 is odd, and we have (D+22k- 2,2k) = 1; we easily find that (D+22k- 2)2_D(2k)2 = (D_22k-2)2. We can put x = ID+22k- 21, y = 2k, Z = ID-2 2k- 21. If D is even, then for every integer y > 1 we have (!Dy2+ 1, y) = 1, and (iDY2+1)2_Dy2 = (iDy2-1)2, and we can put x = ItDy2+11, Z = IlDy 2-1/. SOLUTIONS 75 145. Our equation is equivalent to the equation 2 25+1 .= (x+ I)(y+ 1). Since the Fermat number Fs = 2 25 + 1 is equal to the product of two primes, the smaller being 641, we have only one solution of our equation in positive integers x, and y ~ x, where x = 640. REMARK. It is interesting that we know of some equations of the second order with two unknowns that they have only one solution x and y ~ x, but (for purely technical reasons) we cannot find this solution. Such is, for instance, the case of equation xy+x+y+2 = 2137. On the other hand, we do not know if the equation xy+x+y = 2217 has a solution in positive integers x, y. 146. If y is even, then r = 3-8z+2y 2 gives the remainder 3 upon division by 8, which is impossible. If y is odd, then y = 2k+ 1 where k is an integer, then r = 3-8z+8k2+2, which gives the remainder 5 upon division by 8, which again is impossible since the square of every odd number gives the remainder 1 upon division by 8. 147. Let x be an arbitrary positive integer. We easily check the identity x(x+l)(x+2)(x+3)+1 = (r+3x+l)2, which, in view of our equation, implies y = r+3x+ I. Thus, all solutions in positive integers x, y of our equations are: x-an arbitrary positive integer, and y = x2+3x+I. 148. The equation r+y2+z2+x+y +z = 1 has no rational solutions since we easily see that it is equivalent to the equation and the number 7 would have to be a sum of three squares of rational numbers. We shall show that it is impossible. In fact, if 7 were a sum of squares of three rational numbers, then, after muliplying by the common denominator, we would have (1) where Q, b, and c are integers, and m is a positive integer. Then, there would exist the least positive integer m for which (1) has a solution in the integers a, b, c. If m were even, m = 2n, where n is a positive integer, then all three numbers Q, b, c would be even, hence a = 2al, b = 2b1 , C = 2CI where a1, bI , Cl are integers. Putting this into (1) we get, in view of m 2 = 4n2 a~+b~+ci = 7n2 76 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY where n is a positive integer < m, contrary to the assumption that m is the least positive integer for which 7m2 is a sum of squares of three integers. Thus, m is odd, and m2 gives the remainder 1 upon division by 8. Thus, the right-hand side of (1) gives the remainder 7 upon division by 8; we know, however, that no such number can be a sum of three squares of integers. 149. If positive integers x, y, z would -satisfy the equation 4xy-x-y = Z2, we would have (4x-1) (4y-l) = (2Z)2+ 1, and the positive integer 4x-l ~ 3 would have a prime divisor p of the form 4k+3. We would, therefore, have (2Z)2 = -1 (modp), and, in view of p = 4k+3, also (2Z)P-l = (2Z)2(2k+l) = -1 (mod p), contrary to the Fermat theorem. On the other hand, let n denote an arbitrary positive integer, and let x = -1, Y = -Sn2-2n, Z = -5n-l. We easily check that the numbers x, y, and z satisfy the equation 4xy-x-y = Z2. 150. We can easily check that for positive integers m and D = m2+ 1 we have (2m2+1)2-D(2m)2 = 1. If for positive integers x and y we have r- - Dy2 = 1, then, in view of the identity (r+Dy2)2_D(2xy)2 = (r-Dy2)2, we also have x~-DYi = 1, where Xl = r+Dy2 and Yl = 2xy are positive integers greater than x and y. If follows, for example, that the equation X2 - Dy2 = 1 has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x, y for D = 2, 5, 10, 17, 26, 37, 50, 65, 82. 151*. The equation y2 = x 3+(x+4)2 has two obvious solutions: x = 0, y = 4 and' x = 0, y = -4. We shall now give the proof, due to A. Schinzel, that this equation has no positive integer solutions x, y with x :F 0 (see [29]). Suppose that the positive integers x :F ° and y satisfy the equation. We have, therefore, x3 = (y-x-4) (y+x+4). (1) In view of (1) and x :F 0, the integers y-x-4 and y+x+4 are :F o. Let d = (y-x-4, y+x+4). (2) If d had an odd prime divisor p, then in view of (1) we would have pix, and by pld and (2), we would have ply-x-4 and p/y+x+4, hence pl2y. Since p is odd, it would follow that ply and p14, which is impossible. Thus, d has no odd prime divisor, and must be equal to a power of 2 with an integer exponent ~ o. SOLUTIONS 77 If we had 161d, then by (1) and (2) we would have 2alx3, which implies that 231x, and since d/(y+x+4)-(y-x-4) = 2x+8, we would have 1618, which is impossible. Thus, 16,r d. If we had d = 2, we would have y-x-4 = 2m, y+x+4 = 2n, where (m, n) = 1. In view of (1) and (2) we would have 21x, hence also 2/y. But 2y = 2(m+n), hence y = m+n, and 2Im+n; in view of (m, n) = 1, the numbers m and n must be both odd. Since x 3 = 4mn, we have 8 ,r x\\ which is impossible since 2/x. Thus, d =F 2. If we had d = 4, then y-x-4 = 4m, y+x+4 = 4n, where (m, n) = 1. By (1), we would have x 3 = 16mn, hence 4/x, which implies that 4lmn; thus, since (m, n) = 1, one of the numbers m, n must be divisible by 4 and the other odd. However, since 41x and 4 = d/x-y-4, we have 4/y = 2(m+n), which is impossible. Therefore d =F 4. Since 16,r d, d =F 2 and d =F 4, and since d is a power of 2, it remains to consider two more cases: d = 1 and d = 8. If d = 1, then from (1) and (2) it follows that the numbers y-x-4 and y+x+4 are cubes of integers; y-x-4 = a3, y+x+4 = b\\ which implies, in view of (1), that x = ab and 2x+8 = b3-a3. We cannot have a = b since then we would have x = -4 and the equation y2 = x 3+(x+4)2 would imply y2 = _4 3, which is impossible. In view of x = ab we have 2ab+S = b3_ -a3 = (b-a) (b-a)2+3ab). This implies that if b-a = 1, then 2ab+S = 1+3ab, hence ab = 7, and consequeqtly x = 7, y2 = 73+112 = 464, which is impossible since 464 is not a square. Thus, if we have ab > 0, then b-a > 0, and in view of b-a =F 1, we get b-a ~ 2 and 2ab+8 > 6ab. This implies ab < 2, hence ab = 1 and a = b = 1, which is impossible. If ab < 0, then either a> 0, b < 0, which leads to a3_b 3 = a3+(-b)3 ~ a2+ +(_b)2 ~ -2ab, contrary to the fact that a3_b 3 = -2ab-S < -2ab, or else, a < 0, b > 0, which in view of b3 = a3+2ab+8 leads to b3 < 8. Thus, b = 1, which gives in turn a3+2a+7 = 0, which is impossible since this equation has no integer solutions. Thus, we must have ab = 0, and con- sequently x = 0, contrary to the assumption x =F 0. We cannot have, there- fore, d = 1, and we must have d = S. By (2) we have, therefore, y-x-4 = Sm, y+x+4 = Sn, where (m, n) = 1, and in view of (1) we find x 3 = 64mn. Thus, (xj4Y = mn, which implies, by (m, n) = 1, that the numbers m and n must be cubes of integers, say m = a\\ n = b3. Thus x/4 = ab and 2x+S = 8(n-m) = S(b3-a3)' which leads to ab+l = b3_a 3• Clearly, we cannot have a = b, and we must have la-bl ~ 1. If ab > 0, then b > a and b-a ~ 1, and since ab+l = b3_a 3 78 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY = (b-a) [(b-a)2+3ab] > 3ab, we get 2ab < 1, contrary to the assump- tion ab > o. Since 4ab = x :I: 0, we have ab < O. In view of fb-al ~. 1 and Ib 3-a 3 1 = Ib-al I (b+a)2- ab\\ ~ -ab, and since we also have (in view of ab < 0) the relation lab+ll< labl = -ab, the equation ab+l = b3-a 3 is impossible. This completes the proof of the fact that the equa- tion y2 = x3+(x+4)2 has no solution in integers x :I: 0 and y. 152. Our equation is equivalent to the equation X 2Z+y2X+Z2y = mxyz in integers x, y, z different from 0, and pairwise relatively prime. It follows that yl.rz, zly2x, and xlz2y and since (x, y) = I, (z, y) = 1, which implies (rz,y) = 1, we get from ylx2z that y = ±I. In a similar way we find z = ± 1, and x = ± 1. If all three numbers x, y~ Z are of the same sign, then our equation implies 1 + 1 + 1 = m, hence m = 3. If two of them were positive and one negative, or two negative and one positive, then our equation would imply (in view of x = ± 1, Y = ± 1, z = ± I) that m is negative, contrary to the assumption. Thus, for positive integer m, the equation x y z -+-+-=m y z x has integer solution x, y, z in pairwise relatively prime x, y, z only for m = 3, and in this case there are only two solutions: x = y = z = 1 and x = Y = z = -1. For positive integer m #: 3, our equation has no solution in integers x, y, z different from 0 and pairwise relatively prime. 153. We have x y Z _._e_= 1 y z x ' hence the numbers (rational and positive) x/y, y/z, and z/x cannot be all < 1; if at least one of them is ~ 1, then x y z -+-+->1 Y z x ' and the left-hand side cannot be =·1 for positive integers x, y, z. REMARK. It is more difficult to prove that our equation has no solution in integers #: 0, cf. Cassels [3], Sierpinski [2]; Cassels, Sansone [4]. SOLUTIONS 79 154*. LEMMA. If a, b, c are positive, real, and not all equal, then ( a+b+c)3 b 3 >a c. (1) PROOF. Suppose that the numbers a, b, c are positive and not all equal. Then there exist positive numbers u, v, and w, not all equal and such that a = u\\ b = v3, and c = w 3• We have the identity U3+V3+w3-3uvw = l(u+v+w) [(u-v)2+(v-wl+(w-U)2]. Since not all numbers u, v, ware equal, the last factor is strictly positive, and we have which, in view of u3 = a, V = b, w3 = c gives (1), and completes the proof of the lemma. Let now x, y, z be positive integers. It the numbers x/y, y/z, and z/x were all equal, then, being positive and their product being equal to 1, they would have to be all equal 1, and we would have ~+L+~= 3 >2. y z x Thus, not all numbers x, y, z are equal, and by the lemma we have [~(~+L+~)]3 > ~.

If not all three numbers x/y, y/z, and z/x are equal, then from the solution of Problem 154 it follows that ~+L+~>3. y z x We must have, therefore, x/y = y/z = z/x, and our equation implies that each of these numbers is 1. Thus, x = y = z. In this case we have x y z -+-+- = 1+1+1 = 3, y z x 80 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY and our equation has infinitely many solution in positive integers x, y, z; all of them can be obtained by choosing an arbitrary positive integer for x and setting x = y = z. REMARK. We do not know whether the equation~ +L +~ = 4 has pos- y z x . itive integer solutions x, y, z. On the other hand, the equation!... +L +..:.. = 5 Y z x has a solution, for instance x = 1, Y = 2, z = 4; also (as found by J.

Schinzel, if for a given positive integer m the positive integers x, y, z satisfy the equation then we have Indeed, we have ry x3 y2z = xyz' and in view of (1) we get xl y3 Z3 -+-+-=m. xyz xyz xyz (1) (2) From Problems 153 and 154 it follows that for m = 1 and m = 2 equation (1) has no solution in the positive integers x, y; z, while Problem 155 implies that for m = 3 equation (1) has the only solution Xly = y2z = Z2X = n, where n is some positive integer. Then, however, ry·y2z·z2x = n3, or (xYZ)3 = n 3 , which implies xyz = n, and, in view of ry = n, we find z/x = 1, or x = z; on the other hand, in view of y2z = n, we find xly = 1, or x = y. Thus, we must have x = y = z. However, if m = 3, for . any positive integer x, and x = y = z we get a solution of equation (1). Thus, for m = 3 all solutions of equation (1) in positive integers are obtained by choosing as x an arbitrary positive integer, and setting y = z = x. SOLUTIONS 81 157. Suppose that theorem Tl holds. If theorem T2 were false, there would exist positive integers u, v, and w such that U3+V 3 = w3 , and putting x = u 2 'O, y = v2w, Z = w2u we would have z x contrary to theorem TI . Thus, we proved that theorem Tl implies theorem T 2 (this proof was found by A. Schinzel). . Suppose now t~at theorem Tl is false. Then there exist positive integ~rs x, y, z such that Let rz = a, y 2x = b; we shall have then Z2y = a+b and ab(a+b) = (xYZ)3. Let d = (a, b)'; thus a = da1 , b = db! where (aI' bl ) = 1. It follows that a+ +b = d(al+b 1) and atbl(al+bt)d3 = (xYZ)3. This implies that d 3I(xYZ)3, hence dlxyz and xyz = dt, wheret is a positive integer. . We have, therefore, Qtbl(al+bl) = t 3 , and since aI, bI , and al+bl are pairwise relatively prime, it follows that al = u3, b1 = '03, al +b 1 = w 3, where u, v, and ware positive integers. Thus, u 3 +v3 = w3, contrary to theorem T2, which shows that theorem T2 implies theorem TI . Thus, Tl and .T2 are equivalent, which was to be proved. REMARK. One can prove by elementary means (though the proof' is difficult) that theorem T2 is true; thus, theorem Tl is also true. 158*. If the numbers x, y, z, t are positive integers, then the numbers xly, ylz, zIt, and tlx are rational and positive; their prod~ct equals 1, which implies that they cannot be all < I. But if at least one of them is ~ 1, then their sum is > 1, and the equation ~+L+~+~=l· y z t x cannot hold. Thus, we proved that this equation has no solution in positive integers x, y, Z, t. We shall show now this equation has infinitely many solutions in integers =F O. It suffices to check that this equation is satisfied by nunlbers x = ~n2, y = n 2(n2-I), z = (n2_1)2, t = -n(n2-1), where n is an arbitrary integer > 1. 82 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 159* . LEMMA. If a, b, c, d are positive and not all equal, then ( a+b+c+d)4 b d 4 > a c · (1) PROOF. Suppose that a, b, c, and d are positive, and that, for instance, a :1= b. We have then either a+c #: b+d or a+d:/: b+c since if we had a+c = b+d and a+d = b+c, then we would have a-b = d-b = c-d and hence a-b = 0, contrary to the assumption a #= h. If, for instance, a+c:l= b+d, let u = a+c, v = b+d;we have u =F v, hence (U-V)2 > 0, which gives U 2+V 2 > 2uv. Thus, (U+V)2 = U 2+v2+2uv > 4uv. It follows that (a+b+c+d)2 > 4(a+c) (b+d), and since (a+c)2 ~ 4ac, (b+d)2 ~ 4bd, we have which gives inequality (1), and completes the proof of the lemma. Suppose now that for a positive integer m the equation x y z t -+-+-+-=m y z t x has a solution in positive integers x, y, Z, t. The product of these terms is equal 1. If all of them were equal 1, then m = 4. Thus, if m is a positive integer < 4, then not all four positive rational numbers xly, ylz, zIt, and tlx are equal, and by the lemma, we have which implies x y z t . -+-+-+->4. y z t x Thus, our equation haJ no positive integer solution x, y, z, t for positive in- tegers m < 4, and for m = 4 it has only the solution in which all four numbers xly, ylz, zIt, and tlx are equal, hence equal 1, which implies that x = y = z = t. Thus, for m = 4, our equation has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x, y, z, t, and they all are obtained by choosing arbitrary positive integer x, and putting y = z = t = x. SOLUTIONS 83 160. We must have x ::;;; 4 since for x ~ 5, in view of x::;;; y ::;;; Z ::;;; I, we would have 1 111 4 -+-+-+-::;;;-<1. x y Z I 5 Obviously, we also must have x ~ 2.

Thus, we can have only y = 3, 4,5, or 6. If y = 3, we have 61 =! +! ::;;;!, which gives z::;;; 12, and since z t z I 1 \"6 > z' the number z may assume only the values 7, 8,9,10,11 or 12. For z = 7, we have ! = 4~' or 1=42, which gives the solution x = 2, y = 3, z = 7, t = 42 of our equation. For z = 8, we have ! = 2~' or t = 24, which gives the solution x = 2, y = 3, z = 8, t = 24 of our equation. For z = 9, we have ! = I~' hence t = 18, which gives the solution x = 2, y = 3, z = 9, t = 18 of our equation. For z = 10, we get ! = 1~' or t = 15, which gives the solution x = 2, y = 3, z = 10, I = IS of our equation. For z = II, we have + = !

For z = 12, we have ! = 1~' or t = 12, which gives the solution x = 2, y = 3, z = 12, 1= 12 of our equation. 84 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 111 2 1 1 If y = 4, we have -4 = -+-t ~ -, hence z ~ 8, and since - > - or z z 4 z' z > 4, the number z may assume only values 5, 6, 7, or 8.

For z = 6, we have ! = 1~' or t = 12, which gives the solution x = 2, Y = 4, z = 6, t = 12 of our equation. For z = 7, we have + = ~ which does not lead to integer value of t, and our equation has no integer solution. For z = 8, we have ! = ~, or t = 8, which gives the solution x = 2, Y = 4, Z = 8, t = 8 of our equation. 3 1 1 2 20 . If y = 5, we have 10 = z+T ~ Z' or z~3' that IS, z ~ 6, hence Z ~ Y = 5, and we see that z may assume only values 5 or 6. For z = 5, we have + = 1~' or t = 10, which gives the solution x = 2, Y = 5, z = 5, t = 10 of our equation. 1 2 ' . For z = 6, we have t = IT' which does not lead to int~ger value of t, and our equation has no solution.

' We have completed the consideration of the case x = 2, showing that equation (1) has only 10 positive integer solutions y, z, t with y ~ z ~ t, namely 3, 7, 42; 3, 8,24; 3, 9, 18; 3, 10, 15; 3,~ 12, 12; 4, S, 20; 4, 6, 12; 4, 8, 8; 5, 5, 10, and 6, 6, 6. Suppose now that x = 3. Then we have the equation 111 2 -+-+-=-y z t 3 and, by y ~ z ~ t, we get ~ ~ ~ or y ~ ~, which implies y~4. Since 3 = x ~ y, possible values for yare 3 and 4.

For z = 4, we have t = 12, which gives the solution x = 3, y = 3, z = 4, t = 12 of our equation. For z = 5, we get t = 15/2, which does not lead to a solution in integers x,y, z, t. For z = 6, we get t = 6, which gives the soll!tion x = 3, y = 3, z = 6, t = 6 of our equation. 1 1 5 2 24 If y = 4, we have -+- = 12 ~ -, which implies z ~ -5 < 5, and z t z since z ~ y = 4, we must have z = 4, and consequently t = 6, which gives the solution x = 3, y = 4, z = 4, t = 6 of our equation. Suppose now that x = 4. We have then the equation 111 3 y+--z+f=4' which implies, by y ~ z ~ t, that ! ~ ! ' or y ~ 4, and since y ~ x = 4, we can have only y = 4. This leads to i. +i. = 21 ~2, or z ~ 4, and since z ~ y z t z = 4, we must have z = 4. This in turn implies that t = 4, and we obtain the solution x = 4, y = 4, z = 4, t = 4 of our equation. We have thus exhausted all possible cases, which leads to the conclusion that our equation has 14 positive integer solutions x, y, Z, t with x ~ y ~ z ~ t, namely 2,3,7,42; 2,3,8,24; 2,3,9,18; 2,3,10, 15; 2,3,12, 12; 2,4,5,24; 2,4,6,12; 2,4,8,8; 2,5,5, 10; 2,6,6,6; 3,3,4, 12; 3,3,6,6; 3,4,4,6; and 4, 4, 4, 4. REMARK. The equations considered occur in connection with the problem of covering the plane with regular polygons; see [25, p. 31 and following]. 161. For every positive integer s our equation has at least one solution in positive integers, namely Xl = X2 = ... = Xs = s. To prove that our equation has, for every positive integer s, only a finite Dumber of solutions, we shall prove a more general theorem, asserting that for every rational wand every positive integer s the equation 1 1 1 -+-+ ... +-=w Xl X2 Xs 86 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY has a finite ~ 0 number of solutions in positive integers Xl, X2, ••• , Xs. The proof will proceed by induction with respect to 3. The theorem is obvious for s = 1. Let now 3 be any positive integer, and suppose that the theorem is true for the number 3. Suppose that the positive integers Xl, X2, •.. , x s , Xs+l satisfy the equation 1 1 1 1 -+-+ ... +-+- = u, Xl X2 Xs Xs+I (1) where u is a given rational number, obviously positive. We may assume that· Xl ~ X2 ~ ••• ~ Xs ~ Xs+l. From (1) it follows that (3+ 1)/Xl ~ u, which im- plies Xl ~ (s+I)/u; thus, the number Xl can assume only a finite number of positive integer values. Let us now take as Xl any of these values; then the remaining s numbers X2, X3, ••• , X S , 3s+1 will satisfy the equation 1 1 1 1 1 -+-+ ... +-+-= u-- X2 X3 Xs Xs+l Xl (2) where, for a given Xl, the right-hand side is rational. Consequently, by the inductive assumption of the truth of our theorem for the number 3, it follows that this equation has a finite ~ 0 number of solutions in the positive in- tegers, X2, X3, ••• , x s , Xs+l- Since Xl can assume only a finite ,number of values, the theorem follows for the number s+ 1. This completes the proof. 162*. We easily check that for s = 3 we have a solution of our equation in increasing positive integers, namely Xl = 2, X2 = 3, X3 = 6. If for some integer 3 ~.3 the positive integers Xl < X2 < ... < Xs satisfy our equation, then in view of 3 ~ 3 we have Xl > 1 and 2 < 2Xl < 2X2 < ... < 2xs; thus the numbers t1 = 2, t2 = 2Xl, t3 = 2X2, .•. , ts = 2Xs-l, ts+2 = 2xs form an increasing sequence of positive integers and satisfy the equation 1 1 1 J . -+-+ ... +-+-= 1. tl t2 ts ts+l (1) In this manner we have Is solutions of equation (1) in increasing positive integers tl , t2 , ••• , ts, ts+l, and consequently, IS+l ~ Is. Thus, for every in- teger s ~ 3, the equation 1 1 1 -+-+ ... +-= 1 Xl X2 Xs has at least one solution in increasing positive integers Xl, X2, ••• , XS. SOLUTIONS 87 For s = 3, the equation has only one solution in increasing positive in- tegers since we must have Xl > 1, hence Xl ;::: 2, and if we had Xl ;::: 3, we would have X2 ;::: 4, X3 ;::: 5, which is impossible since 11111 1 -+-+- ~ -+-+- < 1. Xl X2 X3 3 4 5 We have, therefore, X2 = 3, hence X3 = 6, and consequently 13 = 1. On the other hand, h > 1 since the equation 1 1 1 1 -+-+-+-= 1 Xl X2 X3 X4 has in positive integers the solutions 2, 3, 7, 42 and 2, 3, 8, 24 (and also other solutions). We can, therefore, assume that s;::: 4. In this case the equation 111 -+-+ ... +-=1 Xl X2 Xs-l has at least one solution in increasing positive integers Xl < X2 < ... < Xs-lo and then the numbers 11 = 2, 12 = 3, t3 = 6Xlo t4 = 6X2, ••• , tsH = 6X S-l will be increasing positive integers, and will satisfy equation (1). This solu- tion will be different than each of the Is solutions obtained previously since there all numbers were even, while here the number 3 is odd. Thus, we have IsH;::: 1.+ 1, hence IsH > I. for s ;::: 3, which was to be proved. 163. Let In = n(n+ 1)/2 denote the nth triangular number.

Clearly, none of the positive integers x, y, Z, 1 satisfying our equation can be = 1. None of them can be ~ 3, either, since if, for instance, x ~ 3, then by y ~ 2, z ~ 2, t ~ 2 we would have which is impossible. Thus, we must have x = Y = Z = I = 2, which is the only solution of our equation in positive integers. 165. These are numbers 1, 4, and all integers s ~ 6. For s = 1, we have an obvious solution Xl = 1. For s =' 2 and s = 3, our equation has no solution in positive integers since these numbers would have to be > 1, hence ~ 2, while for such num- bers Xl, X2, X3 we have 1 1 1 1 -+-~-+--< 1 xi x~ '-': 4 4 and 111 3 ~+~+~~4<1. For s = 4, we have the solutiol1 Xl = X2 = X3 = X4 = 2. For s = 5, our equation has D\" solution in positive integers. In fact, if the numbers Xl ~ X2 ~ X3 ~ X4 ~ Xs would satisfy our equation, we would have Xl ~ 2, and Xl < 3, since in case Xl ~ 3; we have 115 2+ ... + _,.1 ~ -9 < 1 . x, ~s SOLUTIONS We must therefore have Xl = 2, and consequently, ~+~+~=~=~ rz ;G ~ rs 4' which implies X2 < 3 since 4/9 < 3/4. Thus X2 = 2, which yields 111 1 -+-+---;G ~ rs- 2 · It follows that X3 < 3 since 3/9 < 1/2. Thus, X3 = 2, which yields 111 -+-=- ~ rs 4' which is impossible since X4 ~ 2 and Xs ~ 2. 89 For 8 = 6, our equation has a solution Xl = X2 = X3 = 2, X4 = Xs = 3, X6 = 6. For s = 7, our equation has a solution Xl = X2 = X3 = 2, X4 = Xs = X6 = X, = 4. For 8 = 8, our equation has a solution Xl = X2 = X3 = 2, X4 = Xs = 3, X6 = 7, X, = 14, Xs = 21. Suppose now that for some positive integer 8 the equation has a solution in positive integers tl, ... , ts. Since l/t; = 4/(2ts)2, the equation 1 1 1 _..2 + _..2 + ... + x: = 1 Xi A2 s+3 has a solution in positive integers Xl = t1 , X2 = t2 , ••• , Xs-l = Is-I, Xs = Xs+l = X s+2 = X s+3 = 21s. Thus, if our equation is solvable in positive integers for some positive integer s, then it is also solvable for 8+3, and since it is solvable for s = 6, 7, and 8, it is solvable for every integer s ~ 6 (and, in addition to that, for s = 1 and s = 4). REMARK. One can prove that the rational number r can be represented as a sum of a finite number of reciprocals of squares of an increasing se- quence of natural numbers if and only if either 0 < r < 11t2-1 or 1 ~ r < 11t2.

I do not know whether the number 1/2 can be represented as a sum of less than twelve reciprocals of positive integers. 167*. Let m be a given positive integer. For s = 2\"', our equation has a solution in positive integers Xl = X2 = ... = Xs = 2. Let now a be a given positive integer, and suppose that our equation is solvable in positive integers for the positive integer s. Thus, there exist positive integers t1> t 2 , ... , t. such that and since 1/t';' = a\"'/(at.)'n, for Xl = t1> X2 = t2, ... , Xs_l = t._1> X. = Xs+l = ... = Xs+am_l = at. we shall have 111 /R+/R+ ... + '\" = 1. Xl X2 Xs+a\"'_l Thus, if our equation is solvable in positive integers for a positive integer s, then it is also solvable in positive integers for s+a'\" -1, and, more generally, for s+(a\"'-I)k, where k is an arbitrary positive integer. Taking a = 2 and a = 2\"'-1 we see that (for s = 2\"') our equation has a solution in positive integers for every s = 2m+(2\"'-I)k+[(2\"'-l)m-l]/ where k and I are arbitrary positive integers. The numbers 2\"'-1 and (2\"'-1)\"'-1 are obviously relatively prime. By the theorem, proved in Sierpinski [37, p. 29, Corollary 2], it follows that every sufficiently large positive integer is of the form (2\"'-I)k+ +[(2\"'-1)\"'-1]/, where k and I are positive integers. This implies that every sufficiently large positive integer is also of the form 2m+(2\"'-I)k+ + [(2\"'-1)\"'-1]1, hence for every such integer our equation is solvable in positive integers. 168. Clearly, it suffices to show that our equation has for every positive SOLUTIONS 91 integer s at least one solution in positive integers Xl> Xz ..... X, since every such solution multiplied by a positive integer is again a solution. For s = 1, we have an obvious solution Xl = X2 = 1. th I · 1 1 1 For s = 2, we have· e so ution 152+122 = 2OZ' Now let s be an arbitrary positive integer. and suppose that our equation has a solution in positive integers Since 1 1 I 1 -:2+-Z+ ... + 2\"\" = -2-' '1 12 ts 1,+1 111 (12/.)2 = (15t.)2 + (20t.)2' the positive integers Xi = 12t; for i = 1, ... , s-l, x,= 151., X.+1 = 20t., X&+2 = 12/.+1 satisfy the equation -.!.. +-.!..+ +-.!..+_1_ = _1_ ~ ~ ... r. r.+l r.+~ and the proof follows by induction. 169. It suffices to prove that for every integer s;;:;: 3 our equation has at least one solution in positive integers Xl> xz, ... , X., x,+1' For s = 3, it has the solution .1 1 1 1 123+153+203 = 103 (which can be obtained by dividing by 603 both sides of the equation 33 + +43+53 = 63), while for s = 4 we get the solution 1 1 1 + 1 _ 1 (S • 7 . 13)3 + (5 . 12· 13)3 + (7 . 12 . 13)3 (5· 7 . 12 . 13)3 - (S· 7 . 12)3 (which follows from dividing by (5·7· 12· 13)3 both sides of the equality 13+53+73+123 = 133). Now let s denote a given integer ;;:;: 3 and suppose that our equation has a solution in positive integers for this value of s.

Since it is solvable for s = 3 and s = 4, we conclude that it is solvable for every s ~ 3, which was to be proved. REMARK. One can prove by elementary means that for s = 2 our equa- tion has no solution in positive integers but the proof is difficult. 170*. The solution found by A. Schinzel. We have the identity Thus, if x, y, and z are integers such that x+y+z == 3 and X3+y3+Z3 == 3, then by (1) we get 8 = (x+y) (x+z) (y+z) = (3-x) (3-y) (3-z), (2) and in view of x+y+z = 3 we have 6 = (3-x)+(3-y)+(3-z). (3) The relation (3) implies that either all three numbers 3-x, 3-y, 3-z are even or only one of them is even. In the first case, in view of (2), all these numbers are equal to 2 in absolute value; thus, by (3), they are equal to 2, and 'then x = y = z = 1. In the second case, in view of (2), one of the numbers 3-x, 3-y, 3-z is equal to 8 in absolute value, and the re- maining ones are equal to 1 in absolute value; thus, in view of (3), one of them is = 8, and the remaining ones are = -1. This yields x = -S, Y = z = 4, or x = y = 4, z = - S, or, fipally, x = 4, y = - S, z = 4. Thus, our system of equations has only four integer solutions t namely x,y,z= 1,1,1; -5,4,4; 4, -5,4; 4,4, -5. See Problem E 1355 from The American Mathematical Monthly, 69 (1962), 1009. REMARK. We do not know whether the equation X 3+y3+ Z3 = 3 has other solutions in integers x, y, z besides the four given above. 171. Clearly we must have n ~ 8. If n == 3k, where k is an integer > 5, then for x = k-5, y = 3 we have 3x+5y = n. If n = 3k+l where SOLUTIONS 93 k is an integer> 3, then for x = k-3 and y = 2 we have 3x+5y = n Finally, if n = 3k+2, where k is an integer> 1, then for x = k-l, y = 1 we have 3x+5y = n. It follows that our equation has at least one positive integer solution x, y for every n > 15. It remains to investigate the numbers 8, 9, 10, 12, and 15. For n = 8, we have the solution x = 1, Y = 1. For n = 9, 12, and 15, our equation has no solution, since we would have 315y, hence 31y and 1515y, hence n = 3x+5y > 5y ~ 15. For n = 10, our equa- tion has no solutions in positive integers either, since then we would have 513x, hence 51x and 1513x, hence n = 3x+Sy > 15. Thus, our equation has at least one solution in positive integers x, y for all positive integers n except 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, and 15. Let now m be an arbitrary positive integer and let n be an integer > 4Om. The equation 3x+Sy = n has, therefore, a solution xo, Yo, and at least one of these numbers must be > Sm since in the case Xo ~ Sm, Yo ~ Sm we would have 3xo+Syo ~ 40m < n. If Xo > 5m, then for k = 0, 1,2, ... , m the numbers x = xo-Sk and y = yo+3k are positive integers and satisfy the equation 3x+5y = 3xo+Syo = n. If Yo> 5m, then for k = 0,1, 2, ... , m the numbers x = xo+Sk and y = yo-3k are positive integers and satisfy the equation 3x+Sy = n. Thus, this equation has, for n > 4Om, more than m solutions in positive integer x, y, which shows that the number of such solutions increases to infinity with n. 172. n = 2, y = x, z = x+ 1, where x is an arbitrary positive integer. In fact, for positive integers x we have 2x+2x == 2x+l. On the other hand, suppose that for positive integers n, x, y, and z we have nX+nY = n\". We may assume that x ~ y ~ z. We cannot have n = 1, hence n ~ 2. We have w = rf-nY = w(n\"-x-nY-X), which implies nf:-X_nY-X = 1. If we had y > x, then we would have nil, which is impossible. Thus, we must have y = x, hence rf-X = 2, which yields n = 2, z-x = 1. We obtain, therefore, n = 2, y = x, z = x+l. REMARK. The equation w+nY = nf: is obtained from the Fermat equa- tion x\"+y\" = z\" by reversing the roles of exponents and bases. See Mem. Real. Acad. Sci. Art. Barcelona, 34 (1961), 17-25. 173. Let m and n be two given positive integers, and let a and b be two different primes > m+n. Put c = am+bn. The system x = m, y = n satisfies obviously the equation ax+by = c. Suppose that there is some other system satisfying this equation, say x, y. We cannot have x ~ m, y > n, or x > m, y ~ n since in this case we would have ax+by > am+ 94 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY +bn = c. Thus, we must have either x < m or y < n. If x < m, then m-x is a positive integer < m, and in view ofax+by = am+bn we have by = a(m-x)+hn, which implies that hla(m-x). Since a and b are different primes, it follows that him-x, which is impossible since by definition we: have m > b. In a similar manner we prove that we cannot have y < n. REMARK. It is easy to note that not for aU two systems of positive integers there exists a linear equation ax+by = c, with integer a, h, and c, which has these two systems as the only positive integer solution. On the other hand, we can easily prove that there always exists such an equation of the second degree with integer coefficients. 174. For instance, the equation x+y = m+l, which has exactly m solutions in positive integers x, y, namely x = k, y = m-k+ 1, where k=l, ... ,m. REMARK. It is known that there is no linear equation ax+by = c which would have a finite and> 0 number of solutions in integers x, y. 175. For f(x, y) = r+y2+2xy-mx-my-m-l, we have the iden- tity f(x, y) = (x+y-m-l)(x+y+l). Since for positive integers x and y we have x+y+1 > 0, we can havef(x, y) = 0 if and only if x+y-m-l = 0; from the solution of Problem 174 it follows that this equation has exactly m solutions in positive integers x and y. REMARK. The polynomial in two variables considered in this problem is reducible. One could ask whether for every positive integer m there exists an irreducible polynomial F(x, y) of the second degree with integer coeffi- cients, and such that the equation F(x, y) = 0 has exactly m, solutions in positive integer x, y. One can prove that for every positive integer m there exists a positive integer am such that the equation r+y2 = am has exactly m positive integer solutions x, y. More precisely, one can prove it for a2k~'1 = 2 · S2k-2 and a2k = S2k-l, where k = I, 2, ... , but the proof is not easy. Let us also remark that A. Schinzel proved that for every positive integer m there exists a polynomial of the second degree in the variables x, y, say f(x, y), such that the equation f(x, y) = 0 has exactly m integer solutions. See [18]. 176. Put x = t+3. Then our equation reduces to the equation 2t(t2+3t+21) = 0, which has only one solution in real numbers, namely t = O. It follows that our equation has only one integer solution, namely x = 3. SOLUTIONS REMARK. One can prove that all solutions of the equation r+(x+r)3+(x+2r)3+ ... +(x+(n-l)r)3 = (x+nr)3 95 in positive integers x, r, n are only n = 3, x = 3r where r is an arbitrary positive integer. 177. If n = 2k-l, where k is a positive integer, then obviously, x = -k, Y = 0 is a solution of our equation; if n = 2k,wherej is a positive integer, then x = -k, y = k is a solution of our·equation. REMARK. There are also other solutions, for instance for n = 8, x = - 3, y = 6; for n = 25, x = -11, y = 20; for n = 1000, x = 1333, y = 16830: 178. In this equation the coefficients at x3, r, and x, are divisible by 3, and the constant term is -25, which is not divisible by 3. It follows that our equation has no solutions in positive integers x. 179. Substituting x = t+ 10 we reduce our equation to the equation 3t(t2+40t+230) = O. Since the equation t2+40t-230 = 0 has no rational solutions, we must have t = 0, and our equation has only one solution in positive integers, namely x = 10. 180. x = 1, y = 2 (since 2·3 = 1 . 2 . 3) and x = 5, y = 14 (since 14 . 15 = 5 . 6 . 7). REMARK. L. J. Mordell proved that our equation has no other solutions in positive integers. 181. The solution follows immediately from the identity 1 + (2n)2+ (2n2)2 = (2n2+ 1)2 for n = 1,2, .... REMARK. It is easy to prove that for every positive integer k the equa- tion k+ r+y2 = Z2 has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x, y, z. It suffices to take as x an arbitrary integer > Ikl + I, even if k is odd, and odd if k is even, and put k+r-l y= 2 182. Suppose that positive integers n and x ~ y ~ z satisfy the equation (1) 96 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY We cannot have n = 1. If n = 2, then from (1) we get 1 +2,-x+2%-X = 2t - x, and we cannot have y > x. Thus we have y = x, and 2+2:-x = 2t - x , which gives z-x = 1, hence t-x = 2. Thus, if n = 2, then we must have y = x, z = x+l, and t = x+2, while we easily check that for all positive integers x we have 2x+2x+2x+ 1 = 2x+2. Suppose, next, that n ~ 3. In view of (1) we have 1 +n'-x+n%-X = nt-x, and since n > 2, we must have y = x and z = x. Thus 3 = nt-x, which implies n = 3 and t-x = 1. Therefore, if n > 2, we must have n = 3, x = y = z, t'= x+l. We easily check that for every positive integer x we have 3 x +3x +3x = 3 x + 1 • Thus, all solutions of equation (I) in positive integers n, x, y, z, t with x ~ y ~ z are n = 2, y = x, z = x+l, t = x+2, or n = 3, Y = x, z = x, t = x+ I, where x is an arbitrary positive integer. 183. From the solution of Problem 182 it follows that the equation 4x +4>'+4% = 4t has no solutions in positive integers. Let us note that this equation is obtained from the equation X4+y4+Z4 = t 4 by reversing the role of bases and exponents. As regards the last equation, it is not known whether it has positive integer solutions x, y, z, t or not, as was conjec- tured by Euler. 184. This equation has only one solution in positive integers, namely m = 2, n = 1. In fact, since 3 2 = 1 (mod 8), we have for positive integers k the relation 3 2k+l = 2 (mod 8) and 3 2k- 1+1 == 4 (mod 8), which shows that for a positive integer n the number 3 n+ 1 is not divisible by 8, hence is not divisible by 2 m for integers m ~ 3. Thus, if for positive integers m and n we have 2m_3n = 1, then we must have m ~ 2, hence either '2-3 n = I, which is impossible, or 22-3 ft = I, which gives m = 2, n = 1. 185. This equation has only two solutions in positive integers, namely n = m = 1 and n = 2, m = 3. In fact, if n is odd and > 1, then n = 2k + 1 , where k is a positive integer, and in view of 3 2 = 1 (mod 4) we have 3 2k+ 1 = 3 (mod 4), which yields 2 m = 3 n -1 = 3 2k+1_1 = 2 (mod 4). This implies that m ~ 1 or m = 1, and in view of 3 ft -2m = 1 we have also n = 1. If n is even, n = 2k for some positive integer k, then we have 2 m = 3 2k _1 = (3k -1 )(3k + 1). Two successive even numbers 3 k -1 and 3 k + 1 are, there- fore, powers of the number 2, which implies that these numbers are 2 and 4, which gives k = 1, hence n = 2. This yields the solution n == 2, m = 3. 186. If for positive integer x andy we have 2 x +l - y2, then (y-l)(y+I) SOLUTIONS 97 = 2 x, hence Y > 1, and y-l .= 2\\ y+l = 2', where k is an integer ~ 0, and 1 is an integer> k. Moreover, k+l = x. It follows that 2'-2k = 2, which shows that k > 0 and, in view of k < 1, we have 2 k12. Consequently, k ~ 1, and since k ~ 0, we obtain k = 1. Thus, 2' = 2k+2 = 4, which yields 1 = 2. We have, therefore, x = k+l = 1+2 = 3, hence y2 = 2 3+1 = 9, and y = 3. The equation 2 X + 1 = y2 has, therefore, only one solution in positive integers, namely x = y = 3. 187. This equation has only one such solution, namely x = y = 1 since in case x > 1 the number 2 X -1 is of the form 4k-l, where k is a posi- tive integer, and no square of an integer is of this form since upon division by 4 it gives the remainder either 0 or 1. 188. Suppose that our system has positive integer solution x, y, Z, t. We may assume that (x, y) = 1 since in the case (x, y) = d> 1 we could divide both sides of our equations by d 2• Thus, at least one of the numbers x, y is odd. It is impossible that both are odd since in this case the left-hand sides of our equations would give remainder 3 upon dividing by 4, which is impossible, the right-hand sides being squares. However, if for instance x , is even, then y cannot be odd since in this case the left-hand side of the first equation would give the remainder 2 upon dividing by 4, which is impossible since it is a square. Thus, both numbers x and yare even, contrary to the assumption that (x, y) = 1. 189. Our equation is equivalent to the equation (2x+l)2-2y2 = -1, which has a solution in positive integers, namely x = 3, Y = 5. Our identity implies that if positive integers x and y satisfy the equation, then greater numbers Xl = 3x+2y+l and Yl = 4x+3y+2 also satisfy this equation. It follows that this equation has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x and y. For x = 3, Y = 5, we obtain in this manner Xl = 20, Y1 = 29. 190. Our equation is satisfied for X= 7, Y = 13. This equation is equiv- alent to the equation 3r+3x+ 1 = y2, which jn turn is equivalent to 4y2 = 12r+12x+4 = 3(2x+l)2+1, thus, to the equation (2y)2-3(2x+l)2 = 1. This implies that if x and Y satisfy this equation, then greater numbers Xl = 4y+ 7x+3 and Yl = 7y+ 12x+6 also satisfy this equation. It follows that the equation considered has infinitely many positive integer solutions x, y. For instance, for x = 7, Y = 13 we obtain Xl = 104~ Y1 = 181. 191. Proof (according to J. Browkin). If our system had a solution in positive integers x, y, Z, t, then it would also have a solution with (x, y) = 1 . 98 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY Adding our equations we obtain 6(X2+y2) = Z2+ t 2, which implies that 3Iz2+t2• Since a square of an integer which is not divisible by 3 gives the re- mainder 1 upon dividing by 3, it is impossible that both numbers z and t are not divisible by 3. Since, however, 3Iz2+t2, if one of the numbers z, t is divisible by 3, so must be the other. Thus, both z and t are divisible by 3, which implies that the right-hand side of the equation 6(r+y2) = r+t Z is divisible by 9, and 3Ir+yZ, which, as we know, shows that both x and y are divisible by 3, contrary to the assumption that (x, y) = 1. 192. Our equations imply that 7(X2+y2) = Z2+t 2• We have, therefore, 7Iz2+tZ , hence, by Problem 34, we have 71z and 71t. Thus, 49/7(r+y2), which implies 7Ir+y2, which again implies that 71x and 71y. Thus; our system cannot have solutions with (x, y) = 1, which, of course, is impossible if it has at least one positive integer solution x, y, z, t, In fact, if (x, y) = d > 1, we would have dlz and dlt, and it would suffice to divide each of the numbers x, y, z, t by d. 192a. It has, for instance, a solution x = 3, Y = 1, z = 4, t = 8. 193. If y were even, then r· would be of the form 8k+ 7, which is impossible. If y were odd, then we would have r+1 = y3+23 ==(y+2)[(y-I)2+3] and, in view of y=2k+l, we would have (2k)z+3I(r+l). Since the left-hand side has a prime divisor of the form 4t+3, the number r+l would have a prime divisor of the same form, which is impossible (in view of (x, 1) = I). 194. We have x2+1 = (2C)3+y 3 = (y+2c)(y2-2cy+4c2) = (y+2c)(Y-C)2+3c2). Since c 2 = 1 (mod 8), we have 3c 2 = 3 (mod 8) and if y is odd, then y-c is even and (y-c)2+3c 2 is of the form 4k+3; thus, it has a prime divisor of this form, which is at the same time a divisor of r+ 1, which is impossible. If y were even, then we would have r = y3+(2c)3-1 = -1 (mod 8), which is impossible. It follows that there exist infinitely many positive in- tegers which are not of the form xl_ y 3, where x and yare integers. 195. Suppose that x is odd. Then y is of the form y3 = 0 (mod 8), hence y3 -I = 7 (mod 8), and x 2 + (2k)2 would have a prime divisor of the form 4k+3, which is impossible, being a sum of two squares of relatively prime numbers. Thus, x is even. Let x = 2«z, where ex is a positive integer. If ex = k, SOLUTIONS 99 then 2Zk(zz+l) = y3_1 = (y-l)(yz+y+l), hence y must be odd and y-I cannot be of the form 4k+3. Thus,y == 1 (mod 4), andyz+y+1 == 3 (mod 4), which is impossible. If IX < k, then 2Z\"(2k-\")z+zZ) = (y_I)(yz+y+ I), and, in view of the fact that z is odd, we proceed as above. Finally, if IX > k, then 2Zk(2 CX - kz)z+l) = (y_I)(y2+ y +I), and we. proceed as above. In particular, if k = 1, we see that the equation y3_r = 5 has no positive integer solutions x, y. See: L. Aubry in Dickson, [7, p. 538]. 196. Suppose first that x = 1, Then we have the equations 1 +y = zl, and z+1 = y, which imply zl = z+I+1. It follows that z::f: 1 (since z = 1 would give 1 = t+2, which is impossible). If z = 2, then 1 = 3, hence by y = Z+I, we get y = 5, which yields the solution x = 1, y = 5, z = 2, 1 = 3. If z ~ 3, then I?: z ~ 3 and we have z = zl+2, 1 = 11+2, where ZI ~ 1, 11 ~ 1. It follows that zl = (ZI+2)(t1+2) = ZI11+2z1+211+ +4 ~ ZI+11+7 = z+I+3, contrary to the fact that (in view of x = 1) we have zl = z+t+ 1. Suppose now that x = 2. We then have z ~ x = 2. If z = 2, then 2+y = 2/, 2+t = 2y, which implies y = 1 == 2. We would therefore have x = y = z = t = 2 which is a solution of our system. If z > 2, then, in view of t ~ z, we have 1 > 2 and we may put z = ZI+2, t = 11+2, which implies zt = (ZI+2)(t1+2) = ZIII+2z1+211+4?: ZI+tl+7 = z+t+3. However, since x = 2, we have 2+y = zt, z+t = 2y, which yields zt = 1(z+t)+2. Thus, !(z+I)+2 ~z+t+3, which leads to z+I+2 ~O, which is impossible. Suppose now that x> 2, hence x ~ 3, and z?: x ~ 3, I?: z?: 3. We can put z = ZI+2, 1 = 11+2, where Zl ~ 1 and tl ~ 1. It follows that zt = (ZI+2)(ll+2) = zl(I+2zl+211+4 ~ ZI+tl+9 = z+I+5. Similarly, since x ~ 3, we have y ~ x ~ 3, xy?: x+y+5. We have, however, z+t = xy, which implies zt ~ z+t+5 = xy+5 ?: x+y+IO = zt+lO, which is impossible. Thus, our system has only two solutions in positive integers x, y, z, t with x ~ y and x ~ z ~ t, namely x = 1, Y = 5, z = 2, 1 = 3 and x = y = z = 1=2. As regards solutions of our system in integers, there are infinitely many such solutions. J. Browkin noticed that such solutions are x = Z = 0, t = y, with arbitrary y, while A. M~kowski noticed that the solutions of our system are x = t = -1, y arbitrary, z = l-y. 197. For n = 1, x may be arbitrary. For n = 2, we have XI = X2 = 2. 100 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY For n > 2, Xl = X2 = ... ~ Xn-2 = 1, Xn-l = 1, Xn = n is a solution. There are, however, other solutions, for instance for n = 5, we have Xl = X2 = X3 = 1, X4 = Xs = 3. Thus, we can say that for every positive integer n there exist n positive integers such that their sum equals to their product. 198. If n is odd and > 1, then and in view of a > 0, we must have x-y ~ 1, hence xa-1+yn-l ~ a. Thus, x < n-if a and y < n-v a and a finite number of checking will suffice. If n = 1, then all positive integer solutions of the equation a = x-yare: y arbitrary\"x = a+y. If n = 2k, where k is a positive integer, then a = xa-yn = r\"_y2k = (~_yk)(.xk+yk), where xk_yk ~ 1, hence ~+yk ~ a. It follows that x < Va, y < Va, and a finite number of checking will suffice. 199. In order for a triangular number tx = x(x+l)/2 to be pentagonal, it is necessary and sufficient that for every x there exists a positive integer y such that y(3y-l) = x(x+l). (1) It suffices, therefore, to show that equation (1) has infinitely many positive integer solutions x, y. We easily check that (4x+ 7y+ 1)(12x+21y+2)- (7x+ 12y+ 1)(7x+ 12y+2) = y(3y-l)-x(x+l), and it immediately follows that if positive integers x, y satisfy (1), then the greater integers Xl = 7x+12y+l, YI = 4x+7y+l (2) satisfy the equation Yl(3Yl-l) = Xl(Xt+1). Since the numbers x = y = 1 satisfy (1), it follows that this equation has infinitely many positive integer solutions x, y. The solution x = 1 = 1 gives by (2) the solution Xl = 20, Yl = 12, which in turn leads to X2 = 285, Y2 = 165, and so on. SOLUTIONS 101 MISCELLANEA 200. The equation 4x+ 2 = 0 has obviously no integer roots. On the other hand, the congruence 4x+2 = 0 (modp) is solvable for every prime modulus p. For the modulus equal 2, it is, of course, solvable identically. while if p is an odd prime, p = 2k+ 1, where k is a positive integer, it has the solution x = k. 201. Put m = a; if the congruence ax+b = 0 (mod m) has a solution, then alb, hence b = ak, where k is an integer, and the equation ax+b = 0 has the integer root x = -Ok. 202. We have identically 6r+5x+l = (3x+l) (2x+l), which implies that the equation 6r+5x+ 1 = 0 has no integer solutions. Let m be an arbitrary positive integer. We have then m = 2fZml, where ex is an integer ~ 0, and ml is odd. Since (2(1, ml) = 1, there exists a positive integer x such that 3x = -I (mod 2fZ), and 2x = -1 (mod ml), which yields m = 2crml! (3x+l) (2x+I), and consequently, 6r+5x+l == 0 (mod m) . . 203. This it true for n = 1 since a square of an odd number gives the remainder 1 upon dividing by 8. Suppose that the assertion holds . for a pos- itive integer n. Then for odd k: k2n = 2 n+ 2t+l, where t is an integer. It follows that k2n+ 1 = (2n+2t+ 1)2 = 22n+4t2+2n+3t+ 1 = 2n+3(2n+lt2+t)+ I, which implies that 2n+31~11+1 -1. The proof follows by induction. 204. The proof follows immediately from the identity (3x+4y)2_(2x+3y)2 = r-2y 2, and from the remark that for positive integers x and y we have 3x+4y > x, and 2x+3y > y. 205. If for some integers x and y the number r-2y 2 is odd, then x must be odd, hence r = 1 (mod 8). In the case where y is even, we have 2y2 = 0 (mod 8), and in the case where it is odd, we have 2y2 == 2 (mod 8). Thus, in case of r-2y 2 being odd, we have r-2y 2 = ± 1 (mod 8), which shows that for integers x and y the number r-2 y 2 cannot be of the form 8k+3 or 8k+5, where k is an integer. 206. It can be seen quite readily that for every positive integer n, the number (2n+l)2-2 e 22 is of the form 8k+l, where k is an integer ~ o. Next, we have 1 = 32-2.2 2, 9 = 9 2-2.6 2, 17 = 5 2-2.22, 25 = 15 2-2.102, while the number 33 cannot be represented in the form x 2-2y2, where x 102 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY and yare positive integers. We shall prove, more generally, that no number of the form 72t+33, where t = 0, I, 2, ... , can be represented in the form x2_2y2 with integers x and y. In fact, suppose that 72t+33 = r-2y 2 where t, x and yare integers. The left-hand side is divisible by 3, but is not divisible . by 9. It follows that none of the numbers x, y is divisible by 3 since if 3/x, we would have 3/y and the right-hand side would be divisible by 9, which is impossible. Thus, the numbers x and yare not divisible by 3, hence x2 and y2 give remainder 1 upon dividing by 3; thus, the number x2_2y2 gives the remainder 2 upon dividing by 3, which is impossible since the left-hand side is divisible by 3. Thus, there exist infinitely many positive integers of the form 8k+l (where k = 1, 2, ... ) which are not of the form r-2y2, where x and yare integers, and the least such number is 33 = 8· 4+ 1. 207. The even perfect numbers are, as it is well known, of the form 2P- 1(2P-:-l), wherep and 2P-l are primes (see, for instance, Sierpinski [37, p. 172, corollary]). For p = 2 we have the number 6. If p > 2, then p is . a prime of the form 4k+l or 4k+3. If p = 4k+l, then 2P- 1 = 24k = 16k, and the last digit of 2 p- 1 is obviously 6, while 2P-I = 2 4k+1_l = 2·16k-l and the last digit is obviously 1. Thus, the last digit of the product 2P- 1(2P-l) is 6. If p = 4k+3, then the number 2P- 1 = 2 4k+2 = 4·16k has the last digit 4, while the last digit of 2 P is 8, hence the last digit qf the number 2P-I is 7, and, consequently, the number 2P- 1(2P-l) (as the product of two numbers, one with the last digit 4, and the other with the last digit 7) has the last digit 8. This completes the proof. REMARK. One could prove (but the proof is more difficult) that if the last digit of a perfect number is 8, then the last but one digit is 2. 208. The value of our fraction, in the scaJe g, is 1+g2+g4+g6+g8 1+g+g4+g'+g8 and we have to prove that for every positive integer k, this fraction is equal to the fraction 1+g2+g4+gS+ ... +g2k+2+g2k+4+g2k+6 1 +g +g4+gS+ ... +g2k+2+g2k+S+g2k+6· (1) SOLUTIONS 103 The assertion can be shown by checking that the products of the numerator of each of thesej:actions by the denominator of the other are the same. See P. Anning [1]. REMARK. J. Browkin noticed that for positive integer k we have the identity 1+g2+g4+gs+ ... +g2k+2+g2k+4+g2k+6 = (l_g+g2_ g3+g\") (I+g+g2+ ... +g21c+2), and l+g+g4+gS+ .. , +g2k+2+g2k+S+g2k+6 = (l_g2+ g4) (l+g+g2+ ... +g21e+Z), which implies that the fraction (I) is, for k = 1,2, ... , equal to the fra(:tion l_g+g2_g3+g4 l_g 2+g4 hence its value is independent of k. 209*. A. Schinzel proved a more general theorem, namely the theorem asserting that if g is a positive integer, even, and not divisible by 10, then the sum of decimal digits of gil increases to infinity with n. We shall present his proof. Let us define an infinite sequence of integers ai (i = 0, I, 2, ... ) as follows: put ao = 0, and for k = 0, 1,2, ... , let ale+! denote the smallest positive integer such that 2a,,+\\ > 1(Y''' (thus, we shall have al = I, az = 4, a3 = 14, and so forth). Clearly, al < az < a3 < .... We shall prove that if for some positive integer k we have n ;:;: ak, then the sum of digits of gil is ;:;: k. Let Cj denote the digit of the decimal expansion of gil standing at 10j • Since g is even, we have 2\"lg\", and since n ):: ale, we have, for i = 1,2, ... ... , k-I, the relation 2<lflg\". Moreover, since 2a'llQaI, we have 2allca,_lIQa,-1+ ... +co· If for at-I::;;; j < at all digits CJ were equal zero, we would have 2a'lcai-l_llQ<lf-I-I+ ... +co, and, in view of Co :F 0, also 2a,::;;; cal_I_1lQaI-I-l+ ... +co < 10a,-I. 104 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY This implies 2ai < loaf-I, contrary to the definition of ai. Thus, at least one of the digits c), where ai-l ~j < ai, is different from zero. Since this is true for i = 1, 2, ... , k, at least k digits of g\" are different from zero. For suf- ficiently large n (for n ~ at), the sum of decimal digits of gn is not smaller than an arbitrarily given number k. This shows that the' sum of decimal digits of g\" increases to infinity together with n, which was to be proved. A. Schinzel noted that in a similar way one can prove that if g is an odd positive integer divisible by 5, then the sum of decimal digits of gn increases to infinity with n. In particular, from the theorem proved above it follows (foro g = 2) that the sum of decimal digits of 2\" increases to infinity with n. It does not mean, however, that the increase is monotone: we have, for instance, the sum of digits of 2 3 equal 8, while the sum of digits of 24 equal 7, and the sum of digits of 2s equal 5. Next, the sum of digits of 2 9 is 8, while that of 210 is 7. Similarly, the sum of digits of 2 16 is 25, while that of 217 is 14. 210*. Proof due to A. SchinzeI. Let k be a given integer> 1, and let c be an arbitrary fixed digit of decimal system. Since k > 1, we easily prove (for'instance, by induction) that 10 k- I > 2·2k• Let t denote the least integer such that t ~ C·lOk- 1/2 k ; we shall have, therefore, and At least one of integers t and t+l is not divisible by 5; denote this number by u. We shall have and since 2· 2k < 10 k-I, we shall have, for 1 = 2 ku, the relation C·10 k - 1 ~ 1 < (c+ 1) 10 k- I , (1) which shows that the number 1 = 2 ku has k digits, the first of which (hence the kth from the end) is c (this digit can be zero). In view of 1 = 2 ku we have 2kl/, and by the definition of u it follows that 51u, hence (I, 5) = 1. As we know, the number 2 is a primitive root for the modulus 5\" (see, for instance, W. Sierpinski [24, p. 246, lemma]). Since (I, 5) = 1, there exists an integer n ~ k such that 2 n = 1 (mod 5k). Since 2kll and 2kI2\", we have also SOLUTIONS 105 2\" == [(mod 2k), and consequently 2\" == [(mod 10\"), which shows that the k last digits of the number 1 coincide with the corresponding digits of 2\". It follows that the kth from the end digit of the number 2\" is e, which was to be proved. REMARK. The last four digits of powers of 2 cannot be of the form llle with C = 2,4, 6 or 8 since none of the numbers 1112, 1114, 1116 and 1118 is divisible by 16. In the paper quoted above I proved (p. 249), that the third and second from the end digits of 2\" (where n = 3,4, ... ) can be arbitrary. I proved also that if m is an arbitrary positive integer and k is the number of its digits, then there exists a positive integer n such that k first digits of the number 2\" are the same as the digits of m. 211. For integer n ~ 4, we have 5\"+4_5\" = 5\"(54_1) = 5\"·16·39, hence 5\"+4 == 5\" (mod 10000), and it follows that the last four digits of the se- quence S\" (n = 4, 5, ... ) form a four-term period. The period is 0625, 3125, 5625, 8125. This period is not pure since the numbers 5, 5z = 25, 53 = 125 do not belong to it. 212. Let s be a given positive integer, and let Cx. Cz, ••• , C. be an arbitrary sequence of s decimal digits. Let m = (Cl Cz ••• Cs)lO be a number with s digits equal respectively to Ch Cz, ••• , Ca. Let us choose a positive integer k such that 2Jim < 10',-1 and let n = [lOkJiml+l, where [xl denotes the greatest integer ::;;;. x. We have 10\"Ji m < n ::;;; 10\"Ji m+ 1, which implies that l()2km < nZ::;;; 102km+2·10k{m+l < 1()2km+lOZk- 1+1 < 102km+102k, and consequently it follows that (C1CZ ••• caOO ... 0)10 < n2 < (C1CZ ••• c.999 .~. 9)10, where the number of zeros and the number of nines is 2k. It follows that the first $ digits of n2 are Clo C2, ••• , Ca. i13. If n is a positive integer, then n\"+20-n\" = n\"(n2°-1) is divisible by 4. In fact, if n is even, then 4[n\", and if n is odd, then nlO is odd, hence its square n20 gives the remainder 1 upon dividing by 8. Thus, 8[n20-1. For positive integer n, the number n\"+zo-n\", hence also the number (n+20)\"+20_ 106 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY -nil, is always divisible by 4. On the other hand, if a and b are positive integers such that a > band 4Ia-b, then for positive integer n we have Slna-nb • Indeed, we have a = b+4k, where k is a positive integer, hence na_nb = n b(n4k-1). If Sin, then the first factor on the right is divisible by 5; if 5,t'n, then by the Fermat theorem we have n 4 = 1 (mod 5), which implies n4k == 1 (mod 5), and the second factor on the right-hand side of our equality is divisible by S. We proved, therefore, that if a and b are positive integers, a > b, and 4Ia-b, then for positive integers n we have SlnQ-n\", and of course, we must also have 51(n+20)Q-nb • In particular, for a = (n+20)11+20 and b = nil, we have, as shown above, 4Ia-b, hence 51 (n+20)(n+20j'+20 -nllll. Since the right- hand side is always even (as nand n+20 are either both even or both odd), we have, for positive integers n, the relation 101 (n+20)<n+20)n+2o _nnll , which shows that the numbers (n+20)(n+20)11+20 and nnll have the same last digit. The sequence of last digits of numbers nllll (n = 1, 2, ... ) is therefore, periodic; the period is pure, and consists of at most 20 terms. I t is easy to I see that the period consists of exactly 20 terms, equal to 1, 6, 7, 6, 5, 6, 3, 4, 9, 0, 1, 6, 3, 6, 5, 6, 3, 4, 9, O. 214 .. Let m be an arbitrary positive integer. Let us partition the digits of I the given infinite decimal fraction into blocks of m digits each; we shall have infinitely many such blocks. On the other hand, there are 10 m different I sequences formed of m digits; this number being finite, we conclude that at I least one of them must be repeated an infinite number of times. i ~/- I REMARK. For irrational numbers V 2, 1t or e, we do not even know which I digit will be repeated in the decimal expansion an infinite number of times; f it is easy to show that for each of these n~mbers there exist at least two . such digits. ; 215. If 3 2k = (n+l)+(n+2)+ ... +(n+3k), then we have 3 2k = 3 kn+ I +!3k (3k +l), which gives n = !(3k -l). Thus, the number 3 2k is a sum of 3 k terms, equal to consecutive positive integers, the least of them being n+l = !(3k +l). We have, for example, for k = 1, 2 and 3: 3 2 = 2+3+4, 3 4 = 5+6+ ... +13, 3 6 = 14+15+ ... +40. See Khatri [12]. 216. As we know, if a and b are real numbers such that b-a > 1, then between a and b there is at least one integer; in fact, such an integer equals. I SOLUTIONS 107 for instance [a] + I, where [x] denotes the greatest integer not exceeding x. Indeed, we have a < [a]+1 ~ a+l < b (since b-a > 1). Let s be an integer > I, and let 1 this number will be real and positive. Thus, for integer n > P., we shall have 1 n>~---- (y2-1)' ' which implies that hence .sr- 1 ., n > .sf ., 2-1 and yn(V2-1) >1 Thus, there exists a positive integer k such that Ylt < k fit < k < Y2n, which yields n < k S < 2n. As m. we may take number Vt.]+ l. For s = 2, we have Vt2] = 5, and already between 5 and 10 there lies a square number, namely 32, while between 4 and 8 there is no square number. Thus, the least m2 is 5. Similarly, we easily compute that the least num- ber m3 is 33. 217. Let m be an arbitrary positive integer. By the Chinese remainder theorem, there exists a positive integer x such that x == Pi-i+l (modpt) for i = 1,2, .. , m, (1) where Pi denotes the ith prime. The sequence of m consecutive integers x, x+ + I, ... , x+m-l has the desired property since by (1), for i = 1,2, ... , m we have x+i~ 1 = pfki+pi> where k i is an integer. This number will there- fore be divisible by Pi but not divisible by pr, hence x+i-l cannot be a power with exponent > 1 of any positive integer. 218. Un = 3\"-1 for n = 1,2, .... Easy proof by induction. 219. Un = (2-n)a+(n-l)b for n = 1,2, .... Easy proof by induction. 220. Un = (-1)\"[(n-2)a+(n-l)b] for n = 1,2, .... We easily check that the formula holds for n = 1 and n = 2. Assuming that for some n the formula is valid for u\" and U,,+!, we easily check, using the fact that U,,+2 = -(u n+2un+l), that the formula is valid for U,,+2. Thus, the proof follows by induction. 108 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY • In particular, if a --.:.. 1, b = -1, we obtain Un = (_I)n+l, and for a·:= 1, b = -2, we obtain Un = (_I)n+ln. 221.

We easily check that both these numbers satisfy the desired condition. Fr?w this condition for n = 1 it follows that aa = a. Thus, if a were an integer ~ 2; we would have aa > a 2 > a, which is impossible. If we had a ~ - 2, 'we would also have laDI = l/Iapal < 1, which again is impossible since aD = a and a ~ -2 imply laDI = lal > 2. 223*. Let a and b be arbitrary positive integers, and let c 2 denote the greatest square divisor of a2+~2, that is, a 2+b2 = kc2 • Let x = a 2k, Y = b2k; we' have x+Y = a 2k+b2k = (a2+b2)k = (kC)2 while xy = (abk)2. We shall show that all pairs of positive integers, whose sum and product are squares, can be obtained in this manner for suitably chosen a and: h. Suppose that x+Y = r, xy = t 2, where Z and t are positive integers. Let d = (x, y) and let Cl denote the greatest square divisor of d; we have, there- fore: d = kcf, where k is a positive integer, not divisible by any square of an integer> 1. We have x = dXl, Y =dYl where (Xl' Yl) = 1 and from x+y = Z2 it follows that (Xl +Yl)d = Z2. Thus, d = kcilz2, and since k is not divisible by any square of an integer> 1, we find that kCllz, which implie.s that Z = kCtZl, where Zl is a positive integer. It follows that (Xl +Yl)d = X+ +Y = Z2 = k2crzr = kdzi, which implies that Xl+YI = kz{ and XIYl = t 2/d2 • Since (Xl' Yl) = I, it follows that the numbers Xl and Yl are squares, th~t is, Xl = ai, Yl = bi. Since X = dx! = k(clal)2, y = dYI = k(c1b1)2, putting a = Clat, b = clbt we get x = ka2, y = kb2, and a 2+b2 = (C1al)2+(Ctbt)2 = Cr(Xl+Yt) = k(CIZl)2; putting CIZt = C, we get a 2+b2 = kc'l; since tJte number k is not divisible by any square of ~an integer r > 1, the' number CZ is the greatest square divisor of a'Z + b 2 • .' All pairs of positive integers ~ 100 whose both sum and· product are squares are 2, 2; 5, 20; 8, 8; 10, 90; 18, 18; 20, 80; 9, 16; 32, 32; 50, 50; 72, 72; 2, 98; 98, 98; 36, 64. 224. There is only one such number, namely 10. In fact, if (2x-l)~'+ + (2x+ 1)2 = ty(y+I), then (2x+l)2-(8x)2 = 17, and the number 17 has only one representation as the difference of two squares of integers, namely 17 = 92-8 2• This yields 2y+l = 9, hence Y = 4 and ty = ty(y+I) ~ 10. SOLUTIONS 109 225*. We shall prove by induction with respect to n that the theorem of Hogatt holds for every positive integer :::::;; Un. It is true for n = 1 since Ul = I, and for n = 2 since U2 = 1. Let now n be an integer> 2, and suppose that every positive integer :::::;; Un is a sum of different terms of Fibonacci sequence. Let k denote an integer such that Un < k:::::;; Un+!' If we had k- -Un> Un-I> we would have Un+! ~ k > Un-l +Un = Un+h which is impos- sible. We have, therefore, 0 < k-u n :::::;; Un-to The positive integer k-u n is, by induction, equal to a sum of different terms of Fibonacci sequence, and in view ofk-un :::::;; Un-l < Un, the number Un does not appear in the repre- sentation. It follows that k = (k-un)+u\" is a sum of different terms of Fibonacci sequence, which completes the proof of Hogatt theorem. We have 1 = Ut. 2 = Uh 3 = U. = Ul+Uh 4 = Ut+u., 5 = Us = U3+U4, 6 = Ul+US, 7 = U3+US, 8 = U6 = u.+us, 9 = Ul+U6, 10 = U3+U6. 226. We shall proceed by induction. Our formula is valid for n = 2 since 12 = 1·2+(-1). Suppose that our formula holds for an integer n ~ 2. We have, therefore, u~ = Un_lun+i+(-lt- 1. It follows that which proves the formula for n+ 1. 227. Let us notice first that from the identity it follows that every integer dividible by 6 is a sum of four cubes of integers. Since for every integer k and positive integer n, for r = 0, 1,2,3,4, 5 each of the numbers 6k+r-(6n+r)3 is divisible by 6 (as 61r3- r for integer r), it follows that every integer can be in infinitely many ways represented as a sum of five cubes of integers. REMARK. It is conjectured (and this conjecture was checked for all pos- itive integers < 1000) that every integer can be represented in infinitely many ways as a sum of four cubes of integers; see Schinzel, Sierpinski [21] and Demjanenko [6]. 228. The solution follows immediately from the identity 110 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 229. The proof follows immediately from the following two identities valid for integer t > 8: (t-8)2+(t-l)2+(t+ 1)2+(t+8)2 = (t-7)2+(t-4)2+(t+4)2+(t+ 7)2 and (t-8)3+(t-l)3+(t+ 1)3+(t+8)3 = (t-7)3+(t-4)3+(t+4)3+(t+ 7)3. 230. Suppose that for some positive integers m we have 4m ·7 = Ql+ +b 2+c2+d 2 , where at least one of the numbers a, b, c, d, say a, is ~ 0 and < 2 m - I • We cannot have a = 0 since in this case 4n&·7 would be a sum of three squares of integers, which is impossible (see, for instance, W. SierpiIi- ski, [37, p. 363, Theorem 3]). We have therefore m > 1 and a = 2k(2t-l), where k is a non-negative integer ~ m-2, and t is a positive integer. It follows that 4m ·7-[2k (2t-l)]2 = 4k [4 m- k ·7-(8u+l)] = 4k (8v+7), where u and v are integer (since k ~ m-2, which implies that m-k ~ 2), and we have 4k(8v+ 7) = b2+c2+tP, which is impossible. REMARK. One can easily prove that the number 4m. 7 (where m is a po- sitive integer) has at least one representation as a sum of four squares of integers since 4m .7 = (2m)2+C2m)2+C2m)2+C2m+l)2. 231. We easily check that the first six integers> 2, which are sums of two cu~es of positive integers are 1 3+2 3 = 9, 23+2 3 = 16, 1 3+3 3 = 28, 2 3+3 3 = 35,33+3 3 = 54, 1 3+43 = 65. None of the numbers 9, 16,28, 35, and 54 is a sum of two squares of integers, ·while 65 = 12+82• Thus, the least integer > 2 which is a sum of two squares of integers and a sum of two cubes of positive integers is 65. To show that there exists infinitely many~positive integers which are sums of two squares and sums of two cubes of two relatively prime positive in- tegers, it suffices to note that for positive integer k we have 1 +26k = 1 2+(23k)2 = 1 3+(22k)3. 232. For instance, the number 1 +2 S! has this property since kls! for k = 1, ... , s. Of course, instead of s! we could take the number [1, 2, ... , s]. 233*. For instance, aU numbers of the form 6·8\" (n = 0, I, 2, ... ) have the desired property. In fact, no such number is a sum of cubes of two pos- SOLUTIONS 111 itive integers, as in the case of even n, this number gives the remainder 6 upon division by 9, while in case of odd n, it gives the remainder 3 (since 8 == -1 (mod 9». On the other hand, every cube of an integer gives the re- mainder 0, 1, or -1 upon dividing by 9, hence a sum of two cubes can give only the remainder 0, 1, -1, 2 or - 2, and it cannot give the remainder 3 or 6 (nor 4 or 5). On the other hand, we easily check that 6 = (17/21)3+(37/21)3, which gives • ft = (17.2ft )3 (37.2ft )3 6 8 21 + 21 . Thus, the numbers 6·8ft (n = 0, 1, ... ) are cubes of two positive rational numbers. 234*. Proof due to A. Schinzel. For instance, all numbers of the form 7· 8ft (n = 0, 1,2, ... ) have the desired property. In fact, on one hand we have 7· 8ft = (2ft +1)3_(2ft)3 for n = 0, 1,2, ... ; on the other hand we shall prove that none of the numbers 7 . 8ft (n = 0, 1,2, ... ) is a sum of two cubes of positive integers. We easily check that the assertion is true for n = ° and n = 1. Suppose now that there exists a positive integer n such that 7 . 8ft is a sum of two cubes of positive integers, and let n be the least of such numbers; we have, therefore, n ;;:. 2, and where x and yare positive integers. Since the left-hand side :d even, x and yare either both even or both odd. If they are both odd, r-xy+y2 is odd, and as the left-hand side has only odd divisors 1 and 7, we must have either r-xy+y2 = 1 or x2_xy+y2 = 7. In the first case we would have x 3+ +y3 = x+y, and since x and yare positive integers, this implies that x = y = 1, hence 7· 8ft = 2, which is impossible. If x2_xy+y2 = 7, then which yields 3r ~ 28 and 3y2 ~ 28, hence x ~ 3, y ~ 3. Thus, x 3 + y3 ~ 54, which is impossible, as X3+y3 = 7· 8ft ;;:. 7 . 82• Thus, x and yare both even, x = 2x1,y = 2YI, where Xl and YI are positive integers, and in view of 7· 8ft = X3+y3 we have 7·8\"-1 = x~+yf.· con- trary to the definition of the number n. 112 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY We proved, therefore, that the numbers 7 · 8 ft (n = 0, I, 2, ... ) have the desired property. REMARK. It has been proved that there exist infinitely many positive integers n not divisible by any cube of an integer > 1, such that they cannot be represented as sums of two cubes of rational numbers, but the proof is difficult. Such numbers ~ 50 are 3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 14, 18, 21, 23, 25, 29, 36, 38, 39, 41, 44,45,46,47. The number 22 is a sum of two cubes of ration- al numbers, but with large denominators: 22 = (17299)3 + (25469)3 9954 9954· See [23, p. 301, and tables on pp. 354 and 357]. 235* . Proof due to A. Schinzel. Numbers of the form (2k _I)· 2 nk for n = 0, I, 2, ... have the desired property. We obviously have (2k-l)2nk = (2 ft + 1)k_2 I1k and it remains to show that the equation (1) has no positive integer solutions u and v. This is true for n = 0 since lk+lk < 2k_1 < 2k+lk. Suppose that there exist positive integers n for which equation (1) has a solu- tion in positive integers u and 'iJ, and let n be the least of such numbers. If u and v were both even, u = 2Ul, V = 2Vl, we would have, by (1): (2k_l)2(1I-1)k = t4+~ contrary to the definition of the number n. Since the left-hand side of (1) is even, both numbers u and v have to be odd. Suppose that k is odd and > 3. From t?e formula Uk+Vk + = ,}-1-zl-2v+ri'-3v2- ... +V\"-l u 'lJ where the right-hand side contains k terms, all of them odd, it follows that the left-hand side is odd; since this number is a divisor of (2k_l)2nk, we must have SOLUTIONS We may assume that u ~ v, which implies k+ k U v 2 k-l + ~v , u v 113 and consequently Vk- 1 < 2k; thus v < 2k /(k-l) < 3 (because k > 3). Since k is odd, we have v = 1, and :!:k = ::: ~ t/'-2(u-l) > (U-l)k-l, It follows that (u-l )k-l < 2\\ which yields u-l < 3, hence, in view of the fact that u is odd, U = 1 or u = 3. The relation u = 1 is impossible since we would then have Uk+Vk = 2, contrary to (1). The relation U = 3 is impossible, too, since it would yield which is > 2k_1 (for k > 3). tl'+vk u+v Suppose now that k is an even positive integer. Since u and v are odd, the number ri'+vk gives the remainder 2 upon division by 4, which is im- possible since the left-hand side of (I) is divisible by 4. This completes the proof. 236*. Proof due to A. Rotkiewicz. If 21n, then for positive integers k and I the number (2k+ 1)n+(21+ l)n is a sum of two nth powers of positive integers; as a number of the form 4t+2, it is not a difference of two squares; since 21n, it is not a difference of two nth powers of positive integers, either. On the other hand, if 2,r n, then the numbers (2 11+ 1)211k = (2k+l)n+(2k)n, where k = 0, 1, 2, ... , are not the differences of two nth powers of positive integers. In fact, if we had (2n+1)2nk = xll_yn for positive integer x and y with x > y, then the numbers Xl = x/(x, y) and Yl = y/(x, y) would be positive integers, and being relatively prime, could not be both even. It easily follows that 2,r (~-yi)/(Xl-Yl) and since we must have 114 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY which implies that We have, however, Xl II l-Yl > ~-l~ 3n-1 XI-YI (since we cannot have Xl = 2, for then we would have Yl = 1, and 2\"-112 11+1, which is impossible). We would therefore have 3 n- 1 < 2 n+l, which is impossible for n ~ 3. 237. We shall use the well-known formula rZ+22+ ... +n2 = n(n+l)6(2n+l) . We have to find the least integer n > 1 such that n(n+l)(2n+l) = 6m2 where m is a positive integer. We shall distinguish six cases: 1. n = 6k, where k is a positive integer. Our equation takes on the form k(6k+l) (12k+l) = m2• The factors on the left-hand side are pairwise relatively prime, hence they all must be squares. If k = 1, then 6k + 1 is not a square. The next square after 1 is 4. If k = 4, we have 6k+ 1 = 52, 12k+ 1 = 72, and consequently, for n ~ 6k = 24 the sum 12+22+ ... +242 is a square of a positive integer, 70. 2. n = 6k+ 1, where k is a positive integer. In this case we have (6k+l) (3k+l) (2k+l) = m2, and each of the numbers 2k+l, 3k+l, and 6k+l (which are pairwise relatively prime) must be a square. The least k for which the number 2k+l is a square is k = 4; in this case, however, we have n = 6k+l > 24. 3. n = 6k+2, where k is an integer ~ o. We have in this case (3k+l) (2k+l) (12k+5) = m2, and the numbers 3k+l, 2k+l, and 12k+5 (as pairwise relatively prime) must be squares. If we had k = 0, the number 12k+5 would not be a SOLUTIONS 115 square. On the other hand, for positive integer k, we have, as before, k ~ 4, hence n = 6k+2 > 24. 4. n = 6k+3, where k is an integer ~ O. In this case we have (2k+ I) (3k+2) (12k+ 7) = m2; we easily see that the numbers 2k+l, 3k+2, and 12k+7 are pairwise relatively prime, hence they must be squares. We cannot have k = 0, 1,2 or 3 since in this case the number 3k+2 would not be a square. We have, therefore, k ~ 4, which implies n = 6k+3 > 24. 5. n = 6k+4, where k is an integer ~ O. We have in this case (3k+2) (6k+5) (4k+3) = m2, where the numbers 3k+2, 6k+5, and 4k+3 are pairwise relatively prime, hence they must be squares. We cannot have k = 0, 1,2,3 since then the number 3k+2 would not be a square. We have, therefore, k ~ 4, and consequently n = 6k+4 > 24. 6. n = 6k+5, where k is an integer ~ O. We have in this case (6k+5) (k+l) (12k+11) = m2, and the numbers 6k+5, k+l and 12k+11 are pairwise relatively prime, hence they all must be squares. We cannot have k = 0, 1,2, 3 since in this case the number 6k+5 would not be a square. We have, therefore, k ~ 4, and n = 6k+5 > 24. We proved, therefore, that the least integer n > 1 for which 12+ +22+ ... +n2 is a square is n = 24. REMARK. It is rather difficult to show that n = 24 is the only positive integer for which 12+2z+ ... +n2 is a square. On the other hand, the sum 13+23+ ... +n3 is a square for every positive integer n, but one can prove that it is not a cube of a positive integer for any n. 238. All positive integers except 1,2,3,5,6,7,10,11,13,14,15,19,23. It is easy show that none of the above thirteen numbers is a sum of a finite number of proper powers (these are successively equal to 22,2 3,3 2,2 4 = 42, 52, 33,2 5,6 2, ••• ). Now let n be a positive integer different from any of the above thirteen numbers. 116 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY If n = 4k, where k is a positive integer, then the number n is a sum of k numbers 22. If n = 4k+ 1, then, in view of n ::F 1 and n ::F 5, we can assume that k ~ 2; then n = 4k+l= 32+4(k-2), where k-2 is an integer ~ o. If k = 2, then n = 32, while if k > 2, then n = 32+22+ ... +22, where the number of terms equal to 22 is k-2. If n = 4k+2, then since n is different from numbers 6, 10, and 14, we have k ~ 4 and n = 4k+2 = 32+32+4(k-4). Again it follows that the number n has the desired property. Finally, if n = 4k+3, then since n::F 3,7,11,15,19, and 23, we have k ~ 6 and n = 32+32+32+4(k-6), which again implies that n has the desired property. 238a. We have 1 = 32_23, 2 = 33_5 2, 3 = 27_5 3, 4 = 53_112 = 23 _ _ 22, 5 = 32-22, 7 = 27_112, 8 = 24-2\\ 9 = 52_4 2, 10 = 133-3 7. REMARK. We do not know whether the number 6 is a difference of two proper powers. It has been conjectured that every positive integer has a finite ~ 0 number of representations as the difference of two proper powers. 239. If a2+b2 = c2, where a, b, and c are positive integers, then multi- plying both sides of this equality by the number a2(4I1Z-I)b411(2n+ 1)(11-1 )C4I1Z(2n-I) we obtain [(a2nb(2n+I)(I-I)c\"(2n-I»2n]2+ [(a2n+lb2nZ-lc2nZ)2n-1]2 = [(a2n-lb2n(II-I)ClIlZ-2n+ 1)2n+ 1]2 . 240. There is only one such positive integer, namely n = 5. We easily check that this number satisfies the equation (n-l)!+1 = n2, and we also check that the numbers n = 2, 3, and 4 do not satisfy this equation. For n = 6 we obtain n2 > 6n-4 and we show by induction that the same inequality holds for every integer n ~ 6. If n is an integer ~ 6, then (n-I) !+1 > 2(n-l) (n-2) = 2(nZ-3n+2) > n2 since n2 > 6n-4. Thus, we cannot have (n-I) '+1 = n2 for integer n ~ 6. REMARK. We know only two positive integers n > 5 such that nZI(n-l) '+1, SOLUTIONS 117 namely numbers 13 and 563, and we do not know whether there are more such numbers, or whether there are finitely many of them. We know that every such number must be a prime. Let us also note that for n = 5,6, and 8 the numbers (n-I) '+1 are squares (of numbers 5, 11, and 71 respectively), and we do not know whether there are any other such numbers. 241. If for some integer n > I we had tn- 1 tn = m 2 where m is a positive integer, we would have (n2-1)n 2 = (2m)2, and since n2-1 and n2 are rel- atively prime, each of them would have to be a square, which is impossible since there are no two squares of integers, whose difference would be equal to one. Let now n be a given positive integer. The equation r-n(n+l)y2 = 1 has infinitely many solutions in positive integers x and y. In fact, one of these solutions is x = 2n+ 1 and y = 2, while if for some positive integers x and y we have x 2-n(n+l)y2 = 1, then also [(2n+ l)x+2n(n+ l)y]2- n(n+ 1) [2x+ (2n+ l)y]2 = 1. If x and yare positive integers such that x 2-n(n+ l)y2 = 1, then tnt2tny2 = tntny2(2tny2+1) = t;y2,x2 = (tnyX)2. For instance, for n = 2 we get t3t24 = 3OZ, t312400 = (3 '20·49)2, and so on. 242. We have 210 = 1024> 103• It follows that 21945 = 25(21°)194 > 10. 10J.194 = 10583• Thus, 221945 > 210583 = (210)10582 > 103.10582, and the number of digits of the last number is greater than 10582. The number 5 . 21947+1 has obviously the same number of digits as the number 5 . 21947 = 10 . 21946, and since the decimal logarithm of 2 equals log102 = 0,30103 ... , we have 21946 = 101946loglOz = 10585,8 ... , and it follows that our number has 586 digits. REMARK. The number F1945 is the greatest known composite Fermat number. 118 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY 243. The number 211213 -1 has (in decimal system) the same number of digits as 211213, as it differs only by one from the latter. Thus, it suffices to compute the number of decimal digits of 211213. If a positive integer n is of the form n = lOX where x is real (of course, x ~ 0), then, denoting by [xl the greatest integer ~ x, we have lOX ~ n < lO[X] +1 , and it follows that the number n has [xl + 1 decimal digits. We have 211213 = 10112131011102, and since 10g102 = 0,30103 ... , we have 3375 < 11213log102 < 3376. Thus, the number 211213 (hence also 211213_1) has 3376 decimal digits. 244. We have 211212(211213_1) = 222425_211212. We compute first the number of digits of the number 222425. Since 22425 log102 = 22425 ·0,30103 ... = 6750,597 ... , we obtain (see the solution of Problem 243) the result that the number 222425 has 6751 digits, and we have 222425 = 106750 • 10°·597. Since 10°,597 ... > 101/2 > 3, we get 106751 > 222425 > 3 . 10675°, which shows that the first digit of 222425 is ~ 3. Thus, if we subtract from the number 222425 the number 211213, which has smaller number of digits, we do not change the number of digits of the latter. Consequently, the number 211212(211213_1) has 6751 digits. 245. We have 3! = 6,3!! = 6! = 720,3!!! = 720! > 99! 100621 > 101242. Thus, the number 3!!! has more than thousand digits. By the well-know theorem (see, for instance, Sierpinski [37, p. 131, Theo- rem 6]), if m is a positive integer and p is a prime, then the largest power of p dividing m! is where [xl denotes the greatest integer ~ x. It follows that the largest power of 5 which divides 3!!! = 720! is [ 72°]+[72°]+[ 7201+[72°] = 144+28+5+1 = 178 5 25 125 625 ' while the largest power of 2 dividing 720! is still greater (since already [ 7~0] = 360). It follows that the number 3!!! has 178 zeros at the end of its decimal expansion. 246*. The solution found by A. Schinzel. SOLUTIONS 119 For positive integers m which are powers of primes (with positive integer exponents), and only for such numbers. In fact, if m = l', where p is a prime and k is a positive integer, then for f(x) = )(PI,!'>, in case p ..r x, by the Euler theorem, we have f(x) == 1 (mod pk), while in case pix, in view of rp(pk) ~ pk-l ~ k (which can be easily shown by induction), we have rlX', and consequently, p\"IXApk>. Thus,j(x) == 0 (modpk). If m is an integer> 1, and m is not a power of a prime, then m has at least two different prime divisors, p and q =F p. Suppose that f(x) is a poly- nomial with integer coefficients, and that there exist integers Xl and Xz such that f(XI) == 0 (mod m), while f(X2) == 1 (mod m). We shall have, therefore, also (in view of plm and qlm) the relations f(xJ == 0 (mod p) and f(Xl) == 1 (mod q). Since p and q are different primes, by the Chinese remainder theorem there exists an integer Xo such that Xo == XI (mod p) and Xo == X2 (mod q) It follows that f(xo) == j(XI) == 0 (mod p) and f(xo) == j(X2) == 1 (mod q). The first of these congruences implies that we cannot have f(xo) == 1 (mod m). Similarly, the second congruence implies that we cannot have f(xo) == 0 (mod m). Consequently, f(xo) does not give the remainder 0 upon dividing by m, nor does it give the remainder I. Thus, if m is not a power of a prime, then there is no polynomial f(x) with integer coefficients which would satisfy the required conditions. 247. We easily see that D < [(4m2 + I)n+m+ 1]2, hence the integral part of the number YD equals to ao = (4m2+1)n+m, which implies that D-~ = 4mn+ I and 1 )lD+ao Xl= = . YD-ao D-ao Since ao is the integral part of the number V D, we have ao < v' D < ao+ 1, which yields 2ao < VD+ao < 2ao+ I and since ao = (4mn+ I)m+n, we find 2n VD+llo 2n+1 2m+ 4mn+ 1 < D-cro < 2m+ 4mn+ I ; since (2n+ 1)/(4mn+ 1) ~ I, we see that the integral part of the number Xl = (V D+ao)/(D-~) is equal to al = 2m. We have, therefore Xl = al+l/x2, and X2 = I/(xl-al)' 120 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY On the other hand, yD+ao Xl-at = 4mn+l 2m = YD- [(4mn+ l)m-n] 4mn+l ' and consequently, We easily check that which yields (4mn+l) [VD+(4mn+l)m-n] D- [(4mn+l)m-n]Z xl = VD+(4mn+l)m-n 4mn+l and since ao < yD < ao+l, or we get (4mn+l)m+n < VD < (4mn+l)m+n+l, 1 2m < Xz < 2m+ 4mn+l Consequently, the integral part of Xz equals az = 2m. We have, therefore, X2 = az+ l/x3> which gives X3 = 1/(x2-a2). However, yD+(4mn+l)m-n 2 _ Y:D-(4mn+l)m-n X2- aZ = 4mn+l m - 4mn+l . Consequently, we have - (4mn+l) [vD+(4mn+l)m+n] _ :ID (4 +1) + - 'D+ X3 - D-[(4mn+l)m+n]Z - J' + mn m n - V ao which implies that the integral part of X3 is 2ao, and that the number VI> has the expansion into the arithmetic continued fraction with the three- term period, formed of numbers 2m, 2m and 2ao. REMARK. One can show that all positive integers D for which the ex- pansion of y D into arithmetic continued fraction has a three:-term period are just the above considered numbers D. See Sierpinski [32]. SOLUTIONS 121 24S. Computing the values of functions cp(n) and den) for n ~ 30 from the well-known formulae for these functions. i.e. if n = qf'q~2 ... q~', then we easily see that the only values n ~ 30 for which cp(n) = den) are n = 1, 3, S, 10, IS, 24, and 30. We have here cp(I) = d(l) = 1, cp(3) = d(3) = 2, cp(8) = deS) = 4, cp(lO) = d(lO) = 4, cp(IS) = d(IS) = 6, cp(24) = d(24) = 8, cp(30) = d(30) = 8. REMARK. It was proved that there are no other solutions of the equation cp(n) = den) in positive integers n. It can be shown that for n > 30 we have cp(n) > den); see P6lya and Szego [15, Section VIII, problem 45]. 249. We easily check that for positive integer k and integer s;?: 0 we have (I.!) ( _1 ) ( _1 ) _ s+ 1 + k 1+ k+l ... 1+ k+s - 1+ k . (1) A positive rational number w-l can be always represented in the form w- -1 = min where m and n are positive integers (not necessarily relatively prime) and n > g. It suffices to take k = nand s = m-l; then the right- hand side of (1) will be equal to w. In this way we obtain the desired de- composition for the number w. 250* . We shall first prove that every integer k ;?: 0 can be in at least one way represented in the form (1) where m is a positive integer, and the signs + and - are suitably chosen. The assertion holds for the number 0 since 0 = 12+22_32+42_52_62+72. It is also true for the numbers 1, 2, and 3 since 1 = 12, 2 = _12_22_32+42, 3 = -12+22,4 = _12_22+32. Now, it suffices to prove that our theorem is true for every positive integer k, and since it is true for numbers 0, 1, 2, and 3, it suffices to prove that if the theorem is true for an integer k ;?: 0, it is also true for the number k+4. Suppose, then, that the theorem is true for the number k; thus, there exists 122 250 PROBLEMS IN NUMBER THEORY a positive integer m such that with the suitable choice of signs + and - we have relation (1). Since we have (m+l)2-(m+2)2-(m+3)2+(m+4)2 = 4, (2) it follows from (1) that k+4 = ±12±22± ... ±m2+(m+l)2-(m+2)2-(m+3)2+(m+4)2, that is, our theorem holds for the number k+4. Thus, it is true for every integer. It follows from (2) that for every positive integer m we have (m+I)2-(m+2)2-(m+3)2+(m+4)2-(m+S)2+ +(m+6)2+(m+7)2_(m+8)2 = o. Thus, in (I) we can replace the number m by m+8, hence also by m+16, and so on. This shows that every integer k can be in infinitely many ways represented in the form (I), which was to be proved.
