We will focus on developing math- ematical creativity and problem-solving skills in the realms of algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory, in contrast to the rote applications found in most American high school math classrooms. Thus you should expect to really be challenged: the hardest problems on math com- petitions often require lots of experimentation with various approaches, and there wouldn’t be a point in doing them if your ﬁrst try always worked, anyway. On the other hand, with enough dedication and hard work, you will be able to improve signiﬁcantly, learn some interesting ideas, and hopefully have a lot of fun too along the way. After all, pure math is more or less the epitome of intellectual curiosity—it is not restrained the slightest by the ugliness of reality, and so every new beautiful or surprising result is an untainted jewel of logic and even a work of art in itself! We hope that this elegance so prevalent in math will motivate you to continue seeking its endless riches. 1 Discussion Problems 1. Find a closed form expression for 1 + 2 + · · · + n. 2.
