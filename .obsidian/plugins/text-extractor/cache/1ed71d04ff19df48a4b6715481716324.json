Find the derivatives (if they exist) of the following functions: (a) f (x) = x|x|, x ∈ R (b) f (x) = log |x|, x ∈ R\\{0} (c) f (x) = ⌊x⌋ sin 2(πx), x ∈ R (d) f (x) = (x − ⌊x⌋) sin 2(πx), x ∈ R 2. Study the diﬀerentiability of the following functions f (x) =    x sin(1/x) if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 , g(x) =    x2 sin(1/x) if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 . 3. Study diﬀerentiability of the following function f (x) =  | | tan −1 x if |x| ≤ 1, π 4 |x| x + x − 1 2 if |x| > 1. 4. Assume that f and g are diﬀerentiable at a. Find the following limits (a) lim x→a xf (a) − af (x) x − a , (b) lim x→a f (x)g(a) − f (a)g(x) x − a , (c) lim n→∞ n (f ( a + 1 n ) + f ( a + 2 n ) + · · · + f ( a + k n ) − kf (a)) . 5. Assume that f (0) = 0 and that f (x) is diﬀerentiable at x = 0. Find the value of lim x→0 1 x (f (x) + f ( x 2 ) + f ( x 3 ) + · · · + f ( x 2019 )) . 6. Let f : R → R be a function continuous at 0, such that lim x→0 f (x) x2 = ℓ. Prove that f (x) must be diﬀerentiable at x = 0 and also ﬁnd f ′(0). 7. Suppose that a1, a2, . . . , an are n real numbers such that |a1 sin x + a2 sin 2x + · · · + an sin nx| ≤ | sin x| holds for every x ∈ R. Prove that, |a1 + 2a2 + · · · + nan| ≤ 1. 1 8. Let f and g be two functions such that g(f (x)) is well-deﬁned (in an open neighborhood of a). Suppose that f ′(a) and g′(f (a)) both exist. The goal of this exercise is to prove the chain rule: (g ◦ f ) ′(a) = g′(f (a))f ′(a). (a) Assuming that f (x) ̸= f (a) holds for all x ∈ (a − ϵ, a + ϵ)\\{a} (for some ϵ > 0), prove that (g ◦ f ) ′(a) = g′(f (a))f ′(a). (b) Deﬁne Q(x) =  | | g(f (x)) − g(f (a)) f (x) − f (a) if f (x) ̸= f (a), g′(f (a)) if f (x) = f (a). Show that g(f (x)) − g(f (a)) x − a = Q(x) · f (x) − f (a) x − a holds for every x ̸= a, regardless of whether f (x) = f (a) or not. (c) Show that lim x→a Q(x) = g′(f (a)). (d) Hence complete the proof of (g ◦ f )′(a) = g′(f (a))f ′(a). 9. Give an example where g′(f (a)) does not exist, but (g ◦ f ) ′(a) exists. 10. Suppose that g ◦ f is diﬀerentiable at a, g is diﬀerentiable at f (a), with g′(f (a)) ̸= 0, and f is continuous at a. Then show that f must be diﬀerentiable at a and f ′(a) = (g ◦ f ) ′(a) g′(f (a)) . 11. (Inverse Function Theorem) Let g : C → D be an invertible function, with inverse g−1 : D → C. Suppose that c ∈ C, and d ∈ D are such that d = g(c). If g is diﬀerentiable at c, g−1 is continuous at d, and g′(c) ̸= 0, then show that g−1 must be diﬀerentiable at d and (g−1)′(d) = 1/g′(c). 12. Show that the conclusion of the last problem does not hold if g′(c) = 0. 13. Calculate the limit lim n→∞ ( f (a + 1 n ) f (a) )n. 14. Determine, with proof, the value of lim n→∞ tan n ( π 4 + 1 n ) . 15. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive real numbers. Show that, lim x→0 ( ax 1 + ax 2 + · · · + a x n n )1/x = n√a1a2 · · · an. 2 16. The goal of this exercise is to show that d dx (xr) is rxr−1 for any r ∈ Q. (a) Show (from deﬁnition) that the derivative of xn is nxn−1 where n ∈ Z. (b) For any n ∈ N, ﬁnd the derivative of x1/n. (Note, the function x1/n is usually restricted to positive values of x only, in order to avoid things like (−1) 1/4.) (c) Show that the derivative of xr is rxr−1, for any rational number r. 17. Deﬁne f (x) = x√3 for x > 0. Is it true that f ′(x) = √3x√3−1? If yes, can you give a complete proof of this? 18. Suppose f : (a, b) → R is diﬀerentiable at c ∈ (a, b). Prove that lim h→0 f (c + h) − f (c − h) 2h exists and equals f ′(c). Give an example of a function where this limit exists, but the function is not diﬀerentiable at x = c. 19. Let f be diﬀerentiable at a and let {xn} and {zn} be two sequences converging to a such that xn < a < zn for every n ≥ 1. Prove that, lim n→∞ f (zn) − f (xn) zn − xn = f ′(a). (Hint: Think intuitively; what does the above quotient represent?) 20. Let f be diﬀerentiable at a and let {xn} and {zn} be two sequences converging to a such that xn ̸= a, zn ̸= a and xn ̸= zn for every n ≥ 1. Furthermore, assume that the limit lim n→∞ f (zn) − f (xn) zn − xn exists (ﬁnitely). Is it necessary that the above limit equals f ′(a)? 21. Find a function which is diﬀerentiable everywhere except at exactly 5 points. 22. Deﬁne a function f : (0, 2) → R as: f (x) = { x2 if x is rational 2x − 1 if x is irrational . Determine all points where f is diﬀerentiable. 23. Can you give an example of a function which is diﬀerentiable at exactly 3 points? 24. Construct a continuous function f : R → R which is not diﬀerentiable at the integers only (i.e., f ′(a) exists ⇐⇒ a /∈ Z). 3 25. Construct a function f : R → R which is diﬀerentiable at the integers only (i.e., f ′(a) exists ⇐⇒ a ∈ Z). 26. There exist functions that are continuous on R but not diﬀerentiable at any point! For example, Weierstrass function satisﬁes this property. Let W (x) be any function (e.g., Weier- strass function) which is continuous everywhere and diﬀerentiable nowhere. Show that the function ̃W (x) = (sin πx)W (x) is an example of a continuous function which is diﬀerentiable exactly at the integers (i.e., ̃W ′(a) exists iﬀ a ∈ Z). 27. (Leibnitz rule) Show that for any n ∈ N, the n-th derivative of (f g)(x) = f (x)g(x) is given by d n dxn (f g)\f \f \fx=a = n∑ k=0 ( n k ) f (k)(a)g(n−k)(a) Of course the above equation makes sense only when f (x), g(x) are both n-times diﬀeren- tiable. (Here f (k)(a) denotes the k-th derivative of f evaluated at x = a.) 28. Suppose that xf (x) = log x holds for all x > 0. Show that f (n)(1) = (−1)n−1n! ( 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n ) , where f (n)(a) denotes the n-th derivative of f evaluated at x = a. 29. Suppose that f, g are two diﬀerentiable functions such that f (x) > g(x) holds for every x ∈ R. Is it necessary that f ′(x) ≥ g′(x)? 30. Suppose that f is diﬀerentiable (on an interval I). Is it possible that (a) f is unbounded on I, but f ′ is bounded? (b) f is bounded on I, but f ′ is unbounded? 31. (Lagrange’s interpolation) Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n with n distinct real roots r1, . . . , rn and let Q(x) be a polynomial of degree at most n − 1. Prove that, Q(x) P (x) = n∑ k=1 Q(rk) P ′(rk)(x − rk) holds for any x ∈ R\\{r1, . . . , rn}. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
