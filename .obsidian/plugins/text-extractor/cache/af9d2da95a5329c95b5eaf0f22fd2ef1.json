Exploit the power of complex numbers in representing translations, rotations, and reﬂections, and use the nice formula for centroid and orthocenter. Problem 1. (Yug MO 1990) Let O and H be the circumcentre and orthocentre of △ABC respectively. Let Q be the reﬂection of H across O. Let T1, T2, T3 be the centroids of △BCQ, △CAQ and △ABQ. Prove that AT1 = BT2 = CT3 = 4 3 OA. Problem 2. (BMO 1984) Let ABCD be an cyclic quadrilateral and let HA, HB, HC, HD be the orthocentres of triangles BCD, CDA, DAB, and ABC respectively. Prove that the quadrilaterals ABCD and HAHBHCHD are congruent. Problem 3. Consider triangle ABC and its circumcircle S. Reﬂect the circle with respect to AB, AC, BC to get three new circles SAB, SBC, and SBC. Show that these three circles intersect at a common point and identify this point. Problem 4. (2000 St. Petersburg MO) The line T is tangent to the circumcircle of acute triangle ABC at B. Let K be the projection of the orthocenter of triangle ABC onto line T (K is the root of the perpendicular from the orthocenter to S). Let L be the midpoint of side AC. Show that the triangle BKL is isosceles. Problem 5. (Yug TST 1992) The squares BCDE, CAF G, and ABHI are constructed outside the triangle ABC. Let GCDQ and EBHP be parallelograms. Prove that AP Q is isosceles and ∠P AQ = π/2. Problem 6. (Yug MO 2003) Given triangle ABC, construct equilateral triangle ABC1, BCA1, CAB1 on the outside of ABC. Let P , Q denote the midpoints of C1A1 and C1B1 respectively. Let R be the midpoint of AB. Prove that triangle P QR is isosceles. Problem 7. (Napolean’s Triangle) Given triangle ABC, construct an equilateral triangle on the outside of each of the sides. Let P , Q, R be the centroids of these equilateral triangles, prove that triangle P QR is equilateral. 2 Straightforward Bashing These problems probably have other intended solutions, but they still can be solved by straightforward application of complex numbers. ∗Mostly copied from Yi Sun’s MOP 2007 notes, Marko Radovanovic’s notes in the IMO Compendium, Kun Y. Li’s notes in Mathematical Excalibur 9(1), and Mathlinks. 1 Problem 8. (Simson Line) Let Z be a point on the circumcircle of triangle ABC and P , Q, R be the feet of perpendiclars from Z to BC, AC, AB respectively. Prove that P , Q, R are collinear. (This line is called the Simson line of triangle ABC from Z.) Problem 9. Given cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, let P and Q be the reﬂection of C across lies AB and AD respec- tively. Prove that P Q passes through the orthocentre of triangle ABD. Problem 10. Let W1W2W3 be a triangle with circumcircle S, and let A1, A2, A3 be the midpoints of W2W3, W1W3, W1W2 respectively. From Ai drop a perpendicular to the line tangent to S at Wi. Prove that these perpendicular lines are concurrent and identify this point of concurrency. Problem 11. Let A0A1A2A3A4A5A6 be a regular 7-gon. Prove that 1 A0A1 = 1 A0A2 + 1 A0A3 . Problem 12. Given point P0 in the plane of triangle A1A2A3. Denote As = As−3, for s > 3. Construct points P1, P2, · · · sequentially such that point Pk+1 is Pk rotated 120◦ counter-clockwise around Ak+1. Prove that if P1986 = P0 then triangle A1A2A3 is isosceles. Problem 13. (MOP 2006) Point H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. Points D, E and F lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABC such that AD∥BE∥CF . Points S, T , and U are the respective reﬂections of D, E, F across the lines BC, CA and AB. Prove that S, T , U , H are cyclic. 3 Smart Bashing Although almost all geometry problems are doable with complex number bash, you should always try to simplify the problem ﬁrst by proving various properties of the given conﬁguration. This will drastically reduce the time of bashing. Also, try to set up your bash in the simplest way possible, such as to deﬁne some key line as the real axis. The following problems are probably too complex to bash (no pun intended) unless you simplify the problem ﬁrst. Problem 14. (2003 IMO, Problem 4) Let ABCD be a cyclic quadrilateral. Let P , Q, R be the feet of the perpen- diculars from D to the lines BC, CA and AB respectively. Show that P Q = QR iff the bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠ADC meet on AC. Problem 15. Let O be the circumcentre of triangle ABC. A line through O intersects sides AB and AC at M and N respectively. Let S and R be the midpoints of BN and CM , respectively. Prove that ∠ROS = ∠BAC. Problem 16. (IMO Shortlist 1992) Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral for which AC = BD. Equilateral trian- gles are constructed on the sides of the quadrilateral and pointing outward. Let O1, O2, O3, O4 be the centres of the triangles constructed on AB, BC, CD, and DA respectively. Prove that lines O1O3 and O2O4 are perpendicular. Problem 17. (USA TST 2006, Problem 6) Let ABC be a triangle. Triangles P AB and QAC are constructed outside of ABC such that AP = AB and AQ = AC and ∠BAP = ∠CAQ. Segments BQ and CP meet at R. Let O be the circumcentre of triangle BCR. Prove that AO ⊥ P Q. In an actual contest, I recommend that you do not start complex number bash before absolutely exhausting all other approaches. This is because although complex number bash always works in the end, the algebraic manipula- tions might take a few hours. Nevertheless, knowing how to complex number bash is nice because even the hardest problems can be done this way if you just keep going. Moreover, if you have already signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed the problem but can’t ﬁnish it off, complex number bash is a handy tool. With this powerful, universal tool at your disposal, you can tackle hard geometry problems with conﬁdence! 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
