As always, remember that these notes cover only a fraction of the subject, and you should ﬁnd more to read if you are serious about doing well at the IMO. In the case of inequalities, there are many extensive notes available online: • “Topics in Inequalities - Theorems and Techniques” by Hojoo Lee • “Olympiad Inequalities” by Thomas J. Mildorf • “Basics of Olympiad Inequalities” by Samin Riasat Just search for them on Google. There are some Canadian notes available here: http://sites.google.com/site/imocanada/. Let me also add a short word on notation. I will frequently write things like ∑ cyc a2b and ∑ sym a2b. These are best explained by example. For three variables a, b, c: ∑ cyc a 2b = a 2b + b 2c + c 2a, and ∑ sym a2b = a2b + b 2a + b 2c + c 2b + c 2a + a 2c, ∑ cyc abc = abc + bca + cab = 3abc, and ∑ sym abc = abc + bac + bca + cba + cab + acb = 6abc, ∑ cyc a 3 = a 3 + b 3 + c 3, and ∑ sym a3 = a3 + a3 + b 3 + b 3 + c 3 + c 3. If there are n variables, ∑ cyc will always have n terms, and you get from one term to the others by shifting which variable comes ﬁrst. The relative order stays the same though. On the other hand, ∑ sym will always have n! terms, and you get from one term to the others by trying all n! re-orderings of the variables (even if not all n variables appear in each term). This notation – called cyclic and symmetric sums – is a very convenient short-hand. Be sure to ask if you are confused! 2 The Tool Chest The ﬁrst step to solving inequality problems is learning the relevant theorems. Probably you have seen most of these before, but I will list them here for completeness. 1 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur 2.1 Try These First! AM-GM-HM: For x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥ 0, x1 + x2 + . . . + xn n ≥ n√x1x2 . . . xn ≥ n 1 x1 + 1 x2 + . . . + 1 xn . Equality holds if and only if x1 = x2 = . . . = xn. Cauchy-Schwarz: For x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥ 0 and y1, y2, . . . , yn ≥ 0: ( n∑ i=1 xi · yi )2 ≤ ( n∑ i=1 x2 i ) · ( n∑ i=1 y2 i ) . On contests, you will often want to use one of the two following forms instead: n∑ i=1 x2 i yi ≥ ( ∑n i=1 xi) 2 ∑n i=1 yi n∑ i=1 xi yi = n∑ i=1 x2 i xiyi ≥ ( ∑n i=1 xi) 2 ∑n i=1 xiyi . The ﬁrst of these two forms is sometimes called “Engel” form. In all cases, equality holds if and only if xi yi is the same for all i. 2.2 Plan B “H¨older”: For xi,j ≥ 0 with 1 ≤ i ≤ m and 1 ≤ j ≤ n: ( n∑ i=1 xi,1 · xi,2 · . . . · xi,m )m ≤ ( n∑ i=1 xm i,1 ) · ( n∑ i=1 xm i,2 ) · . . . · ( n∑ i=1 x m i,m ) . This inequality is a natural generalization of Cauchy-Schwarz, making it easy to remember and sometimes easy to use. The biggest trick is ﬁguring out what to call it. Some people say H¨older’s, but not everyone will recognize it by that name1. If you want to use it on a contest, you should 1Traditionally, H¨older’s inequality is stated as a weighted version of Cauchy-Schwarz: For any positive numbers (xi)n i=1, (yi)n i=1, p, q with p + q = 1, it is true that ∑n i=1 x p i yq i ≤ (∑n i=1 xi)p · (∑n i=1 yi)q. Do you see why these two formulations are equivalent? 2 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur state the full result ﬁrst. That way there will be no confusion. Rearrangement: Suppose x1 ≤ x2 ≤ . . . ≤ xn and y1 ≤ y2 ≤ . . . ≤ yn. If σ is an arbitrary permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. then: n∑ i=1 xi · yi ≥ n∑ i=1 xi · yσ(i) ≥ n∑ i=1 xi · yn+1−i. The main advantage of the rearrangement inequality is that it works even for negative numbers, something that is not true for most of the other theorems. Bear that in mind! Power-Mean: Deﬁne the order-p power mean of x1, x2, . . . , xn to be: ( xp 1 + xp 2 + . . . + xp n n )1/p if p ̸= 0 n√ x1 · x2 · . . . xn if p = 0. If x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥ 0 and p ≥ q, then the order-p power mean of x1, x2, . . . , xn is at least as large as the order-q power mean. Jensen: A continuous function f : [a, b] → R is called “convex” if f (x)+f (y) 2 ≥ f ( x+y 2 ) for all x, y. If f is convex, then for all x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ [a, b]: 1 n · n∑ i=1 f (xi) ≥ f ( x1 + x2 + . . . + xn n ) . If f (x)+f (y) 2 ≤ f ( x+y 2 ) for all x, y, then f is called “concave” and the opposite of this inequality is true. Jensen’s is most useful for people who know calculus, because you can prove a function f (x) is convex by calculating its second derivative and proving f ′′(x) > 0 for all x. Alternatively, you can just memorize some convex functions: • xr is convex for x ≥ 0 and r ̸∈ (0, 1) . • sin x is concave for x ∈ [0, π], while cos x is concave for x ∈ [−π/2, π/2]. • tan x is convex for x ∈ [0, π/2). • ex is convex for all x, while log x is concave for all x. • The sum of two convex functions is convex. 3 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur 2.3 The Rest Weighted AM-GM: If w1, w2, . . . , wn ≥ 0 satisfy w1 + w2 + . . . + wn = 1, and x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥ 0, then: w1 · x1 + w2 · x2 + . . . + wn · xn ≥ xw1 1 · xw2 2 · . . . · xwn n . For rational w1, w2, . . . , wn, this is equivalent to just repeating some terms in the regular AM-GM inequality. Using similar tricks, you can also get a weighted version of Jensen’s inequality. Muirhead: We say (a1, a2, . . . , an) majorizes (b1, b2, . . . , bn) if: • a1 ≥ a2 ≥ . . . ≥ an and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ . . . ≥ bn, • a1 + a2 + . . . + ak ≥ b1 + b2 + . . . + bk for k = 1, 2, . . . , n, and • a1 + a2 + . . . + an = b1 + b2 + . . . + bn. If (a1, a2, . . . , an) majorizes (b1, b2, . . . , bn) and x1, x2, . . . , xn ≥ 0, then: ∑ sym xa1 1 · xa2 2 · . . . x an n ≥ ∑ sym xb1 1 · xb2 2 · . . . · x bn n , Remember that the symmetric sum is taken over all n! permutations of x1, x2, . . . , xn. Muirhead is similar to coordinate geometry in many ways. Given an inequality, you can often expand it out, group terms, and then apply Muirhead without ever thinking. Just don’t make a mistake! The IMO jury is well aware of Muirhead however, and recent problems are not easily solved in this way. Schur: If x, y, z ≥ 0 and r > 0, then: xr(x − y)(x − z) + yr(y − z)(y − x) + zr(z − x)(z − y) ≥ 0. If r = 1, this simpliﬁes to: x 3 + y3 + z3 + 3xyz ≥ x2y + y2x + y2z + z2y + z2x + x2z. Equality holds if x = y = z, or if two values are equal and the third is zero. Schur’s inequality is not considered standard knowledge, and so you will never need it to solve a problem. However, it is an important tool if you decide to multiply an inequality out. It is one of 4 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur very few inequalities that can prove xyz is greater than something else. 3 The Many Faces of Cauchy-Schwarz and H¨older Back in the good old days, inequality problems were pretty straightforward. Pick one of the classic theorems, apply it in the obvious way, and often that would be enough by itself. Here’s a pretty typical example: Example 1 (APMO 1991, #3). Let a1, a2, . . . , an, b1, b2, . . . , bn be positive real numbers such that a1 + a2 + . . . + an = b1 + b2 + . . . + bn. Show that a2 1 a1 + b1 + a2 2 a2 + b2 + . . . + a2 n an + bn ≥ a1 + a2 + . . . + an 2 . Solution. By Cauchy-Schwarz in Engel form: n∑ i=1 a2 i ai + bi ≥ (∑n i=1 ai) 2 ∑n i=1(ai + bi) = (∑n i=1 ai) 2 2 · ∑n i=1 ai = ∑n i=1 ai 2 . These days however, inequalities are always disguised, and you need to combine the theorems with some other kinds of manipulation. In this section, I will go over a few useful tricks that come up again and again. To emphasize the tricks rather than the theorems, each of the main examples will ultimately come down to Cauchy-Schwarz or H¨older. More Examples: 1. Prove that (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) ≥ (a + b + c)3 for a, b, c ≥ 0. 2. Let P (x) be a polynomial with positive coeﬃcients. Prove that if P ( 1 x ) ≥ 1 P (x) holds for x = 1, then it holds for all x > 0. 3. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive real numbers such that ∑n i=1 xi = ∑n i=1 1 x2 i . Prove that ∑n i=1 xi ≥ n. 3.1 Move Things Around First One of the simplest ways to disguise an inequality is to move some terms around so that the equation is no longer in exactly the right form. Here’s an example: Example 2. Prove that b a+2b+c + c b+2c+d + d c+2d+a + a d+2a+b ≤ 1 for a, b, c, d ≥ 0. Any time we are trying to bound a sum of fractions, Cauchy-Schwarz is the ﬁrst inequality to try. However, in both fractional forms (see Page 1), we really want to show the fractions are greater than something, not less than something. So we’re screwed here, right? Nope! Instead of proving b a+2b+c is small, we could just prove 1 2 − b a+2b+c = 0.5a a+2b+c + 0.5c a+2b+c is big! And once you phrase the problem like that, Cauchy-Schwarz works just ﬁne. 5 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur Solution. By Cauchy-Schwarz, ∑ cyc a a + 2b + c ≥ (a + b + c + d)2 ∑ cyc(a2 + 2ab + ac) = (a + b + c + d)2 ∑ cyc a2 + 2 ∑ cyc ab + 2ac + 2bd = 1. Similarly, ∑ cyc c a+2b+c ≥ 1. Therefore, ∑ cyc b a+2b+c = 2 − ∑ cyc ( 0.5a a+2b+c + 0.5c a+2b+c ) ≤ 1. Notice that we could have instead tried to use Cauchy’s inequality in Engel form. This states that ∑ cyc a a+2b+c ≥ (√a+ √b+ √c+√d) 2 4(a+b+c+d) . But now what happens if you plug in some random numbers, like a = b = c = 0 and d = 1? Oops! The right-hand side isn’t bigger than 1 at all, which means you’re screwed and you have to start over. This gives two bonus lessons: • After applying some theorems, try plugging in values to the thing you want to prove. If it isn’t even true, then you’re back to square one! • Cauchy-Schwarz is very sensitive to the slightest tweak. The diﬀerence between the correct approach and the wrong approach to bounding ∑ cyc a a+2b+c is whether you apply Cauchy- Schwarz in Engel form directly, or whether you ﬁrst write it as ∑cyc a2 a2+2ab+ac , and then apply Cauchy-Schwarz. (That is where the third form comes from.) More Examples:2 1. If a, b, c > 0, prove that 1 a2+1 + 1 b2+1 + 1 c2+1 ≤ (a−b)2+(b−c)2+(c−a)2+9 a2+b2+c2+3 . 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers satisfying a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove that 1 a3+2 + 1 b3+2 + 1 c3+2 ≥ 1. 3. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn > 0. Prove that x3 1 x2 1+x1x2+x2 2 + x3 2 x2 2+x2x3+x2 3 + . . . + x3 n x2 n+xnx1+x2 1 ≥ 1 3 (x1 + x2 + . . . + xn). 4. Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle. Prove that b2+c2−a2 (b+c−a)2 + c2+a2−b2 (c+a−b)2 + a2+b2−c2 (a+b−c)2 ≤ 3. 3.2 Think About Equality Cases Consider the following problem: Example 3 (Russia). If a, b, c, d ≥ 0, prove that 3√ ab + 3√cd ≤ 3√a + c + d · 3√a + c + b. 2The “More Examples” in these notes can be quite tricky and use the key idea in new and creative ways. Think about them for 5-10 minutes before giving up, but don’t be afraid to look at the hints if you get stuck! Unlike the main examples, these extra examples do not necessarily use Cauchy-Schwarz or H¨older. 6 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur If you cube everything, this looks pretty close to H¨older’s inequality. But there are a couple problems: (1) there are only two summands on the left-hand side while each factor on the right- hand side has three summands, and (2) to get cube roots coming out, there should be three factors on the right-hand side instead of two. Without any kind of additional guidance, you might ﬁrst try grouping up factors on the right- hand side like this: 3√a + c + d · 3√b + a + c · 3√1 + 1 + 1 ≥ 3√ab + 3√ac + 3√cd. This looks pretty good, right? It is a direct application of H¨older and it looks pretty close to what we are trying to prove. But actually this deduction can’t possibly help. Here’s why: equality holds in this step only if a b = d c . Notice that this does not include a = c = 1 and b = d = 2, but equality does hold in that case for the original problem. So when we need our approximation to be exact, this application of H¨older is not exact, and therefore we’re screwed. The good news is the equality case can help point us in a better direction. In particular, we know that b and d can actually equal a + c. This suggests that maybe we should think of a + c as a single summand when we are grouping with b and d. Once you get that idea, the rest of the problem falls apart: Solution. By H¨older’s inequality: ( 3√ ab(a + c) + 3√ c(a + c)d )3 ≤ (a + c) · (b + (a + c) ) · ((a + c) + d ). Dividing through by (a + c) and taking cube roots gives us the desired result. The moral here is you should always, always, always try to ﬁgure out what the equality cases are in an inequality. They will usually be something simple like x = y = z, but they won’t always be. And then when you apply any theorems, make sure equality in the theorem holds when it does in the problem. Otherwise, the theorem is too weak and cannot possibly prove what you need! More Examples: 1. For all positive reals a, b, c, d, show that 1 a + 1 b + 4 c + 16 d ≥ 64 a+b+c+d 2. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers such that xyz = 1. Prove that x3 (1+y)(1+z) + y3 (1+z)(1+x) + z3 (1+x)(1+y) ≥ 3 4 . 3. Let x, y, z be three real numbers, all diﬀerent from 1, such that xyz = 1. Prove that x2 (x−1)2 + y2 (y−1)2 + z2 (z−1)2 ≥ 1. 3.3 Substitute Next, let’s take a look at an example that shamelessly rips oﬀ #2 from IMO 1995: Example 4 (USA TST 2010). Let a, b, c be positive real numbers satisfying abc = 1. Show that 1 a5(b + 2c)2 + 1 b5(c + 2a)2 + 1 c5(a + 2b)2 ≥ 1 3 . 7 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur This looks pretty intimidating, and a direct attack is unlikely to get you anywhere. However, it magically simpliﬁes to something much more tractable with a change of variables: Solution. Let x = 1 a , y = 1 b , and z = 1 c . Then xyz = 1 abc = 1 and 1 a5(b+2c)2 = x5y2z2 (z+2y)2 = x3 (z+2y)2 . Therefore, we need to show that if xyz = 1, then ∑ cyc x3 (z+2y)2 ≥ 1 3 . Indeed, H¨older’s inequality guarantees that:( ∑ cyc x3 (z + 2y)2 ) · (∑ cyc (z + 2y) ) · ( ∑ cyc (z + 2y) ) ≥ (x + y + z)3 ∑ cyc(z + 2y) = 3(x + y + z), so we can divide through by 9(x + y + z)2 to get: ∑ cyc x3 (z + 2y)2 ≥ x + y + z 9 ≥ 3√xyz 3 = 1 3 . Here are some other substitutions that are useful: • a, b, c are the sides of a triangle if and only if the following variables are positive: x = b+c−a 2 , y = c+a−b 2 , z = a+b−c 2 . Try using x, y, z instead of a, b, c on any problem that involves the side lengths of a triangle. This is called the “Ravi substitution” after Canadian IMO veteran Ravi Vakil. • You have already seen what x = 1 a , y = 1 b , z = 1 c can do. It can be a little tricky to predict when this substitution will help, so just try it if you are stuck. • If abc = 1, you can let a = x y , b = y z , c = z x . This will sometimes turn an asymmetric inequality into something much nicer, but it can deﬁnitely make things worse too! • More exotically, you can also do trigonometry substitutions. If a, b, c > 0, then: – a + b + c = abc is equivalent to saying a = tan X, b = tan Y, c = tan Z for X, Y, Z the angles of an acute triangle. – ab + bc + ca = 1 is equivalent to saying a = cot X, b = cot Y, c = cot Z for X, Y, Z the angles of an acute triangle. – a2 + b2 + c2 + 2abc = 1 is equivalent to saying a = cos X, b = cos Y, c = cos Z for X, Y, Z the angles of an acute triangle. Furthermore √ 1 a2+1 = cos X if a = tan X, and √1 − a2 = sin X if a = cos X. If any of these statements would simplify a problem, consider making the corresponding trig substitution! More Examples: 1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers satisfying abc = 1. Prove that 1 a3(b+c) + 1 b3(c+a) + 1 c3(a+b) ≥ 3 2 . 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers satisfying abc = 1. Prove that (a − 1 + 1 b ) ( b − 1 + 1 c ) ( c − 1 + 1 a ) ≤ 1. 3. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers satisfying 1 a2+1 + 1 b2+1 + 1 c2+1 = 2. Prove that ab + bc + ca ≤ 3 2 . 8 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur 3.4 Isolated Fudging Cauchy-Schwarz gives you the ability to bound a b + c d + e f all at once without looking at each term too carefully. Very few other theorems give you that power. When you can’t look at the whole sum as one quantity, it is useful to prove each individual term is bigger (or smaller) than something much easier to work with. Usually, you will want the fudged terms to all have the same denominator, so that you can easily add them up. Here is an example: Example 5 (IMO 2005, #3). Let x, y, and z be positive numbers such that xyz ≥ 1. Prove that x5 − x2 x5 + y2 + z2 + y5 − y2 y5 + z2 + x2 + z5 − z2 z5 + x2 + y2 ≥ 0. Solution. The given inequality is equivalent to: ∑ cyc ( x2 − x5 x5 + y2 + z2 + 1) ≤ 3 ⇐⇒ ∑ cyc x2 + y2 + z2 x5 + y2 + z2 ≤ 3. Now, Cauchy-Schwarz implies that (x5+y2+z2)(yz+y2+z2) ≥ (√ x5yz+y2+z2)2 ≥ (x2+y2+z2)2. Therefore, ∑ cyc x2 + y2 + z2 x5 + y2 + z2 ≤ ∑ cyc yz + y2 + z2 x2 + y2 + z2 = 2x2 + 2y2 + 2z2 + xy + yz + zx x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 3 This is a diﬃcult problem, but once you write the inequality as ∑ cyc x2+y2+z2 x5+y2+z2 ≤ 3, Cauchy- Schwarz makes it very natural to compare each term with something x2+y2+z2 . And once you get that far, you should be able to ﬁgure out what the “something” has to be. This was an example where the fudged terms were suggested by just trying various simpliﬁca- tions on the original terms. In other cases, it can be helpful to guess that there is a fudged term in some simple form such as a a+b+c , and then try to prove it works. Sometimes the guessing can be quite tricky though! For example, you can prove ∑ cyc a√a2+8bc ≥ ∑cyc a 4 3 a 4 3 +b 4 3 +c 4 3 = 1, but why would you think to try this?3 See Yufei’s notes for some tips: http://sites.google.com/site/ imocanada/2008-winter-camp. More Examples: 1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers satisfying a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove a a2+b+c + b b2+c+a + c c2+a+b ≤ 3. 2. If a, b, c > 0, show that 1 a3+b3+abc + 1 b3+c3+abc + 1 c3+a3+abc ≤ 1 abc . 3. If a, b, c > 0, show that ( 2a b+c ) 2 3 + ( 2b c+a ) 2 3 + ( 2c a+b ) 2 3 ≥ 3. 4. If x, y, z ≥ 0 and x2 + y2 + z2 = 1, show that ∑ cyc √1 − xy · √1 − yz ≥ 2. 3This problem comes from IMO 2001 #2. Can you see a direct proof that ∑ cyc a√a2+8bc ≥ 1 using H¨older’s? 9 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur 4 Problems I will end with a fairly random collection of Olympiad inequality problems for you to practice on and challenge yourself with. The preceding sections might help you, but they also might not. A- level problems might be on the CMO, B-level problems might be on the IMO, and C-level problems are some of the hardest inequalities ever proposed! A1.

Write (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) = (a3 + 1 + 1) · (1 + b3 + 1) · (1 + 1 + c3). 2. What happens when you apply Cauchy-Schwarz to (∑n i=1 ai xi ) · (∑n i=1 aixi)? (Source: Titu Andreescu) 3. By H¨older, ( ∑n i=1 xi)2 · (∑n i=1 1 x2 i ) ≥ n3. (Source: Romania 2007) More Examples: Move Things Around First 1. The numerator on the right-hand side is mysterious, but the denominators suggest Cauchy- Schwarz in Engel form. We just need to switch the sign around, as in the worked example. (Source: Adrian Tang) 2. AM-GM guarantees a3 + 1 + 1 ≥ 3a, but applying that directly only gives 1 a3+2 ≤ 1 3a . (Source: Pham Kim Hung) 3. How does the left-hand side compare with ∑ cyc x3 1+x3 2 x2 1+x1x2+x2 2 ? Once you have the inequality in this form, you should be able to bound each term separately. (Source: ???) 4. Write the inequality as ∑ cyc (a−b)(a−c) (b+c−a)2 ≤ 3. We can assume without loss of generality that a ≥ b ≥ c. Which of the three summands is positive? Which has largest absolute value? (Source: Adapted from IMO Shortlist 2006, A5) More Examples: Think About Equality Cases 1. Equality holds if a = b = 1, c = 2, d = 4. Maybe you could split up some terms. (Source: ???) 2. By AM-GM, x3 (1+y)(1+z) +(1+y)+(1+z) ≥ 3x. This would make the inequality much simpler, but unfortunately, equality does not hold at the right place (namely x = y = z). What if you used 1+y C instead of just 1 + y? (Source: IMO Short List 1998, A3) 3. Since x = y = z is not an equality case, none of our theorems work! Let a = x 1−x , b = y 1−y , c = z 1−z , and see what the given condition turns into. (Source: IMO 2008, #2a) More Examples: Substitute 1. This is almost identical to the worked example. Substitute x = 1 a , y = 1 b , z = 1 c . (Source: IMO 1995, #2) 2. Let x, y, z be such that a = x y , b = y z , c = z x . Then let p = x + y − z, q = y + z − x, r = z + x − y. Just remember that p, q, r are not necessarily positive! You can also multiply everything out to get Schur’s inequality. (Source: IMO 2000, #2) 3. Let a = tan X, b = tan Y, c = tan Z, and write ab + bc + ca = (a+b+c)2 2 − a2+b2+c2 2 . (Source: Iran 2006) More Examples: Isolated Fudging 1. The denominators are messy. Simplify using the fact that (a2 + b + c)(1 + b + c) ≥ (a + b + c)2. (Source: Adapted from Ukraine 2008). 11 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Cauchy-Schwarz and Other Classical Inequalities David Arthur 2. By Muirhead, a3 + b3 ≥ a2b + ab2. Alternatively, once you think to use isolated fudging, you should always try comparing with simple stuﬀ like a a+b+c . (Source: USAMO 1997, #5) 3. Prove ( 2a b+c ) 2 3 ≥ 3a a+b+c . (Source: MOP 2002) 4. 1 − xy = (x2 + y2 − xy) + (z2). If you are clever, you can use Cauchy-Schwarz twice and never have to do anything messy. (Source: Pham Van Thuan and Le Vi) Problems A1. This is a quadratic equation in a. When is a quadratic equation minimized? It is also a sum of two squares. A2. 44 ≈ √1999. Can you change some terms or add some terms to make the product telescope? (Source: CMO 1997, #3) A3. Can you use the constraint to make the inequality homogenous? (This means that all terms have the same degree, so multiplying a, b, c by a constant does not change anything.) If you can do that, you can forget about the constraint and everything becomes much simpler! (Source: CMO 2008, #3) A4. This problem is a trap. It looks set up for H¨older, but really you should just multiply it out. (Source: APMO 1998, #3) A5. Apply Cauchy-Schwarz in Engel form. (Source: IMO 1982, #3) A6. Do the Ravi substitution and expand. As a rule of thumb, if an inequality can be expanded in just a few minutes, you should always try it. (Source: IMO 1983, #6) B1. Assume a ≥ b ≥ c and then apply the rearrangement inequality. (Source: Samin Riasat) B2. The condition can be rewritten as ∑ cyc x−1 x = 1. Now apply Cauchy-Schwarz. (Source: Iran 1998) B3. Let a = k · x y , b = k · y z , c = k · z x . (Source: Balkan MO 2006 and other places) B4. Use induction. (Source: APMO 1999, #2) B5. One option is to use the fact f (x) = 1√x is convex. Alternatively, you can apply H¨older’s inequality on (left-hand side)2 · something. (Source: Pham Kim Hung and Vo Quoc Ba Can) B6. Prove the following algebraic identity: (∑ i,j,k ai,jbj,kck,i)2 ≤ ∑ i,j a2 i,j ∑ j,k b2 j,k ∑ k,i c2 k,i. You can use Cauchy-Schwarz. (Source: IMO 1992, #5) B7. The minimum value is 3 2 . Try ﬂipping the sign and simplifying a bit (section 3.1), then using induction. (Source: China Girls 2007) C1. I haven’t solved this yet! (Source: USAMO 2000, #6). C2. I haven’t solved this yet!
