Fermat’s Little Theorem: If p is a prime, and a is not divisible by p, then ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). • In problems dealing with ﬁnding/proving things about integers n, it is often useful to consider prime factorization of n, or speciﬁc prime factors of n. • When you want to prove no positive integers n satisfying the conditions of the problem exist, assume one does exist, and look at the smallest such integer. Then ﬁnd a smaller positive integer satisfying the conditions of the problem. • Look at the smallest prime divisor or the largest prime divisor of n. • It is sometimes useful to look at easy cases for n and then build up to the general case inductively. First prove the result when n is a prime, then when it is a power of a prime, then when it is a product of two powers of primes, etc. Or, induct on the number of prime divisors of n. 2 The Power of Factoring and Expanding Here are two very well-known relations: xn − yn = (x − y)(xn−1 + xn−2y + ... + yn−1); xn + yn = (x + y)(xn−1 − xn−2y + ... + yn−1), if n is odd. They turn out to be extremely useful when solving olympiad problems, because very often you encounter the expressions an + bn, xn + 1, xn − 1, an ≡ bn (mod p). Order of an Element Let n be a positive integer and a a positive integer relatively prime to n. Let d be the smallest positive integer such that ad ≡ 1 (mod n). Then d is called the order of a modulo n, and is denoted by ordna. Lemma 1: Let p be a prime, a a positive integer, a ̸≡ 1 (mod p), and d = ordpa. Then 1, a, a2, ..., ad−1 are all diﬀerent modulo n and 1 + a + ... + ad−1 ≡ 0 (mod p). Proof. The ﬁrst part follows by deﬁnition of d; the second part follows from (a−1)(1+a+...+ad−1) = ad − 1 ≡ 0 (mod p) and the fact that p is a prime and a ̸≡ 1 (mod p). Lemma 2: Let p be a prime, a a positive integer, and d = ordpa. Then d|(p − 1). 1 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes Alexander Remorov Proof. Let p − 1 ≡ r mod d so n = md + r. Then ap−1 = (ad)mar ≡ ar (mod p). But ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) so ar ≡ 1 (mod p). By deﬁnition of d and the fact that 0 ≤ r < d is follows r = 0 and d|(p − 1). Lemma 3: Similarly, it follows if m is a positive integer, d = ordma, and an ≡ 1 (mod p) then d|n. Another simple relation, which is also very useful: (x + y)n = n∑ i=0 (n i ) xn−iyi 1. If p|x then (x + y)n ≡ nxyn−1 + yn (mod p2). 2. More generally, if p|x, then (x + y)n ≡ n∑ i=n−k+1 ( n i ) xn−iyi (mod pk). 3. In particular, if a ≡ b (mod p) then a = kp + b and so using 1, an ≡ nkpbn−1 + bn (mod p2). Lots of olympiad problems involve ﬁnding the highest power of a prime p dividing an integer n. We write pk||n if pk|n and pk+1 ∤ n. The following lemma was published by Santiago Cuellar and Jose Alejandro Samper in Mathematical Reﬂections 2007, Issue 3: Lemma 4: Let p be an odd prime, a, b be two diﬀerent integers not divisible by p, and n be a positive integer. Then if a ≡ b (mod p), then if pk||(a − b), pl||n, then pk+l||(an − bn). Proof. It is enough to show that pl|| an − bn a − b . We will do this by induction on l. Base Step: l = 0. Then p ̸ |n and: an − bn a − b = n−1∑ i=0 a n−1−ib i ≡ n−1∑ i=0 an−1−iai (mod p), since a ≡ b (mod p), so an − bn a − b ≡ n−1∑ i=0 a n−1 (mod p) ≡ na n−1 (mod p) ̸≡ 0 (mod p) since p ̸ |n and p ̸ |a. Induction Step: Assume pl|| an − bn a − b . We need to show p|| apn − bpn an − bn . Now, an ≡ bn (mod p) then bn = kp + an, so bni ≡ ikpan(i−1) + ani (mod p2) for i = 1, 2, ..., n − 1. Therefore: apn − bpn an − bn = p−1∑ i=0 a n(p−1−i)b ni ≡ p−1∑ i=0 a n(p−1−i)(ikpan(i−1) + a ni) (mod p2) ≡ an(p−2)( kp2(p − 1) 2 + pan) (mod p 2), hence p|| apn − bpn an − bn . Then pl+1|| apn − bpn a − b and the induction step is complete. Lemma 5: Let a, b be two odd integers and n be a positive even integer. Then if 2k+1||a2 − b2, 2l||n, then 2k+l||(an − bn). Proof. It is enough to show that 2l−1|| an − bn a2 − b2 . We again use induction on l. Base Step: l = 1. Then n = 2m where m is odd, and: 2 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes Alexander Remorov an − bn a2 − b2 = n−1∑ i=0 a 2(m−1−i)b 2i ≡ n−1∑ i=0 a2(m−1−i)a 2i (mod 2), since a ≡ b (mod 2), so an − bn a − b ≡ n−1∑ i=0 a 2(m−1) (mod 2) ≡ ma 2(m−1) (mod 2) ̸≡ 0 (mod 2) since 2 ̸ |m and 2 ̸ |a. Induction Step: Assume 2l−1|| an − bn a2 − b2 . We need to show 2|| a2n − b2n an − bn . This follows from the fact that a2n − b2n an − bn = a n + b n ≡ 2 (mod 4) since an, bn are both congruent 1 modulo 4, since a, b are odd and 2|n. Hence 2|| a2n − b2n an − bn . Then 2l|| a2n − b2n a2 − b2 and the induction step is complete. Some important corollaries of the above results: 1. Lemmas 4 and 5 work for any integers a, b; so they will also work for expressions of the form an + bn if n is odd; just consider −b instead of b. 2. In the expression (a − b)(an−1 + an−2b + ... + bn−1) the greatest common divisor of the two brackets is usually quite small. If an odd prime p divides the greatest common divisor of the two brackets, and p ̸ |a, then p|n as well. 3. Let p be an odd prime. Then if a ≥ 2, ap − 1 has a prime divisor which does not divide a − 1. Sketch of Proof: Assume the contrary. Then gcd(a − 1, ap−1 + ap−2 + ... + 1)|p so ap−1 + ap−2 + ... + 1 is a power of p. Using Lemma 4, p2||(ap − 1) hence ap−1 + ap−2 + ... + 1 = a − 1, which gives a contradiction. 4. Let p be an odd prime. Then if a ≥ 2, and p ̸= 3 or a > 2 then ap + 1 has at a prime divisor which does not divide a + 1. Example: (Russia 1996) The positive integers a, b, p, n, k satisfy an + bn = pk. Show that if n > 1 is odd, and p is an odd prime, then n is a power of p. Solution: First note that pk = (a + b)(an−1 − an−2b + ... + bn−1) hence a + b = pj for some j ≥ 0. Because a + b ≥ 2 then j ≥ 1. Let l be such that pl||n. Because a ≡ −b (mod p), then using lemma 4, have pl+j||(an −(−b)n) = pk. So l + j = k and l = k − j. Using lemma 4 again, have pk||(apk−j + bpk−j ) and apk−j + bpk−j |an + bn since n is odd and pk−j||n. But an + bn = pk so pk = apk−j + bpk−j = an + bn and n = pk−j. The result follows. 3 Resources 1 Santiago Cuellar, Jose Alejandro Samper, A Nice and Tricky Lemma, Mathematical Reﬂec- tions, http://reflections.awesomemath.org/2007_3/Lifting_the_exponent.pdf 2 Naoki Sato’s Number Theory Package, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/Papers/SatoNT.pdf 3 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes Alexander Remorov 3 David Arthur’s Handout from Winter Camp 2009, http://www.stanford.edu/~darthur/wc09/numbertheory.pdf 4 Jacob Tsimerman’s Handout from Winter Camp 2008, http://web.mit.edu/yufeiz/www/wc08/nt.pdf 5 Yimin Ge’s article on Vieta Jumping, http://www.georgmohr.dk/tr/tr09taltvieta.pdf 6 Problems In Elementary Number Theory, Volumes 1 and 2, http://projectpen.files.wordpress.com/2008/10/pen-vol-i-no-1.pdf http://www.cpohoata.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/pen-vol-ii-no-1-090618.pdf 4 Some Useful Results The following problems are for warm-up, but the results in them are useful. It is good to know them. 1. If p is an odd prime, and p ≡ 3 (mod 4), and p|(x2 + y2) show that p|x and p|y. Corollary: If n is a positive integer, and p a prime dividing n2 + 1, then p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Note: If n ≡ 3 (mod 4) then n has a prime divisor congruent to 3 modulo 4. It is often useful to look at prime divisors of n that are congruent to 3 modulo 4 or those congruent to 1 modulo 4. 2. Let a be an integer and m, n be positive integers. Prove: gcd(am − 1, an − 1) = |agcd(m,n) − 1|. 3. If a is an integer not divisible by a prime p, and for some integer k, ak ≡ −1 (mod p) then if d = ordpa, then f = d 2 is the smallest integer for which a d 2 ≡ −1 (mod p). 4. Euler’s Theorem: If n and a are positive integers, and gcd(a, n) = 1 then aϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). (Here, ϕ(n) is the Euler function; if n = pe1 1 pe2 2 ...p ek k then ϕ(n) = n(1 − 1 p1 )(1 − 1 p2 )...(1 − 1 pk ).) You are allowed to use ONLY Fermat’s Little Theorem and Lemma 4. Note: We can prove more: if m = lcm(p1 − 1, p2 − 1, ..., pk − 1) then a mpe1−1 1 p e2−1 2 ...pek −1 k ≡ 1 (mod n). 5. Prove that the smallest positive integer d for which 2d ≡ 1 (mod 3k) is d = ϕ(3k). Note: A number a is called a primitive root modulo n if ordna = ϕ(n). This question shows that 2 is a primitive root modulo 3n. Note: Using the note in question 3, and Lemma 4, show if a positive integer n has a primitive root then n is equal to 2, 4, pk, or 2pk where p is an odd prime. 6. If x is a positive integer, and p, q are primes and q| xp − 1 x − 1 then q = p or q ≡ 1 (mod p). 7. Let n be a positive integer. Show that all prime divisors of 22n + 1 are congruent to 1 modulo 2n+1. 4 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes Alexander Remorov 5 Problems The following problems are more diﬃcult and are olympiad/easy IMO level. 1.

If a1, a2, ..., ak are all positive integers, which are relatively prime to n and less than n, and a2 − a1 = a3 − a2 = ... = ak − ak−1 > 0, show that n is prime or a power of 2. 4.

(China TST 2005) Let a, m, n be positive integers such that a > 1; m ̸= n. If am − 1 and an − 1 have the same prime divisors, prove that a + 1 is a power of 2. Here are some harder problems. Many of these involve more than just the techniques discussed in this handout. If you can do the last few of them, you are quite well prepared if a problem on this subject appears on IMO. 1. (IMO 2000.5) Does there exist a positive integer n such that n has exactly 2000 diﬀerent prime divisors and 2n + 1 is divisible by n? 2.
