Dec. 9, start of class Throughout, K denotes a number ﬁeld. 11.4 PID’s ’n ED’s Exercise 11.7. Suppose R is a Euclidean domain with absolute value | · |. Let a ∈ R such that |a| = 1. Show (a) = R. 11.6 Quotient rings Exercise 11.8. Let R = Z[√−5] and consider the ideals I = (2), J = (1 + √−5) and p = (2, 1 + √−5). Write down a set of representatives for R/I, R/J and R/p. What are their norms? Show that I and J are not prime but p is. 12.2 Fractional ideals and the class group Deﬁnition 12.1. Let K be a number ﬁeld, and I ⊆ K. If aI = {ai : i ∈ I} is an ideal of OK for some nonzero a ∈ OK, we say I is a fractional ideal of OK. Further if aI is principal, we say I is principal. Denote the set of nonzero fractional ideals of OK by Frac(OK), and the set of nonzero principal ideals by Prin(OK). Exercise 12.1. Let I = (n) be a non-zero ideal of Z. Check the fractional ideal I −1 = 1 n Z is indeed the inverse of I, i.e., II −1 = (1) = Z. Similarly, for any number ﬁeld K and any non-zero principal ideal I = (α) of OK, show α−1OK is the inverse of I, i.e., II −1 = (1) = OK. Exercise 12.2. Let K be a number ﬁeld. Show the principal fractional ideals of OK correspond to the elements of K, up to units. Exercise 12.3. Check that OK is the identity element of Frac(OK), i.e., if I is a fractional ideal of OK, show OK · I = I. Exercise 12.4. Let I, J be ideals of OK. Then J |I ⇐⇒ J ⊇ I ⇐⇒ J −1 ⊆ I −1. (Hint: it’s easy if you use Theorem 12.4 to multiply by inverses.) Note when J = OK, this says I −1 ⊇ OK. 12.3 Primes of the form x2 + 5y2 Exercise 12.5. Use Fermat’s 2 square theorem to determine the primes of the form x2 + 4y2 (Exercise 12.8.1). 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
