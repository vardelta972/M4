Prove that f (x) = x for all x ∈ [0, 1]. 1 2 2008 BLUE MOP, FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS-I AL˙I G ¨UREL Problem 1, Solution by Brian Hamrick: Let f (k) be f applied k times. f (4)(x) = x is quartic equation with four real roots: a = −1, b = 2, m = −1 + √5 2 , and n = −1 − √5 2 · So a, b, m, n are the ﬁxed points of f (4). Moreover a, b are also the ﬁxed points of f (2). Now observe that if x is a ﬁxed point of f (k), then so is f (x). Observe that f (m) and f (n) are m or n because they are ﬁxed points of f (4) but not f (2). On the other hand, f is injective on the set of these four points {a, b, m, n} since neither one is the negative of another. Now, in both cases we have f (f (m)) = m which is a contradiction since the only ﬁxed points of f (2) are a and b □ Problem 2, Solution by Wenyu Cao: Let x0 = x, for a ﬁxed x and let xn+1 = f (xn) for n ≥ 0. The given condition becomes: xn+2 + axn+1 = b(a + b)xn which has the characteristic equation y2 + ay − b(a + b) = 0 with roots y = b, and y = −a − b. Thus xn = sb n + t(−a − b)n for some real constants s and t. If t ̸= 0, then for suﬃciently large n, the t(−a − b)n term will dominate the sb n term and xn will become negative, which contradicts the deﬁnition of f . Thus, t = 0 and it follows that f (x) = bx □ Problem 3, Solution by Toan Phan: Firstly, observe that f (x) = x 2 satisﬁes the condition f (3x) ≥ f (f (2x)) + x. Thus, α ≤ 1 2 . Secondly, f (x) > x 3 . Moreover if f (x) ≥ αx, then using the functional equation we get f (x) ≥ 2α2+1 3 x, as well. Let a1 = 1 3 and an+1 = 2a2 n+1 3 . Then α = an satisfy the inequality for all n. Observe that the sequence {an} is increasing and bounded by 1 2 , thus it has a limit and we ﬁnd that limn→∞ an = 1 2 . Hence the answer is α = 1 2 □ Problem 4, Solution by John Berman: Plugging-in values n = 1 and n = 2, after eliminating some possibilities we conclude that f (f (1)) = 1 and f (2) = 2. Then by induction we show that for n ≥ 2, 2 ≤ f (n) ≤ n. So the recursion, f (n + 1) = n + 2 − f (f (n)) determines all f (n) values for n ≥ 2 uniquely. Then f (f (1)) = 1 implies that f (1) cannot be larger than 1, hence f (1) = 1. Let ϕ = √5−1 2 . We claim that f (n) = [ϕn] + 1. To prove this, we need to show that it satisﬁes the same recurrence relation as f . Note that ϕn < f (n) < ϕn + 1. Furthermore, ϕk + 1 − ϕ < f (k) is true for at least one of k = n or k = n + 1 and f (k) < ϕk + 1 − ϕ is true for at least one of k = n or k = n + 1. Thus, ϕ2n + ϕ(n + 1) + 1 − ϕ < f (n) < (ϕ(ϕn + 1) + 1) + (ϕ(n + 1) + 1) − ϕ. Bounding by integers, n + 1 < f (f (n)) + f (n + 1) < n + 2 + ϕ implies f (f (n)) + f (n + 1) = n + 2, as desired □ 2008 BLUE MOP, FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS-I AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 5, Solution by Justin Brereton: Observe that g(0) = 0 or 2. If g(0) = 2 the only solution is g ≡ 2. If g(0) = 0, letting x = y = 2 gives g(2) = 0 or 2. Assume that g(2) = 2. Then we get g(1) = 1 or 2 by letting x = y = 1. Assume g(1) = 1, then note that g(x + 1) = g(x) + 1. for all x. In this case, we get g(x + n) = g(x) + n and g(nx) = ng(x) for all x and integer n. Letting x = y y−1 , we get g( 1 z ) = 1 g(z) for all non-zero z. Then since g(n) = n for all integers, we get g ( 1 n ) = 1 n and then it follows that g(r) = r for all rational numbers r. Now, since g(x2) = g(x) 2 ≥ 0. Com- bining this with the g ﬁxing rational numbers, we can show that g(x) = x for all real number x. In all the case g(1) = g(2) = 2, we get g ≡ 2 by letting y = 1 which contradicts the fact that g(0) = 0. The only case left is g(2) = 0. In this case, ﬁrst show that all rational numbers are sent to zero. Then by letting y = n a positive integer show that g(x + n) = g(nx) + g(x). In particular, g(x + 1) = 2g(x), hence by induction g(x + n) = 2ng(x). So g(nx) = (2 n − 1)g(x). But then, on one hand g(4x) = (2 4 − 1)g(x), on the other hand g(4x) = (2 2 − 1)g(2x) = (2 2 − 1)(2 2 − 1)g(x). We conclude that g ≡ 0 in this case as well. In conclusion the only solutions are g(x) = x and the two constant functions g ≡ 0 and g ≡ 2 □ Problem 6, Solution by Sergei Bernstein: Plugging-in x = 0 gives f (f (y)) = y. Plugging-in y = 0 gives f (xf (x)) = f (x) 2. Replacing x with f (x) we get f (x) = ±x. Suppose that x, y ̸= 0 and f (x) = x but f (y) = −y. Then plugging-in (x, y) gives f (x2 − y) = x2 + y implies x = 0 or y = 0, a contradiction. We conclude that f (x) = x and f (x) = −x are the only solutions □ Problem 7, Solution by Sam Keller: Letting x = y = z = 1, we get f (1) = 2. Then (x, y, z) = (a 2, 1, 1) gives f (a)2 = f (a) 2 + 2. The triple (x, x, 1 x ) then gives f (x) = f ( 1 x ). Letting z = 1 y and s = √xy, t = √ x y gives f (st) + f ( s t ) = f (s)f (t). f is increasing for x = 1, f ( 1 x ) = f (x) and f (1) = 2. We conclude that f (x) ≥ 2 for all x > 0. Let f (x) = g(x) + 1 g(x) . Inducting on n and using the above equation with s = xn and t = x we show that g(xn) = g(x)n. It then follows that g(xr) = g(x) r for all rational numbers r. Since g is increasing, the same result follows for all real numbers r and hence by letting h(x) = ln(g(ex)) and using Cauchy’s Equation, we deduce that g(x) = x c for some constant c. In conclusion f (x) = xc + 1 xc for some constant c and all such functions actually work □ Problem 8, Solution by Sergei Bernstein: Observe that f is injective. Since it is also continuous and f (0) < f (1), it has to be strictly increasing, otherwise using Intermediate Theorem we would get to diﬀerent numbers whose images are same. Now if x ≤ f (x) applying f to both sides repeatedly and using monotonicity, we get x ≤ f (x) ≤ f (2)(x) ≤ ... ≤ f (n)(x) = x. Hence f (x) = x. We get the same result in the other case: x ≥ f (x) and conclude that f (x) = x for all x ∈ [0, 1] □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
