For positive integer n>1 and integer x, if there exists a least positive integer d such that x d ≡1 (mod n), then we say d is the order of x (mod n). We denote this by ordn(x) = d. It is natural to ask for a prime p, if there exists x such that ordp(x) = p−1. Such x is called a primitive root (mod p). Indeed, we have the following Theorem. For every prime number p, there exists a primitive root (mod p). (We will comment on the proof at the end of the article.) As a consequence, if x is a primitive root (mod p), then 1, x, x 2, …, x p−2 (mod p) are distinct and they form a permutation of 1, 2, …, p−1 (mod p). This is useful in solving some problems in math competitions. The following are some examples. (Below, we will use the common notation a∣b to denote a is a divisor of b.) Example 1. (2009 Hungary-Israel Math Competition) Let p ≥ 2 be a prime number. Determine all positive integers k such that Sk = 1k + 2k + ⋯ + (p−1)k is divisible by p. Solution. Let x be a primitive root (mod p). Then Sk ≡ 1+x k+⋯+x (p−2)k (mod p). If p−1∣k, then Sk ≡1+⋯+1= p−1 (mod p). If p−1∤k, then since x k ≢1 (mod p) and x (p−1)k ≡ 1(mod p), we have ).(mod0 1 1 )1( p x x S k kp k ≡ − − ≡ − Therefore, all the k’s that satisfy the requirement are precisely those integers that are not divisible by p−1. Example 2. Prove that if p is a prime number, then (p−1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). This is Wilson’s theorem. Solution. The case p = 2 is easy. For p > 2, let x be a primitive root (mod p). Then (p−1)! ≡ x 1x 2⋯x p−1 = x (p−1)p/2 (mod p). By the property of x, w=x (p−1)/2 satisfies w≢1(mod p) and w 2 ≡1(mod p). So w ≡ −1(mod p). Then (p−1)! ≡ x (p−1)p/2 = w p = −1 (mod p). Example 3.

So ).(mod 2 1 2 1 )( 1 1 120 p p xpF p i i − =≡ ∑ − = Then . 2 1 2 1 2 1 )( pp p pf = − −= Example 4. If a and b are nonnegative integers such that 2a ≡ 2b (mod 101), then prove that a ≡ b (mod 100). Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 15, No. 1, May 10-Jun. 10 Page 2 Solution. We first check 2 is a primitive root of (mod 101). If d is the least positive integer such that 2 d ≡ 1 (mod 101), then dividing 100 by d, we get 100 = qd + r for some integers q, r, where 0 ≤ r < d. By Fermat’s little theorem, 1≡ 2100 =(2 d)q2 r ≡ 2r (mod 101), which implies the remainder r = 0. So d∣100. Assume d < 100. Then d∣50 or d∣20, which implies 2 20 or 250≡1 (mod 101). But 210 = 1024 ≡ 14(mod 101) implies 220 ≡ 142 ≡ −6 (mod 101) and 250 ≡ 14(−6)2 ≡ −1 (mod 101). So d = 100. Finally, 2a ≡ 2b (mod 101) implies 2 |a−b| ≡ 1 (mod 101). Then as above, dividing |a-b| by 100, we will see the remainder is 0. Therefore, a ≡ b (mod 100). Comments: The division argument in the solution above shows if ordn(x) = d, then x k ≡1 (mod n) if and only if d ∣ k. This is useful. Example 5. (1994 Putnam Exam) For any integer a, set na = 101a −100×2a. Show that for 0 ≤ a,b,c,d ≤ 99, na+nb ≡ nc+nd (mod 10100) implies {a,b}={c,d}. Solution. Since 100 and 101 are relatively prime, na+nb ≡ nc+nd (mod 10100) is equivalent to na+nb ≡ nc+nd (mod 100) and na+nb ≡ nc+nd (mod 101). As na ≡ a (mod 100) and na ≡ 2a (mod 101). These can be simplified to a+b ≡ c+d (mod 100) (*) and 2a+2b ≡2c+2d (mod 101). Using 2100≡ 1(mod 101) and (*), we get 2a2b = 2a+b ≡ 2c+d = 2c2d (mod 101). Since 2b ≡ 2c+2d −2a (mod 101), we get 2a(2c+2d −2a) ≡ 2c2d (mod 101). This can be rearranged as (2a−2c)(2a−2d) ≡ 0 (mod 101). Then 2a ≡ 2c (mod 101) or 2a ≡ 2d (mod 101). By the last example, we get a ≡ c or d (mod 100). Finally, using a+b ≡ c+d (mod 100), we get {a,b}={c,d}. Example 6. Find all two digit numbers n (i.e. n = 10a + b, where a, b ∊ {0,1,…,9} and a ≠ 0) such that for all integers k, we have n | k a − k b. Solution. Clearly, n = 11, 22, …, 99 work. Suppose n is such an integer with a ≠ b. Let p be a prime divisor of n. Let x be a primitive root (mod p). Then p ∣ x a − x b, which implies x |a−b| ≡ 1(mod p). By the comment at the end of example 4, we have p−1 ∣ |a-b| ≤ 9. Hence, p = 2, 3, 5 or 7. If p = 7 ∣ n, then 6 ∣ |a-b| implies n = 28. Now k 2 ≡ k 8 (mod 4) and (mod 7) hold by property of (mod 4) and Fermat’s little theorem respectively. So n = 28 works. Similarly the p = 5 case will lead to n = 15 or 40. Checking shows n = 15 works. The p = 3 case will lead to n = 24 or 48. Checking shows n = 48 works. The p = 2 case will lead to n = 16, 32 or 64, but checking shows none of them works. Therefore, the only answers are 11, 22, …, 99, 28, 15, 48. Example 7. Let p be an odd prime number. Determine all functions f : ℤ→ℤ such that for all m,n∊ℤ, (i) if m ≡ n (mod p), then f(m) = f(n) and (ii) f(mn) = f(m)f(n). Solution. For such functions, taking m = n = 0, we have f(0) = f(0)2, so f(0) = 0 or 1. If f(0) = 1, then taking m = 0, we have 1 = f(0) = f(0) f(n) = f(n) for all n∊ℤ, which is clearly a solution. If f(0) = 0, then n ≡ 0 (mod p) implies f(n) = 0. For n≢0 (mod p), let x be a primitive root (mod p). Then n ≡ x k(mod p) for some k∊{1,2,…,p−1}. So f(n) = f(x k) = f(x)k. By Fermat’s little theorem, x p ≡ x (mod p). This implies f(x)p = f(x). So f(x) = 0, 1 or −1. If f(x) = 0, then f(n) = 0 for all n∊ℤ. If f(x) = 1, then f(n) = 1 for all n≢0 (mod p). If f(x) = −1, then for n congruent to a nonzero square number (mod p), f(n) = 1, otherwise f(n)= −1. After seeing how primitive roots can solve problem, it is time to examine the proof of the theorem more closely. We will divide the proofs into a few observations. For a polynomial f(x) of degree n with coefficients in (mod p), the congruence f(x) ≡ 0 (mod p) has at most n solutions (mod p). This can be proved by doing induction on n and imitating the proof for real coefficient polynomials having at most n roots. If d∣p−1, then x d−1 ≡ 0(mod p) has exactly d solutions (mod p). To see this, let n = (p−1)/d, then x p−1−1= (x d−1)(x (n−1)d+x (n−2)d+⋯+1). Since x p−1−1≡ 0 (mod p) has p−1 solutions by Fermat’s little theorem, so if x d−1 ≡ 0 (mod p) has less than d solutions, then (x d−1)(x (n−1)d+x (n−2)d+⋯+1) ≡ 0 (mod p) would have less than d + (n−1)d = p−1 solutions, which is a contradiction. Suppose the prime factorization of p −1 is ke k e pp L 1 1 , where pi’s are distinct primes and ei ≥ 1 . For i = 1, 2, …, k, let . ie ii pm = Using the observation in the last paragraph, we see there exist mi−mi/pi > 1 solutions xi of equation 01 ≡− imx (mod p), which are not solutions of 01 / ≡− ii pmx (mod p). It follows that the least positive integer d such that xi d − 1 ≡ 0 (mod p) is . ie ii pm = That means xi has order ie ii pm = in (mod p). Let r be the order of xixj in (mod p). By the comment at the end of example 4, we have .| ji e j e i ppr Now ),(mod1)()( pxxxxx rd ji rd j rd i rd j ≡=≡ which by the comment again, we get .| rdp je j Since je jp and ie ipd = are relatively prime, we get .| rp je j Interchanging the roles of pi and pj, we also get .| rp je j So .| rpp ji e j e i Then . ji e j e i ppr = So x = x1x2⋯xk will have order ,1 1 1 −=ppp ke k e L which implies x is a primitive root (mod p). For n > 1, Euler’s theorem asserts that if x and n are relatively prime integers, then x φ(n) ≡1(mod n), where φ(n) is the number of positive integers among 1,2,…,n that are relatively prime to n. Similarly, we can define x to be a primitive root (mod n) if and only if the least positive integer d satisfying x d ≡ 1(mod n) is φ(n). For the inquisitive mind who wants to know for which n, there exists primitive roots (mod n), the answers are n = 2, 4, pk and 2pk, where p is an odd prime. This is much harder to prove. The important thing is for such a primitive root x (mod n), the numbers x i (mod n) for i = 1 to φ(n) is a permutation of the φ(n) numbers among 1,2,…,n that are relatively prime to n.

Let k be a positive integer. Divide 3k pebbles into five piles (with possibly unequal number of pebbles). Operate on the five piles by selecting three of them and removing one pebble from each of the three piles. If it is possible to remove all pebbles after k operations, then we say it is a harmonious ending. Determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a harmonious ending to exist in terms of the number k and the distribution of pebbles in the five piles.

Problem 342. Let f(x)=anx n+⋯+a1x+p be a polynomial with coefficients in the integers and degree n>1, where p is a prime number and |an|+|an−1|+⋯+|a1| < p. Then prove that f(x) is not the product of two polynomials with coefficients in the integers and degrees less than n. Solution. The 6B Mathematics Group (Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School), CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 6), LEE Kai Seng (HKUST), LI Pak Hin (PLK Vicwood K. T. Chong Sixth Form College), Emanuele NATALE (Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”, Roma, Italy), Pedro Henrique O. PANTOJA (University of Lisbon, Portugal). Let w be a root of f(x) in ℂ. Assume |w|≤1. Using anw n+⋯+a1w+p=0 and the triangle inequality, we have ,|||||| 111 ∑∑∑ === ≤≤= n i i n i i i n i i i awawap which contradicts the given inequality. So all roots of f(x) have absolute values greater than 1. Assume f(x) is the product of two integral coefficient polynomials g(x) and h(x) with degrees less than n. Let b and c be the nonzero coefficients of the highest degree terms of g(x) and h(x) respectively. Then |b| and |c| ≥ 1. By Vieta’s theorem, |g(0)/b| and |h(0)/c| are the products of the absolute values of their roots respectively. Since their roots are also roots of f(x), we have |g(0)/b| > 1 and |h(0)/c| > 1. Now p = |f(0)| = |g(0)h(0)|, but g(0), h(0) are integers and |g(0)| > |b| ≥ 1 and |h(0)| > |c| ≥ 1, which contradicts p is prime. Problem 343. Determine all ordered pairs (a,b) of positive integers such that a≠b, b2+a=pm (where p is a prime number, m is a positive integer) and a2+b is divisible by b2+a. Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 6), HUNG Ka Kin Kenneth (Diocesan Boys’ School) and LI Pak Hin (PLK Vicwood K. T. Chong Sixth Form College). For such (a,b), 2 4 2 2 2 ba bb ba ba ba + + +−= + + implies p m = a + b 2 | b 4 + b = b(b 3+1). From a ≠ b, we get b < 1+b < a+b 2. As gcd(b, b 3+1) = 1, so p m divides b 3+1 = (b+1)(b 2−b+1). Next, by the Euclidean algorithm, we have gcd(b+1,b 2−b+1) = gcd(b+1,3) | 3. Assume we have gcd(b+1,b 2−b+1)=1. Then b2+a=pm divides only one of b+1 or b 2−b+1. However, both b+1, b 2−b+1< b 2+a=p m. Hence, b+1 and b 2−b+1 must be divisible by p. Then the assumption is false and p = gcd(b+1,b 2−b+1) = 3. (*) If m = 1, then b2+a = 3 has no solution. If m = 2, then b2+a = 9 yields (a,b) = (5,2). For m ≥ 3, by (*), one of b+1 or b 2−b+1 is divisible by 3, while the other one is divisible by 3 m−1. Since ,31311 12/2 −<+=++<+ mmabb so 3 m−1 | b 2−b+1. Since m ≥ 3, we have b 2 − b + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 9). Checking b ≡ −4, −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 (mod 9) shows there cannot be any solution.

Let a1, a2, a3, ⋯ be a sequence of integers such that there are infinitely many positive terms and also infinitely many negative terms. For every positive integer n, the remainders of a1, a2, ⋯, an upon divisions by n are all distinct. Prove that every integer appears exactly one time in the sequence. Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 6), HUNG Ka Kin Kenneth (Diocesan Boys’ School), LI Pak Hin (PLK Vicwood K. T. Chong Sixth Form College), Emanuele NATALE and Carlo PAGANO (Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”, Roma, Italy). Assume there are i > j such that ai = aj. Then for n > i, ai ≡ aj (mod n), which is a contradiction. So any number appears at most once. Next, for every positive integer n, let Sn={a1, a2, …, an}, max Sn = av and min Sn = aw. If k = av− aw ≥ n, then k ≥ n ≥ v, w and av ≡ aw (mod k), contradicting the given fact. So max Sn −min Sn = av− aw ≤ n − 1. Now Sn ⊆[min Sn , max Sn] and both contain n integers. So the n numbers in Sn are the n consecutive integers from min Sn to max Sn. Now for every integer m, since there are infinitely many positive terms and also infinitely many negative terms, there exists ap and aq such that ap < m < aq. Let r > max{p,q}, then m is in Sr. Therefore, every integer appears exactly one time in the sequence. Comment: An example of such a sequence is 0, 1, −1, 2, −2, 3, −3, ….
