If f (x) = nx, g(x) = e2x, and h(x) = g(f (x)), ﬁnd n such that h′(0) = 100. Answer: 50 Solution: If f (x) = nx, g(x) = e2x, and h(x) = g(f (x)), then h(x) = e2(nx) = e2nx. The derivative of h(x) is 2n ∗ e2nx, by the Chain Rule. Then, plugging in 0 for x gets us 2n = 100, so, n = 50. 2. Farmer Joe will plant carrots to cover a rectangle in the ﬁrst quadrant with a vertex at the origin and sides parallel to the x and y axes. However, he can not grow carrots on his neighbor’s land. If the border between his and his neighbor’s land is along the curve y = − ln(2x), what is the maximum area of carrotland Farmer Joe can create? Answer: 1 2e Solution: We note that the area of carrotland is xy = −x ln(2x). The maximum occurs when (xy)′ = 0, or − ln(2x) + −1 = 0. Hence x = e−1/2 and y = 1. So, the maximum area is 1 2e . 3. For all θ from 0 to 2π, Annie draws a line segment of length θ from the origin in the direction of θ radians. What is the area of the spiral swept out by the union of these line segments? Answer: 4π3 3 Solution: After drawing the spiral, it should become clear that we have the following calculation since our radius is θ 1 2 ∫ 2π 0 θ2dθ = 4π3 3 4. The Chebyshev Polynomials are deﬁned as Tn(x) = cos(n cos−1(x)), for n = 0, 1, 2, .... Compute the following inﬁnite series: ∞∑ n=1 ∫ 1 −1 T2n+1(x)dx. If the series diverges, your answer should be ”D.” Answer: 0 Solution: We can show that the Chebyshev Polynomials are odd for odd n. Recall that for an odd function, f (−x) = −f (x). So, the integral of said function over [−1, 1] should be 0. Thus, the sum of those integrals should also be 0. 5. What is (2020) 2 + (2021)2 1! + (2022)2 2! + (2023)2 3! + (2024)2 4! + . . . Answer: 4084442e Solution: We start with ex = ∞∑ n=0 xn n! SMT 2020 Calculus Test Solutions February 22, 2020 Then we can do a pattern of diﬀerentiating and multiplying by x. x 2020ex = ∞∑ n=0 xn+2020 n! (2020x2019 + x2020)ex = ∞∑ n=0 (n + 2020)xn+2019 n! (2020x2020 + x2021)ex = ∞∑ n=0 (n + 2020)xn+2020 n! (2020 2x2019 + 4041x2020 + x2021)e x = ∞∑ n=0 (n + 2020)2xn+2019 n! So, our desired sum occurs when x = 1, and we obtain 4084442e . 6. Let us deﬁne the sequence an = (−1)n/(n). Now, we deﬁne the partial sums AN = N∑ n=1 an. What is the diﬀerence ∞∑ N =1 ( AN − lim M →∞ AM )) ? Answer: − log(2) + 1/2 Solution: First we note that we are calculating the series ∞∑ N =1 ∞∑ m=N +1 (−1)m+1 m = − ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 (−1)n+m n + m Instead, we consider F (x) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 (−x)n+m n + m . Then we note that the answer should be limx→1 −F (x). Now we can see that F ′(x) = ∞∑ n=1 ∞∑ m=1 (−1)(−x) n+m−1 = x (1 + x)2 . Then we can determine that F (x) = ∫ x (1 + x)2 dx = log(1 + x) + 1 1 + x − 1 (Note that F (0) = 0 from its deﬁnition). Thus, lim x→1 −F (x) = − log(2) − 1 2 + 1 = − log(2) + 1/2.

Compute lim n→∞ ∫ 2020 e f ′ n(x) fn(x)fn−1(x) ln x − f ′ n−1(x) fn−1(x) dx. Answer: ln(ln 2020) Solution: It turns out that the limit is unnecessary, as we can see by induction that f ′ n(x) = fn(x) ( f ′ n−1(x) ln x + 1 x fn−1(x) ) . This means that the desired integral is ∫ 2020 e 1 x ln x dx. The anti-derivative is just ln(ln x), so evaluating at endpoints gives ln(ln 2020) . 8. Compute ∫ ∞ 0 dx x4 − 6x2 + 25 . Answer: π 20 Solution: We ﬁrst factor the denominator to get ∫ ∞ 0 dx x4 − 6x2 + 25 = ∫ ∞ 0 dx (x2 − 4x + 5)(x2 + 4x + 5) . We can then decompose the integral into the partial fractions ∫ ∞ 0 [ −x + 4 40(x2 − 4x + 5) + x + 4 40(x2 − 4x + 5) ] dx. Focusing on the ﬁrst term, we notice that d dx (x2 − 4x + 5) = 2x − 4. This suggests that we further decompose the ﬁrst term into ∫ ∞ 0 [ −(x − 2) 40(x2 − 4x + 5) + 2 40(x2 − 4x + 5) ] dx. The ﬁrst integral evaluates to − 1 2 ln(x2 − 4x + 5). To evaluate the second integral, we complete the square in the denominator to get∫ ∞ 0 2dx 40(x − 2)2 + 40 . We can then make the substitution u = x−2 and use the fact that ∫ dx x2+1 = tan−1(x) to see that the second integral evaluates to 1 20 tan−1(x − 2). Decomposing the second integral in a similar manner, we ﬁnd ∫ ∞ 0 dx x4 − 6x2 + 25 = [− 1 80 ln(x 2 − 4x + 5) + 1 80 ln(x 2 + 4x + 5) + 1 20 tan −1(x − 2) + 1 20 tan −1(x + 2)]∞ 0 = [ 1 80 ln ( x2 − 4x + 5 x2 + 4x + 5 ) + 1 20 (tan −1(x − 2) + tan−1(x + 2))]∞ 0 SMT 2020 Calculus Test Solutions February 22, 2020 When x = 0, the resulting terms cancel to 0. When x → ∞, the fraction in the ln term approaches 1, and ln 1 = 0. On the other hand, tan−1(x) → π 2 , so our answer is 1 20 ( π 2 + π 2 ) = π 20 . 9. Deﬁne an = √ 2 + √2 + √2 + . . . | {z } n square roots . For example a1 = √2 and a2 = √2 + √2. Find the value of lim n→∞ 4 n(2 − an). Answer: π2 4 Solution: It is not hard to show by induction that an = 2 cos(π/2n+1). Therefore, 4n(2 − an) = 4 n ( 2 − ( 2 − 2 ( π 2n+1 )2 2! + 2 ( π 2n+1 )4 4! − . . . )) = π2 4 + O(1/4 n). Thus, as n → ∞, the limit approaches π2 4 . 10. Let Im = ∫ 2π 0 sin(x) sin(2x) · · · sin(mx)dx. Find the sum of all integers 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 such that Im ̸= 0. Answer: 1300 Solution: Analyzing the even/oddness of the function shows that odd m don’t work, and analyzing π − x vs x symmetry shows that m ≡ 2 mod 4 doesn’t work. But it is not obvious why Im ̸= 0 for every m ≡ 0 mod 4. One could guess this is true and guess the corresponding answer, but we present a full proof here (and we present diﬀerently phrased reasons for why m ̸≡ 0 mod 4 fail). First, recall we can re-express sin(nx) as 1 2i (einx − e−inx), and note that Im being nonzero means that we can ignore the coeﬃcient of 1 2i and simply ﬁnd the m for which the following is nonzero: ∫ 2π 0 (eix − e−ix)(ei2x − e−i2x) · · · (eimx − e −imx)dx. When we expand this product, each term contributes one exponential of the form sneixsnn where sn ∈ {−1, +1}, yielding ∫ 2π 0 ∑ sn∈{−1,+1} s1s2 . . . sm exp ( ix ∑ n snn ) dx. Rearranging the sums and integrals, this becomes ∑ sn∈{−1,+1} s1s2 . . . sm ∫ 2π 0 exp ( ix ∑ n snn ) dx. SMT 2020 Calculus Test Solutions February 22, 2020 Notice that if ∑ n snn is some nonzero integer, ∫ 2π 0 exp ( ix ∑ n snn ) dx = 1 i ∑ n snn ( exp ( 2πi ∑ n snn ) − 1 ) = 0. However, if ∑ n snn = 0, then the integral is just ∫ 2π 0 1dx = 2π. Therefore, we again ignore scaling coeﬃcients 2π, and the expression that should be nonzero is ∑ sn∈{−1,+1},∑n snn=0 s1s2 . . . sm. Now, notice that ∑n snn ≡ ∑n n ≡ m(m + 1)/2 mod 2. So if ∑ n snn = 0, then we must have m(m + 1) ≡ 0 mod 4, i.e. m is either 0 or 3 modulo 4. For a given tuple S = (s1, s2, . . . , sm) such that ∑n snn = 0, let’s split the indices into two sets: PS = {n : sn = +1} and NS = {n : sn = −1}. Notice that s1s2 . . . sm = (−1)|NS |, so the desired quantity can be written as ∑ S (−1) |NS |. If m ≡ 3 mod 4, then |PS| ≡ −|NS| mod 2 since |PS| + |NS| = m ≡ 1 mod 2. Moreover, notice that a valid S can be paired with the valid tuple −S := (−s1, −s2, . . . , −sm), for which N−S = PS and hence (−1)|N−S | +(−1)|NS | = (−1)−|NS | +(−1)|NS | = 0. Clearly, every valid tuple is paired with exactly 1 distinct valid tuple, showing that the desired total sum is 0 if m ≡ 3 mod 4. So assume m = 4k for some positive integer k. In this case, |PS| ≡ |NS| mod 2, meaning that (−1)|N−S | + (−1)|NS | = 2(−1)|NS |. Therefore, we can view the tuples S and −S as equivalent (we refer to them jointly as ±S), and we can view the tuple (P±S, N±S) as just a partition Π±S of {1, 2, . . . , m} into two sets. Since |P±S| ≡ |N±S| mod 2, let us deﬁne a partition Π±S’s parity to be equal to the parity of |P±S|. Let O be the set of ±S with odd Π±S and E be the set of ±S with even Π±S. These sets are clearly ﬁnite, and the desired sum is proportional to |E| − |O|. If the desired total sum is nonzero, then |O| ̸= |E|. We claim that there exists a non-surjective injection from O to E, which would imply |O| < |E|. Consider an element ±S of O and its partition Π±S into two sets A, B such that WLOG A = {1, 2, . . . , x} ∪ A′ and B = {x + 1} ∪ B′ where all elements of A′ and B′ are at least x + 2 and x > 1. These conditions generally hold because when m = 4k, we know m ≥ 4, so the partition cannot be {1}, {2, 3, . . . , m} (this implies the existence of {1, 2, . . . , x} in A with x > 1) and the partition containing 1 cannot be {1, 2, . . . , m} (this implies that x + 1 lies in the set without 1). Now, consider A∗ = {2, 3, . . . , x − 1} ∪ {x + 1} ∪ A′ and B∗ = {1, x} ∪ B′. It is easy to see that since we only swapped {1, x} with {x + 1}, this is a partition that leads to a valid choice of ±S∗. Moreover, since Π±S was odd, we know |B′| is odd and hence |B∗| is even, implying that ±S∗ ∈ E. Thus, we have a valid map from O to E. It is easy to see that this is an injection, but the condition that elements of B′ are at least x + 2 means that it is not a surjection: consider attempting to map to the element that partitions the indices into those equivalent to 0 or 3 mod 4, and those equivalent to 1 or 2 mod 4. For m ≥ 8, this results in one set in the partition having {1, 4, 5, 8, . . .}, meaning 1, x, x + 1 are in the same SMT 2020 Calculus Test Solutions February 22, 2020 side of the partition and is hence impossible to achieve under the map, and for m = 4, there is simply no x + 1. The answer is then ∑25 k=1 4k = 1300 .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
