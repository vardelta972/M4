These se- quences are all in the form, for constant a1, a2,..., ak, xn = a1xn−1 + a2xn−2 + ... + akxn−k We realize that a geometric sequence can also be written as a recurrence. Given that x0 = c and xn = rxn−1 for all n≥0, we can conclude that xn = crn. This is because xn = r(xn−1) = r(r(xn−2)) = r(r(r(xn−3))) = ... = r(r(r(...(c)...)) = rnc. Interestingly enough, linear occurrences can generally be expressed as either a combination of geometric sequences or sequences related to geometric sequences. If we want to make a linear occurrence that satisﬁes xn = crn, it would be of the form xn = crn = a1crn−1 + a2crn−2 + ... + akcrn−k = a1xn−1 + a2xn−2 + ... + akxn−k rearranging gives us crn − a1crn−1 − a2crn−2 − ... − akcrn−k = 0 Dividing both sides by crn−k in order to simplify yields rk − a1rk−1 − a2rk−2 − ... − ak = 0 Since the formula xn = crn satisﬁes the recurrence only if rk − a1rk−1 − a2rk−2 − ... − ak = 0, r must be a root of xk − a1xk−1 − a2xk−2 − ... − ak. This polynomial is known as the characteristic polynomial. Given a general linear sequence, with terms x0,x1,...xk−1deﬁned, and with xn = a1xn−1 + a2xn−2 + ... + akxn−kfor all n ≥ k, we let its characteristic polynomial be xk − a1xk−1 − a2xk−2 − ... − ak. We let this polynomial have roots r1,r2,...rk. The formula for this sequence depends on whether or not the roots r1,r2,...rk are distinct. 1 Lecture 23-Linearly Reccurrent Sequences K.Pahil 1.1 Case 1: The characteristic polynomial has distinct roots Set xn = c1rn 1 + c2rn 2 + ... + ckrn k for n=0,1,...,k-1. This gives us the following system of equations using which we can solve for c1,c2,...ck: x0 = c1 + c2 + ... + ck x2 = c1r1 + c2r2 + ... + ckrk ... xk−1 = c1rk−1 1 + c2rk−1 2 + ... + ckrk−1 k After solving for c1,c2,...ck, we just substitute our result into xn = c1rn 1 + c2rn 2 + ... + ckrn k in order to ﬁnd the general formula for this sequence. 1.2 Case 2: The characteristic polynomial does not have distinct roots Let root r occur m times with m>1. The term crnmust be replaced by c1rn + c2nrn + ... + cmnm−1rm After making this replacement, you can solve using the same process shown when the characteristic polynomial has distinct roots. 2 Examples 2.1 Example 1 2.1.1 Question One of the most well known linearly recurrent sequence is the Fibonacci sequence. It is deﬁned by the formula Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2. Find its general formula. 2.1.2 Solution Since Fn − Fn−1 − Fn−2 = 0, this sequence has a characteristic polynomial x2 − x − 1. Using the quadratic formula the characteristic polynomial’s roots can easily be found to be x = 1±√5 2 . For the sake of simplicity, let α = 1+ √5 2 and let β = 1−√5 2 . We know that Fn = c1αn + c2βn for some constants c1and c2. We know that F0 = 0 and F1 = 1. Setting n = 0 and n = 1, we obtain the equations: 0 = c1 + c2 1 = c1α + c2β Solving this system of equations shows us that c1 = 1 α−β = 1√ 5 and c2 = − 1 α−β = − 1√5 . This means that Fn = 1√5 αn − 1√5 βn = 1√5 (( 1+ √5 2 ) n − ( 1− √5 2 ) n) 2 Lecture 23-Linearly Reccurrent Sequences K.Pahil 2.2 Example 2 2.2.1 Question Given sequence xn = 14xn−1 − 80xn−2 + 238xn−3 − 387xn−4 − 324xn−5 + 108xn−6, and that x0 = 1,x1 = 21,x2 = 123,x3 = 3221,x4 = 11223,x5 = 31442, solve for xn. 2.2.2 Solution This sequence has characteristic polynomial x6 − 14x5 + 80x4 − 238x3 + 387x2 − 324x + 108. Using the rational roots theorem, and a bit of trial and error, the roots of this polynomial can be found to be (x − 3)3(x − 2)2(x − 1). This means that its formula must be of the form xn = a3 n + bn3 n + cn 23 n + d2 n + en2 n + f for some constants a, b, c, d, e, f . Substituting 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 into this equation gives us a + d + f = 1 3a + 3b + 3c + 2d + 2e + f = 21 9a + 18b + 36c + 4d + 8e + f = 123 27a + 81b + 243c + 8d + 24e + f = 3221 81a + 324b + 1296c + 16d + 64e + f = 11223 243a + 1215b + 6075c + 32d + 160e + f = 31442 Solving yields a = 974225 8 ,b = − 72046 3 ,c = 16475 12 ,d = −111184,e = − 64425 2 , f = − 84745 8 . Therefore: xn = ( 974225 8 )3n − ( 72046 3 )n3 n + ( 16475 12 )n23 n − (111184)2 n − ( 64425 2 )n2n − 84745 8 2.3 Example 3 2.3.1 Question Find the set of real numbers a0 for which the inﬁnite sequence (an) of real numbers deﬁned by an+1 = 2n − 3an for n=0, 1, 2, ... is strictly increasing, that is, an < an+1 for n > 0. (British Mathematical Olympiad, 1980). 2.3.2 Solution First it is important to note that an+1 = 2 n − 3anis not quite a linearly recurrent series. In order to ﬁx this, we look at the formulae for an+1and an. an+1 = 2 n − 3an an = 2 n−1 − 3an−1 3 Lecture 23-Linearly Reccurrent Sequences K.Pahil In order to eliminate any powers of two and ﬁnd a true linear recurrence, we multiply both sides of an = 2n−1 − 3an−1 by 2 in order to obtain 2an = 2n − 6an−1. By subtracting this from an+1 = 2 n − 3an, we ﬁnd that an+1 − 2an = 2 n − 3an − (2 n − 6an−1) = −an + 6an−1.Rearranging yields an+1 = −an + 6an−1.This is a linear recurrence with characteristic polynomial x2 + x − 6, which is equal to (x − 2)(x + 3). Therefore an = c12 n + c2(−3)n. In order to solve for c1and c2,we must ﬁnd a0and a1. We leave a0as a variable, and ﬁnd that a1 = 1 − 3a0.This gives us the system of equations c1 + c2 = a0and 2c1 − 3c2 = 1 − 3a0.Solving for c1 and c2 in terms of a0 yields c1 = 1 5 and c2 = a0 − 1 5 . This means that an = ( 1 5 )(2 n) + (a0 − 1 5 )(−3) n. We notice that, unless a0 − 1 5 = 0, (−3)nwill eventually eclipse 2 n.In other words, since (−3)n grows faster than 2 n, the terms in the sequence will begin to alter signs once n gets big enough unless (−3)n has a coeﬃcient of 0. This only occurs when a0 = 1 5 . 2.4 Example 4 2.4.1 Question Given a sequence (xn) deﬁned by x0 = 1 and xn = 2xn−1 + 3n for all n≥1, ﬁnd xn. 2.4.2 Solution First we realize that the sequence in its current form is not a true ruccerence because of the presence of the term 2n. In order to eliminate this term, we create a second equations by substituting n-1 in for n. Before doing this, we rearrange the given equation to give us xn − 2xn−1 = 3n. xn − 2xn−1 = 3n xn−1 − 2xn−2 = 3n − 3 We subtract the second equation from the ﬁrst and ﬁnd that xn − 3xn−1 + 2xn−2 = 3 This equation is also not a true linear recurrence because of the presence of a constant 2. In order to eliminate it, we repeat a process similar to the one used above. We substitute n-1 into the given equation in order to ﬁnd that xn−1 − 3xn−2 + 2xn−3 = 3 Subtracting this from xn − 3xn−1 + 2xn−2 = 3 gives us xn − 4xn−1 + 5xn−2 − 2xn−3 = 0 This process is called shifting the index n. Since we now have a true linear recurrence, we can ﬁnally ﬁnd the characteristic polynomial to be x3 − 4x2 + 5x − 2 = (x − 1)2(x − 2). This tells us that xn = c11 n + c2n1n + c32 n = c1 + c2n + c32n. We also know that x0 = 1, x1 = 2(1) + 3(1) = 5, x2 = 2(5) + 3(2) = 16. By substitution of n=0, 1, 2 into xn = c1 + c2n + c33 n equation, we get the system of equations 1 = c1 + c3 4 Lecture 23-Linearly Reccurrent Sequences K.Pahil 5 = c1 + c2 + 2c3 16 = c1 + 2c2 + 4c3 We can easily solve and ﬁnd that c1 = −6,c2 = −3 and c3 = 7. Therefore xn = (7)(2 n) − 6 − 3n 2.4.3 Trend Any recurrence of the form xn − a1xn−1 − a2xn−2 − ... − akxn−k = f (n) for any arbitrary function f (n) is called an inhomogeneous recurrence. If f (n) satisﬁes any recurrence, you can use the technique of shifting the index n to convert inhomogeneous recurrences into linear recurrence. 3 Problems 1.
