In particular, the sections do not match up. (In fact we have done some of the Chapter 12 material in the text in our Chapter 11 notes.) Our goal is to prove that OK has unique factorization into prime ideals for any number ﬁeld K. We will use this to determine which primes are of the form x2 + 5y2. 12.1 The ideal factorization theorems We are still missing one main ingredient to prove the existence of factorization into prime ideals. The ingredient we need is the following result. Proposition 12.1. Let K be a number ﬁeld and I, J be nonzero proper ideals of OK. If J |I and I ̸= J , then I = J J ′ for some nonzero proper ideal J ′ of OK. In other words, this notion of J |I for ideals, means I really factors as a product I = J J ′. This is an immediate consequence of Corollary 12.6 below. Stillwell gives what is perhaps a simpler argument for this in Section 12.5 when K is an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld. For the moment, let’s take it for granted and see how it implies existence of prime factorization for ideals. Theorem 12.2. (Existence of factorization into prime ideals) Let K be a number ﬁeld and I be a nonzero proper ideal of OK. Then I = p1 · · · pk where pi’s are prime ideals of OK. Proof. Either I is maximal (and therefore prime) or not. If so we’re done, so suppose not. Then there is some prime ideal p1 which contains I by Prop 11.15 and Cor 11.19. By the above proposition, we can write I = p1J1 for some ideal nonzero proper ideal J1. Further J1 ⊇ I. We repeat this argument so that at each stage we get I = p1p2 · · · pnJn and I ⊆ J1 ⊆ J2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ Jn ⊆ OK. This has to terminate at some point because we can only nest in a ﬁnite number of ideals in between I and OK (since OK is ﬁnitely generated—we used this also in Prop. 11.15), i.e., at some point we have Jk = pk is prime. Theorem 12.3. (Uniqueness of prime ideal factorization) Let I be a nonzero proper ideal of OK and suppose I = p1p2 · · · pr = q1q2 · · · qs where each pi and qj is a prime ideal of OK. Then r = s and, up to reordering the qj’s, pi = qi for 1 ≤ i ≤ r. Stillwell gives a simple argument for this, but just like his argument for unique prime factorization in Z, it is lacking when some of the prime ideals are repeated in the factorization. For a complete proof, we would like to make the following argument. Suppose p1p2 · · · pr = q1q2 · · · qs for some prime ideals pi, qj. By the prime divisor property, i.e., the deﬁnition of prime ideals, p1|q1q2 · · · qs implies p1 divides one of the qj’s, say q1. Since p1 and q1 are maximal (prime), p1 divides (contains) q1 implies p1 = q1. Now we would like to be able to multiply both sides by the “inverse” of p1, some p −1 1 , to conclude p2 · · · pr = q2 · · · qs. 88 Repeating this argument would show r = s and pi = qi for each i, giving uniqueness of prime ideal factorizations. Now if we think about ideals in Z, prime ideals are of the form p = (p). Such a p−1 would have to be something like the ideal generated by p−1, which is not an element of Z. Nevertheless, we can formally construct such ideals, which will be called fractional ideals, to apply the above argument. Precisely what we need is given below in Corollary 12.7. It turns out that the theory of fractional ideals will also provide the proof of Proposition 12.1. 12.2 Fractional ideals and the class group Deﬁnition 12.4. Let K be a number ﬁeld, and I ⊆ K. If aI = {ai : i ∈ I} is an ideal of OK for some nonzero a ∈ OK, we say I is a fractional ideal of OK. Further if aI is principal, we say I is principal. Denote the set of nonzero fractional ideals of OK by Frac(OK), and the set of nonzero principal ideals by Prin(OK). Put another way, the fractional ideals of OK are just subsets of the form a−1I where a ∈ OK, a ̸= 0 (possibly a = 1, so this includes the case of usual ideals). It is clear that fractional ideals still satisfy the two deﬁning properties of ideals: (i) closed under addition, and (ii) closed under multiplication by elements of OK. The only thing they don’t satisfy in the deﬁnition of ideals is that they may not be contained in OK. Note on terminology: whenever I say an ideal of OK, I will mean an honest ideal in OK. If I mean fractional ideal, I will always say fractional. However, sometimes I will say ordinary ideal to stress that we are talking about honest ideals contained in OK. Example. The fractional ideals of Z = OQ are 1 n (m) = { k m n : k ∈ Z } where m ∈ N ∪ {0}, n ∈ N and gcd(m, n) = 1. To see this, it is clear from the deﬁnition, together with the classiﬁcation of ideals of Z, that they are subsets of Q of the form a n (m) for some a n ∈ Q and m ∈ N ∪ {0}, i.e., all integer multiples of the rational number an m . Renaming am to m, we see get all multiples of m n . It is clear we may take gcd(m, n) = 1 and n > 0 to give the claim. Hence the fractional ideals of Z are in 1-to-1 correspondence with Q≥0, the set of nonnegative rational numbers. Precisely, the correspondence is a nonnegative rational number corresponds to the fractional ideal which is all integral multiples of that number. Example. Let K be a number ﬁeld. Any ideal of OK is a fractional ideal. If a ∈ K, then aOK is also a fractional ideal. Example. Let K be a number ﬁeld. Then K is not a fractional ideal of OK, even though it satisﬁes the properties of being closed under addition and multiplication by elements of OK, because there is no element a of OK such that aK ⊆ OK. A similar non-example (for the same reason), but perhaps less trivial, is the ring Z[ 1 2 ] = { a 2k : a, k ∈ Z } . One formally deﬁnes the product of fractional ideals in the same way as for ideals: IJ = {i1j1 + i2j2 + · · · ikjk : im ∈ I, jn ∈ J }. The point is every (non-zero) fractional ideal is invertible. Exercise 12.1. Let I = (n) be a non-zero ideal of Z. Check the fractional ideal I −1 = 1 n Z is indeed the inverse of I, i.e., II −1 = (1) = Z. Similarly, for any number ﬁeld K and any non-zero principal ideal I = (α) of OK, show α−1OK is the inverse of I, i.e., II −1 = (1) = OK. 89 Exercise 12.2. Let K be a number ﬁeld. Show the principal fractional ideals of OK correspond to the elements of K, up to units. In fact, the product of principal (fractional) ideals corresponds to the product of elements of K (up to units). In the case K = Q, Frac(OK) is essentially Q>0 the positive rational numbers, which forms a group under multiplication. More generally we have the following. Theorem 12.5. Frac(OK) is an abelian group under multiplication, and OK is the identity element. Exercise 12.3. Check that OK is the identity element of Frac(OK), i.e., if I ∈ Frac(OK), show OK · I = I. Proof. First note that the product of two fractional ideals I and J is again a fractional ideal. This is because there exist a, b ∈ OK such that aI and bJ are ideals of OK. Then abIJ is just the product of two ordinary ideals aI and bJ of OK, and thus itself an ideal of OK. Hence multiplication is a binary operation on Frac(OK). One formally checks from the deﬁnition that multiplication is associative and commutative. This is straightforward and I will not write it down. The exercise above shows OK is a multiplicative identity, so it suﬃces to show every element has an inverse. Let I be an (ordinary) ideal of OK. Deﬁne I −1 = {a ∈ K : aI ⊆ OK}. Then it is easy to see that I −1I ⊆ OK. It takes a little more work to show I −1I = OK, and in the interest of time I will omit it, though it is nothing too diﬃcult (the proof is about 1–1 1 2 pages, see any text on Algebraic Number Theory). Roughly, one can use a descent-type argument to reduce the proof to the case where I maximal. It easy to see I −1 ̸⊆ OK (exercise below), and therefore I −1I is strictly larger than I. But then the maximality of I implies I −1I must be OK. Corollary 12.6. Let I, J be ideals of OK. Then J |I ⇐⇒ I = J J ′ for some (ordinary) ideal J ′ of OK. Proof. Let J ′ be the fractional ideal J ′ = J −1I. Then I = J J ′, and the corollary then reads J |I ⇐⇒ J ′ is an ordinary ideal of OK, i.e., if and only if J ′ = J −1I ⊆ OK. Multiplying both sides by J , this is true if and only if I ⊆ J OK = J , which was the deﬁnition of J |I. This completes the proof of Proposition 12.1, and hence Theorem 12.2. Corollary 12.7. Let I, J , J ′ be ideals of OK. If IJ = IJ ′, then J = J ′. Proof. Multiply by I −1. This completes the proof of Theorem 12.3. Exercise 12.4. Let I, J be ideals of OK. Then J |I ⇐⇒ J ⊇ I ⇐⇒ J −1 ⊆ I −1. (Hint: it’s easy if you use Theorem 12.5 to multiply by inverses like in the corollary above.) Note when J = OK, this says I −1 ⊇ OK. Corollary 12.8. Prin(OK) is a subgroup of Frac(OK). Proof. Since it’s a subset of Frac(OK) is suﬃces to check it’s closed under multiplication and inverses. Suppose I, J ∈ Prin(OK). Then aI = (b) and cJ = (d) for some a, b, c, d ∈ OK where a, c ̸= 0. In other words, I is all integer (OK) multiples of b a and J is the integer multiples of d c . Hence their product is the integer multiples of bd ac , which is again a principal fractional ideal. It is closed under inverses, because I −1 is just the set of all integer multiples of a b (proof same as for Exercise 12.1), which is again a prinicipal fractional ideal. 90 It is simple result from group theory that if A is an abelian group and B is a subgroup, the set of cosets A/B forms an abelian group, called the quotient group. I will assume that you know this, or are willing to take it for granted. We won’t really use the group structure anyway, but we will use the term group. Deﬁnition 12.9. Let K be a number ﬁeld. The class group of K (or of OK) is deﬁned to be the quotient group Frac(Ok)/Prin(OK), and denoted ClK or Cl(OK), or possibly Cl(K) or ClOK , or maybe even HK or H(K). The class number of K (or of OK) is h(K) = hK = #ClK. The class group has been one of the fundamental objects of study in number theory since Gauss developed the theory of binary quadratic forms. Note that the class group is trivial, i.e., the class number is 1, if and only if every fractional ideal of OK is principal. It is easy to see that this happens if and only if every ideal of OK is principal, since the inverses of prinicipal ideals are principal fractional ideals, and the inverses of nonprincipal ideals are nonprincipal fractional ideals. Hence hK = 1 if and only if OK has unique factorization. In fact the class group measures in a very precise way, exactly just how much unique factorization can fail in OK, and these notions have been studied over the past 50 years. For instance, in 1960 Carlitz showed that every irreducible factorization of an element α in OK has the same length (number of irreducible factors, with multiplicity) if and only if hK ≤ 2. The quantitative study of the relation with the class group of OK and the non-uniqueness of factorization in OK for some reason is not addressed in most number theory texts, but for a good account of this theory, see Chapter 9 of Narkiewicz’s Elementary and Analytic Theory of Algebraic Numbers. One of the major problems of algebraic number theory is understanding the class group of a number ﬁeld. In particular, using Minkowski’s theorem (see Chapter 8, the second proof) one can provide a bound on the class number, which is suﬃcient to determine the class number in special cases, but not in general. On the other hand, Dirichlet proved an exact formula for the class number of quadratic ﬁelds in terms of his L-functions, but again this is not always computationally feasible enough to use to pin down the class number exactly. Indeed if one looks at a table of class numbers just for imaginary quadratic ﬁelds, there is no apparent pattern, so one can not hope for an elementary formula. I brieﬂy discussed the problem of determining which quadratic ﬁelds have class number 1 in the section on PIDs, since these notions are equivalent, so this should give you some idea of the state of things. Recall in particular that there are 9 imaginary quadratic ﬁelds K = Q( √−d) such that OK is a PID, i.e., has class number 1. Using Minkowski’s bound it is easy to check that these 9 ﬁelds found by Gauss all have class number 1, but it is much harder to show that there are no others. In fact these questions are related to diﬃcult problems in the theory of elliptic curves. In 2004, Watkins determined all imaginary quadratic ﬁelds with class number n for n ≤ 100 (there are ﬁnitely many). However, a s mentioned before, it is not even known if there are inﬁnitely many real quadratic ﬁelds with class number 1, but it is conjectured that about 75% do. 12.3 Equivalence classes Deﬁnition 12.10. Let K be a number ﬁeld and I, I ′ ∈ Frac(OK). We say I and I ′ are equivalent, and write I ∼ I ′, if I ′ = J I for some J ∈ Prin(OK). In other words, with this notion of equivalence, the class group is the group of equivalence classes in Frac(OK). In other words, I ′ ∼ I means I ′ = αI for some α ∈ K (by Exercise 12.2), i.e., equivalent fractional ideals just diﬀer by scalars. 91 Now we can relate this notion with the book’s geometric notion of the “shape” of an ideal. If K = Q( √−d) is an imaginary quadratic ﬁeld, then OK is a lattice in C. Similarly, any fractional or ordinary ideal of OK will be a lattice in C, and two of them will have the same shape if an only if they diﬀer by scalars (remember, a real number scalars would just scale a lattice symmetrically by a certain amount, and a complex number scalar will involve a rotation). Hence two (fractional or ordinary) ideals if and only if they are equivalent. The following is an immediate consequence of the deﬁnition of fractional ideals and equivalence, but worth pointing out. Lemma 12.11. Let K be a number ﬁeld. If I ∈ Frac(OK), then I ∼ I ′ where I ′ is an ordinary ideal of OK. Proof. By deﬁnition I ′ = aI is an ordinary ideal of OK for some a ∈ OK. Since I ′ = (a)I, I ′ ∼ I. 12.4 Primes of the form x2 + 5y2 One of our motivating questions this semester was: which numbers are of the form x2 + ny2? By Brahmagupta’s composition law, this essentially reduces to the question of which primes are of the form x2 + ny2, which has a much cleaner answer (cf. Chapter 6 for n = 1). We have dealt with the cases n = 1, 2, 3 by using unique factorization in the rings Z[i], Z[ √−2] and Z[ζ3] = OQ( √−3. By the exercise below, we can reduce the n = 4 case to the n = 1 case because x2 + 4y2 = x2 + (2y)2. Exercise 12.5. Use Fermat’s 2 square theorem to determine the primes of the form x2 + 4y2 (Exercise 12.8.1). Hence the next logical case is n = 5. Unfortunately, the same approach does not work because Z[ √−5] = OQ( √−5) does not have unique factorization. Lemma 12.12. The class number hQ( √−5) = 2, and representatives for the class group are (1) and (2, 1 + √−5). Proof. First note the class number is not 1, i.e., Z[ √−5] is not a PID, since p = (2, 1 + √−5) is not a principal ideal. The argument is the same as for the ideal (2, 1 + √−5) in Z[ √−3]. Here is one argument. Let α be an non-zero element of p of smallest possible norm. Recall the N (a+b √−5) = a2 +5b2, so the only elements of norm less than 4 = N (2) in Z[ √−5] are ±1. Note 1 ∈ p (which is equivalent to −1 ∈ p) means 1 = 2(a + b √−5) + (1 + √−5)(c + d √−5) = 2a + 2b √−5 + c − 5d + (c + d)√−5 Looking at real and imaginary parts we have 1 = 2a + c − 5d and 0 = 2b + c + d, but the ﬁrst means c ̸≡ d mod 2 and the second means c ≡ d mod 2 which is impossible. Hence α = ±2. If p were principal, it would have to be generated by α, which it is not, since 1 + √−5 ̸∈ (α). Hence the class number is at least 2. To show it equals 2, we want to show that if I is any non-principal fractional ideal of Z[ √−5] is equivalent to (2, √−5). It in fact suﬃces to show this for I an ordinary non-prinicpal ideal, since I is equivalent to an ordinary ideal by the previous lemma. Let α be a non-zero element of I of minimal norm. Since I is not principal, there exists an element β ∈ I such that β ̸∈ (α). Consider the rectangle (p. 232 of Stillwell) with corners 0, α, 92 √−5α and (1 + √−5)α. By adding appropriate an appropriate multiple of α to β, we may assume β lies in this rectangle. In fact, by replacing β with α − β if necessary, we may assume β is in the “left half” of the rectangle. Similarly, replacing β with (1 + √−5)α − β if necessary, we may assume β is in the “lower left quadrant” of the rectangle. This means 2β will still be contained in the rectangle. In particular N (2β) ≤ N ((1 + √−5)α), since the norm is just the square of the distance from the origin. But this means N (β) ≤ N (α) since N (2) = N (1 + √−5) = 4. Then by the assumption that N (α) is minimal, we conclude N (α) = N (β). Then the only possibility for β is β = 1+ √−5 2 α (any other point in the “lower left quadrant” of the rectangle has smaller norm). Now we claim I = (α, β). If not, take γ ∈ I but not in (α, β). Applying the same argument above for γ in place of β, we may assume γ is in the lower left quadrant, and conclude that γ = β = 1+ √−5 2 , a contradiction. Hence I = (α, β) = (α, 1 + √−5 2 α) ∼ 2(α, 1 + √ −5 2 α) = (2α, (1 + √−5)α) ∼ (2, 1 + √−5). Example. Let q = (3, 1 + √−5) ∈ Z[√−5]. As above, one may show q is not principal. Thus q ∼ p = (2, 1 + √−5). To see this directly, note that (1 + √−5)p = (2(1 + √−5), −4 + 2√−5) = (2(1 + √ −5), 6) ∼ (1 + √−5, 3). The only non-obvious equality is the middle one, but this is true because 6 = 2(1 + √−5) − (−4 +√−5) ∈ (2(1 + √ −5), −4 + 2 √−5). Hence (2(1 + √−5), −4 + 2 √−5) ⊇ (2(1 + √−5), 6). Writing −4 + √−5 = 2(1 + √−5) − 6, we see that (2(1 + √−5), −4 + 2√−5) ⊆ (2(1 + √−5), 6) also holds. Let us take for granted the following basic facts on norms of ideals, which I may prove formally next semester. Proposition 12.13. Let K be a number ﬁeld and I, J be ideals of OK. Then N (IJ ) = N (I)N (J ). Further if K = Q(√d) is a quadratic ﬁeld (real or imaginary) and a ∈ OK, then N (a) = N ((a)), i.e., the norm of the element a (as previously deﬁned N (a) = aa) equals the norm of principal ideal (a). The multiplicativity is essentially just a standard ring isomorphism theorem, which says (OK/I) ≃ (OK/IJ )/(I/IJ ). The cardinality of the quotient on the left is N (I), while that on the right is N (IJ )/N (J ). Theorem 12.14. Let p ∈ N be prime. Then p = x2 + 5y2 for some x, y ∈ Z ⇐⇒ p ≡ 1, 9 mod 20. Proof. (⇒) Suppose p = x2 + 5y2. It is clear p ̸= 2, 5, so p mod 20 must be relatively prime to 2 and 5. The squares mod 20 are 0, 1, 4, 5, 9, 16. Thus the only values of x2 + 5y2 that are relatively prime to 2 and 5 are 1 and 9. (⇐) Suppose p ≡ 1, 9 mod 20. By quadratic reciprocity, we see that (−5 p ) = 1, i.e., p|m2 + 5 = (m + √−5)(m − √−5) for some m ∈ Z. On the other hand p ∤ m ± √−5 in Z[ √−5] since m p ± √−5 p ̸∈ Z[ √−5]. In other word, the principal ideal (p)|(m + √−5)(m − √−5) in Z[ √−5] but (p) ∤ (m + √−5) and (p) ∤ (m − √−5) (these are denote principal ideals). Hence (p) is not a prime ideal of Z[ √−5]. 93 Now by the prime ideal factorization theorem, (p) factors into prime ideals (p) = p1p2 · · · pr. Looking at norms, we see N (p1)N (p2) · · · N (pr) = N ((p)) = N (p) = p2. Since each N (pi) > 1 (otherwise pi = OK), we must have r = 2 and N (p1) = N (p2) = p. Consider p1. Either it is principal or not. If it is, say p1 = (a + b √−5). Then N (p1) = p means N (a + b √−5) = a2 + 5b2 = p, and we are done. If not, then p1 ∼ (2, 1 + √−5) so p1 = α(2, 1 + √−5) for some α ∈ K. Writing α = a b + c d √−5 with a, b, c, d ∈ Z, we see 2α, (1 + √−5)α ∈ OK implies either α ∈ OK (b = d = 1) or α = 1+ √−5 2 OK (b = d = 2 and a ≡ c mod 2). However one easily checks that 1+ √−5 2 (2, 1 + √ −5) = (1 + √−5, −4 + 2√ −5) = (1 + √−5, 2), so without loss of generality we may assume α ∈ OK. But then p1 = (α)(2, 1+√−5) is a factorization of p1 into ideals of OK. Since p1 is prime (maximal), this factorization must be trivial, i.e., we must have (α) = Z[ √−5]. But then N (p1) = N ((2, 1+√−5)) = 2 (as computed in your homework), which is not ≡ 1, 9 mod 20. Hence p1 must be principal. Remarks. (1) While we did not explicitly use uniqueness of prime factorization, we used the existence, together with the explicit structure of the class group of Z[ √−5]. Both of these inputs rely on the fact that Frac(OK) is a group, which was our key to proving the uniqueness. Additionally, one may want to use uniqueness in to prove the fact that the norm is multiplicative. (2) An alternative proof that does not rely on the unproven norm facts is in the last section of Stillwell. However, I opted for the above proof because (i) it is much simpler, (ii) it illustrates the usefulness of norms of ideals, (iii) it is more typical and enlightening of the applications of ideal factorization, and (iv) it is much more similar to the arguments we made before for Z, Z[i] and Z[ √−2]. (3) Here is an alternative way to compute N ((2, 1 + √−5)). Since (2, 1 + √−5) divides (2), we must have (2) = (2, 1 + √−5)p for some proper ideal p (in fact p = (2, 1 + √−5). Then 4 = N ((2)) = N ((2, 1 + √−5))N (p) which implies N ((2, 1 + √−5)) = N (p) = 2. You are free to use the multiplicativity of the norm on the ﬁnal exam. To close, let us revisit the example of the non-unique factorization 6 = 2 · 3 = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5) in Z[√−5]. In terms of principal ideals, this says 36 (6)= 4 (2) 9 (3)= 6 (1 + √−5) 6 (1 − √−5) . Here the numbers above the ideals are the norms of each ideal. So in some sense, this non-unique factorization is like the non-unique factorization of 36 into two non-irreducibles of Z. Let p = (2, 1 + √ −5), q = (3, 1 + √−5) and q = (3, 1 − √−5). We have already computed that N (p) = 2. Similarly one computes N (q) = N (q) = 3. If the norm of an ideal is prime in Z, that means the ideal itself must be a prime ideal (by multiplicativity), so p, q, q are all prime ideals. Note that 1 − √−5 = 2 − (1 + √−5) ∈ p (this is why we don’t consider p, since p = p), so p|(2), p|(1 + √−5) and p|(1 − √−5). Similarly, q|(3), q|(1 + √−5), and q|(3), q|(1 − √−5). One can easily check that q ̸= q, so we have 2 divisors of the ideal (3). Since N (q)N (q) = N ((3)), there can’t be any other divisors. This proves (3) = qq 94 (without explicitly doing the calculation of the product on the right, though one could obviously also do that). Similarly we have (1 + √−5) = pq, (1 − √−5) = pq. Finally, to check (2) = p 2 we can do the same argument of norms, ones we check that 2 ∈ p2 so we know that p2|(2). An alternative argument is the following—since Cl(Z[√−5]) has order 2, any ideal squared must be equivalent to (1), i.e., the square of any ideal is principal. In particular p2 is principal, and since it has norm 4 it must be generated by an element of Z[ √−5] of norm 4—but the only such elements are ±2. Thus the non-unique factorization is resolved in terms of ideals as (6) = (2)(3) = p 2qq = (pq)(pq) = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5). Another way to look at this example, more in line with Kummer’s original ideas of adding ideal numbers to the ring, is the following. Somehow p should be correspond to the “ideal number” α = 1+ √−5 3 . The reason for this, is that if p were a principal ideal (α), both 2 and 1 + √ −5 would have to be multiples of α. Since p ̸= Z[ √−5], α ̸= 1, and a reasonable choice would be α = 1+ √−5 3 . Then α(1 − √−5) = 2 and 3α = 1 + √−5. Similarly, we see that q is like the “ideal number” β = 1+ √−5 2 and q is like the “ideal number” β = 1− √−5 2 . In terms of α, β, β, we can resolve the factorization 2 · 3 = 1 + √−5 3 (1 − √−5) · (1 + √−5) 1 − √−5 2 = 1 + √−5 3 1 − √−5 2 (1 + √ −5) · (1 − √−5) = (1 + √−5) · (1 − √−5) in the ring Z[α, β, β]. The technical problem is that α, β, β are not algebraic integers—for instance β − β2 = 1 2 . This this ring has inﬁnite degree over Z (a Z-basis for the ring is inﬁnite) and this factorization, while resolved, is in fact made trivial, because 2, 3 and 6 are all units in this ring. There are, however, ways to recover unique factorization in Z[ √−5] (without trivializing the problems) by passing to the ring of integers of a larger number ﬁeld. For instance every element of Z[√ −5] factors uniquely into irreducibles in the ring of integers of K = Q( √−5, √2). However, other diﬃculties arise with this approach, which I’ve alluded to before: (1) in general, how do you ﬁnd the appropriate number ﬁeld K to work in, (2) how do you determine its ring of integers OK and irreducible elements of OK, (3) this ring OK itself may not have unique factorization. (While we can guarantee any element of the smaller ring factors uniquely into irreducibles in OK, this may not be true for every element of OK). Thus the approach via Dedekind’s ideal theory is generally the most satisfactory. 95","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
