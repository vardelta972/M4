Find all functions f : R → R such that for all real numbers x and y, f (xf (y) + x) = xy + f (x). Solution: Putting x = 1, y = −1 − f (1) and letting a = f (y) + 1, we get f (a) = f (f (y) + 1) = y + f (1) = −1. Putting y = a and letting b = f (0), we get b = f (xf (a) + x) = ax + f (x), so f (x) = −ax + b. Putting this into the equation, we have a 2xy − abx − ax + b = xy − ax + b. Equating coeﬃcients, we get a = ±1 and b = 0, so f (x) = x or f (x) = −x. We can easily check both are solutions. A2. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers. Prove that x x + √(x + y)(x + z) + y y + √(y + z)(y + x) + z z + √(z + x)(z + y) ≤ 1. Solution: By Cauchy, we have (x + y)(x + z) ≥ ( √xy + √xz) 2. Hence, ∑ cyc x x + √(x + y)(x + z) ≤ ∑ cyc x x + √xy + √xz = ∑ cyc √x √x + √y + √z = 1. A3. Let p(x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Does there always exist a positive integer k such that p(x) − k is irreducible? (An integer polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two nonconstant integer polynomials.) Solution: Yes. Choose k such that the constant term of p(x)−k is −q, where q is some large prime (to be speciﬁed later). Now, suppose p(x) − k = f (x)g(x) for some nonconstant integer polynomials f, g. Since q is prime, looking at the constant term, we must have that either |f (0)| = 1 or |g(0)| = 1. Assume without loss of generality |f (0)| = 1. Then if r1, . . . , rk are the roots of f , we have |r1 · · · rk| = 1/|a| ≤ 1, where a is the leading coeﬃcient of f . Therefore, there is some ri such that |ri| ≤ 1. Consequently, we must have that p(ri) − k = 0. Let p(x) − k = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x − q, then q = \f \f \f \f \f n∑ k=1 akrk i \f \f \f \f \f ≤ n∑ k=1 |ak||ri| k ≤ n∑ k=1 |ak|. Therefore, if we pick k large enough so that q > ∑n k=1 |ak|, then we have a contradiction, which means that p(x) − k is irreducible.

Let X be a ﬁnite set of positive integers and A a subset of X. Prove that there exists a subset B of X such that A equals the set of elements of X which divide an odd number of elements of B. First solution: We construct B in stages. Set B = ∅ and consider every number in X, starting with the largest and going down. For each element x ∈ X, see whether it divides the correct parity of elements in B. (That is, if x ∈ A, x divides an odd number of elements in B; if x ∈ X − A, x divides an even number of elements in B.) If it does not, add it to B. Thus the ﬁrst element added to B is the largest element of A. Now, this procedure will not change the divisibility condition for any element greater than x, and will fulﬁll the condition for x. Thus when all elements of X have been examined, the divisibility conditions will be satisﬁed by all elements of X, and B will be as desired. Second solution: Given B a subset of X, it is clear that there is a unique A such that A equals the set of elements of X which divide an odd number of elements of B. Now, given two distinct subsets, B1, B2 ⊆ X, let us show that the corresponding subsets A1, A2 ⊆ X are distinct too. If B1 and B2 are not disjoint, then we can simply replace B1 by B1 − B1 ∩ B2 and replace B2 by B2 − B1 ∩ B2, as this would not change the distinctness of the two resulting A1, A2. So we assume that B1 and B2 are disjoint. Let n be the largest element in B1 ∪ B2. Say that n ∈ B1. Then n ∈ A1 but n /∈ A2. It follows that B1 ̸= B2 implies A1 ̸= A2. It follows that the map sending B to A is a bijection from the subsets of X to itself. Thus for every A, we can ﬁnd a corresponding B. Source: 102 Combinatorics Problems C2. Let B be a set of more than 2n+1/n distinct points with coordinates of the form (±1, ±1, . . . , ±1) in n-dimensional space with n ≥ 3. Show that there are three distinct points in B which are the vertices of an equilateral triangle. Solution: Let S be the set of points with all coordinates equal to ±1. For each P ∈ B, let SP be the set of points in S which diﬀer from P in exactly one coordinate. Since there are more than 2 n+1/n points in B, and each SP has n elements, the cardinalities of the sets SP sum to more than 2n+1, which is to say, more than twice the number of points in S. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be a point of S in at least three of the sets, say in SP , SQ, SR. But then any two of P, Q, R diﬀer in exactly two coordinates, so P QR is an equilateral triangle of side length 2√2, by the Pythagorean Theorem. Source: Putnam 2000 C3. Let S be a set of n points on a plane, no three collinear. A subset of these points is called polite if they are the vertices of a convex polygon with no points of S in the interior. Let ck denote the number of polite sets with k points. Show that the sum n∑ i=3(−1) ici depends only on n and not on the conﬁguration of the points. Solution: Consider the sum ∑ T ⊆S,|T |≥3(−1) |T |. (†) This clearly does not depend on the conﬁguration of the points, and so we may call it f (n), where n = |S|. (It is easy to see that f (n) = − 1 2 (n − 1)(n − 2), but we will not need this.) Alternatively, let us calculate (†) by ﬁrst grouping subsets of S into collection of subsets that share the same convex hull. If the convex hull has t vertices on the boundary, and k points of S inside, then its contribution to the sum in (†) will be (−1) t k∑ i=0(−1)i( k i ), 2 which equals to zero if k ≥ 1 and (−1) t otherwise (consider the expansion of (1 − 1)k). In other words, if T is a subset of S whose vertices form a convex polygon, then the collection that T belongs to contributes (−1)t to the sum if T is polite and 0 otherwise. Therefore, n∑ i=3(−1)ici = ∑ T ⊂S,|T |≥3(−1) |T | = f (n).

G1. Let ABC be an acute triangle. The points M and N are taken on the sides AB and AC, respectively. The circles with diameters BN and CM intersect at points P and Q respectively. Prove that P, Q and the orthocenter H are collinear. Solution: We need to show that H lies on the radical axis of the two circles, and thus it suﬃces to show that it is equal powers with respect to the two circles. Let Y and Z be the feet of the altitudes from B and C, respectively. Since ∠BY N = 90◦, Y lies on the circle with diameter BN . Since BY passes through H, it follows that the power of H with respect to this circle is HB · HY . Similarly, the power of H with respect to the other circle is HC · HZ. On the other hand, HB · HY = HC · HZ since B, C, Y, Z are concyclic. Thus, H has equal powers with respect to the two circles. Source: Leningrad 1988 G2. Let ABC be a triangle with AC ̸= AB, and select point B1 on ray AC such that AB = AB1. Let ω be the circle passing through C, B1, and the foot of the internal bisector of angle CAB. Let ω intersect the circumcircle of triangle ABC again at Q. Prove that AC is parallel to the tangent to ω at Q. Solution: Let the angle bisector of ∠BAC meet BC at E and ω again at D. We have ∠ADB1 = ∠ADB = ∠ACB (this is true in both conﬁgurations) and it follows that C, B1, E, D are concyclic. Thus Q = D. Let ℓ be the line tangent to ω at Q. Then we have ∠(ℓ, DA) = ∠ECD = ∠BCD = ∠BAD = ∠CAD. It follows that ℓ is parallel to AC. Source: Russia 2001 G3. Let OAB and OCD be two directly similar triangles (i.e., CD can be obtained from AB by some rotation and dilatation both centered at O). Suppose their incircles meet at E and F . Prove that ∠AOE = ∠DOF . Solution: Let Ω1 be the incircle of OAB and Ω2 the incircle of OCD. Suppose that Ω1 touches OA at X, and Ω2 touches OC at Y . Consider an inversion about O with radius √ |OX| · |OY |. Suppose that Ω1 gets sent to Ω ′ 1 and Ω2 gets sent to Ω ′ 2. Note that the choice of the radius of inversion implies that the radii of Ω1 and Ω ′ 2 are equal, and that the radii of Ω ′ 1 and Ω2 are equal. It follows that Ω′ 1 is the reﬂection of Ω2 about the angle bisector of ∠AOD, and likewise with Ω1 and Ω′ 2. Let E′ denote the image of E, so that E′ is an intersection point of Ω ′ 1 and Ω′ 2. Then, E′ is the reﬂection of F across the angle bisector of ∠AOD. But O, E, E′ are collinear. It follows that ∠AOE = ∠AOE′ = ∠DOF .

Let n > 1 be an odd integer. Prove that n does not divide 3 n + 1. Solution: Assume to the contrary that there is a positive odd integer n that divides 3 n + 1. Let p be the smallest prime divisor of n. Then p divides 3 n + 1; that is, 3 n ≡ −1 (mod p), so 32n ≡ 1 (mod p). By Fermat’s little theorem, we also have 3 p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). It follows that 3 gcd(2n,p−1) ≡ 1 (mod p). Since p is the smallest prime divisor of n, gcd(n, p − 1) = 1. Because n is odd, p − 1 is even. Hence gcd(2n, p − 1) = 2. It follows that 32 ≡ 1 (mod p), or p divides 8, which is impossible as p is odd. N2. Let S be a ﬁnite set of integers, each greater than 1. Suppose that for each integer n there is some s ∈ S such that gcd(s, n) = 1 or gcd(s, n) = s. Show that there exist s, t ∈ S such that gcd(s, t) is prime. Solution: Let n be the smallest positive integer such that gcd(s, n) > 1 for all s in n; note that n has no repeated prime factors. By the condition on S, there exists s ∈ S which divides n. On the other hand, if p is a prime divisor of s, then by the minimality of n, n/p is relatively prime to some element t of S. Since n cannot be relatively prime to t, t is divisible by p, but not by any other prime divisor of s (any such prime divides n/p). Thus gcd(s, t) = p, as desired. Source: Putnam 1999 N3. Let a positive integer k be given. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many pairs of integers (a, b) with |a| > 1 and |b| > 1 such that ab + a + b divides a 2 + b 2 + k. Solution: By inspection, we see that if (a, b) = (0, 1), then a 2 + b 2 + k is divisible by ab + a + b: a 2 + b2 + k ab + a + b = k + 1. (†) Let us rearrange this as a quadratic in a: a 2 − (k + 1)(b + 1)a + (b − 1)(b − k) = 0. As a quadratic in a, the sum of the roots is (k + 1)(b + 1). Hence, if (a, b) is a solution to (†), then so is ((k + 1)(b + 1) − a, b), and hence by symmetry of (†), so is (b, (k + 1)(b + 1) − a). Deﬁne a sequence (an) as follows: a1 = 0, a2 = 1, and an = (k + 1)(an−1 + 1) − an−2 for all n ≥ 2. Then by the above reasoning, (a, b) = (an, an+1) is a solution of (†) for all n ≥ 0. Furthermore, the sequence (an) is increasing, giving an inﬁnite number of positive integer solutions. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
