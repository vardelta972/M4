S. Cassels. 1. The solution of the title equation in integers x, y for given integers a > 1, 6 > 1 has been dicussed by W. J. LeVeque [2]. The second paragraph of this note shows that y is odd if x > 1, and that any prime divisor of y which is less than x divides a, and vice versa. The third paragraph proves simply a stronger form of LeVeque's theorem, that there is at most one solution, which can be specified completely. The third paragraph uses the results of the second only to secure a slight refinement of the enunciation. It is conjectured that there are only a finite number of nontrivial solu? tions a, 6, x, y of the equation. 2. We first have the trivial Theorem I. (x, y) = 1. Proof. Suppose that x = px?, y = py? for p > 1. Then a^ ? 6^ = 1 with % = a% bt = 6^; which is clearly impossible. Theorem II. If x > 1, then 2\\y. Proof. Otherwise, by the preceding argument we should have a solution a, 6, x, y of am ? 62 = 1 with odd prime x. But then 1 + ib ? e(p + H)?\\ p% _[_ q2 ==i a for some unit ? and by replacing p -f- iq by w(p -\\- iq) with a suitable unit y we may suppose that e = 1. Bquating coeffieients we now have l=sp^pw--i ? ix(x ? i)|^-3g2_|_. . .-txq*-1), and so p ===== ? 1. By considering conguences modulo x we have p = 1, and so (1) (x ?1)/2? (x ? l)(x? 2)(x-~ 3)g2/4! + - ? ? ? q*-1 = 0. Since 2 | (1 ? i)w we have | q | > 1. Let r be a prime divisor of q. We shall show that all the terms on the left of (1) except the first are * Received September 8, 1952. 160 J. W. S. CASSELS. divisible by a higher power of r than that dividing (x ?l)/2; which con- tradicts (1). It is enough to show that for k^.2 the Iraction 2(x ? 2) ? ? ? (x ? 2k + l)q2k~3/(2k) ! = (x ? 2)'--(x ? 2k + l)/(2h'? 2) ! ? q2k~3/k(2k ? 1) does not have r in its denominator when reduced. The first factor is an integer. For ^4 we have r2k~3 | q2k~3, but r2k~3 ^ 22k~3 >k(2k ? l), so then the statement is certainly true. For k = 2, 3 we have r \\ q2k~z, but r2\\k(2k ? 1) since k(2k ? 1) =6,15 respectively is squarefree, and again the statement is true. Hence the assumption that ax ? b2 = 1 is soluble leads to a contradiction. We require two trivial lemmas. Lemma 1. Let p be an odd prime and c > 1 an integer. Then f = (c%>? l)/(o? 1) is prime to p or divisible by p but not by p2 according as c#l (p) or cs=l (p). The number f,f/p respectively is odd, greater than 1 and prime to c ? 1. Further, g = (cp -{-1)/(c -\\- 1) is prime to p or divisible by p but not by p2 according as c^ ? 1 (p) or C?=?1 (p). The number g,g/p respec? tively is odd and prime to c + 1; it is greater than 1 except when (2) c = 2, p = 3. Proof. If q is a prime divisor of c ?1, then / = 1 + o -f- ? ? ? cp_1 = p (q) and so q | / implies q = p- If c == 1 + rP? ^nen f = 1 + (1 + rp) + (1 + 2rp) + ? ? ? + (1 + (p - 1) rp) ^ p (p2) and so the greatest common divisor of c ? 1, / is 1 or p. In particular f is odd if c is odd. If c is even, then /s? 1/1 (2) is again odd. Finally, it is obvious that / > p. As before, the greatest common divisor of g and c + 1 is 1 or p, and g is odd. Also g CP + 1 22>+1 23+l p p(c + l) ~ p.d -\" 3.3 with equality in both places only if c = 2, p = 3. 1, Lemma 2. Let c > 1. If c is even, then c + 1, c ? 1 are coprime. If c is odd, then one of c + 1, c ? 1 say c ? 1, is not divisible by 4; and then f (c ? 1) is prime to c zp 1. ON THE EQUATION aw-by = 1. 161 Proof. Clear We can now prove Theorem III. (i) If p is prime and p\\x, p\\b, then p > y. (ii) If p is prime and p\\y, p\\a>>> then p > x. Proof. We first prove (i) and put x = px?. By Lemmas 1,2 the numbers (ax ? 1)/'(a?1?1) and aWl?1 are coprime, and so aXl ? 1 = cy for some c | 6. Hence 6^ = (cv + l)p ? 1 and so 6 > c?, i. e. 6 ^ c? + 1. Then (cp + i)*><; &= (cv+ i)p ? i < (cy + iy, and so p > y ([1] Theorem 19). For (ii) we first note that p > 2 by Theorem II. Put y = py? and so, as before, 6^ + 1 = dm > 1 for some d \\ a. Hence a? = (dw ? l)p + 1 and so a^dP?1. Thus (*??1)*^^= (#>?1)p + 1 > (#* ?1)*, and so p > #. We call a solution nontrivial if x > 1, ^/ > 1 an(i deduce Corollary 1. For a non-trivial solution it is impossible that (x,b) ===== (y,a) =1. For a later purpose we require Corollary 2. There are no nontrivial solutions of 2X ? bv = 1. Proof. If y > 1, 6 > 1 then # > 1 and so ?/ is odd by Theorem II. Hence each prime factor of y is greater than x and in particular 6*> > 2y > 2^, a contradiction. 3. The following theorem enables all solutions of the title equation to be found for given a, 6. Theorem IV. Let (3) ax ? by==l, where x, y, a > 1, 6 > 1 are positive integers and the equation is not (4) 32 ? 23 = 1. 162 j. w. s. cassels. Suppose that ?,?) are the least positive solutions of where A, B are the products of the odd primes dividing a, b respectively. Then x = ?, y = tj ; except that x = 2, y = 1 may occur if ? ===== y = 1 a?i^ a + 1 ^ * power of 2. Proof. We first prove |/ ===== ^. Clearly ?? | y. Suppose y/^ is even. Then &=== (?1)2//?? = i ^?i (^) nnless A=>1, i.e. unless a- is a power of 2. But then 0^ = 6^ + 1 = 2(4) and so 6^ = 2, 6 = 1; which is excluded. Hence y/^ is odd. Suppose that y/rj is divisible by an odd prime p, say y = py1} 7j\\y?. Then by the second part of Lemma 1 there is an odd prime q dividing (6^ + l)/(6^ + 1) (and so a) but not dividing 6^-f-l; except in the case (2) which corresponds to (4). Hence 6^-f-1^0 (q) and a fortiori byi^?1 (A). The contradiction proves y =77. We now prove the statements about x. Clearly ? | x. The proof that x/? is a power of 2 runs exactly as before using now the first part of Lemma 1. If 2? | x, say x = 2xx, ? | xt, then a similar argument using Lemma 2 leads to an absurdity unless aWl + 1 contains no odd prime factors, i. e. a?1 -f-1 = %m for some m > 0. If now x?^?, then 2 | x? and so 2OT = a?1 + 1 ? 2 (4) i. e. m = a = 1, which is excluded. Henee x = ? or x = 2|, the latter only if (5) ^+1==2W. But (5) implies |=1 by Theorem III, Corollary 2. Now a +1 ? 2m, a2 ? 1 = 6y and hence 0?1 = 2cy for some odd c, where y\\ (m-f-1). Finally, 2 = 2m ? 2c? and hence 1 ? 2m~1 ? cK By Theorem III, Corollary 2 this implies c = l or y = ^ = 1. The case c = 1 gives a = 3 and so the exception (4) of the theorem; and the case j/ == ^7 ===== 1 gives the exception at the end of the enuneiation. Trinity College, Cambridge, Bngland. REFERENCES.
