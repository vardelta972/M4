Problem 1. Given triangle ABC the point J is the centre of the excircle opposite the vertex A. This circle is tangent to the side BC at M, and to the lines AB and AC at K and L, respectively. The lines LM and BJ meet at F, and the lines KM and CJ meet at G. Let S be the point of intersection of the lines AF and BC, and let T be the point of intersection of the lines AG and BC. Prove that M is the midpoint of ST. (The excircle of ABC opposite the vertex A is the circle that is tangent to the line segment BC, to the ray AB beyond B, and to the ray AC beyond C.) Problem 2. Let n ≥ 3 be an integer, and let a2,a3,…,an be positive real numbers such that a2a3⋯an =1. Prove that (1+a2)2(1+a3)3⋯(1+an)n > nn. Problem 3. The liar’s guessing game is a game played between two players A and B. The rules of the game depend on two positive integers k and n which are known to both players.

Despite cold weather, jet lag and delay of luggage, I managed to get myself involved in choosing the problems for the contest. Once the “easy” pair was selected, the jury did not have much choice but to choose problems of possibly other topics for the “medium” and the “difficult” pairs. The two papers of the contest were then set. We had to decide the various official versions and the marking scheme of the contest. After that, I just had to wait for the contestants to finish the contest and get myself involved in the coordination to decide the points obtained by our team. Here I would like to discuss the problems. (Please see Olympiad Corner for the statements of the problems.) Problem 1. Really problem 1 is quite easy, merely a lot of angle chasings and many angles of 90° (tangents) and similar triangles, etc, and no extra lines or segments needed to be constructed. First note that ∠AKJ =∠ALJ = 90°, hence A,K,L,J lie on the circle ω with diameter AJ. The idea is to show that F and G also lie on the same circle. Looking at angles around B, we see that 4∠MBJ +2∠ABC = 360°. Thus∠MBJ = 90°− ½∠ABC. Also,∠BMF=∠CML = ½∠ACB (as CM=CL). Then ∠LFJ = ∠MBJ −∠BMF = ½∠BAC. Thus ∠LFJ =∠LAJ. Hence, F lies on ω. By the same token, so is G. Now AB and SB are symmetric with respect to the external bisector of ∠ABC, so is BK and BM. Now SM = SB+BM = AB+BK =AK. Similarly, TM=AL. So SM=TM. It is relatively easy to tackle the problem using coordinate geometry. For instance, we can let the excircle be the unit circle with J=(0,0), M=(0,1), BC is aligned so that B=(b,1) and C=(c,1). Coordinates of other points are then calculated to verify the required property. But one must be really careful if he tries to use coordinate method. It was somehow decided that if a contestant cannot get a full solution using coordinate method, then he will be “seriously penalized”! Problem 2. As it turned out, this problem caused quite a bit of trouble and many students didn’t know how to tackle the problem at all. More sophisticated inequalities such as Muirhead do not work, since the expression is not “homogeneous”. The Japanese leader called the problem a disaster. There were trivial questions such as “why is there no a1?” A more subtle issue is how to isolate a2,a3,…,an. Clearly(1+a2)2 ≥ 22a2 by the AM-GM inequality. But how about (1+a3)3? Indeed the trick is to apply AM-GM inequality to get for k=2 to n−1, 1 1 1 1 11 )1( + + + + ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ +++=+ k k k k a kk a L . )1( )1( 1 1 1 1 1 k k k k k k k k ak k a k + + + + + + =⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ +≥ By multiplying the inequalities, the constants cancelled out and we get the final inequality. That the inequality is strict is trivial using the conditions of AM equals GM. The above inequality can also be used as the inductive step of proving the equivalent inequality (1+a2)2(1+a3)3⋯(1+an)n > nna2a3⋯an. w T S G F K M L J A B C Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 17, No. 1, May-Aug. 12 Page 2 Problem 3. Comparing with problem 6, I really found this problem harder to approach! Nevertheless there were still 8 contestants who completely solved the problem. Among them three were from the US team. That was an amazing achievement! We can deal with this combinatorial probabilistic problem as follows. Ask repeatedly if x is 2k. If A answers no k+1 times in a row, then the answer is honest and x≠2k. Otherwise B stops asking about 2k at the first time answer yes. He then asks, for each i=1,2,…,k, if the binary representation of x has a 0 in the i-th digit. Whatever the answer is, they are all inconsistent with a certain number y in the set {0,1,2,⋯, 2k−1}. The answer yes to 2k is also inconsistent with y. Hence x≠y. Otherwise the last k+1 answers are not honest and that is impossible. So we find y and it can be eliminated. Or we can eliminate corresponding numbers with nonzero digits at higher end. Notice we may need to do some re-indexing and asking more questions about the indices of the numbers subsequently. With these questions, we can reduce the size of the set that x lies until it lies in a set of size 2 k. Part 2 makes use of a function so that using the function, A can devise a strategy (to lie or not to lie, but lying not more than k times consecutively) so that no extra information will be provided to B and hence B cannot eliminate anything for sure. Due to limit of space, I cannot provide all details here. It was decided that part 1 answered correctly alone was worth 3 points and part 2 alone worth 5 points. But altogether a problem is worth at most 7 points. So 3 + 5 = 7! At the end it really did not matter. After all, not too many students did the problem right. The problem is noted to be related to the Lovasz Local Lemma. See N. Alon et al, The Probabilistic Methods, Wiley, 1992. In the book it seems that there is an example that deals with similar things. One may check how the lemma and the problem are related! Problem 4. Despite being regarded as an easy problem, this problem is not at all easy. It is much more involved than expected. Also this problem eventually caused more trouble because of the disputes about the marking scheme. First, by putting a=b=c=0, one gets f(0)=0. By putting b=−a and c=0, one gets f(a) = f(−a). More importantly, by putting c=−(a+b) and solving f(a+b) = f(−(a+b)) as a quadratic equation of f(a) and f(b), one gets () ( ) ( ) 2 ( ) ( ).f a b f a fb f a fb+= + ± Putting a=b and c=−2a into the original equation, one gets f(2a)=0 or f(2a)=4f(a). Now the problem becomes getting all possible solutions from these two relations. Using the two conditions, one checks that there are four types of solution: (i) f1(x)≡0 , (ii) f2(x) = kx 2 , (iii) 3 0, even () ,odd x fx kx ⎧ = ⎨ ⎩ and (iv) 4 0, 0 (mod 4) () , 1(mod 4) . 4, 2 (mod 4) x fx k x kx ≡⎧ ⎪ =≡ ±⎨ ⎪ ≡⎩ The “k” in the solutions is essentially f(1). Indeed if f(1)=0, then f(2)=0, one then show by induction f(x)=0 for all x. (Or by showing f(x) is periodic of period 1.) Now if f(1)=k, using the condition f(2a)=0, one can show again by induction f(x) is k for x odd and is 0 for x even. Now if f(1)=k and f(2)=4k, then f(4)=0 or 16k. In the first case we get a function with period 4 and arrive at the solution f4(x). In the second case we get f2(x). (One needs to verify the details.) By checking the values of a, b and c mod 2 or 4, or other possible forms, one can check the solutions are indeed valid. Eventually if a contestant claimed that all the solutions are easy to check, but without checking, one point would be deducted. If a contestant says nothing about the solutions satisfy the functional equation and check nothing, then two points would be deducted! Problem 5. The following solution was obtained by one of our team members. Extend AX to meet the circumcircle of ABC at A’, likewise extend BX to meet the circle at B’. Now extend AB’ and BA’ to meet at H, which is exactly the orthocentre of ABX and it lies on the extension of DC. Since BK 2 = BC 2 = BD·BA, we have ∆ABK~∆KBD, so ∠BKD =∠BAK = ∠ BHD, which implies B, D, K, H concyclic. So ∠BKH =∠BDH=90°. This implies HK 2 = BH2 −BK 2 = BH2− BD·BA = BH2 − BA’·BH = HA’·HB. Similarly HL2= HB’·HA. But HA’·HB = HB’·HA. Hence HK=HL. Using similar arguments as above, we have ∠ALH = 90° ( =∠BKH.) Along with HK=HL, we see ∆MKH≅∆MLH. Therefore, MK=ML. Problem 6. Clearing denominators of 12 12 ... 1, 33 3 naaa n ++ + = one gets x1+2x2+⋯+nxn=3 a, where x1,x2,…,xn are non-negative integer powers of 3. Taking mod 2, one gets n(n+1)/2 ≡ 1(mod 2). This is the case only when n ≡ 1, 2 (mod 4). The hard part is to prove the converse also holds. The cases n=1 or 2 are easy. By trials, for n=5, (a1,…,a5)=(2,2,2,3,3) works. The official solution gave a systematic analysis of how to obtain solutions by using identities 1/2a=1/2a+1+1/2a+1 and w/3a=u/3a+1+v/3a+1, where u+v=3w. For n=4k+1≥5, one can arrive at the solution a1=2=a3, a2=k+1, a4k = k+2 = a4k+1 and am = [m/4]+3 for 4≤m<4k. Similarly, for n=4k+2≥6, one can arrive at the solution a1 = 2, a2 = k+1, a3 = a4 = 3, a4k+1 = k+2 = a4k+2 and am = [(m−1)/4]+3 for 4<m≤4k. One can check these are indeed solutions by math induction on k. In the inductive steps of both cases, just notice a2, an−1, an are increased by 1 so to balance the new an+1, an+2, an+3, an+4 terms. This reminds me of the 1978 USAMO problem: an integer n is called good if we can write n=a1+a2+⋯+ak, where a1,a2,…,ak are positive integers (not necessarily distinct) satisfying .1 111 21 =+++ kaaa L Given 33 to 73 are good, prove that all integer greater than 33 are good. The idea there is to show if n is good, then 2n+8 and 2n+9 are good by dividing both sides of the above equation by 2 and adding the terms 1/4+1/4 and 1/3+1/6 respectively.

Yes, we can try a=5,555,554,445 and b=5,554,445,555 and c=4,445,555,555. Then S(a+b)=S(11,110,000,000)=4, S(b+c)=S(10,000,001,110)=4, S(c+a)=S(10,001,110,000)=4. Finally, S(a+b+c)=S(15,555,555,555)=51.

Integers a0, a1, ⋯, an are all greater than or equal to −1 and are not all zeros. If a0+2a1+22a2+⋯+2nan = 0, then prove that a0+a1+a2+⋯+an >0. Solution.

For all the conditions to hold, n ≠ 0. We will prove by mathematical induction. For n=1, if a0+2a1=0, then the conditions on a0 and a1 imply a0 is an even positive integer. So a0+a1 = a0/2 > 0. Suppose the case n=k is true. For the case n=k+1, the given equation implies a0 is even, hence a0 ≥ 0. So a0=2b, with b a nonnegative integer. Then dividing the equation by 2 on both sides, we get that (b+a1)+2a2+⋯+2kak+1 = 0. From the cases n=k and n=1 (in cases a2=⋯=ak+1=0), we get a0+a1+a2+⋯+an ≥ (b+a1)+a2+⋯+an > 0, ending the induction. Problem 393. Let p be a prime number and p ≡ 1 (mod 4). Prove that there exist integers x and y such that x 2 − py 2 = − 1. Solution.

Let (m,n) be the fundamental solution (i.e. the least positive integer solution) of the Pell’s equation x 2 − py 2 = 1 (see Math Excal., vol. 6, no. 3, p.1). Then m2 − n2 ≡ m2 − pn2 = 1(mod 4). Then m is odd and n is even. Since 2 22 1 2 1 ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = + ⋅ − n p mm and (m−1)/2, (m+1)/2 are consecutive integers (hence relatively prime), either uvnv m pu m 2, 2 1 , 2 1 22 == + = − or uvnpv m u m 2, 2 1 , 2 1 22 == + = − for some positive integers u and v. In the former case, v 2−pu2=1 with 0 < v ≤ v 2 = (m+1)/2 < m and 0 < u = n/(2v) < n. This contradicts the minimality of (m,n). So the latter case must hold, i.e. u2−pv 2 = −1. Problem 394. Let O and H be the circumcenter and orthocenter of acute ΔABC. The bisector of ∠BAC meets the circumcircle Γ of ΔABC at D. Let E be the mirror image of D with respect to line BC. Let F be on Γ such that DF is a diameter. Let lines AE and FH meet at G. Let M be the midpoint of side BC. Prove that GM⊥AF. Solution 1.

Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 17, No. 1, May-Aug. 12 Page 4 O A B C F D X HE M G As AD bisects ∠BAC, D is the midpoint of arc BC. Hence, FD is the perpendicular bisector of BC. Thus, (1) FE || AH. Let line AH meet Γ again at X. Since ∠BCX=∠BAX=90°−∠ABC=∠BCH, H is the mirror image of X with respect to BC. Therefore, ∠HED=∠XDE= ∠AFE. Thus, (2) AF || HE. By (1) and (2), AFEH is a parallelogram. Hence, G is the midpoint of AE. As M is also the midpoint of DE, we get GM || AD. Since DF is the diameter of Γ, AD⊥AF, hence GM⊥AF. Solution 2. Andy LOO (St. Paul’s Co-educational College). Place the figure on the complex plane and let the circumcircle of ΔABC be the unit circle centered at the origin. Denote the complex number representing each point by the respective lower-case letter. Without loss of generality we may assume a = 1 and that the points A, B and C lie on the circle in anticlockwise order. Let b =u2 and c=v 2, where |u|=|v|=1. Then d=uv and hence f =−uv. Next, E is the mirror image of D with respect to BC means eb d b cb cb −−⎛⎞ = ⎜⎟ −−⎝⎠ , giving e = u2 − uv + v 2. By the Euler line theorem, h=a+b+c=1+u2+v 2.Now G on lines AE and FH means g ag a ea e a −− = −− and g fg f hf h f −− = −− . Solving these simultaneously for G, we get g = (u2−uv+v 2+1)/2. Also, m = (b+c)/2 = (u2+v 2)/2. To show GM⊥AF, it suffices to prove that (m−g)/(f−a) is an imaginary number.

One frog is placed on every vertex of a 2n-sided regular polygon, where n is an integer at least 2. At a particular moment, each frog will jump to one of the two neighboring vertices (with more than one frog at a vertex allowed). Find all n such that there exists a jumping of these frogs so that after the moment, all lines connecting two frogs at different vertices do not pass through the center of the polygon. Solution. Kevin LAU (St. Paul’s Co-educational College, S.3), Simon LEE (Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School), LI Jianhui (CNEC Christian College, F.5) and Andy LOO (St. Paul’s Co-educational College). If n ≡ 2 (mod 4), say n=4k+2, then label the 2n=8k+4 vertices from 1 to 8k+4 in clockwise direction. For j ≡ 1 or 2 (mod 4), let the frog at vertex j jump in the clockwise direction. For j ≡ 3 or 4 (mod 4), let the frog at vertex j jump in the counter-clockwise direction. After the jump, the frogs are at vertices 2, 6, …, 8k+2 and 3,7, …, 8k+3. No two of these vertex numbers have a difference of the form 2 (mod 4). So no line through two different vertices with frogs will go through the center. If n ≢2 (mod 4), then assume there is such a jump. We may exclude the cases all frogs jump clockwise or all frogs jump counter-clockwise, which clearly do not work. Hence, in this jump, there is a frog, say at vertex i, jumps in the counter-clockwise direction, then the frog at vertex i+m(n−2) (mod 2n) must jump in the same direction as the frog at vertex i for m=1,2,…. If n is odd, then gcd(n−2,2n) = 1. So there are integers a and b such that a(n−2) + b(2n) = 1. For every integer q in [1,2n], letting m = (q−i)a, we have i+m(n−2) ≡ q (mod 2n). This means all frogs jump in the counter-clockwise direction, which does not work. If n is divisible by 4, then gcd(n−2,2n) = 2. So there are integers c and d such that c(n−2)+d(2n)=2. Letting m=nc/2, we have i+m(n−2)≡i+n (mod 2n). Then frogs at vertices i and i+n jump in the counter-clockwise direction and the line after the jump passes through the center, contradiction. Therefore, the answer is n ≡ 2 (mod 4). Other commended solvers: Alice WONG (Diocesan Girls’ School). Olympiad Corner (continued from page 1) Problem 3. (Cont.) At the start of the game A chooses integers x and N with 1≤x≤N. Player A keeps x secret, and truthfully tells N to B. Player B now tries to obtain information about x by asking player A questions as follows: each question consists of B specifying an arbitrary set S of positive integers (possibly one specified in some previous question), and asking A whether x belongs to S. Player B may ask as many such questions as he wishes. After each question, player A must immediately answer it with yes or no, but is allowed to lie as many times as she wants; the only restriction is that, among any 1k + consecutive answers, at least one answer must be truthful. After B has asked as many questions as he wants, he must specify a set X of at most n positive integers. If x belongs to X, then B wins; otherwise, he loses. Prove that: 1. If n ≥2k, then B can guarantee a win. 2. For all sufficiently large k, there exists an integer n ≥1.99k such that B cannot guarantee a win. Problem 4.
