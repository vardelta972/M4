Constant c can be e.g. an integer, rational, real or complex number. A Polynomial in x is a sum of ﬁnitely many monomials in x. In other words, it is an expression of the form P(x) = anxn + an−1 + · · · + a1x + a0. (∗) If only two or three of the above summands are nonzero, P is said to be a binomial and trinomial, respectively. The constants a0, . . . , an in (∗) are the coefﬁcients of polynomial P. The set of polynomials with the coefﬁcients in set A is denoted by A[x] - for instance, R[x] is the set of polynomials with real coefﬁcients. We can assume in (∗) w.l.o.g. that an ̸= 0 (if an = 0, the summand anxn can be erased without changing the polynomial). Then the exponent n is called the degree of polynomial P and denoted by deg P. In particular, polynomials of degree one, two and three are called linear, quadratic and cubic. A nonzero constant polynomial has degree 0, while the zero-polynomial P(x) ≡ 0 is assigned the degree −∞ for reasons soon to become clear. Example 1. P(x) = x3(x + 1) + (1 − x2)2 = 2x4 + x3 − 2x2 + 1 is a polynomial with integer coefﬁ- cients of degree 4. Q(x) = 0x2 − √ 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Theorem 1. If A and B are two polynomials then: (i) deg(A ± B) ≤ max(deg A, deg B), with the equality if deg A ̸= deg B. (ii) deg(A · B) = deg A + degB. 2 The conventional equality deg 0 = −∞ actually arose from these properties of degrees, as else the equality (ii) would not be always true. Unlike a sum, difference and product, a quotient of two polynomials is not necessarily a polyno- mial. Instead, like integers, they can be divided with a residue. Theorem 2. Given polynomials A and B ̸= 0, there are unique polynomials Q (quotient) and R (residue) such that A = BQ + R and deg R < deg B. Proof. Let A(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 and B(x) = bkxk + · · · + b0, where anbk ̸= 0. Assume k is ﬁxed and use induction on n. For n < k the statement is trivial. Suppose that n = N ≥ k and that the statement is true for n < N. Then A1(x) = A(x) − an Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 3 Solution. a) The zeros of polynomial x2 − x + 1 are ε1,2 = 1±i √ 4 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com In the factorization of a real polynomial P(x) into linear factors we can group conjugated com- plex zeros: P(x) = (x − r1) · · · (x − rk)(x − ξ1)(x − Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 5 Problem 2. Show that the polynomial f (x) = x6 − 2x5 + x4 − 2x3 + x2 − 2x + 1 has exactly four zeros of modulus 1. Solution. Set y = x + x−1. Then f (x) 6 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Problem 4. Find all polynomials of the form anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 with a j ∈ {−1, 1} ( j = 0, 1, . . . , n), whose all roots are real. Solution. Let x1, . . . , xn be the roots of the given polynomial. Then x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n = (∑i xi)2 − 2(∑i< j xix j) = a2 n−1 − 2an−2 ≤ 3; x2 1x2 2 · · · x2 n = 1. By the mean inequality, the second equality implies x2 1 + · · · + x2 n ≥ n; hence n ≤ 3. The case n = 3 is only possible if x1, x2, x3 = ±1. Now we can easily ﬁnd all solutions: x ± 1, x2 ± x − 1, x3 − x ± (x2 − 1). △ One contradiction is enough to show that not all zeros of a given polynomial are real. On the other hand, if the task is to show that all zeros of a polynomial are real, but not all are computable, the situation often gets more complicated. Problem 5. Show that all zeros of a polynomial f (x) = x(x − 2)(x − 4)(x − 6) + (x − 1)(x − 3)(x − 5)(x − 7) are real. Solution. Since f (−∞) = f (∞) = +∞, f (1) < 0, f (3) > 0 and f (5) < 0, polynomial f has a real zero in each of the intervals (−∞, 1), (1, 3), (3, 5), (5, ∞), that is four in total. △ We now give the announced proof of the fact that every polynomial has a complex root. This fundamental theorem has many different proofs. The proof we present is, although more difﬁcult than all the previous ones, still next to elementary. All imperfections in the proof are made on purpose. Theorem 12 (The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). Every nonconstant complex polynomial P(x) has a complex zero. Proof. Write P(x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0. Suppose that P(0) = a0 ̸= 0. For each r > 0, let Cr be the circle in the complex plane with the center at point 0 and radius r. Consider the continuous curve γr = P(Cr) = {P(x) | |x| = r}. The curve described by the monomial xn, i.e. {xn | x ∈ Cr} rounds point 0 n times. If r is large enough, for example r > 1 + |a0| + · · · + |an−1|, we have |xn| > |an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0| = |P(x) − xn|, which means that the rest P(x) − xn in the expression of P(x) can not “reach” point 0. Thus for such r the curve γr also rounds point 0 n times; hence, it contains point 0 in its interior. For very small r the curve γr is close to point P(0) = a0 and leaves point 0 in its exterior. Thus, there exists a minimum r = r0 for which point 0 is not in the exterior of γr. Since the curve γr changes continuously as a function of r, it cannot jump over the point 0, so point 0 must lie on the curve γr0 . Therefore, there is a zero of polynomial P(x) of modulus r0. 2 3 Polynomials with Integer Coefﬁcients Consider a polynomial P(x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 with integer coefﬁcients. The difference P(x) − P(y) can be written in the form an(xn − yn) + · · · + a2(x2 − y2) + a1(x − y), in which all summands are multiples of polynomial x − y. This leads to the simple though important arithmetic property of polynomials from Z[x]: Theorem 13. If P is a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients, then P(a) − P(b) is divisible by a − b for any distinct integers a and b. In particular, all integer roots of P divide P(0). 2 There is a similar statement about rational roots of polynomial P(x) ∈ Z[x]. Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 7 Theorem 14. If a rational number p/q (p, q ∈ Z, q ̸= 0, nzd(p, q) = 1) is a root of polynomial P(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 with integer coefﬁcients, then p | a0 and q | an. Proof. We have qnP ( p 8 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 4 Irreducibility Polynomial P(x) with integer coefﬁcients is said to be irreducible over Z[x] if it cannot be written as a product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. Example 5. Every quadratic or cubic polynomial with no rational roots is irreducible over Z. Such are e.g. x2 − x − 1 and 2x3 − 4x + 1. One analogously deﬁnes (ir)reducibility over the sets of polynomials with e.g. rational, real or complex coefﬁcients. However, of the mentioned, only reducibility over Z[x] is of interest. Gauss' Lemma below claims that the reducibility over Q[x] is equivalent to the reducibility over Z[x]. In addition, we have already shown that a real polynomial is always reducible into linear and quadratic factors over R[x], while a complex polynomial is always reducible into linear factors over C[x]. Theorem 16 (Gauss' Lema). If a polynomial P(x) with integer coefﬁcients is reducible over Q[x], then it is reducible over Z[x], also. Proof. Suppose that P(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 = Q(x)R(x) ∈ Z[x], where Q(x) and R(x) nonconstant polynomials with rational coefﬁcients. Let q and r be the smallest natural numbers such that the polynomials qQ(x) = qkxk + · · · + q0 and rR(x) = rmxm + · · · + r0 have integer coefﬁcients. Then qrP(x) = qQ(x) · rR(x) is a factorization of the polynomial qrP(x) into two polynomials from Z[x]. Based on this, we shall construct such a factorization for P(x). Let p be an arbitrary prime divisor of q. All coefﬁcients of P(x) are divisible by p. Let i be such that p | q0, q1, . . . , qi−1, but p ∤ qi. We have p | ai = q0ri + · · · + qir0 ≡ qir0 (mod p), which implies that p | r0. Furthermore, p | ai+1 = q0ri+1 + · · · + qir1 + qi+1r0 ≡ qir1 (mod p), so p | r1. Continuing in this way, we deduce that p | r j for all j. Hence rR(x)/p has integer coefﬁcients. We have thus obtained a factorization of rq Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 9 Solution. By the (extended) Eisenstein criterion, f has an irreducible factor of degree at least n − 1. Since f has no integer zeros, it must be irreducible. △ Problem 11. If p is a prime number, prove that the polynomial Φp(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 is irre- ducible. Solution. Instead of Φp(x), we shall consider Φp(x + 1) and show that it is irreducible, which will clearly imply that so is Φp. We have Φp(x + 1) = (x + 1)p − 1 10 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 1. Prove that all zeros of polynomial P are less than p 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 11 Instead, it is often useful to consider the ﬁnite difference of polynomial P, deﬁned by P[1](x) = P(x + 1) − P(x), which has the degree by 1 less than that of P. Further, we deﬁne the k-th ﬁnite difference, P[k] = (P[k−1])[1], which is of degree n − k (where deg P = n). A simple induction gives a general formula P[k] = k ∑ i=0(−1) k−i( k i ) P(x + i). In particular, P[n] is constant and P[n+1] = 0, which leads to Theorem 20. P(x + n + 1) = n ∑ i=0(−1) n−i( n + 1 i ) P(x + i). 2 Problem 15. Polynomial P of degree n satisﬁes P(i) = (n+1 i )−1 for i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Evaluate P(n + 1). Solution. We have 0 = n+1 ∑ i=0(−1) i( n + 1 i ) P(i) = (−1) n+1P(n + 1) + { 1, 2 | n; 0, 2 ∤ n. It follows that P(n + 1) = { 1, 2 | n; 0, 2 ∤ n. △ Problem 16. If P(x) is a polynomial of an even degree n with P(0) = 1 and P(i) = 2i−1 for i = 1, . . . , n, prove that P(n + 2) = 2P(n + 1) − 1. Solution. We observe that P[1](0) = 0 i P[1](i) = 2i−1 for i = 1, . . . , n − 1; furthermore, P[2](0) = 1 i P[2](i) = 2i−1 for i = 1, . . . , n−2, etc. In general, it is easily seen that P[k](i) = 2i−1 for i = 1, . . . , n−k, and P[k](0) is 0 for k odd and 1 for k even. Now P(n + 1) = P(n) + P[1](n) = · · · = P(n) + P[1](n − 1) + · · ·+ P[n](0) = { 2n, 2 | n; 2n − 1, 2 ∤ n. Similarly, P(n + 2) = 22n+1 − 1. △ 6 Applications of Calculus The derivative of a polynomial P(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 is given by P′(x) = nanxn−1 + (n − 1)an−1xn−2 + · · · + a1. The inverse operation, the indeﬁnite integral, is given by ∫ P(x)dx = an 12 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Problem 17. Suppose that real numbers 0 = x0 < x1 < · · · < xn < xn+1 = 1 satisfy n+1 ∑ j=0, j̸=i 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 13 We have P(x) = (x − z1) α1 · · · (x − zk) αk = (x − zk+1) αk+1 · · · (x − zk+m) αk+m + 1 for some natural numbers α1, . . . ,αk+m. Let us consider P′(x). We know that it is divisible by (x − zi)αi−1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k + m; hence, k+m ∏ i=1 (x − zi) αi−1 | P′(x). Therefore, 2n − k − m = deg ∏ k+m i=1 (x − zi)αi−1 ≤ degP′ = n − 1, i.e. k + m ≥ n + 1, as desired. △ Even if P has no multiple zeros, certain relations between zeros of P and P′ still hold. For example, the following statement holds for all differentiable functions. Theorem 22 (Rolle's Theorem). Between every two zeros of a polynomial P(x) there is a zero of P′(x). Corollary. If all zeros of P(x) are real, then so are all zeros of P′(x).) Proof. Let a < b be two zeros of polynomial P. Assume w.l.o.g. that P′(a) > 0 and consider the point c in the interval [a, b] in which P attains a local maximum (such a point exists since the interval [a, b] is compact). We know that P(x) = P(c) + (x − c)[P′(c) + o(1)]. If for example P′(c) > 0 (the case P′(c) < 0 leads to a similar contradiction), then P(x) > P(c) would hold in a small neighborhood of c, a contradiction. It is only possible that P′(c) = 0, so c is a root of P′(x) between a and b. 2 7 Symmetric polynomials A symmetric polynomial in variables x1, . . . , xn is every polynomial that is not varied by permuting the indices of the variables. For instance, polynomial x2 1 is symmetric as a polynomial in x1 (no wonder), but is not symmetric as a polynomial in x1, x2 as changing places of the indices 1 and 2 changes it to the polynomial x2 2. Deﬁnition 2. The polynomial P(x1, x2, . . . , xn) is symmetric if, for every permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n}, P(x1, x2, . . . , xn) ≡ P(xπ(1), xπ(2), . . . , xπ(n)). An obvious property of a symmetric polynomial is that its coefﬁcients at two terms of the forms xi1 1 · · · xin n and x j1 1 · · · x jn n , where ( j1, . . . , jn) is a permutation (i1, . . . , in), always coincide. For example, if the expansion of a symmetric polynomial in x, y, z contains the terms x2y, then it also contains x2z, xy2, etc, with the same coefﬁcient. Thus, the polynomials σk (1 ≤ k ≤ n) introduced in section 2 are symmetric. Also symmetric is e.g. the polynomial x2 1 + x2 2. A symmetric polynomial is said to be homogenous if all its terms are of the same degree. Equiv- alently, polynomial T is homogenous of degree d if T (tx1, . . . ,txn) = tdT (x1, . . . , xn) holds for all x and t. For instance, x2 1 + x2 2 is homogenous of degree d = 2, but x2 1 + x2 2 + 1, although symmetric, is not homogenous. Every symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn can be written as a sum of homogenous polynomials. Moreover, it can also be represented as a linear combination of certain “bricks”. These bricks are the polynomials Ta = ∑ xai1 1 · · · xain n (∗) for each n-tuple a = (a1, . . . , an) of nonnegative integers with a1 ≥ · · · ≥ an, where the summation goes over all permutations (i1, . . . , in) of the indices 1, . . . , n. In the expression for Ta the same summand can occur more than once, so we deﬁne Sa as the sum of the different terms in (∗). The polynomial Ta is always an integral multiple of Sa. For instance, T(2,2,0) = 2(x2 1x2 2 + x2 2x2 3 + x2 3x2 1) = 2S(2,2,0). 14 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com All the n-tuples a of degree d = a1 + · · · + an can be ordered in a lexicographic order so that a > a′ if s1 = s ′ 1, . . . , sk = s ′ k and sk+1 > s ′ k+1 for some k ≥ 1, where si = a1 + · · · + ai. In this ordering, the least n-tuple is m = (x + 1, . . . , x + 1, x, . . . , x), where x = [d/n] and x + 1 occurs d − n[d/n] times. The polynomials Ta can be multiplies according to the following simple formula: Theorem 23. If a = (a1, . . . , an) and b = (b1, . . . , bn) are n-tuples of nonnegative integers, it holds that Ta · Tb = ∑ π Ta+π(b), where the sum goes over all permutations π(b) of the n-tuple b. (We deﬁne (xi)n i=1 + (yi)n i=1 = (xi + yi)n i=1.) Proof. It sufﬁces to observe that xπ1(b) 1 · · · xπn(b) n Ta = ∑ xa1+πi1 (b) i1 · · · xan+πin (b) in , and to sum up over all permutations π. 2 There are inﬁnitely many mentioned bricks, and these are obviously not mutually independent. We need simpler elements which are independent and using which one can express every symmetric polynomial by basic operations. It turns out that these atoms are σ1, . . . ,σn. Example 8. The following polynomials in x, y, z can be written in terms of σ1,σ2,σ3: xy + yz + zx + x + y + z = σ2 + σ1; x2y + x2z + y2x + y2z + z2x + z2y = σ1σ2 − 3σ3; x2y2 + y2z 2 + z 2x2 = σ2 2 − 2σ1σ3. Theorem 24. Every symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn can be represented in the form of a polyno- mial in σ1, . . . ,σn. Moreover, a symmetric polynomial with integer coefﬁcients is also a polynomial in σ1, . . . ,σn with integer coefﬁcients. Proof. It is enough to prove the statement for the polynomials Sa of degree d (for each d). Assuming that it holds for the degrees less than d, we use induction on n-tuples a. The statement is true for the smallest n-tuple m: Indeed, Sm = σq n σr, where d = nq + r, 0 ≤ r < n. Now suppose that the statement is true for all Sb with b < a; we show that it also holds for Sa. Suppose that a = (a1, . . . , an) with a1 = · · · = ak > ak+1 (k ≥ 1). Consider the polynomial Sa − σkSa′, where a′ = (a1 − 1, . . ., ak − 1, ak+1, . . . , an). According to theorem 23 it is easy to see that this polynomial is of the form ∑b<a cbSb, where cb are integers, and is therefore by the inductive hypothesis representable in the form of a polynomial in σi with integer coefﬁcients. 2 The proof of the previous theorem also gives us an algorithm for expressing each symmetric polynomial in terms of the σi. Nevertheless, for some particular symmetric polynomials there are simpler formulas. Theorem 25 (Newton's Theorem on Symmetric Polynomials). If we denote sk = xk 1 + xk 2 + · · ·+ xk n, then: kσk = s1σk−1 − s2σk−2 + · · · + (−1)ksk−1σ1 + (−1)k+1sk; sm = σ1sm−1 − σ2sm−2 + · · · + (−1)n−1σnsm−n za m ≥ n. (All the polynomials are in n variables.) Proof. Direct, for example by using the formula 23. 2 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 15 Problem 20. Suppose that complex numbers x1, x2, . . . , xk satisfy x j 1 + x j 2 + · · · + x j k = n, for j = 1, 2, . . . , k, where n, k are given positive integers. Prove that (x − x1)(x − x2) . . . (x − xk) = xk − ( n 1 ) xk−1 + ( n 2 ) xk−2 − · · · + (−1) k( n k ) . Solution. We are given sk = n for k = 1, . . . , n. The Newton's theorem gives us σ1 = n, σ2 = 1 16 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com (b) If P(x) ≥ 0 for all x ≥ 0, show that there exist real polynomials A(x) and B(x) such that P(x) = A(x)2 + xB(x)2. 10. Prove that if the equation Q(x) = ax2 + (c − b)x + (e − d) = 0 has real roots greater than 1, where a, b, c, d, e ∈ R, then the equation P(x) = ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0 has at least one real root. 11. A monic polynomial P with real coefﬁcients satisﬁes |P(i)| < 1. Prove that there is a root z = a + bi of P such that (a2 + b2 + 1) 2 < 4b2 + 1. 12. For what real values of a does there exist a rational function f (x) that satisﬁes f (x2) = f (x)2 − a? (A rational function is a quotient of two polynomials.) 13. Find all polynomials P satisfying P(x2 + 1) = P(x)2 + 1 for all x. 14. Find all P for which P(x)2 − 2 = 2P(2x2 − 1). 15. If the polynomials P and Q each have a real root and P(1 + x + Q(x) 2) = Q(1 + x + P(x) 2), prove that P ≡ Q. 16. Find all polynomials P(x) with real coefﬁcients satisfying the equality P(a − b) + P(b − c) + P(c − a) = 2P(a + b + c) for all triples (a, b, c) of real numbers such that ab + bc + ca = 0. (IMO04-2) 17. A sequence of integers (an) ∞ n=1 has the property that m − n | am − an for any distinct m, n ∈ N. Suppose that there is a polynomial P(x) such that |an| < P(n) for all n. Show that there exists a polynomial Q(x) such that an = Q(n) for all n. 18. Let P(x) be a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coefﬁcients and let k be a natural number. Consider the polynomial Q(x) = P(P(. . . P(P(x)) . . . )), where P is applied k times. Prove that there exist at most n integers t such that Q(t) = t. (IMO06-5) 19. If P and Q are monic polynomials such that P(P(x)) = Q(Q(x)), prove that P ≡ Q. 20. Let m, n and a be natural numbers and p < a − 1 a prime number. Prove that the polynomial f (x) = xm(x − a)n + p is irreducible. 21. Prove that the polynomial F(x) = (x2 + x)2n + 1 is irreducible for all n ∈ N. 22. A polynomial P(x) has the property that for every y ∈ Q there exists x ∈ Q such that P(x) = y. Prove that P is a linear polynomial. 23. Let P(x) be a monic polynomial of degree n whose zeros are i − 1, i − 2, . . . , i − n (where i2 = −1) and let R(x) and S(x) be the real polynomials such that P(x) = R(x) + iS(x). Prove that the polynomial R(x) has n real zeros. 24. Let a, b, c be natural numbers. Prove that if there exist coprime polynomials P, Q, R with complex coefﬁcients such that Pa + Qb = Rc, then 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 17 9 Solutions 1. The polynomial f (x) − 10x vanishes at points x = 1, 2, 3, so it is divisible by polynomial (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3). The monicity implies that f (x) − 10x = (x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − c) for some c. Now f (12) + f (−8) = 11 · 10 · 9 · (12 − c) + 120 + (−9)(−10)(−11)(−8 − c) − 80 = 19840. 2. Note that Q(x2) = ∏(x2 − x2 i ) = ∏(x − xi) · ∏(x + xi) = (−1)nP(x)P(−x). We now have b1 + b2 + · · · + bn = Q(1) − 1 = (−1) nP(1)P(−1) − 1 = (−1) n(1 + B − A)(1 + B + A), where A = a1 + a3 + a5 + · · · and B = a2 + a4 + · · · . 3. It follows from the conditions that P(− sin x) = P(sin x), i.e. P(−t) = P(t) for inﬁnitely many t, so the polynomials P(x) and P(−x) coincide. Therefore, P(x) = S(x2) for some polynomial S. Now S(cos2 x) = S(sin 2 x) for all x, i.e. S(1 − t) = S(t) for inﬁnitely many t, which implies S(x) ≡ S(1 − x). This is equivalent to R(x − 1 18 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 8. By theorem 20 we have P(n + 2) = n ∑ i=0(−1) n−i 1 Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 19 14. Let us denote P(1) = a. We have a2 − 2a − 2 = 0. Since P(x) = (x − 1)P1(x) + a, substituting in the original equation and simplifying yields (x − 1)P1(x)2 + 2aP1(x) = 4(x + 1)P1(2x2 − 1). For x = 1 we have 2aP1(1) = 8P1(1), which together with a ̸= 4 implies P1(1) = 0, i.e. P1(x) = (x− 1)P2(x), so P(x) = (x− 1)2P2(x)+ a. Assume that P(x) = (x− 1)nQ(x)+ a, where Q(1) ̸= 0. Again substituting in the original equation and simplifying yields (x − 1)nQ(x)2 + 2aQ(x) = 2(2x + 2)nQ(2x2 − 1), which implies that Q(1) = 0, a contradiction. We conclude that P(x) = a. 15. At ﬁrst, note that there exists x = a for which P(a)2 = Q(a)2. This follows from the fact that, if p and q are real roots of P and Q respectively, then P(p)2 − Q(p)2 ≤ 0 ≤ P(q)2 − Q(q)2, whereby P2 − Q2 is a continuous function. Then we also have P(b) = Q(b) for b = 1 + a + P(a) 2. Assuming that a is the largest real number with P(a) = Q(a), we come to an immediate contradiction. 16. Let P(x) = a0 +a1x+· · ·+anxn. For every x the triple (a, b, c) = (6x, 3x, −2x) satisﬁes the con- dition ab+bc+ca = 0. The condition in P gives us P(3x)+P(5x)+P(−8x) = 2P(7x) for all x, so by comparing the coefﬁcients on both sides we obtain K(i) = ( 3i + 5i + (−8)i − 2 · 7i) = 0 whenever ai ̸= 0. Since K(i) is negative for odd i and positive for i = 0 and even i ≥ 6, ai = 0 is only possible for i = 2 and i = 4. Therefore, P(x) = a2x2 + a4x4 for some real numbers a2, a4. It is easily veriﬁed that all such P(x) satisfy the conditions. 17. Let d be the degree of P. There is a unique polynomial Q of degree at most d such that Q(k) = ak for k = 1, 2, . . . , d + 1. Let us show that Q(n) = an for all n. Let n > d + 1. Polynomial Q might not have integral coefﬁcients, so we cannot deduce that n − m | Q(n) − Q(m), but it certainly has rational coefﬁcients, i.e. there is a natural number M for which R(x) = MQ(x) has integral coefﬁcients. By the condition of the problem, M(an − Q(n)) = M(an −ak)−(R(n)−R(k)) is divisible by n−k for each k = 1, 2, . . . , d +1. Therefore, for each n we either have an = Q(n) or Ln = lcm(n − 1, n − 2, . . ., n − d − 1) ≤ M(an − Q(n)) < Cnd for some constant C independent of n. Suppose that an ̸= Q(n) for some n. note that Ln is not less than the product (n − 1) · · · (n − d − 1) divided by the product P of numbers gcd(n − i, n − j) over all pairs (i, j) of different numbers from {1, 2, . . . , d + 1}. Since gcd(n − i, n − j) ≤ i − j, we have P ≤ 1d2d−1 · · · d. It follows that (n − 1)(n − 2) · · ·(n − d − 1) ≤ PLn < CPnd, which is false for large enough n as the left hand side is of degree d + 1. Thus, an = Q(n) for each sufﬁciently large n, say n > N. What happens for n ≤ N? By the condition of the problem, M(an − Q(n)) = M(an − ak) − (R(n) − R(k)) is divisible by m − n for every m > N, so it must be equal to zero. Hence an = Q(n) for all n. 18. We have shown in 7 from the text that every such t satisﬁes P(P(t)) = t. If every such t also satisﬁes P(t) = t, the number of solutions is clearly at most deg P = n. Suppose that P(t1) = t2, P(t2) = t1, P(t3) = t4 i P(t4) = t3, where t1 ̸= t2,3,4. By theorem 10, t1 − t3 divides t2 − t4 and vice versa, from which we deduce that t1 − t3 = ±(t2 − t4). Assume that t1 − t3 = t2 − t4, i.e. t1 − t2 = t3 − t4 = k ̸= 0. Since the relation t1 − t4 = ±(t2 − t3) similarly holds, we obtain t1 − t3 + k = ±(t1 − t3 − k) which is impossible. Therefore, we must have t1 − t3 = t4 − t2, which gives us P(t1) + t1 = P(t3) + t3 = c for some c. It follows that all integral solutions t of the equation P(P(t)) = t satisfy P(t) + t = c, and hence their number does not exceed n. 20 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 19. Suppose that R = P − Q ̸= 0 and that 0 < k ≤ n − 1 is the degree of R(x). Then P(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) = [Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x))] + R(P(x)). Writing Q(x) = xn + · · · + a1x + a0 yields Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) = [P(x) n − Q(x) n] + · · · + a1[P(x) − Q(x)], where all the summands but the ﬁrst have a degree at most n2 − n, while the ﬁrst summand equals R(x) · (P(x)n−1 + P(x)n−2Q(x) + · · · + Q(x)n−1) and has the degree n2 − n + k with the leading coefﬁcient n. Therefore the degree of Q(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) is n2 − n + k. On the other hand, the degree of the polynomial R(P(x)) equals kn < n2 − n + k, from which we conclude that the difference P(P(x)) − Q(Q(x)) has the degree n2 − n + k, a contradiction. It remains to check the case of a constant R ≡ c. Then the condition P(P(x)) = Q(Q(x)) yields Q(Q(x) + c) = Q(Q(x)) − c, so the equality Q(y + c) = Q(y) − c holds for inﬁnitely many values of y; hence Q(y + c) ≡ Q(y) − c which is only possible for c = 0 (to see this, just compare the coefﬁcients). 20. Suppose that f (x) = g(x)h(x) for some nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. Since | f (0)| = p, either |g(0)| = 1 or |h(0)| = 1 holds. Assume w.l.o.g. that |g(0)| = 1. Write g(x) = (x − α1) · · · (x − αk). Then |α1 · · · αk| = 1. Since f (αi) − p = αm i (αi − a)n = −p, taking the product over i = 1, 2, . . . , k yields |g(a)|n = |(α1 − a) · · · (αk − a)|n = pk. Since g(a) divides |g(a)h(a)| = p, we must have |g(a)| = p and n = k. However, a must divide |g(a) − g(0)| = p ± 1, which is impossible. 21. Suppose that F = G · H for some polynomials G, H with integer coefﬁcients. Let us consider this equality modulo 2. Since (x2 + x + 1)2n ≡ F(x) (mod 2), we obtain (x2 + x + 1)2n = g(x)h(x), where g ≡ G and h ≡ H are polynomials over Z2. The polynomial x2 + x + 1 is irreducible over Z2[x], so there exists a natural number k for which g(x) = (x2 + x + 1)k and h(x) = (x2 + x + 1)2n−k; of course, these equalities hold in Z2[x] only. Back in Z[x], these equalities become H(x) = (x2 + x + 1)2n−k + 2V (x) and G(x) = (x2 + x + 1) k + 2U(x) for some polynomials U and V with integer coefﬁcients. Thus, [(x2 + x + 1) k + 2U(x)][(x2 + x + 1) 2n−k + 2V (x)] = F(x). Now if we set x = ε = −1+i √ Duˇsan Djuki´c: Polynomials in One Variable 21 Since Rn + iSn = (x − i + n)(Rn−1 + iSn−1), the polynomials Rn and Sn satisfy the recurrent relations Rn = (x + n)Rn−1 + Sn−1 and Sn = (x + n)Sn−1 − Rn−1. This gives us Rn − (2x + 2n − 1)Rn−1 + [(x + n − 1) 2 + 1]Rn−2 = 0. If z1 > · · · > zn−2 are the (real) zeros Rn−2, by the inductive hypothesis we have zi−1 > yi > zi. Since the value of Rn−2 is alternately positive and negative on the intervals (z1, +∞), (z2, z1), etc, it follows that sgnRn−2(yi) = (−1)i−1. Now we conclude from the relation Rn(yi) = −[(x + n − 1)2 + 1]Rn−2(yi) that sgnRn(yi) = (−1) i, which means that the polynomial Rn has a zero on each of the n intervals (y1, +∞), (y2, y1), . . . , (−∞, yn−1). This ﬁnishes the induction. 24. We ﬁrst prove the following auxiliary statement. Lemma. If A, B and C are coprime polynomials with A + B = C, then the degree of each of the polynomials A, B,C is less than the number of different zeros of the polynomial ABC. Proof. Let A(x) = k ∏ i=1(x − pi) ai, B(x) = l ∏ i=1(x − qi) bi, C(x) = m ∏ i=1(x − ri) ci . Let us rewrite the given equality as A(x)/C(x) + B(x)/C(x) = 1 and differentiate it with respect to x.
