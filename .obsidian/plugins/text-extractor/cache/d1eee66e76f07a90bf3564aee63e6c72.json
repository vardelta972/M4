Pulling out the factor of a, we see a(b − c) ≡ 0 (mod p). Since a is relatively prime to p, we need b − c ≡ 0 (mod p) and therefore b ≡ c (mod p). 2 Composite Mods If the modulus is prime, then we can divide out common factors from each side. If it is composite, however, we can’t necessarily do that. For example, consider 20 ≡ 2 (mod 6). If we divide out a 2 on each side, we get 10 ≡ 1 (mod 6), which is not true. 3 The Idea Consider the set S = {1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1} consisting of the nonzero residues in mod p. Now suppose we multiply each element by a. {a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} Every element in this set must be distinct, because we can simply divide out the common factor of a in this prime mod. But there are only p − 1 nonzero residues mod p, so this must be a permutation of S. 4 Invertibility In particular, because {a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} is a permutation of {1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1}, there must exist some number a−1 such that aa−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). 5 Theorems 5.1 Fermat’s Little Theorem In particular, because {a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} is a permutation of {1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1}, the product of all the elements of the ﬁrst set is the product of all the elements of the second 1 set. Equating the two, we get a · 2a · 3a · · · (p − 1)a ≡ 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 1) (mod p) Canceling 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 1) from each side, recalling that this is a prime mod, we are left with ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) 5.2 Wilson’s Theorem Consider 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 1) = (p − 1)! (mod p). By invertibility, we can pair together inverses and cancel them in pairs. This continues until we are left with the only two elements which are their own inverse: 1 and -1. As their product is -1, we have that (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p) 6 Problems 1. (1 point) Find 3111890 (mod 1009). 2. (1 points) Compute the remainder when 2009! is divided by 2011. 3.
