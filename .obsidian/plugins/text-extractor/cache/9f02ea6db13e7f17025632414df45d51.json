Because x + y + z = xyz, A, B, C are three angles of a triangle. Also because x, y, z > 0 the triangle is acute. Then since 1√1+x2 = cos A, we want cos A + cos B + cos C ≤ 3 2 . Because x → cos x is concave on [0, π.2), by Jensen’s inequality cos A + cos B + cos C ≤ 3 cos ( A + B + C 3 ) = 3 cos ( π 3 ) = 3 2 □ Problem 2, Solution by Zhifan Zhang: We claim that ( 2a b+c ) 2 3 ≥ 3a a+b+c . Ob- serve that the cyclic sum of this inequality gives the desired inequality. Since this inequality is homogenous, after normalization we may assume that a + b + c = 1 and 0 < a < 1. Then after cubing both sides and simplifying it becomes equivalent to a(1 − a)2 ≤ 4 27 , which follows from AM-GM on the three numbers 2a, 1 − a and 1 − a □ Problem 3, Solution by Taylor Han: Note that x + y + 1 > √2x + 2y + 1. Adding a cyclic sum of these, and using that abc = 1, we get ∑ cyc 1 √b + 1 a + 1 2 > √2 ( 1 b + 1 a + 1 + 1 c + 1 b + 1 + 1 a + 1 c + 1 ) = √2 ( 1 b + 1 a + 1 + b 1 a + 1 + b + 1 a 1 + b + 1 a ) = √2 □ Problem 4, Solution by Wenyu Cao: By AM-GM, ab+3c 2 ≥ √3abc. Thus, √abc c + ab ≤ √3(ab + 3c) 6(ab + c) = √3 6 + √3c 3(c + ab) · Furthermore, a a + bc + b b + bc = a(b + c) + b(a + c) (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) = c + 2ab a+b c + ab = c − 2c 1−c c + ab + 2 1 − c · Thus, it suﬃces to show that (1 + √3 3 ) c − 2c 1−c c + ab + 2 1 − c ≤ 1 + 7 √3 12 · Note that (1 + √3 3 ) c − 2c 1−c ≤ 0 for all 0 ≤ c ≤ 1. Thus, by AM-GM we get (1 + √3 3 ) c − 2c 1−c c + ab + 2 1 − c ≤ ( 1 + √3 3 ) c − 2c 1−c c + ( 1−c 2 )2 + 2 1 − c · Let f (c) denote the RHS of the last inequality. After some calculations we ﬁnd that, f ′(7 − 4 √3) = 0 and investigating the sign of f ′ we see that the maximum value of f is f (7 − 4 √3) = 1 + 7 √3 12 . Hence, we are done □ 2008 BLUE MOP, INEQUALITIES-III AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 5, Solution by Damien Jiang: Dividing both sides by abc and letting x = a b , y = b c , and z = c a we get the equivalent inequality: √(xy + yz + zx)(x + y + z) ≥ 1+ 3√(x + y)(y + z)(z + x), where x, y, z > 0, and xyz = 1. Let A = (x+y)(y +z)(z +x). Note that (xy +yz +zx)(x+y +z) = A+xyz = A+1. So it remains to prove that √A + 1 ≥ 1 + 3√A which after squaring and simplifying becomes equivalent to ( 3√A − 2)( 3√A + 1) ≥ 0. Finally this follows from AM-GM, i.e. A ≥ 8xyz = 8 or 3√A ≥ 2 □ Problem 6, Solution by Damien Jiang (ﬁnally): First note that 1 3√1+x3 ≥ 2 2+x2 . Using this and letting x = a 2 4 , y = b 2 4 , z = c 2 4 , it suﬃces to prove the following inequality: x (1 + 2x)(1 + 2y) + y (1 + 2y)(1 + 2z) + z (1 + 2z)(1 + 2x) ≥ 1 3 where x, y, z > 0 such that xyz = 1. After multiplying out and canceling terms, we get the equivalent inequality (x + y + z) + 2(xy + yz + zx) ≥ 9, which follows from AM-GM, since xyz = 1 □ Problem 7, Solution by Minseon Shin: By weighted Jensen on the convex function f (x) = 1√x , we have a√a2+8bc + b√b2+8ac + c√c2+8ab a + b + c ≥ 1 √ a(a2+8bc)+b(b2+8ca)+c(c2+8ab) a+b+c · We need to show that a + b + c √ a3+b3+c3+24abc a+b+c ≥ 1, which is equivalent to (a + b + c) 3 ≥ a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 24abc ⇔ ∑ sym a 2b ≥ ∑ sym abc which is Muirhead inequality: [2, 1, 0] ≥ [1, 1, 1] □ Problem 8, Solution by Joshua Pfeﬀer: Let log S = log a+log b+log c+log d < log 3. Observe that the function x → 1 1+e4x is convex. So by Jensen’s Inequality: 1 = ∑ cyc 1 1 + a4 = ∑ cyc 1 1 + e4 log a ≥ 4 1 + elog S , which implies that S ≥ 3, as desired □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
