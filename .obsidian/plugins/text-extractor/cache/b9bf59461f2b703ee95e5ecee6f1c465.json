Within this area of geometry lies numer- ous interesting theorems and results, along with new methods. After you familiarize yourself with with this material, you should be able to solve most of the USAMO level geometry problems. 1 Theorems and Ideas 1.1 Menelaus’s Theorem Iﬀ points X, Y , Z on the extensions of sides BC, CA, AB of △ABC are collinear, then BX CX ∗ CY AY ∗ AZ BZ = 1 1.2 Brahmagupta’s Formula For any cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths a, b, c, d, area A, and semiperimeter s: A = √ (s − a)(s − b)(s − c)(s − d) Note that if d=0, then this simpiﬁes to Heron’s Formula. 1.3 The Butterﬂy Theorem Let AB be a chord of circle ω with midpoint M . Let CD and EF be two other chords of ω through M . Let X and Y be the intersections of AB with CE and DF , respectively. In this construction, M is also the midpoint of XY . 1 1.4 Simson’s Theorem Let D, E, F be the feet of the perpendiculars from a point P to △ABC. Iﬀ P lies on the circumcircle of △ABC, D, E, F are collinear and the line is known as the Simson line of P with respect to △ABC. 1.5 Hexagons In a hexagon ABCDEF , two vertices or two sides can be either adjacent, alternate, or opposite. For example, A and B are adjacent, C and F are opposite, and DE and F A are alternate, and BC and EF are opposite. A, C, E is a triad of alternating vertices, while AB, CD, EF are three alternating sides. The interior angles of a hexagon sum to 720 ◦. Note that in a cyclic hexagon, any three alternating angles sum up to 360 ◦, but the converse is not always true. Also note that the following two theorems only go one way; their converses are much more complicated. 1.5.1 Pascal’s Theorem If the three pairs of opposite sides in a cyclic hexagon all intersect, then the three points of intersection are collinear. 1.5.2 Brianchon’s Theorem If a hexagon ABCDEF can be circumscribed about a circle, then sides AD, BE, CF are either concurrent or parallel. 1.6 Coordinates There are many diﬀerent types of coordinates that have been discovered. Here are four of the most common systems and how they work. The ﬁrst two have been around since ancient times, but the last two were both introduced in the early 19th century. Beware: it is usually unwise to start oﬀ a problem by attempting to use coordinates. They are time consuming to use and often do not do the trick. 1.6.1 Cartesian Coordinates AKA Rectangular Coordinates You should know this system, so here are some tips: • A triangle can be represented using three variables. Use A = (0, 0), B = (0, a), C = (b, c). • The distance between (a, b) and (c, d) is √ (c − a)2 + (d − b)2. 2 • If a problem introduces a circle, start with a unit circle: a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. 1.6.2 Polar Coordinates The use of this system is limited to simple problems, usually ones involving primarily circles and angles. Polar coordinates are (r, θ), where r is the distance from the origin, and θ is the angle a line connecting the point to the origin makes with the positive x-axis, going counterclockwise from the positive x-axis. We use the substitution x = r cos θ, y = r sin θ to convert to Cartesian coordinates, and we use r = √x2 + y2, θ = tan −1( y x ) to convert from Cartesian coordinates. 1.6.3 Trilinear Coordinates Trilinear Coordinates denote the ratio of the distances from a point P = (x, y, z) to each of three sides of a triangle. Note that since this is a ratio, (x, y, z) and (−5x, −5y, −5z) represent the same point. However, the coordinates are often normalized so that x2 + y2 + z2 = 1. Using trilinear coordinates, many triangle centers can be expressed with ease. For example, here is a list of common triangle center functions: (note that a, b, c are the side lengths of the triangle, while α, β, γ are the angles of the triangle) • incenter: (1, 1, 1) • circumcenter: (cos α, cos β, cos γ) • orthocenter: (cos β cos γ, cos α cos γ, cos α cos β) • nine point center: (cos β − cos γ, cos α − cos γ, cos α − cos β) • centroid: ( 1 a , 1 b , 1 c ) Note that all triangle centers(not just the above) should have symmetric trilinear co- ordinates. 1.6.4 Barycentric Coordinates Barycentric coordinates (x, y, z) represent ratios of masses placed at the vertices of a triangle, which determines some center of mass. When these coordinates are normalized, x+y +z = 1. Note that the centroid has barycentric coordinates (1, 1, 1), and the incenter has coordinates (a, b, c) (where a, b, c are side lengths of the triangle). Other centers have slightly less elegant barycentric coordinates. 3 1.7 Vectors/Complex Numbers These tools can be very useful for brute forcing a geometry problem. However, a lot of practice is necesary to use these eﬀectively. This will not be covered here. Try ﬁnding a specialized book if you wish to learn about computational geometry. 2 Problems 1. {1.5-3.5} Prove all the theorems in this lecture.
