Prove that every positive rational number can be written in the form a1 + 1 a2 + 1 a3+... 1 an , for some positive integers n and a1, a2, · · · , an. 2. In an n × n grid of numbers from {−1, 1}, there is one −1 in each row and each column. It is permitted to negate all the numbers in any given row or column. Find the minimum possible number of −1’s in a grid which can be reached by these operations. 3. n lines, no two parallel and no three concurrent, are drawn in a plane. They split the plane into regions, each containing a number. One of the regions contains the number 1, and the others contain the number 0. It is permitted to simultaneously increment the numbers in any two adjacent (that is, sharing a common side) regions by 1. When is it possible to get all the numbers to be simultaneously divisible by 3? 2 Modular Arithmetic Hello. Today, we will talk about number theory. Speciﬁcally, we will talk about modular arithmetic. 3 Introduction We say that a ≡ b (mod n) (read: a is congruent to b mod n) iﬀ a−b is a multiple of n. This relation is reﬂexive, symmetric, and transitive, which means it partitions the integers into equivalence classes; that is, the set of integers can be split into parts such that any two elements from the same part are equal and no two elements from diﬀerent parts are equal. We call these parts residue classes mod n. The nice thing about residue classes is that for any two residue classes A, B mod n, the sumset A + B = {a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} is also a residue class mod n. This is equivalent to the fact that if a ≡ b (mod n) and c ≡ d (mod n), then a + b ≡ c + d (mod n). Additionally, the productset AB = {ab : a ∈ A, b ∈ B} is a subset of a residue class mod n. 4 Division Notice that the above two results do not imply that if ac ≡ bc (mod n), then a ≡ b (mod n). In fact, unfortunately this statement is false - 2 · 3 ≡ 6 · 3 (mod 6), yet it is not the case that 2 ≡ 6 (mod 6). For ac ≡ bc (mod n) to imply a ≡ b (mod n), we only need c to have an inverse mod n - that is, a number c −1 with cc −1 ≡ 1 (mod n). It is suﬃcient for c to share no common factor with n besides 1. 5 The Chinese Remainder Theorem The Chinese Remainder Theorem states that if m, n are relatively prime positive integers, then the system x ≡ a (mod m); x ≡ b (mod n) has a unique solution mod mn. This is essentially a 1 consequence of the existence of m−1 mod n. 6 Prime Moduli Since every integer not divisible by a prime is relatively prime to it, every n not divisible by a prime p has an inverse mod p. In fact, it is even possible to assign residue classes mod p to any rational number with denominator not divisible by p: we set a b to be in the same residue class as ab −1. The sumset of two residue classes will still be residue class, and the productset of two residue classes will still be a residue class. Keep in mind Fermat’s Little Theorem: that a p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) for any integers a, p with p prime and a not divisible by p. (This also implies a p−2 ≡ a −1 (mod p).) 7 Composite Moduli Most importantly, composite moduli can be “reduced” into prime-power moduli using the Chinese Remainder Theorem. Also, Euler’s Theorem states that a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for any relatively prime positive integers a, n, where ϕ(n) is the number of positive integers less than or equal to n and relatively prime to n. 8 Small Moduli To prove that a solution does not exist for a particular equation, it is suﬃcient to prove that there is no solution mod 2. Or mod 3. Or mod 8. Speciﬁcally, you might use the fact that 0, 1, and 4 are the only squares mod 8. 9 Problems 1. Prove Fermat’s Little Theorem. 2. Prove Euler’s Theorem. 3. Prove that (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p) for all primes p. 4. Prove that the sum of the squares of 3, 4, 5, or 6 consecutive integers is not a perfect square. 5. A set a1, a2, · · · , an is called a complete residue class mod n if no two of the elements are equivalent mod n. a1, a2, · · · , an and b1, b2, · · · , bn are complete residue classes mod n. For which n is it possible that a1 + b1, a2 + b2, · · · , an + bn is a complete residue class mod n? For which n is it possible that a1b1, a2b2, · · · , anbn is a complete residue class mod n? 6. Let p be a prime, and let k be a positive integer relatively prime to p − 1. If a is an integer with a k ≡ 1 (mod p), prove that a ≡ 1 (mod p). 7. If a and b are positive integers with a ≡ b (mod n), show that a n ≡ bn (mod n2). 8. Show that if n is a ﬁxed positive integer, then 2, 2 2, 2 22, 2222 , · · · eventually becomes constant mod n. 9. Prove that for all positive integers a > 1 and n, n is a divisor of ϕ(a n − 1). 2 10. Find all integers n such that n is a factor of 2 n − 1. 11. Find all integers n such that n2 is a factor of 2 n + 1. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
