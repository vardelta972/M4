David Arthur darthur@gmail.com Sometimes you will run into problems asking you to choose or place or label a bunch of objects in the “best” way possible. Here’s one example that can be solved with a trick you might have seen before: Example 1. n points are marked inside an equilateral triangle with side length 1 in such a way that no two marked points are within distance 0.5 of each other. What is the largest possible value for n? Solution. For n = 4, we can mark one point at each vertex of the triangle and one at the center. The minimum distance between any two of these points is 1√3 > 0.5. Now suppose n ≥ 5. Partition the triangle into four regions as shown: A A A A A A AA \u0001 \u0001\u0001 \u0001 \u0001\u0001 \u0001\u0001 AA A A \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 By the Pigeonhole Principle, two points must be in the same region, and the distance between those two points has to be at most 0.5, giving a contradiction. Therefore, the answer is n = 4. As you can see, there are two completely separate parts to this problem. First, we need to ﬁnd a conﬁguration that works for n = 4. Then we need to show there are no valid conﬁgurations for n > 4. In fact, almost all optimization problems break down in this way, and either part can be quite challenging. 1 Showing a conﬁguration is optimal A lot of the time, it is actually pretty easy to guess what the optimal conﬁguration should be. After that, you are just left with trying to prove it is optimal. There is one principle above else that you should keep in mind while doing this: KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Optimization problems, like other Olympiad problems, have clean solutions 9 times out of 10. This means that you should be looking for simple things to analyze, and you should be staying away from messy calculations, intuition-based hand-waving, and heavy case analysis. 1 of 8 Winter Camp 2010 Arranging things... optimally! David Arthur Example 1 shows KISS in action. You could write down equations for the distances between all points and then try manipulating them, but can you see how to complete a proof from there? No? Me neither. But once you divide the triangle up and use the Pigeonhole Principle, the problem becomes easy. The only question is: why would you think to divide the triangle up like that? Well, the good news is there are a few speciﬁc ideas that come up again and again, and this is one of them. Here’s a handy list of some of these tricks. It will be a little confusing at ﬁrst, but try a couple problems and refer to the list as you go, and hopefully you will start to see some patterns. 1. Suppose you want to choose as many points as possible from some space in such a way that no two points are close together. Then, divide the space into regions so that it is “obvious” that you cannot choose more than one point (or two points or three) from any one region. This is exactly what we did in Example 1. 2. More generally, suppose you have a list of “things”, and you want to pick as many things as possible subject to the constraint that certain combinations of things are illegal. Then divide the set of all things into groups so that it is “obvious” that you cannot choose more than one thing (or two or three) from any group. See Example 2 and Problem A5. 3. Suppose you want to cover a space with a small number of circles, squares, etc. Then focus on only a few speciﬁc points such that no one object can cover too many of these points. Often, you can completely ignore everything else during your proof. See Problem B4. 4. More generally, suppose you have a list of “things”, and you want to pick as few things as possible subject to a bunch of constraints of the following form: (a) You must choose at least one thing with some property A. (b) You must choose at least one thing with some property B. (c) etc. Once again, focus on only a few speciﬁc constraints such that no one object can cover too many of these constraints. See Example 3. 5. For graph problems, focus on one vertex and its neighbours. For colouring problems, focus on one single object and other objects that obviously cannot be the same colour as it. Hopefully, a large percentage of these must be diﬀerent colours from each other as well. See Example 4. (That example is not a graph problem, but it is essentially a colouring problem and the principle applies.) 6. Smoothing (a more advanced technique): look at some very small piece of an optimal solution. Prove that you can ﬁnd a better solution unless it is conﬁgured in some particular way. Now ask yourself: what solutions are conﬁgured in that particular way? If you’re lucky, these solutions might be easier to analyze than completely general solutions. See Problem C6. This approach is also the key idea to CMO 2009, #5, even though that problem is not framed as an optimization problem. 7. Invariants: is there some simple quantity or concept that behaves in a very predictable way as you build your solution? Can you deduce something as a result? See Problems B6 and B7. 2 of 8 Winter Camp 2010 Arranging things... optimally! David Arthur It’s completely okay if this list seems a little too complicated or a little too abstract right now. Just read it once, try a few problems, and then try to see how the solutions ﬁt into a common pattern. But notice how the key to all of these methods is to focus on something small and easy to understand. If you don’t focus on something much smaller than the whole, then optimizations problems are usually just too complicated to deal with1. To get you started, here are a couple more worked examples: Example 2. Let A be the largest subset of {1, 2, . . . , 100} such that A does not contain two elements with one dividing the other. What is |A|? Solution. For each odd number k, let Sk denote the set {k, 2k, 4k, 8k, . . .}. Any two elements of Sk divide each other, so A can have at most one element from Sk for all k. On the other hand, every number between 1 and 100 belongs to exactly one Sk for some odd k between 1 and 100. There are exactly 50 such k, so it follows that |A| ≤ 50. Conversely, the set {51, 52, . . . , 100} satisﬁes the given property since 2 · 51 > 100, and hence |A| ≥ 50. Therefore, |A| = 50. Example 3. We say that two diﬀerent cells of an 8 × 8 board are neighbouring if they have a common side. Find the minimal number of cells on the 8 × 8 board that must be marked so that every cell (marked or not marked) has a marked neighbouring cell. Solution. Divide the board into 10 regions as shown below: e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e Note that within each region, every square neighbours one of the two “central” squares. Therefore, if we mark each of the 20 central squares as shown, we have a valid solution. Conversely, the two central squares within each region only neighbour other squares in that region, and they do not share any neighbours with each other. Therefore, we must mark at least two squares within each region, and hence 20 marked squares is the smallest possible. This last example is pretty evil; it is actually based on IMO 1999 #32. So if you are wondering how anyone would think of this tiling, don’t worry about it too much. An IMO #3 is always going to be hard! But nonetheless, notice that as hard as this problem is, the basic approach is really just the exact same as in Example 1. Divide the thing up into regions such that each region is very easy to understand. Even for the hardest optimization problems, ideas like this can go a long way. 1Like all good rules of thumb, there are exceptions to this. Often, these exceptions rely on interpreting the problem as a special case of some deeper mathematical structure, like linearly independent vectors or partially ordered sets. Yufei wrote some notes on these topics if you are interested: http://web.mit.edu/yufeiz/www/imo2008/zhao- combinatorics.pdf 2IMO 1999 #3 is identical to this problem except you have to do n × n boards for all even n, not just 8 × 8. The tiling I showed here can be extended to a tiling for all such boards and thus solve the whole IMO problem, although you might have to play around with it a little bit to see how. 3 of 8 Winter Camp 2010 Arranging things... optimally! David Arthur 2 Finding the optimal conﬁguration Occasionally, you will run into problems where ﬁnding the optimal conﬁguration is as hard or harder than any proofs. Here is one example that some of you might remember from last year’s buﬀet contest: Example 4. A mathematics competition has n contestants and ﬁve problems. On each problem, each contestant is assigned a positive integer score which is at most seven. It turns out no pair of contestants got the same score on two diﬀerent problems. Find the maximum possible value for n. Solution. There are seven possible scores on each question. If n ≥ 50, then at least ⌈ 50 7 ⌉ = 8 contestants got the same score on problem 1. But then two of those contestants must have gotten the same score on problem 2, which is impossible. Now, for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 7, let xi,j,k denote the value in {1, 2, . . . , 7} that is congruent to i + jk (mod 7). Consider 49 contestants Ci,j where contestant Ci,j receives score xi,j,k on problem k. Suppose that two contestants Ci1,j1 and Ci2,j2 got the same scores on questions k1 and k2. Then i1 − i2 + (j1 − j2)k1 ≡ i1 − i2 + (j1 − j2)k2 ≡ 0 (mod 7). Subtracting, we have (j1 − j2)(k1 − k2) ≡ 0 (mod 7) =⇒ j1 ≡ j2 (mod 7) =⇒ j1 = j2. But then we must also have i1 = i2, which is a contradiction. Therefore, it is possible to satisfy the required condition with 49 contestants, and hence 49 is the maximum possible value for n. Where did this construction come from? Well, we can think of each student’s scores being given by a function from [1, 5] to [1, 7]. So we need to come up with a large family of functions for which any two functions have the same value at only one point. But we know that any two line functions have this property! So we assign each student scores according to an equation like this: Score = A · P roblemN umber + B. The rest is just easy algebra3! Now, what if we modiﬁed the problem so that no pair of contestants got the same score on three diﬀerent problems? Can you see how to assign scores for n = 343? There are plenty of problems where you can just guess randomly and eventually come up with an optimal conﬁguration, but as with this example, there are also times where that is impractical. Here are some things to keep in mind when you run into one of those situations: 1. Always look for solutions that are symmetrical or that follow some simple pattern. If the optimal conﬁguration is just random garbage, it would be a nightmare to prove it has the properties you want (unless it is very small). Since Olympiad problems don’t have nightmare solutions, look for something less random. Bear this in mind if you try Problems C2 and C5! 2. When assigning values between 1 and n, think modulo n. The ability to add, subtract, and multiply (and also divide if n is prime), can lead to constructions you would not have thought of otherwise. This was key to our solution for Example 4. 3. If you are trying to prove a conﬁguration exists and it seems impractical to write the conﬁg- uration down (because it is too big, or because you need to prove a conﬁguration exists in many diﬀerent situations at once), use induction. 3Implicit in this approach is the idea that integers mod 7 behave in a very similar way to real numbers, so our intuition about two lines intersecting only once is still true. This does work for 7, and it also works for any prime. It does not work for non-primes though. Try doing this construction in the case where there are only six possible scores on each problem, and see for yourself where it breaks down. 4 of 8 Winter Camp 2010 Arranging things... optimally! David Arthur 4. A more advanced technique: If you are trying to prove there exists a conﬁguration or object with some value at least equal to C, calculate the average of this value over all choices of conﬁgurations/objects. If the average is at least C, then you’re done! See Problem B8. 3 Problems For almost all of the following problems, you will have to both ﬁnd an optimal conﬁguration and then independently prove it is optimal. I strongly recommend thinking about both parts of the problem as you go. Partial progress on the proof can help guide your search for a good conﬁguration, and time spent looking for a good conﬁguration can sometimes give you intuition for the proof. Plus, you don’t want to spend a long time trying to prove a conﬁguration is optimal only to ﬁnd out there is an even better conﬁguration that you missed! The questions are arranged roughly in order, with A-level problems being pre-IMO diﬃculty, B-level problems being “easy” and medium IMO diﬃculty, and C-level problems being hard IMO diﬃculty. Good luck! A1. A square grid of 16 dots (see the ﬁgure) contains the corners of nine 1 × 1 squares, four 2 × 2 squares, and one 3 × 3 square, for a total of 14 squares whose sides are parallel to the sides of the grid.
