Let ABCD be a quadrilateral circumscribed about a circle, whose interior and exterior angles are at least 60\u000e. Prove that 1 Prove that S must be equal to the set of all integers. Solution: We may as well assume that none of the ai is equal to 0. We start with the following observations. (d) 0 = a1 \u0000 a1 2 S by (b). (e) \u0000s = 0 \u0000 s 2 S whenever s 2 S, by (a) and (d). (f) If x; y 2 S and x \u0000 y 2 S, then x + y 2 S by (b) and (e). By (f) plus strong induction on m, we have that ms 2 S for any m \u0015 0 whenever s 2 S. By (d) and (e), the same holds even if m \u0014 0, and so we have the following. (g) For i = 1; : : : ; n, S contains all multiples of ai. We next verify that (h) For i; j 2 f1; : : : ; ng and any integers ci; cj, ciai + cjaj 2 S. We do this by induction on jcij + jcjj. If jcij \u0014 1 and jcjj \u0014 1, this follows from (b), (d), (f), so we may assume that maxfjcij; jcjjg \u0015 2. Suppose without loss of generality (by switching i with j and/or negating both ci and cj) that ci \u0015 2; then ciai + cjaj = ai + ((ci \u0000 1)ai + cjaj) and we have ai 2 S, (ci \u00001)ai +cjaj 2 S by the induction hypothesis, and (ci \u00002)ai +cjaj 2 S again by the induction hypothesis. So ciai + cjaj 2 S by (f), and (h) is veri\fed. Let ei be the largest integer such that 2ei divides ai; without loss of generality we may assume that e1 \u0015 e2 \u0015 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0015 en. Let di be the greatest common divisor of a1; : : : ; ai. We prove by induction on i that S contains all multiples of di for i = 1; : : : ; n; the case i = n is the desired result. Our base cases are i = 1 and i = 2, which follow from (g) and (h), respectively. Assume that S contains all multiples of di, for some 2 \u0014 i < n. Let T be the set of integers m such that m is divisible by di and m + rai+1 2 S for all integers r. Then T contains nonzero positive and negative numbers, namely any multiple of ai by (h). By (c), if t 2 T and s divisible by di (so in S) satisfy t \u0000 s 2 T , then t + s 2 T . By taking t = s = di, we deduce that 2di 2 T ; by induction (as in the proof of (g)), we have 2mdi 2 T for any integer m (positive, negative or zero). From the way we ordered the ai, we see that the highest power of 2 dividing di is greater than or equal to the highest power of 2 dividing ai+1. In other words, ai+1=di+1 is odd. We can thus \fnd integers f; g with f even such that f di + gai+1 = di+1. (Choose such a pair without any restriction on f , and replace (f; g) with (f \u0000 ai+1=di+1; g + di=di+1) if needed to get an even f .) Then for any integer r, we have rf di 2 T and so rdi+1 2 S. This completes the induction and the proof of the desired result. Problem originally by Kiran Kedlaya. 3. For what real values of k > 0 is it possible to dissect a 1 \u0002 k rectangle into two similar, but noncongruent, polygons? Solution: We will show that a dissection satisfying the requirements of the problems is possible if and only if k 6= 1. We \frst show by contradiction that such a dissection is not possible when k = 1. Assume that we have such a dissection. The common boundary of the two dissecting polygons must be a single broken line connecting two points on the boundary of the square (otherwise either the square is subdivided in more than two pieces or one of the polygons is inside the other). The two dissecting polygons must have the same number of vertices. They share all the vertices on the common boundary, so they have to use the same number of corners of the square as their own vertices. Therefore, the common boundary must connect two opposite sides of the square (otherwise one of the polygons will contain at least three corners of the square, while the other at most two). However, this means that each of the dissecting polygons must use an entire side of the square as one of its sides, and thus each polygon has a side of length 1. A side of longest length in one of the polygons is either a side on the common boundary or, if all those sides have length less than 1, it is a side of the square. But this is also true of the other polygon, which means that the longest side length in the two polygons is the same. This is impossible since they are similar but not congruent, so we have a contradiction. We now construct a dissection satisfying the requirements of the problem when k 6= 1. Notice that we may assume that k > 1, because a 1 \u0002 k rectangle is similar to a 1 \u0002 1 and the sides of the (2n + 2)-gon A0A1A2 : : : A2nD have lengths 1; r; r2; : : : ; r2n\u00001; 1 + r2 + r4 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + r2n\u00002; r + r3 + r5 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + r2n\u00001; respectively. These two polygons dissect the rectangle ABCD and, apart from orientation, it is clear that they are similar but noncongruent, with coe\u000ecient of similarity r > 1. The rectangle ABCD and its dissection are thus constructed. The rectangle ABCD is similar to a rectangle of size 1 \u0002 fn(r), where fn(r) = 1 + r2 + ::: + r2n So when all the numbers are written, the maximum square in row 6 is in B and the maximum square in row 1 is in A. Since there is no path from B to A that stays in A [ B, Bob wins. Problem originally by Melanie Wood. 5. Let a; b and c be positive real numbers. Prove that (a5 \u0000 a2 + 3)(b5 \u0000 b2 + 3)(c5 \u0000 c2 + 3) \u0015 (a + b + c)3: Solution: For any positive number x, the quantities x2 \u0000 1 and x3 \u0000 1 have the same sign. Thus, we have 0 \u0014 (x3 \u0000 1)(x2 \u0000 1) = x5 \u0000 x3 \u0000 x2 + 1, or x5 \u0000 x2 + 3 \u0015 x3 + 2: It follows that (a5 \u0000 a2 + 3)(b5 \u0000 b2 + 3)(c5 \u0000 c2 + 3) \u0015 (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2): It su\u000eces to show that (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) \u0015 (a + b + c)3: (\u0003) We \fnish with two approaches. \u000f First approach Expanding both sides of inequality (\u0003) and cancelling like terms gives a3b3c3+3(a3+b3+c3)+2(a3b3+b3c3+c3a3)+8 \u0015 3(a2b+b2a+b2c+c2b+c2a+ac2)+6abc: (\u00030) By the AM-GM Inequality, we have a3 + a3b3 + 1 \u0015 3a2b. Combining similar results, inequality (\u0003) reduces to a3b3c3 + a3 + b3 + c3 + 1 + 1 \u0015 6abc; which is evident by the AM-GM Inequality. \u000f We rewrite the left-hand-side of inequality (\u0003) as (a3 + 1 + 1)(1 + b3 + 1)(1 + 1 + c3): By H\u0000older's Inequality, we have (a3 + 1 + 1) 1 6. A circle ! is inscribed in a quadrilateral ABCD. Let I be the center of !. Suppose that (AI + DI)2 + (BI + CI)2 = (AB + CD)2: Prove that ABCD is an isosceles trapezoid. Solution: Our proof is based on the following key Lemma. Lemma If a circle !, centered at I, is inscribed in a quadrilateral ABCD, then BI 2 + AI or BP \u0001 CI + BI 2 = AB \u0001 BC: (y0) Note also that 4BIP and 4IDA are similar, implying that BP","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
