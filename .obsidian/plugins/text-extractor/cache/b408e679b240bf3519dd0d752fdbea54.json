(AM-GM) Let a1, · · · , an be positive real numbers. Then, we have a1 + · · · + an n ≥ n√a1 · · · an. Theorem 2. (Cauchy-Schwarz) Let a1, · · · , an, b1, · · · , bn be real numbers. Then, (a12 + · · · + an2)(b12 + · · · + bn2) ≥ (a1b1 + · · · + anbn) 2. Theorem 3. (Jensen) Let f : [a, b] → R be a convex function. Then for any x1, x2, . . . , xn ∈ [a, b] and any nonnegative reals ω1, ω2, . . . , ωn with ω1 + ω2 + · · · + ωn = 1, we have ω1f (x1) + ω2f (x2) + · · · + ωnf (xn) ≥ f (ω1x1 + ω2x2 + · · · + ωnxn). If f is concave, then the inequality is ﬂipped. Theorem 4. (Weighted AM-GM) Let ω1, · · · , ωn > 0 with ω1 + · · · + ωn = 1. For all x1, · · · , xn > 0, we have ω1x1 + ω2x2 + · · · + ωnxn ≥ xω1 1 xω2 2 · · · xωn n . Theorem 5. (Schur) Let x, y, z be nonnegative real numbers. For any r > 0, we have ∑ cyclic xr(x − y)(x − z) ≥ 0. Deﬁnition 1. (Majorization) Let x = (x1, x2, . . . xn) and y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) be two sequences of real numbers. Then x is said to majorize y (denoted x ≻ y) if the following conditions are satisﬁed • x1 ≥ x2 ≥ x3 · · · ≥ xn and y1 ≥ y2 ≥ y3 · · · ≥ yn; and • x1 + x2 + · · · + xk ≥ y1 + y2 + · · · + yk, for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1; and • x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = y1 + y2 + · · · + yn. Theorem 6. (Muirhead) 1 Suppose that (a1, . . . , an) ≻ (b1, . . . , bn), and x1, . . . xn are positive real numbers, then ∑ sym xa1 1 xa2 2 · · · xan n ≥ ∑ sym xb1 1 xb2 2 · · · xbn n . where the symmetric sum is taken over all n! permutations of x1, x2, . . . , xn. Theorem 7. (Karamata’s Majorization inequality) Let f : [a, b] → R be a convex function. Suppose that (x1, · · · , xn) ≻ (y1, · · · , yn), where x1, · · · , xn, y1, · · · , yn ∈ [a, b]. Then, we have f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + · · · + f (yn). 1Practical notes about Muirhead: (1) don’t try to apply Muirhead when there are more than 3 variables, since mostly likely you won’t succeed (and never, ever try to use Muirhead when the inequality is only cyclic but not symmetric, since it is incorrect to use Muirhead there) (2) when writing up your solution, it is probably safer to just deduce the inequality using weighted AM-GM by ﬁnding the appropriate weights, as this can always be done. The reason is that it is not always clear that Muirhead will be accepted as a quoted theorem. 1 Winter Camp 2008 Inequalities Yufei Zhao Theorem 8. (Power Mean) Let x1, · · · , xn > 0. The power mean of order r is deﬁned by M(x1,··· ,xn)(0) = n√x1 · · · xn , M(x1,··· ,xn)(r) = ( xr 1 + · · · + xnr n ) 1 r (r ̸= 0). Then, M(x1,··· ,xn) : R −→ R is continuous and monotone increasing. Theorem 9. (Bernoulli) For all r ≥ 1 and x ≥ −1, we have (1 + x) r ≥ 1 + rx. Deﬁnition 2. (Symmetric Means) For given arbitrary real numbers x1, · · · , xn, the coeﬃcient of tn−i in the polynomial (t + x1) · · · (t + xn) is called the i-th elementary symmetric function σi. This means that (t + x1) · · · (t + xn) = σ0tn + σ1t n−1 + · · · + σn−1t + σn. For i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , n}, the i-th elementary symmetric mean Si is deﬁned by Si = σi(n i ) . Theorem 10. Let x1, . . . , xn > 0. For i ∈ {1, · · · , n}, we have (1) (Newton) Si Si+1 ≥ Si−1 Si , (2) (Maclaurin) Si 1 i ≥ Si+1 1 i+1 . Theorem 11. (Rearrangement) Let x1 ≥ · · · ≥ xn and y1 ≥ · · · ≥ yn be real numbers. For any permutation σ of {1, . . . , n}, we have n∑ i=1 xiyi ≥ n∑ i=1 xiyσ(i) ≥ n∑ i=1 xiyn+1−i. Theorem 12. (Chebyshev) Let x1 ≥ · · · ≥ xn and y1 ≥ · · · ≥ yn be real numbers. We have x1y1 + · · · + xnyn n ≥ ( x1 + · · · + xn n ) ( y1 + · · · + yn n ) . Theorem 13. (H¨older) 2 Let x1, · · · , xn, y1, · · · , yn be positive real numbers. Suppose that p > 1 and q > 1 satisfy 1 p + 1 q = 1. Then, we have n∑ i=1 xiyi ≤ ( n∑ i=1 xip) 1 p ( n∑ i=1 yiq) 1 q . More generally, let xij (i = 1, · · · , m, j = 1, · · · n) be positive real numbers. Suppose that ω1, · · · , ωn are positive real numbers satisfying ω1 + · · · + ωn = 1. Then, we have n∏ j=1 ( m∑ i=1 xij )ωj ≥ m∑ i=1   n∏ j=1 xij ωj   . Theorem 14. (Minkowski) 3 If x1, · · · , xn, y1, · · · , yn > 0 and p > 1, then ( n∑ i=1 xip) 1 p + ( n∑ i=1 yip) 1 p ≥ ( n∑ i=1 (xi + yi)p) 1 p 2Think of this as generalized Cauchy, as you can use it for more than two sequences. 3Think of this as generalized triangle inequality. 2 Winter Camp 2008 Inequalities Yufei Zhao 2 A motivating example In this section we discuss several common techniques in inequalities through following famous problem from IMO 2001 by Hojoo Lee: Prove that a √a2 + 8bc + b √b2 + 8ca + c √c2 + 8ab ≥ 1 for all positive real numbers a, b and c. The oﬃcial solution is short and mysterious: Oﬃcial solution: First we prove that a √a2 + 8bc ≥ a 4 3 a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 , or equivalently, that (a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 ) 2 ≥ a 2 3 (a 2 + 8bc). Indeed, this follows from applying AM-GM as follows: (a 4 3 +b 4 3 +c 4 3 ) 2 = (a 4 3 ) 2 +(b 4 3 +c 4 3 )(a 4 3 +a 4 3 +b 4 3 +c 4 3 ) ≥ (a 4 3 ) 2 +2b 2 3 c 2 3 ·4a 2 3 b 1 3 c 1 3 = a 8 3 +8a 2 3 bc = a 2 3 (a 2 +8bc). We have similar inequalities for the other two terms, and so a √a2 + 8bc + b √b2 + 8ca + c √c2 + 8ab ≥ a 4 3 a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 + b 4 3 a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 + c 4 3 a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 = 1. □ While the solution looks nice and short, it leaves us wonder how in the world could anyone come up with it. In particular, where did the exponent 4 3 come from? Here we provide some motivation. Isolated fudging. It is not unusual to compare individual terms of an inequality to expressions such as a r ar + br + cr because if the comparison turns out to be successful, we can ﬁnish oﬀ the problem right away. (Techniques of this form are sometimes called isolated fudging, meaning that the eﬀort is focused on manipulating individual terms, as opposed to the inequality as a whole.) So, suppose we guess that it is possible to have an inequality of the form a √a2 + 8bc ≥ a r ar + br + cr . Now how can we pick the candidates for r? Blind guess and check will probably get us nowhere. Luckily, there is a method that will give you the unique candidate for r (though with no promise that this r will work). Be prepared, this method will require some calculus. Suppose that some r works. Let us consider the function f (a, b, c) = a √a2 + 8bc − a r ar + br + cr . What do we know about f (a, b, c)? Because of the inequality that we want, we need f (a, b, c) ≥ 0 for all a, b, c > 0. Also, by considering the point of equality, we see that (1, 1, 1) must be a local minimum of f . So consider the partial derivative of f with respect to a (denoted ∂f /∂a), meaning that we diﬀerentiate f with respect to a while treating the other variables as if they were constants. Since (1, 1, 1) is a local minimum, this partial derivative when evaluated at (1, 1, 1) must give zero. So let’s do this computation. (If you know some multivariable calculus, it may be instructive to think in terms of ∇f = 0 at (1, 1, 1).) 3 Winter Camp 2008 Inequalities Yufei Zhao We have ∂f ∂a = √a2 + 8bc − a 2 √a2+8bc a2 + 8bc − ra r−1(a r + br + cr) − a r · ra r−1 (ar + br + cr)2 . Evaluating at (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 1) and setting the value to zero, we get 3− 1 3 9 − 3r−r 9 = 0, which gives r = 4 3 . Aha! Now we found the candidate for r, we can now go through the steps of the oﬃcial solution (which were easy, given we know what r is). □ Note that while we used calculus to motivate our solution, we do not need to include any calculus in the solution! In fact, calculus is best avoided in olympiad solutions as it is generally viewed unfavorably. However, since we are not required to provide the motivation to our proof, we do not need to worry about this issue. Amazing, isn’t it? Turning the table around. Seeing that the inequality is homogeneous (meaning that the transformation (a, b, c) 7→ (ka, kb, kc) does not change anything), it is natural to impose a constraint on it. So let us assume without the loss of generality that abc = 1 8 , so that we need to prove a √ a2 + 1 a + b √b2 + 1 b + c √c2 + 1 c ≥ 1. This does not seem any easier. Now, let us turn the table around and switch the roles of the constraint and the inequality. Let x = a √ a2 + 1 a , y = b √ b2 + 1 b , z = c √c2 + 1 c . Note that a√a2+ 1 a = 1√1+ 1 a3 , so we can write a, b, c in terms of x, y, z: a 3 = x 2 1 − x2 , b 3 = y2 1 − y2 , c 3 = z2 1 − z2 . So, the inequality that we wish to prove is x+y +z ≥ 1 assuming abc = 1 8 . By considering the contrapositive, it suﬃces to prove that abc < 1 8 assuming x + y + z < 1. That is, we need to prove that x2y2z2 (1 − x2)(1 − y2)(1 − z2) < 1 83 given x + y + z < 1. The square roots are now gone! The new inequality turns out to be extremely easy, as it is merely a straightforward application of AM-GM. Indeed, we have 1 − x2 > (x + y + z)2 − x2 = y2 + z2 + xy + xy + yz + yz + xz + xz ≥ 8x 1 2 y 3 4 z 3 4 and similarly for 1 − y2 and 1 − z2. Setting this back into about inequality gives the desired result. □ How to use Jensen. Since the inequality is homogeneous, we can assume that a + b + c = 1. Note that the function x 7→ 1√x is convex. So we can use Jensen’s inequality as follows: a · 1 √a2 + 8bc + b · 1 √b2 + 8ca + c · 1 √c2 + 8ab ≥ 1 √a(a2 + 8bc) + b(b2 + 8ca) + c(c2 + 8ab) = 1 √a3 + b3 + c3 + 24abc . So it remains to prove that 1 √a3 + b3 + c3 + 24abc ≥ 1 4 Winter Camp 2008 Inequalities Yufei Zhao or equivalently, a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 24abc ≤ (a + b + c) 3. This is again extremely easy, as AM-GM gives (a + b + c) 3 − a 3 − b3 − c 3 = 3(a2b + b2a + b 2c + c 2b + c2a + a 2c) + 6abc ≥ 24abc. □ 3 Problems The following problems are selected from a packet written by Thomas Mildorf, which can be found at http://web.mit.edu/tmildorf/www/Inequalities.pdf.
