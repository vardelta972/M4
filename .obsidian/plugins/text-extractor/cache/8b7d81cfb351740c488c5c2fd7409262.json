Li For a fixed nonzero integer N, as the case 1−=N shows, the generalized equation Ndyx =− 22 may not have a solution. If it has a least positive solution ),( 11 yx , then Ndyx =− 22 has infinitely many positive solutons given by ),( nn yx , where 1 11 ))(( −++=+ n nn dbadyxdyx and (a, b) is the least positive solution of 1 22 =− dyx . However, in general these do not give all positive solutions of Ndyx =− 22 as the following example will show. Example 9. Consider the equation − 2x 723 2 −=y . It has ),( 11 yx = (4, 1) as the least positive solution. The next two solutions are (19, 4) and (211, 44). Now the least positive solution of 22 23yx − = 1 is (a, b) = (24, 5). Since (4 + 23 )(24 + 5 23 ) = 211 + 44 23 , the solution (19, 4) is skipped by the formula above. In case Ndyx =− 22 has positive solutions, how do we get them all? A solution (x, y) of Ndyx =− 22 is called primitive if x and y (and N) are relatively prime. For 0 ≤ s < N , we say the solution belong to class sC if x ≡ sy (mod N ). As x, y are relatively prime to N, so is s. Hence, there are at most φ ( N ) classes of primitive solutions, where φ (k) is Euler’s φ -function denoting the number of positive integers m ≤ k that are relatively prime to k. Also, for such s, −≡− 222 )( xyds 0 2 ≡dy (mod N ) and y, N relatively prime imply ds ≡ 2 (mod N ). Theorem. Let ),( 11 ba be a sC primitive solutions of Ndyx =− 22 . A pair ,( 2a )2b is also a sC primitive solution of Ndyx =− 22 if and only if dba 22 + = )/()( 1122 dbadba −− . Multiplying these two equations, we get 22 dvu − = N/N = 1. To see u, v are integers, note 2121 bdbaa − ≡ 21 2 )( bbds − ≡ 0 (mod N ), which implies u is an integer. Since −21ba 21ab 2121 sbbbsb −≡ = 0 (mod N ), v is also an integer. For the converse, multiplying the equation with its conjugate shows ),( 22 ba solves Ndyx =− 22 . From 112 dvbuaa += and 112 vaubb += , we get −= 22 uaa 2dvb and 221 vaubb −= . Hence, common divisors of 22 , ba are also common divisors 11 , ba . So 22 , ba are relatively prime. Finally, ≡− 22 sba 1 2 1111 )()()( vbsdvsbubsdvbusb −=+−+ 0≡ (mod N ) concludes the proof. Thus, all primitive solutions of − 2x Ndy = 2 can be obtained by finding a solution (if any) in each class, then multiply them by solutions of − 2x 2dy = 1. For the nonprimitive solutions, we can factor the common divisors of a and b to reduce N. Example 10. (1995 IMO proposal by USA leader T. Andreescu) Find the smallest positive integer n such that 19n + 1 and 95n + 1 are both integer squares. Solution. Let 95n + 1 = 2x and 19n + 1 = 2y , then 22 5yx − = -4. Now φ (4) = 2 and (1, 1), (11, 5) are 31 , CC primitive solutions, respectively. As (9, 4) is the least positive solution of 22 5yx − = 1 and 9 + 54 = (2 + 2)5, so the primitive positive solutions are pairs (x, y), where )51(5 +=+ yx 22)52( −+ n or (11 + +2)(55 22)5 −n . Since the common divisors of x, y divide 4, the nonprimitive positive solutions are the cases x and y are even. This reduces to considering 22 5vu − = -1, where we take u = x/2 and v = y/2. The least positive solution for 2u - 25v = -1 is (2, 1). So x + 5y = 2(u + )5v = 2(2 + 12)5 −n . In attempt to combine these solutions, we look at the powers of 51 + coming from the least positive solutions (1, 1).

Maria and José take turns drawing a segment between two of the points which have not yet been joined by a segment. The game ends when each point has been used as the endpoint of a segment at least once. The winner is the player who draws the last segment. If José goes first, who has a winning strategy?

José has the following winning strategy. He will let Maria be the first person to use the ninety-sixth unused point. Since there are 4465 95 2 =C segments joining pairs of the first ninety-five points, if Maria does not use the ninety-sixth point, José does not have to use it either. Once Maria starts using the ninety-sixth point, José can win by joining the ninety-seventh and ninety-eighth points. Problem 142.

Determine all natural numbers k > 1 such that, for some distinct natural numbers m and n, the numbers mk + 1 and + nk 1 can be obtained from each other by reversing the order of the digits in their decimal representations.

CHAO Khek Lun Harold (St. Paul’s College, Form 7), LEUNG Wai Ying (Queen Elizabeth School, Form 7), Ricky TANG (La Salle College, Form 4) and WONG Tsz Wai (Hong Kong Chinese Women’s Club College, Form 6). Without loss of generality, suppose such numbers exist and .mn > By the required property, both numbers are not power of 10. So nk and mk have the same number of digits. Then 10 > .kk k k mn m n ≥= − Since every number and the sum of its digits are congruent (mod 9), we get 11 +≡+ mn kk (mod 9). Then )1 ( −=− −mnmmn kkkk is divisible by 9. Since the two factors are relatively prime, k>10 and mnk −>9– 1, we can only have k = 3, 6 or 9. Now 2813 3 =+ and 82134 =+ show k = 3 is an answer. The case k = 6 cannot work as numbers of the form 16 + i end in 7 so that both 1+ mk and 1+ nk would begin and end with 7, which makes kkk mn ≥/ impossible. Finally, the case k = 9 also cannot work as numbers of the form 19 + i end in 0 or 2 so that both numbers would begin and end with 2, which again makes kkk mn ≥/ impossible.
