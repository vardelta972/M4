Prove that there do not exist natural numbers x and y, with x > 1, such that x7 − 1 x − 1 = y5 + 1 . 2. In a triangle ABC, AD is the altitude from A, and H is the orthocentre. Let K be the centre of the circle passing through D and tangent to BH at H. Prove that the line DK bisects AC. 3. Consider the expression 2013 2 + 20142 + 20152 + · · · + n2 . Prove that there exists a natural number n > 2013 for which one can change a suitable number of plus signs to minus signs in the above expression to make the resulting expression equal 9999. 4. Let ABC be a triangle with ∠A = 90◦ and AB = AC. Let D and E be points on the segment BC such that BD : DE : EC = 1 : 2 : √3. Prove that ∠DAE = 45◦. 5. Let n ≥ 3 be a natural number and let P be a polygon with n sides. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be the lengths of the sides of P and let p be its perimeter. Prove that a1 p − a1 + a2 p − a2 + · · · + an p − an < 2 . 6. For a natural number n, let T (n) denote the number of ways we can place n objects of weights 1, 2, . . . , n on a balance such that the sum of the weights in each pan is the same. Prove that T (100) > T (99). ——— ⋆⋆ ———","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
