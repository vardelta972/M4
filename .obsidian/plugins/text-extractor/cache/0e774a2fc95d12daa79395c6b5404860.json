Find all triples of positive integers x, y, z satisfying 1 + 2x3y = z2. Solution: Since z = 1, 2 or 3 does not yield a solution, we assume z ≥ 4. Factoring we obtain (z + 1)(z − 1) = 2x3y. Since the numbers z − 1 and z + 1 diﬀer by 2, at most one of them is divisible by 3. Also, since the product is even, the factors are both even, and exactly one of them is divisible by 4. So either z + 1 = 2 · 3y and z − 1 = 2x−1 or z + 1 = 2x−1 and z − 1 = 2 · 3y. By subtracting the two equations, the ﬁrst case yields 2 = 2 · 3y − 2x−1; hence 3y − 2x−2 = 1. This has a solution x = 3, y = 1, for which z = 5. For solutions with x ≥ 4, looking mod 4 we conclude that y must be even, say y = 2y1. Factoring yields (3y1 + 1)(3y1 − 1) = 2x−2. So both factors on the left are powers of two, and since they diﬀer by two, the ﬁrst one is 4 and the second is 2. This gives the solution x = 5, y = 2, and consequently z = 17. The second case leads to the equation 2x−2 − 3y = 1. By looking at mod 3 we see that x is even, so let x − 2 = 2x1. Then we have (2x1 − 1)(2x1 + 1) = 3y. So 2x1 − 1 and 2x1 + 1 are two powers of 3 that diﬀer by 2, which can only be 1 and 3. From this we get the solution x = 4, y = 1, z = 7. In summary, the solutions are (x, y, z) = (3, 1, 5), (5, 2, 17), (4, 1, 7). Source: Romanian TST 1984 2. For positive real numbers a, b, c such that abc ≤ 1, prove that a b + b c + c a ≥ a + b + c. First solution: Using the weighted AM-GM, we have 2a b + b c ≥ 3 3 √ a2 bc ≥ 3a. Similarly, 2b c + c a ≥ 3b and 2c a + a b ≥ 3c. Adding these three inequalities gives the result. Second solution: Replacing a, b, c by ta, tb, tc with t = 1/ 3√abc preserves the LHS while increases the RHS and makes at·bt·ct = abct3 = 1. Hence we may assume wolog that abc = 1. Then there exists positive real numbers x, y, z such that a = y x , b = z y , , c = x z . The Rearrangement Inequality gives x3 + y3 + z3 ≥ x2y + y2z + z2x. 1 Thus a b + b c + c a = x3 + y3 + z3 xyz ≥ x2y + y2z + z2x xyz = a + b + c, as desired. 3. In acute triangle ABC, ∠A < 45◦. Point D lies in the interior of triangle ABC such that BD = CD and ∠BDC = 4∠A. Point E is the reﬂection of C across line AB, and point F is the reﬂection of B across line AC. Prove that AD ⊥ EF . First solution: All angles are directed. Let RA be the rotation by angle 2∠CAB centered at A and let RD be the rotation by angle ∠BDC centered at D. Then T = RA ◦ RD ◦ RA is a translation because the sum of angles of RA, RD, RA is zero. Note that RA(F ) = B, RD(B) = C, RA(C) = E, so composing them gives T(F ) = E. Therefore, T is the translation by −−→ F E. Let M = RD(A), N = RA(M ). Then because triangle ADM is isosceles and ∠M DA = 4∠CAB, we have ∠DAM = 90◦ − 2∠CAB. Therefore, ∠DAN = ∠DAM + ∠M AN = 90 ◦ − 2∠CAB + 2∠CAB = 90 ◦. Since T(A) = N , we have −−→ AN = −−→ F E, and therefore AD ⊥ EF. Second solution: We use complex numbers. Use lower case letters to denote the complex number corresponding to a point. Place D at the center, and let B and C be on the unit circle so that B and C are symmetric about the real axis. Let α denote the unit complex number with argument ∠CAB. Then, b = α2, c = α−2. Since AE = AC and ∠CAE = 2∠CAB, we see that e − a = α2(c − a), which gives us e = a + α2(c − a) = a(1 − α2) + cα2 = a(1 − α2) + 1. Similarly, f = a(1 − α−2) + 1. So f − e = a(α2 − α−2). Note that α2 − α−2 is purely imaginary as α lies on the unit circle. It follows that EF is perpendicular to AD. Source: MOP 2007 2 4. Let m, n be two positive integers with m ≥ n. Prove that n∑ k=0(−1) k(m − k n )(n k ) = 1. First solution: (Finite diﬀerences) Let f be the polynomial f (x) = (m − x n ) = (m − x)(m − 1 − x) · · · (m − n + 1 − x) n! . Then LHS = n∑ k=0(−1) k( n k ) f (k) = (−1) n∆nf (0), where ∆ denotes the ﬁnite diﬀerence operator, which transforms a function g(x) into g(x + 1) − g(x). For polynomials, if P is a polynomial of degree d, then ∆P is a polynomial of degree d − 1. Since deg(f ) = n, we see that ∆nf (x) is a constant. So LHS = (−1) n∆nf (0) = (−1) n∆nf (m − n) = n∑ k=0(−1) k( n k ) f (m − n + k). Since f (m − n + 1) = f (m − n + 2) = · · · = f (m) = 0, the only nonzero term is f (m − n) = 1, and thus the original sum equals to 1. Second solution: (Combinatorial) For i = 1, 2, . . . , n, let Si denote the set of all n-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , m} that does not contain the element i. That is Si = {A ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , m} : |A| = n, i /∈ A} . Since S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn contains all n-element subset of {1, 2, . . . , m} except for the subset {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have |S1 ∪ S2 ∪ · · · ∪ Sn| = ( m n ) − 1. Also, the intersection Sa1 ∩ Sa2 ∩ · · · ∩ Sai, where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 < · · · < ai ≤ n, contains all n-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , m}\\{a1, a2, . . . ai}. So Sa1 ∩ Sa2 ∩ · · · ∩ Sai = (m − i n ) . By the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle, |S1∪S2∪· · ·∪Sn| = ∑ 1≤i≤n |Si|− ∑ 1≤i<j≤n |Si∩Sj|+ ∑ 1≤i<j<k≤n |Si∩Sj∩Sk|−· · ·−(−1) n|S1∩S2∩· · ·∩Sn|, which is equivalent to (m n ) − 1 = ( m − 1 n )(n 1 ) − (m − 2 n )( n 2 ) + ( m − 3 n )(n 3 ) − · · · − (−1) n( m − n n )( n n ), and rearranging gives n∑ k=0(−1) k( m − k n )(n k ) = 1, 3 as desired. Third solution: (Generating function) We see that given sum equals to the coeﬃcient of xm in the product F (x)G(x), where F (x) = ∞∑ k=0(−1) k(n k ) xk, and G(x) = ∞∑ k=0 (k n )xk. Using binomial theorem, we have F (x) = n∑ k=0(−1) k( n k ) xk = (1 − x)n, and G(x) = ∞∑ k=n (k n ) xk = xn ∞∑ k=0 ( n + k n )x k = x n ∞∑ k=0(−1) k( −n − 1 k ) xk = xn(1 − x)−n−1. And thus F (x)G(x) = xn(1 − x)−1 = xn + xn+1 + xn+2 + · · · . So the coeﬃcient of xm is 1, and thus the sum equals to 1. Source: MathLinks Contest 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
