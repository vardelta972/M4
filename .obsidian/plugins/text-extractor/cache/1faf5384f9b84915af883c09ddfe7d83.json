{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/Inequalities/AGhost Notes/ineq_new.pdf","text":"Basic Inequalities 1. Most basic one: For any real number x, we have x2 ≥ 0 with equality if and only if x = 0. This inequality is the mother of almost all inequalities you will ever encounter. Some consequences of this inequality are : (a) a2 + b2 ≥ 2ab for all a, b ∈ R with equality for a = b. (b) a/b + b/a ≥ 2 for all a, b > 0 with equality for a = b. (c) 1 x + 1 y ≥ 4 x+y for all x, y > 0 with equality for x = y. (d) 2(a2 + b2) = (a + b)2 + (a − b) 2 ≥ (a + b) 2 for all a, b ∈ R. Equality holds for a = b. (e) a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca for all a, b, c ∈ R with equality for a = b = c. This inequality is tremendously useful. We can rewrite this as 3(a2 + b2 + c2) ≥ (a + b + c) 2 ≥ 3(ab + bc + ca) (1) (f) a3 + b3 + c3 − 3abc = (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2 − ab − bc − ca) ≥ 0 for all a, b, c such that a + b + c ≥ 0. (Can you tell the equality cases ? Hint. Equality holds for a = b = 1, c = −2. So a = b = c is not the only possibility!) Let us look at some examples now. 1.1. Prove that, a4 + b4 + c4 ≥ abc(a + b + c) for all a, b, c ∈ R. Solution: Using x2 + y2 + z2 ≥ xy + yz + zx twice, we get a4 + b4 + c4 ≥ (ab) 2 + (bc) 2 + (ca) 2 ≥ ab · bc + bc · ca + ca · ab = abc(a + b + c). 1.2. For a, b, c ≥ 1 prove that, abc + 1/a + 1/b + 1/c ≥ a + b + c + 1/abc. Solution: The given inequality is equivalent to (a − 1 b )(b − 1 c )( c − 1 a ) ≥ 0, Which is true because ab ≥ 1, bc ≥ 1, ca ≥ 1. 1.3. For a, b, c, d ∈ R, such that, a + b > 0, c + d > 0. Prove that, ab a + b + cd c + d ≤ (a + c)(b + d) a + b + c + d . Solution: It is equivalent to (multiplying both sides with a + b + c + d) ab + ab(c + d) a + b + cd(a + b) c + d + cd ≤ (a + c)(b + d) = ab + ad + bc + cd or, ab(c + d) 2 + cd(a + b)2 ≤ (ad + bc)(a + b)(c + d) or, ab(c2 + d2) + cd(a2 + b2) + 4abcd ≤ (ad + bc)(ac + bd) + (ad + bc) 2 or, 4abcd ≤ (ad + bc) 2 or, 0 ≤ (ad − bc) 2. Try out these yourself: 1.4. Let a, b, c, d be real numbers satisfying a + d = b + c. Then Prove that, (a − b)(c − d) + (a − c)(b − d) ≥ (a − d)(b − c). 1.5. If m, n ∈ Z+, show that, m n < √ 2 if and only if √2 < m+2n m+n . 1 1.6. For a, b, c ∈ R satisfying a 4 + b4 + c4 + d 4 = 16. Prove that, a5 + b5 + c5 + d5 ≤ 32. Some more examples: 1.7 Let x, y, z ≥ 0. Prove that x2 + xy2 + xyz2 ≥ 4(xyz − 1). Solution: We use a2 + 4 ≥ 4a three times: 4 + x2 + xy2 + xyz2 ≥ 4x + xy2 + xyz2 ≥ 4xy + xyz2 ≥ 4xyz. 1.8. Let x, y, z > 0. Prove that if xyz ≥ xy + yz + zx, then (a) xyz ≥ 3(x + y + z), (b) x + y + z ≥ 9. Solution: We shall use (1) repeatedly. (a) x2y2z2 ≥ (xy + yz + zx)2 ≥ 3xyz(x + y + z), done! (b)*( ∑ cyc xy)2 ≥ 3xyz( ∑ cyc x) ≥ 3 ( ∑ cyc xy)( ∑ cyc x) ⇒ xy + yz + zx ≥ 3(x + y + z) Hence, (x + y + z) 2 ≥ 3(xy + yz + zx) ≥ 9(x + y + z). * Notation: ∑ cyc f (a, b, c) = f (a, b, c) + f (b, c, a) + f (c, a, b). For example, ∑ cyc xy2 = xy2 + yz2 + zx 2, ∑ cyc(x + y) = (x + y) + (y + z) + (z + x) = 2(x + y + z). 1.9. For 0 < a, b, c < 1, prove that, √abc + √(1 − a)(1 − b)(1 − c) < 1. Solution: L.H.S. < √ bc + √ (1 − b)(1 − c) ≤ b + c 2 + 1 − b + 1 − c 2 = 1. 2. AM-GM Inequality: For positive real numbers a1, a2, . . . , an the following inequality holds: a1 + a2 + · · · + an n ≥ (a1a2 . . . an) 1 n (2) with equality if and only if all the ak’s are equal. The LHS and RHS are called re- spectively the arithmetic mean(AM) and geometric mean(GM) of the positive numbers a1, . . . , an. we have not proved (2) in the class, let me give a proof here. Proof. We shall induct on n to show that (2) is true for any n real numbers. Note that (2) is true for n = 1 with equality. But using this we can not prove for n = 2. So our base case for induction is n = 2 and it is implied by 1.(a) above. Now we assume it to be true for n = m (m ≥ 2) and prove for n = m + 1. Let a1, a2, . . . , am+1 be any (m + 1) positive real numbers. Note that both the LHS and RHS of (2) does not change even if we rearrange ak’s, so we may assume a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ am+1 without loss of generality. Now let A = (a1 + a2 + · · · + am+1)/(m + 1) be their AM. Then note that a1 ≤ A ≤ am+1. Hence (a1 − A)(A − am+1) ≥ 0 ⇒ (a1 + am+1 − A)A ≥ a1am+1 (∗) Now we apply AM-GM on the m quantities a2, a3, . . . , am, (a1 + am+1 − A) to get (a2 + a3 + · · · + am + (a1 + am+1 − A) m )m ≥ a2a3 . . . am(a1 + am+1 − A) 2 LHS of last inequality is = (m+1)A−A m = A and RHS ≥ a2 . . . am · a1am+1/A by (*) above. Hence we get A m+1 ≥ a1a2 . . . am+1 which closes our induction. Let us go through some easy examples ﬁrst. 2.1. For a, b, c, d > 0 prove that a/b + b/c + c/d + d/a ≥ 4. Solution: 1 4 (a b + b c + c d + d a ) ≥ ( a b · b c · c d · d a )1/4 = 1. 2.2. If a, b, c > 0 and (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c) = 8, then show that abc ≤ 1. Solution: (1 + a) ≥ 2 √ a, (1 + b) ≥ 2 √b, (1 + c) ≥ 2 √c. Multiply them together and we are done. 2.3. If a, b, c > 0 satisfy that abc = 1, prove that 1 + ab 1 + a + 1 + bc 1 + b + 1 + ac 1 + c ≥ 3. Solution: LHS = 1 + 1/c 1 + a + 1 + 1/a 1 + b + 1 + 1/b 1 + c = 1 c ( 1 + c 1 + a ) + 1 a (1 + a 1 + b ) + 1 b ( 1 + b 1 + c ) Now by AM-GM, last expression is ≥ 3 ( 1 abc)1/3 = 3. Following are some more applications of AM-GM. Carefully note the tricks used in each problem. 2.4. For x, y, z > 1, prove that x2 y − 1 + y2 z − 1 + z2 x − 1 ≥ 12. Solution: x2 y − 1 + y2 z − 1 + z2 x − 1 ≥ 3 3 √ x2 y − 1 · y2 z − 1 · z2 x − 1 = 3 3 √ x2 x − 1 · y2 y − 1 · z2 z − 1 Now, x2 + 4 ≥ 4x ⇒ x2/(x − 1) ≥ 4 (Note here we are using (x − 1) > 0). Do similar for y and z. Hence last expression is ≥ 3 3√4 · 4 · 4 = 12. Equality holds for x = y = z = 2. 2.5. For a, b, c ∈ R+ prove that, bc a + ca b + ab c ≥ a + b + c. Solution: If we apply AM-GM on all three terms on the LHS, then we fail to solve the problem. So we need some other strategy. Indeed, apply AM-GM on any two of them, bc a + ca b ≥ 2c, ca b + ab c ≥ 2a, ab c + bc a ≥ 2b. Now just add them up and the conclusion follows. Do these yourself: (a, b, c, d ∈ R+) (i) a2 b2 + b2 c2 + c2 a2 ≥ a c + b a + c b , (ii) 1 a3 + 1 b3 + 1 c3 + 1 d3 ≥ a + b + c + d abcd 3 2.6. For a, b, c ∈ R + prove that, a b + b c + c a ≥ a + b + c 3√ abc Solution: Here the previous trick (applying AM-GM on two terms out of three) is not helpful. But the RHS is giving us a hint. To bring the cube-root, we need three terms to apply AM-GM, but we can not take all of them at once. So what else can we do? We take one of them twice and another one once: a b + a b + b c ≥ 3 a 3√abc. Adding this with two other similar inequalities, we easily get required inequality. This was an example of ‘Weighted AM-GM’, where the terms are given diﬀerent weights (here 2 and 1). Do yourself: (a, b, c ∈ R +) (i) a b + b c + c a ≥ 3√abc( 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ), (ii) a3 + b3 + c3 ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a 2.7. For a, b, c ∈ R +, prove that a3b + b3c + c3a ≥ abc(a + b + c). Solution: This is even trickier than the last ones. Here we need to couple one term on the LHS with one term on the RHS, as follows: By AM-GM, a3b + abc2 ≥ 2a2bc. Add this with two other similar inequalities and we are done. Alternate Solution: Dividing both sides by abc, the given inequality takes the form a2 c + b2 a + c2 b ≥ a + b + c. This can be obtained by summing up the inequalities a2 c + c ≥ 2a, b2 a + a ≥ 2b, c2 b + b ≥ 2c. 2.8. Let a, b, c ∈ R+ such that a + b + c = 3. Prove that, √a + √b + √ c ≥ ab + bc + ca. Solution: It is diﬃcult to get ab, bc, ca by applying AM-GM on √ a, √ b etc. So we try to rewrite the RHS in some other way. Indeed, we can write it as 2(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c) 2 − (a2 + b2 + c2) = 9 − (a2 + b2 + c2). Now we need to show, 2(√ a + √ b + √ c) ≥ 9 − (a2 + b2 + c2). This can be done by AM-GM, as follows: a2 + √a + √a ≥ 3a. Sum this up with similar inequalities for b and c and we are done. 2.9. For a, b, c, d ∈ R + prove that, a + b + c + d 4 ≥ 3 √ abc + bcd + cda + dab 4 . Solution: We use 4xy ≤ (x + y) 2 several times: 4 16(abc + bcd + cda + dab) = 4(4ab(c + d) + 4cd(a + b)) ≤ 4(a + b) 2(c + d) + 4(c + d) 2(a + b) = 4(a + b)(c + d)(a + b + c + d) ≤ (a + b + c + d) 3. Hence, 3 √abc + bcd + cda + dab 4 ≤ a + b + c + d 4 . ▲ While applying AM-GM, you should carefully note the equality cases. The following example illustrates this. 2.10. Let x, y, z ∈ R + such that xyz = 1. Prove that, x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) + y3 (1 + z)(1 + x) + z3 (1 + x)(1 + y) ≥ 3 4. Solution: If we apply AM-GM in this way: x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) + (1 + y) + (1 + z) ≥ 3x ⇒ ∑ cyc x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) ≥ x + y + z − 6, then we clearly fail to prove what we want. How to repair it? Note that, for x = y = z = 1, equality holds. And in that case, the x3 (1+y)(1+z) terms equal to 1/4, whereas 1 + y = 1 + z = 2. So, in order to make the last two terms equal to 1/4, we should do like this: x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) + 1 + y 8 + 1 + z 8 ≥ 3x 4 ⇒ ∑ cyc x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) ≥ x + y + z 2 − 3 4 ≥ 3 4 . where the last inequality is due to x + y + z ≥ 3 3√xyz = 3. Moral of the story: always apply AM-GM in a way that equality occurs. 3. AM-HM Inequality: Let a1, . . . , an be positive real numbers. If we apply AM-GM inequality on 1/a1, 1/a2, . . . , 1/an then we get (after some manipulations) (a1a2 . . . an) 1/n ≥ n 1/a1 + 1/a2 + · · · + 1/an (3) The last expression is called harmonic mean(HM)1 of the numbers a1, . . . , an and the inequality (3) is called GM-HM inequality. Since it is same as just AM ≥ GM, it is hardly used in this name. However, the inequalities (2) and (3) combine to give AM ≥ GM ≥ HM for any n positive reals with equality if and only if all the numbers are equal. This, especially AM ≥ HM is much important. Note that, x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ n 1/x1 + 1/x2 + · · · + 1/xn can be rewritten as (x1 + x2 + · · · + xn)( 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn ) ≥ n 2 (4) We call this AM-HM inequality and it is very similar to C-S inequality (see next section). 1Note that HM is nothing but the reciprocal of the AM of the reciprocals. 5 3.1. For a, b, c > 0, prove that a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ≥ 3 2 . Solution: By AM-HM inequality, ((b + c) + (c + a) + (a + b) )( 1 b + c + 1 c + a + 1 a + b ) ≥ 3 2 ⇒ a + b + c b + c + a + b + c c + a + a + b + c a + b ≥ 9 2 ⇒ a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ≥ 9 2 − 3 = 3 2 . 3.2. Let a, b, c be side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that, 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≤ 1 b + c − a + 1 c + a − b + 1 a + b − c . Solution: By AM≥HM, 1 b + c − a + 1 c + a − b ≥ 4 b + c − a + c + a − b = 2 c Similarly we can obtain 1 c + a − b + 1 a + b − c ≥ 2 a, 1 a + b − c + 1 b + c − a ≥ 2 b . Adding these together will give us the required inequality. 3.3. For a1, . . . , an > 0 with a1 + · · · + an = s prove that a1 s − a1 + a2 s − a2 + · · · + an s − an ≥ n n − 1. Solution: If we add 1 to each term on the LHS, we get LHS + n = s s − a1 + s s − a2 + · · · + s s − an Now, we can use AM ≥ HM to get 2 1 s − a1 + 1 s − a2 + · · · + 1 s − an ≥ n2 s − a1 + s − a2 + · · · + s − an = n 2 ns − s Therefore, LHS = s s − a1 + s s − a2 + · · · + s s − an − n ≥ n2s (n − 1)s − n = n n − 1. 3.4. For a, b, c > 0 show that, ab a + b + 2c + bc b + c + 2a + ca c + a + 2b ≤ a + b + c 4 . Solution: 1 a + b + 2c = 1 (a + c) + (b + c) ≤ 1 4 ( 1 a + c + 1 b + c ), last inequality due to HM≤AM. Hence, we obtain ∑ cyc ab a + b + 2c ≤ ∑ cyc ab 4 ( 1 a + c + 1 b + c ) = 1 4 ( ab + cb a + c + ba + ca b + c + bc + ac a + b ) = b + a + c 4 . 2you can also call this ‘Using Titu’s Lemma’ ; see section 5 below. 6 3.5. Let a, b, c ∈ R +. Prove the inequalities 9abc 2(a + b + c) ≤ ab2 a + b + bc2 b + c + ca2 c + a ≤ a2 + b2 + c2 2 . Solution: Using HM ≤ AM, ab2 a + b = 1 1/b2 + 1/ab ≤ 1 4 (b2 + ab). Hence, ∑ cyc ab2 a + b = ∑ cyc 1 1/b2 + 1/ab ≤ 1 4 ∑ cyc (b2 + ab) ≤ 1 2(a2 + b2 + c2), last inequality due to ab + bc + ca ≤ a2 + b2 + c2. Next, ab2 a + b + bc2 b + c + ca 2 c + a AM −GM ≥ 3abc 3√ (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) Again, by AM-GM, 3√ (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≤ (a+b)+(b+c)+(c+a) 3 = 2(a + b + c)/3. Hence we get ab2 a + b + bc2 b + c + ca2 c + a ≥ 3abc 2(a + b + c)/3. 4. Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality For two pairs of n real numbers, a1, . . . , an and b1, . . . , bn (not necessarily +ve) we have (a2 1 + · · · + a 2 n)(b2 1 + · · · + b2 n) ≥ (a1b1 + · · · + anbn) 2 with equality if either bk = 0 for each k = 1, . . . , n; or if there is some m ∈ R such that ak = mbk holds for each k = 1, . . . , n. Here are some quick applications of Cauchy- Schwarz (C-S) inequality : (a2 + b2 + c2)(b2 + c2 + a2) ≥ (ab + bc + ca) 2 ⇒ a 2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca. (bc a + ca b + ab c )( ca b + ab c + bc a ) ≥ (c + a + b)2 ⇒ bc a + ca b + ab c ≥ a + b + c. ( a2 b2 + b2 c2 + c2 a2 )( b2 c2 + c2 a2 + a2 b2 ) ≥ ( a c + b a + c b )2 ⇒ a2 b2 + b2 c2 + c2 a2 ≥ a c + b a + c b . A proof of C-S inequality: Let A = a2 1 + · · · + a2 n and B = b2 1 + · · · + b2 n. If A = 0 or B = 0 then the inequality is trivial. Else, we have for each k = 1, . . . , n, a2 k A + b2 k B AM −GM ≥ 2akbk√ AB We sum up such inequalities for k = 1, . . . , n we get a2 1 + · · · + a2 n A + b2 1 + · · · + b2 n B ≥ 2(a1b1 + · · · + anbn) √ AB The LHS is simply 2. Hence we get √AB ≥ (a1b1 + · · · + anbn), as required. Here equality holds if ak/A = bk/B holds for each k = 1, . . . , n. 7 Now look at some examples below. 4.1. (a) Find the maximum value of 2x + 5y + 4z where x, y, z are real numbers (not necessarily positive) satisfying x2 + 5y2 + z2 = 1. (b) Find the minimum value of 2x2 + 3y2 + 6z2 where x, y, z are real numbers (not necessarily positive) satisfying x + y + z = 7. Solution: (a) Using C-S inequality, (x2 + (√ 5y) 2 + z2)(2 2 + (√ 5)2 + 42) ≥ (2x + 5y + 4z) 2 This gives 2x + 5y + 4z ≤ 5. (b) Using C-S inequality, we get (2x2 + 3y2 + 6z2)( 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 ) ≥ (x + y + z)2 which gives 2x2 + 3y2 + 6z2 ≥ 7. 4.2. For x, y, z ∈ R, show that, ( x 2 + y 3 + z 6 )2 ≤ ( x2 2 + y2 3 + z2 6 ) Solution: By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ( x 2 + y 3 + z 6 )2 ≤ ( x2 2 + y2 3 + z2 6 )( 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 ) 4.3. For any θ ∈ R ﬁnd minimum and maximum value of 3 sin θ + 4 cos θ. Solution: By C-S inequality, (3 sin θ + 4 cos θ) 2 ≤ (3 2 + 42)(sin 2 θ + cos2 θ) = 5 2. This gives −5 ≤ 3 sin θ+4 cos θ ≤ 5. And equality holds in both sides, e.g. 3 sin θ+4 cos θ = 5 holds for θ = sin −1 3 5 and 3 sin θ + 4 cos θ = (−5) holds for θ = π + sin−1 3 5. 4.4. Suppose P (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn with ak ≥ 0 for each k = 0, 1, . . . , n. Show that if P (x)P (1/x) ≥ 1 holds for x = 1 then it holds for every non-zero x ∈ R. (x ̸= 0 of course!) Solution: Let P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0. It is given that P (1)P ( 1 1) = P (1) 2 ≥ 1. Now, by cauchy-schwarz inequality, P (x)P ( 1 x ) = (anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0)(an 1 xn + an−1 1 xn−1 + · · · + a1 1 x + a0) ≥ (an + an−1 + · · · + a1 + a0)2 = P (1) 2 ≥ 1. 4.5. For x, y, z ≥ 0, prove that, √ x(3x + y) + √y(3y + z) + √ z(3z + x) ≤ 2(x + y + z). Solution: By Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (√ x(3x + y)+ √ y(3y + z)+ √ z(3z + x) )2 ≤ (x+y+z)(3x+y+3y+z+3z+x) = 4(x+y+z) 2. 8 4.6. Suppose x, y, z > 1 satisfy 1 x + 1 y + 1 z = 2. Prove that, √x + y + z ≥ √x − 1 + √ y − 1 + √ z − 1. Solution: 1 x + 1 y + 1 z = 2 ⇒ x − 1 x + y − 1 y + z − 1 z = 1. Then, x + y + z = ∑ cyc x · ∑ cyc ( x − 1 x ) C−S ≥ ( ∑ cyc √ x − 1 )2. 4.7. Let a, b, c ∈ R+ such that, 1 a+b+1 + 1 b+c+1 + 1 c+a+1 ≥ 1. Prove that, a + b + c ≥ ab + bc + ca. Solution: This problem is special in appearance, because given condition looks heavier than what to prove! Anyways, see how we can approach it: By CS inequality, (a + b + 1)(a + b + c2) ≥ (a + b + c) 2 Hence, 1 ≤ 1 a + b + 1 + 1 b + c + 1 + 1 c + a + 1 ≤ ∑ cyc a + b + c2 (a + b + c)2 = 2(a + b + c) + a2 + b2 + c2 (a + b + c)2 Hence (a + b + c)2 ≤ 2(a + b + c) + (a2 + b2 + c2) ⇒ ab + bc + ca ≤ a + b + c. 4.8. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers with abc = 1. Prove that, a a + b4 + c4 + b b + c4 + a4 + c c + a4 + b4 ≤ 1. Solution: (a + b4 + c4)(a3 + 1 + 1) C−S ≥ (a2 + b2 + c2)2 gives ∑ cyc a a + b4 + c4 ≤ a4 + b4 + c4 + 2(a + b + c) (a2 + b2 + c2)2 = a4 + b4 + c4 + 2abc(a + b + c) (a2 + b2 + c2)2 ≤ 1, Since a2b2 + b2c2 + c2a2 ≥ abc(a + b + c). (By C-S or AM-GM.) 5. Titu’s Lemma This is a modiﬁcation of C-S inequality, namely the following : a2 1 b1 + a2 2 b2 + · · · + a2 n bn ≥ (a1 + a2 + · · · + an)2 b1 + b2 + · · · + bn . Where bk’s are positive real numbers and ak’s are any real numbers. Here equality holds iﬀ for some m, ak = mbk holds for each k. This form of C-S inequality is more useful in certain type of problems, as seen below: 5.1. For a, b, c, d > 0 prove that 1 a + 1 b + 4 c + 16 d ≥ 64 a + b + c + d. Solution: Using Titu’s lemma, 1 2 a + 1 2 b + 2 2 c + 4 2 d ≥ (1 + 1 + 2 + 4)2 a + b + c + d . 9 5.2. For positive real numbers a, b, c prove that a 2 + b2 b + c + b2 + c2 c + a + c2 + a2 a + b ≥ a + b + c. Solution: By Titu’s lemma, a2 b + c + b2 c + a + c2 a + b ≥ (a + b + c)2 2(a + b + c) = a + b + c 2 and, b2 b + c + c2 c + a + a2 a + b ≥ (b + c + a) 2 2(a + b + c) = a + b + c 2 . Now just add this two together and we are done. 5.3. Suppose a, b, c > −1 are real numbers such that a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove that, 1 1 + ab + 1 1 + bc + 1 1 + ca ≥ 3 2 . Solution: 1 1 + ab + 1 1 + bc + 1 1 + ca T itu ≥ 9 3 + ∑ ab ≥ 9 3 + ∑ a2 = 3 2. 5.4. For positive reals a, b, c with abc = 1, show that, (a + b − 1) 2 c + (b + c − 1) 2 a + (c + a − 1)2 b ≥ a + b + c. Solution: Its easy to get that a + b + c ≥ 3. Hence, ∑ cyc (a + b − 1) 2 c T itu ≥ (2(a + b + c) − 3 )2 (a + b + c) ≥ (a + b + c) 2 (a + b + c) = (a + b + c). 5.5. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers. Prove that, a b + 2c + b c + 2a + c a + 2b ≥ 1. Solution: ∑ cyc a b + 2c = ∑ cyc a2 ab + 2ca T itu ≥ (a + b + c) 2 3(ab + bc + ca) ≥ 1. 5.6. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive real numbers with sum 1. Prove that, a1 2 − a1 + a2 2 − a2 + · · · + an 2 − an ≥ n 2n − 1. Solution: We apply Titu’s lemma to obtain LHS = a2 1 2a1 − a2 1 + a2 2 2a2 − a2 2 + · · · + a2 n 2an − a2 n ≥ (a1 + · · · + an)2 2(a1 + · · · + an) − (a2 1 + · · · + a2 n). Since a1 + · · · + an = 1, so we get LHS ≥ 1 2 − (a2 1 + · · · + a2 n). Again, by Titu’s lemma, a2 1 1 + · · · + a2 n 1 ≥ (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) 2 1 + 1 · · · + 1(n times) = 1 n (∗) 10 Hence LHS ≥ 1 2 − (a2 1 + · · · + a2 n) ≥ 1 2 − 1/n = n 2n − 1 , as required. A note. The inequality marked (*) is important. We restate it as follows. RMS-AM Inequality: For any a1, . . . , an ∈ R, we have √ a2 1 + · · · + a2 n n ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n (5) with equality if and only if a1 = a2 = · · · = an. 5.7. For a, b, c > 0 prove that, a a + 2b + 3c + b b + 2c + 3a + c c + 2a + 3b ≥ 1 2. Solution: It is similar to question 5.5. above. LHS = a2 a2 + 2ab + 3ca + b2 b2 + 2bc + 3ab + c2 c2 + 2ca + 3bc ≥ (a + b + c) 2 ∑ cyc(a2 + 2ab + 3ca) So all we need to show now is (a + b + c) 2 ∑ cyc(a2 + 2ab + 3ca) ≥ 1 2 ⇐⇒ 2(a + b + c)2 ≥ (a + b + c)2 + 3(ca + ab + bc) which follows from (a + b + c) 2 ≥ 3(ab + bc + ca). 5.8. Suppose a, b, c, d > 0 satisfy (a2 + b2)3 = (c2 + d2). Prove that, a3/c + b3/d ≥ 1. Solution: a4 ac + b4 bd ≥ (a2 + b2) 2 ac + bd and (ac + bd) 2 ≤ (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2) = (a2 + b2) 4. 5.9. For a, b, c > 0 prove that a3 + 5b3 3a + b + b3 + 5c3 3b + c + c3 + 5a3 3c + a ≥ 3 2 (a2 + b2 + c2). Solution: We use Titu’s Lemma and ∑ ab ≤ ∑ a2 to obtain ∑ cyc a3 3a + b = ∑ cyc (a2) 2 3a2 + ab T itu ≥ (a2 + b2 + c2)2 3 ∑ a2 + ∑ ab = ( ∑ a2) 2 4 ∑ a2 = 1 4 ∑ a2 and, ∑ cyc b3 3a + b = ∑ cyc (b2) 2 3ab + b2 T itu ≥ (a2 + b2 + c2)2 ∑ a2 + 3 ∑ ab = ( ∑ a2) 2 4 ∑ a2 = 1 4 ∑ a2 Hence, ∑ cyc a3 + 5b3 3a + b ≥ 1 4 ∑ cyc a2 + 5 4 ∑ cyc a2 = 3 2 (a2 + b2 + c2). 11 6. Diﬀerence Technique This is a simple but amazing technique. In some situations, where direct AM-GM/C-S inequality does not work, but just a little trick makes the solution magically feasible. Take the following problem as an example. 6.1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers with a + b + c = 3. Prove that, a 1 + b2 + b 1 + c2 + c 1 + a2 ≥ 3 2. Solution: a 1 + b2 + b 1 + c2 + c 1 + a2 AM −GM ≤ a 2b + b 2c + c 2a ≥ 3 2 ∗ No conclusion! ∗ So simply applying AM-GM does not work here. However we can do like this: ∑ cyc a 1 + b2 = ∑ cyc a − ab2 1 + b2 ≥ ∑ cyc a − ab2 2b = 3 − ab + bc + ca 2 . And ab + bc + ca ≤ (a+b+c)2 3 = 3. Hence L.H.S≥ 3 − 3/2 = 3/2−Done! So, just writing a 1+b2 = a − ab2 1+b2 , our solution is done−quite magically! This is how this method works−we write each term as a diﬀerence of two terms and then apply AM-GM/C-S. 6.2. Suppose x, y, z > 1 satisfy 1 x + 1 y + 1 z = 2. Prove that, √x + y + z ≥ √x − 1 + √ y − 1 + √ z − 1. Solution: Substitute √ x − 1 = a etc. so that x = a2 + 1, y = b2 + 1, z = c2 + 1. So we have to show √ 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ a + b + c. Now, 2 = ∑ cyc 1 a2 + 1 T itu ≥ 9 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 ⇒ √ 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ 3 √ 2 . So we have to show 3√2 ≥ a+b+c. However, a2 +b2 +c2 ≥ 9 2 −3 = 3 2 ⇒ 3(a2 +b2 +c2) ≥ 9 2 and 3(a2 + b2 + c2) ≥ (a + b + c)2 does not imply (a + b + c) 2 ≤ 9 2. Hence we proceed with the ‘diﬀrenence’ approach : 2 = ∑ cyc 1 a2 + 1 = ∑ cyc (1 − a2 a2 + 1 ) ⇒ 1 = ∑ cyc a2 a2 + 1 ≥ (a + b + c) 2 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 Thus we get 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ (a + b + c) 2 ⇒ √ 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ (a + b + c), as required! 6.3. Let a, b, c ∈ R+ with a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove that, 1 a3 + 2 + 1 b3 + 2 + 1 c3 + 2 ≥ 1. Solution: ∑ cyc 1 a3 + 2 = 1 2 ∑ cyc ( 1 − a3 a3 + 1 + 1 ) ≥ 1 2 ∑ cyc (1 − a 3 3a ) = 1. 12 6.4. Let a, b, c ∈ R+. Prove that, 2a √ 3a + b + 2b √3b + c + 2c √3c + a ≤ √ 3(a + b + c). Solution:[ ∑ cyc a √ 3a + b ]2 C−S ≤ ∑ cyc a · ∑ cyc a 3a + b ≤ 3 4 ∑ cyc a ⇐⇒ ∑ cyc a 3a + b ≤ 3 4. And, ∑ cyc 3a 3a + b = 3 − ∑ cyc b2 3ab + b2 T itu ≤ 3 − (a + b + c) 2 3 ∑ ab + ∑ b2 ≤ 3 − 3 4 = 9 4 . 7. Rearrangement Inequality The rearrangement inequality is a remarkable inequality, although it is hardly used. Given two sequences of real numbers, namely a1, a2, . . . an and b1, b2, . . . , bn, it says that the sum a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn will be maximum when the sequences are similarly ordered and minimum when the sequences are oppositely ordered. This inequality can be used to prove Nesbitt’s inequality, Tchebyshev’s inequality, C-S inequality (try it). The following examples illustrate use of this inequality in olympiad problems. 7.1. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be distinct positive integers. Find the minimum value of : x1 12 + x2 22 + · · · + xn n2 . Solution: Let (y1, y2, . . . , yn) be the permutation of (x1, x2, . . . , xn) such that y1 < y2 < · · · < yn. Clearly, y1 ≥ 1 . y2 > y1 ⇒ y2 ≥ 2. Inductively one can get yk ≥ k for all k = 1, 2, . . . , n. Now, note that the sequences (y1, y2, . . . , yn) and (1, 1 22 , . . . , 1 n2 ) are oppositely ordered. Hence, by Rearrangement inequality, x1 12 + x2 22 + · · · + xn n2 ≥ y1 12 + y2 22 + · · · + yn n2 ≥ 1 12 + 2 22 + · · · + n n2 = 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n. Equality occurs when xk = k for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n. (Since equality occurs, so it is indeed the minimum value.) 7.2. Suppose a, b, c are side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that, a2(b + c − a) + b2(c + a − b) + c2(a + b − c) ≤ 3abc. Solution: First note that, a(b + c − a) ≤ b(c + a − b) ⇐⇒ 0 ≤ (a − b)(a + b − c) ⇐⇒ a ≤ b. Thus, a(b + c − a), b(c + a − b), c(a + b − c) and a, b, c are ordered oppositely. Hence, ∑ cyc a2(b + c − a) ≤ ∑ cyc b · a(b + c − a), ∑ cyc a2(b + c − a) ≤ ∑ cyc c · a(b + c − a) Just adding these two inequalities and collecting terms on the RHS, 2 ∑ cyc a2(b + c − a) ≤ ∑ cyc ba(b + c − a + c + a − b) = 6abc. Done! 13 7.3. Let a, b, c be side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that, a2b(a − b) + b2c(b − c) + c2a(c − a) ≥ 0. Solution: From last solution, we see that, a(b + c − a), b(c + a − b), c(a + b − c) and a, b, c are oppositely ordered. (and so the ﬁrst three are similarly ordered as 1/a, 1/b, 1/c. ∑ cyc 1 a · a(b + c − a) ≥ ∑ cyc 1 c · a(b + c − a) ⇒ a + b + c ≥ a + b + c + a(b − a) c + b(c − b) a + c(a − c) b ⇒ a2b(a − b) + b2c(b − c) + c2a(c − a) ≥ 0. 7.4. Let x, y, z be real numbers, each greater than 1. Prove that x + 1 y + 1 + y + 1 z + 1 + z + 1 x + 1 ≤ x − 1 y − 1 + y − 1 z − 1 + z − 1 x − 1. Solution: RHS-LHS is sum of terms like x−1 y−1 − x+1 y+1 = 2(x−y) y2−1 , so it suﬃces to show that x x2 − 1 + y y2 − 1 + z z2 − 1 ≤ x y2 − 1 + y z2 − 1 + z x2 − 1 which follows from rearrangement inequality as x, y, z and 1 x2−1, 1 y2−1, 1 z2−1 are oppositely sorted. 8. Weighted AM-GM The weighted form of AM-GM is given by using weighted averages. For example, the weighted arithmetic mean of a and b with ratio 2 : 1 is 2a+b 2+1 and the geometric is 2+1√ a2b. The weighted AM-GM Inequality states that if a1, a2, . . . , an are non-negative real numbers, and λ1, λ2, . . . , λn are non-negative real numbers with sum of the weights, λ1 + · · · + λn = 1, then λ1a1 + λ2a2 + · · · + λnan ≥ aλ1 1 aλ2 2 . . . a λn n . Equality holds if and only if ai = aj for all integers i, j such that λi ̸= 0 and λj ̸= 0. We obtain the unweighted form of AM-GM by setting λ1 = λ2 = · · · = λn = 1/n. Following are some examples that illustrate use of weighted AM-GM. 8.1. For positive reals a, b, c, prove that, a8 + b8 + c8 a3b3c3 ≥ 1 a + 1 b + 1 c . Solution: ∑ cyc (2a8 + 3b8 + 3c8 8 ) ≥ ∑ cyc 8a2b3c3 ⇒ a 8 + b8 + c8 ≥ a3b3c3( 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ). 8.2. If a, b, c are positive real numbers such that abc = 1, prove that ab+cbc+aca+b ≤ 1. 14 Solution: a + b + c 3 ≥ 3√abc = abc ⇒ 1 ≥ 3abc a + b + c Now, by weighted AM-GM, (a, b, c as weights) a+b+c√ (ab)c(bc)a(ab)c ≤ c · ab + a · bc + b · ca a + b + c ≤ 1. Hence, ab+cbc+aca+b = (ab)c(bc) a(ab) c ≤ 1. 8.3. For a ﬁxed positive integer n, ﬁnd the minimum value of the sum x1 + x2 2 2 + x3 3 3 + · · · + xn n n given that x1, x2, . . . , xn are positive numbers satisfying that the sum of their reciprocals is n. Solution 1: By weighted AM-GM with 1 and k − 1 as weights, 1 · xk k + (k − 1) · 1 ≥ kxk ⇒ xk k + 1 − 1 k ≥ xk Summing up such inequalities for k = 1, 2, . . . , n we get n∑ k=1 xk k k + n − n∑ k=1 1 k ≥ n∑ k=1 xk AM −HM ≥ n2 ∑ 1/xk = n. Hence, x1 + x2 2 2 + x3 3 3 + · · · + xn n n ≥ 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n. With equality when x1 = x2 = · · · = xn = 1. Solution 2: Let Hn = 1 + 1/2 + · · · + 1/n. Takng 1 k as the weight for xk, we get n∑ k=1 1 k · xk k ≥ Hn(x1x2 . . . xn) 1/Hn And we have n√ x1x2 . . . xn ≥ n ∑n k=1 1/xk = 1 ⇒ x1x2 . . . xn ≥ 1. Combining the above two inequalities, we get n∑ k=1 1 k · xk k ≥ Hn. 8.4. If a, b, c > 0, prove that, (aabbcc) 1 a+b+c ≥ 3√ abc. Solution: Suppose (aabbcc) 1 a+b+c < 3√abc. Then, 15 3 = a 1 a + b 1 b + c1 c ≥ (a + b + c) ( 1 aabbcc ) 1 a+b+c > (a + b + c) 1 3√abc ≥ 3 Thus we reached at 3 > 3, a contradiction! 8.5. If a, b, c > 0 with abc = 1, then show that, a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ a + b + c. Solution: First we use abc = 1 to make each term of same degree (two) : a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ (abc)1/3(a + b + c). This inequality can be proven by summing up inequalities like 2 3 a2 + 1 6b2 + 1 6c2 ≥ (abc)1/3a. 9. An Useful Identity The identity (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) − xyz is often useful, and along with 1 9(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) AM −GM ≥ xyz, it produces another useful inequality (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) ≥ 8 9(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) ⋆ The inequality (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) ≥ 8xyz is very well-known, but the following identity is more precise: (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 8xyz + x(y − z) 2 + y(z − x) 2 + z(x − y)2 = x(y + z) 2 + y(z + x) 2 + z(x + y)2 − 4xyz 9.1. Let x, y, z be positive reals satisfying (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = 1. Prove that xy + yz + zx ≤ 3/4. Solution: x + y + z = x + y 2 + y + z 2 + z + x 2 ≥ 3 3 √ (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) 8 = 3 2. And, xyz ≤ (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) 8 = 1 8 So, 1 = (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) − xyz ≥ 3 2(xy + yz + zx) − 1 8 ⇒ xy + yz + zx ≤ 3 4. 9.2. For a, b, c > 0, prove that, 3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≥ 8(a + b + c)(abc) 2/3. Solution: (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≥ 8 9(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) AM −GM ≥ 8 3 (a + b + c)(abc) 2/3. 16 9.3. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers. Prove that, a + b + c 3 ≤ 1 4 3 √(a + b)2(b + c)2(c + a)2 abc . Solution: (a + b) 2(b + c) 2(c + a) 2 ≥ ( 8 9(a + b + c) )2(ab + bc + ca) 2 ≥ ( 8 9(a + b + c) )23abc(a + b + c) = abc[4(a + b + c) 3 ]3. 9.4. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers. Prove that, (x + yz x )(y + zx y )(z + xy z ) ≥ 2(xyz + y2z + z2x + x2y). Solution: Dividing both sides by xyz the given inequality transforms into ( x2 + yz zx )( y2 + zx xy )( z2 + xy yz ) ≥ 2(1 + y x + z y + x z ). Now substitute a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. Then the inequality is equivalent to (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≥ 2(1 + ab + bc + ca) ⇐⇒ (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) − 1 ≥ 2(1 + ab + bc + ca) ⇐⇒ (a + b + c − 2)(ab + bc + ca) ≥ 3. This follows from a + b + c ≥ 3 and ab + bc + ca ≥ 3. More Challenging Problems: Here are some more problems, for those who are interested. Some of these problems are really amazing. Try out as many as you can. 1. If a, b, c, d > 0, then show that at least one of the following inequalities is wrong: a + b < c + d, (a + b)(c + d) < ab + cd, (a + b)cd < ab(c + d). 2. For any n ∈ N, prove that, 1 2 ≤ 1 n + 1 + 1 n + 2 + · · · + 1 2n ≤ 3 4 . 3. Let a, b, c, d ∈ R + such that abcd = 1. Prove that, 1 a + b + 2 + 1 b + c + 2 + 1 c + d + 2 + 1 d + a + 2 ≤ 1. 4. Let a, b, c, d ∈ R + such that abcd = 1. Prove that, a4(1 + a) + b4(1 + b) + c4(1 + c) + d4(1 + d) ≥ 1 2 (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c)(1 + d). 17 5. For a, b, c > 0, prove that, (i) a b + b c + c a + 3 3√abc a + b + c ≥ 4, (ii) a b + b c + c a + 3x 3√abc a + b + c ≥ 3 + x, where 3 ≥ x. 6.

Prove that, (A 2 − a2 1 − a2 2 − · · · − a2 n)(B2 − b2 1 − b2 2 − · · · − b2 n) ≤ (AB − a1b1 − a2b2 − · · · − anbn)2 8. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers.

For a, b, c ≥ 1, prove that √a − 1 + √b − 1 + √c − 1 ≤ √ a(bc + 1). 10. For a, b, c > 0 prove that, 1 a(b + 1) + 1 b(c + 1) + 1 c(a + 1) ≥ 3 1 + abc. 11.

Suppose a, b, c, d ∈ R+ such that abcd = 1 and a + b + c + d > a b + b c + c d + d a. Prove that, a + b + c + d < b a + c b + d c + a d . Solutions Please read the solutions only after you are completely exhausted. While reading the solution, always ask yourself “Why did I fail?”. Even if you have solved a problem, I recommend that go through the solution below, it may contain some important idea. 1. Assume that all of them are true. Multiplying the ﬁrst two, we get ab + cd > (a + b) 2 ≥ 4ab ⇒ cd ≥ 3ab . . . (1). Multiplying the last two, we get ab(ab + cd) > cd(a + b) 2 ≥ cd · 4ab ⇒ ab > 3cd . . . (2). Adding (1) and (2) we get ab + cd > 3(ab + cd)−not possible for a, b, c, d > 0. 2. One side is easier: 1 n + 1 + 1 n + 2 + · · · + 1 2n ≥ 1 n + n + 1 n + n + · · · + 1 2n = n 2n . The other side is little trickier: 1 n + 1 n + 1 + 1 n + 2 + · · · + 1 2n = 1 2 [( 1 n + 1 2n ) + ( 1 n + 1 + 1 2n − 1 ) + · · · + ( 1 2n + 1 n )] = 3n 2 [ 1 2n2 + 1 2n2 + (n − 1) + · · · + 1 2n2 ] ≤ 3n 2 [(n + 1) 1 2n2 ] = 3 4 + 1 n . 19 3. Using x + y ≥ 2 √xy for x, y > 0, we get 1 a + b + 2 + 1 c + d + 2 ≤ 1 2 √ab + 2 + 1 2 √cd + 2 Now using abcd = 1, 1 2 √ab + 2 + 1 2 √ cd + 2 = 1 2 ( 1 √ab + 1 + √ab 1 + √ab ) = 1 2. And in a similar manner, we can show 1 b + c + 2 + 1 d + a + 2 ≤ 1 2 . 4. The given inequality is equivalent to ∑ cyc a4 (1 + b)(1 + c)(1 + d) ≥ 1 2. This is just similar to example 2.10. above. 5. (a) We have a b + b c + c a ≥ a + b + c 3√abc (already done above). Call a + b + c 3√abc = E. Then we have to show, E + 3/E ≥ 4 ⇐⇒ E2 − 4E + 3 ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ (E − 1)(E − 3) ≥ 0. Now, AM-GM gives E ≥ 3. So clearly we have (E − 1)(E − 3) ≥ 0. part(b) is similar to part(a). 6. ab√ a b (b + c)(c + a) = √a3b(b + c)(c + a) = √ a2(b + c) · ab(c + a) Now, by AM-GM, ∑ cyc √ a2(b + c) · ab(c + a) ≤ 1 2 ( ∑ cyc a2(b + c) + ∑ cyc ab(c + a)) Note that, a2(b + c) + b2(c + a) + c2(a + b) = ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) and hence we are left to show ab(c + a) + bc(a + b) + ca(b + c) ≤ ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a) which reduces to 3abc ≤ ab2 + bc2 + ca2. Last inequality is implied by AM-GM. 7. Let a = a2 1 + · · · + a 2 n and b = b2 1 + · · · + b2 n. If A2 = a or B2 = b then the given inequality holds trivially. So assume now A 2 > a, B2 > b. Then, √(A2 − a)(B2 − b) + a1b1 + · · · + anbn C−S ≤ √ (A2 − a)(B2 − b) + ab C−S ≤ √ (A2 − a + a)(B2 − b + b) = AB. 8. Let us denote A = a2x2 + b2y2 + c2z2, B = b2x2 + c2y2 + a2z2 and C = c2x2 + a2y2 + b2z2. Note that A + B + C = (a2 + b2 + c2)(x2 + y2 + z2) = a2 + b2 + c2. Now, √A + √B + √ C C−S ≤ √ (1 + 1 + 1)(A + B + C) = √3(a2 + b2 + c2). And equality is achieved when x = y = z. So it is indeed the maximum value of the given expression. On the other hand, observe that, AB = (a2x2 + b2y2 + c2z2)(b2x2 + c2y2 + a2z2) C−S ≥ (abx2 + bcy2 + caz2) 2 etc. So that, 20 √AB + √ BC + √CA ≥ (ab + bc + ca)(x2 + y2 + z2) = ab + bc + ca. Hence, (√A + √B + √C)2 = A + B + C + 2(√AB + √BC + √CA ) ≥ a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) = (a + b + c) 2. Again, its easy to check that this minimum is achieved; e.g. when x = 1, y = 0, z = 0. 9. Since most of the inequalities we know are true for non-negative real numbers, so let us denote √a − 1 = x, √b − 1 = y, √ c − 1 = z. Then we have to show (x + y + z) 2 ≤ (x2 + 1)( (y2 + 1)(z2 + 1) + 1 ) This hints at using Cauchy-Schwarz! Indeed, by using C-S inequality, we get that (x + (y + z)) 2 ≤ (x2 + 1)(1 + (y + z)) 2 and (y + z) 2 ≤ (y2 + 1)(1 + z2). Hence done. 10. (1 + abc) ( 1 a(b + 1) + 1 b(c + 1) + 1 c(a + 1) ) + 3 = 1 + abc + ab + a a(b + 1) + 1 + abc + bc + b b(c + 1) + 1 + abc + ca + c c(a + 1) = 1 + a a(b + 1) + b(c + 1) b + 1 + 1 + b b(c + 1) + c(a + 1) c + 1 + 1 + c c(a + 1) + a(b + 1) a + 1 ≥ 6 Last inequality is due to AM-GM for the six members. 11. By AM-GM, √ a3 + 1 = √ (a + 1)(a2 − a + 1) ≤ (a + 1) + (a2 − a + 1) 2 = a2 + 2 2 Hence, 2 a2 + 2 + 2 b2 + 2 + 2 c2 + 2 ≤ 1 √ a3 + 1 + 1 √b3 + 1 + 1 √c3 + 1 ≤ 1. Now, by AM-HM/Titu’s lemma, 2 ∑ cyc 1 a2 + 2 ≥ 2 9 a2 + b2 + c2 + 6 ⇒ a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ 12. 12. Since abc = 1, we can substitute a = y/z, b = z/x, c = x/y where x, y, z are positive reals. In terms of x, y, z the given inequality takes the form (x + y − z)(y + z − x)(z + x − y) ≤ xyz. Let x + y − z = u, y + z − x = v, z + x − y = w. If LHS is negative then it is trivial. And LHS is non-negative if either u, v, w are all non-negative, in which case it becomes 8uvw ≤ (u+v)(v+w)(w+u), an easy appliction of AM-GM. or Exactly two among u, v, w are non-positive, say for instance u ≤ 0, v ≤ 0 and w ≥ 0. But then we observe that, u + v = 2y ≤ 0 and we started with y > 0, so this case can not occur. 21 13. 4(x2 + xy + y2) = 3(x + y) 2 + (x − y) 2 ≥ 3(x + y) 2. Hence, LHS ≥ 3 4 43 (x + y)(y + z)(z + x)] 2 ≥ 3 4 43 · [8 9 (x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx)]2 And last quantity is same as = (x + y + z)2(xy + yz + zx) 2. 14. Diﬀerence technique! ∑ cyc a 1 + b2c = ∑ cyc ( a − ab2c 1 + b2c ) AM −GM ≥ ∑ cyc (a − ab2c 2b√c ) = 4 − ∑ cyc b√a · ac 2 AM −GM ≥ 4 − ∑ cyc b(a + ac) 4 = 4 − 1 4 ∑ cyc ab − 1 4 ∑ cyc abc. Now, we have a + b + c + d = 4. So using AM-GM again, ∑ cyc ab ≤ 1 4 ( ∑ cyc a)2 = 4, ∑ cyc abc ≤ 1 16 ( ∑ cyc a)3 = 4. Hence, LHS ≥ 4 − 1 − 1 = 2. 15. Use (x3 + y3) = 8 − 6xy. So, if t = xy, we need to show t 3(4 − 3t) ≤ 1 where t ≤ 1. 16. Take xk = 1/k and λk = k to apply weigthed AM-GM. You may also do it by weighted GM-HM. 17. This is similar to examples 8.2. and 8.4. 18. This is again similar to examples 8.2. and 8.4. 19. Yes it is little tricky: 1 = 1 a + b + c [ a · 1 a6/7 + b · 1 b6/7 + c · 1 c6/7 ] ≥ ( 1 aabbcc ) 6/7 a+b+c . 20. By weighted AM-GM (with 3 and 1 as weights) 3a + b + c 3 3√abc + 8abc (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≥ 4 ( 8(a + b + c) 3 27(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) )4. And, 8(a + b + c)3 = [(b + c) + (c + a) + (a + b)] 3 AM −GM ≥ 27(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). 21. AM-GM twice! ∑ cyc 1 √a3 + b AM −GM ≤ ∑ cyc 1 √ 2 1 a3/4b1/4 W eighted AM −GM ≤ 1 √ 2 ∑ cyc 1 4 ( 3 a + 1 b ) . 22. By weighted AM-GM, (Using 1 − x and x as weights!) we have 1 1−x( 1 x )x ≤ (1 − x) · 1 + x · 1 x ⇒ 1 xx ≤ 2 − x. 22 23. By weighted AM-GM, (k − 1) 1 k − 1 + ak ≥ k( ak (k − 1)k−1 )k ⇒ (1 + ak) k ≥ kk (k − 1)k−1 · ak So, n∏ k=2 (1 + ak) k ≥ n∏ k=2 kk (k − 1)k−1 · ak = nn · a2a3 . . . an = n n Easy to see that equality does not hold here. 24. Its one of my favourite ones. 3(a + b + c + d) + ( b a + c b + d c + a d ) > 3 ( a b + b c + c d + d a ) + ( b a + c b + d c + a d ) = ∑ cyc ( a b + a b + b c + a d ) ≥ ∑ cyc 4 4 √ a3 bcd = 4(a + b + c + d).
