Also, leave suﬃcient margins, write clearly and rigorously, and do not attempt to fool or confuse the graders. Good luck! 1. Let O be the circumcenter of a convex quadrilateral ABCD. Let W, X, Y, Z be the foot of the perpendicular from O to the segments AB, BC, CD, DA, respectively. If brackets denote area, prove that [ABCD] = [ABZ] + [BCW ] + [CDX] + [DAY ]. 2. Prove that for every natural a, there exist inﬁnitely many naturals n such that 10 na − 1 is composite. 3. Find all ﬁnite sequences of nonnegative integers z0, z1, . . . , zn−1, such that n is a nat- ural, and for any integer i such that 0 ≤ i < n, zi represents the number of integers j such that 0 ≤ j < n and zj = i. One such sequence is 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
