Answer: 8π3 3 Solution: We see that the antiderivative is θ3 3 , so evaluation at the limits gives the answer. 2. Let f (x) = x ln x + x. Solve f ′(x) = 0 for x. Answer: e−2 Solution: By the product rule, f ′(x) = ln x + (x/x) + 1 = 2 + ln x = 0, so x = e−2 . 3. Compute ∫ π/4 0 cos x − 2 sin x sin 2x dx. Answer: √2 6 Solution: There are many ways to do this, but here’s one: notice that cos x − 2 sin x sin(2x) = cos x − 4 sin 2 x cos x = cos x − 4(1 − cos2 x) cos x = 4 cos3 x − 3 cos x = cos 3x, so the antiderivative is 1 3 sin 3x, and we just evaluate at the appropriate endpoints to get √2/6 . Solution: Note that cos x − 2 sin x sin(2x) = cos x − 4 sin 2 x cos x So, ∫ π/4 0 cos x − 4 sin 2 x cos x = sin x − 4/3 sin 3 x | π/4 0 = √2/6 4. Let f0(x) = ( √e)x, and recursively deﬁne fn+1(x) = f ′ n(x) for integers n ≥ 0. Compute∑∞ i=0 fi(1). Answer: 2√e Solution: Rewrite f0(x) as ex/2. Then, we can see by induction that fn(x) = 1 2n ex/2, and hence the inﬁnite sum is a geometric series with ratio 1 2 . To ﬁnish, we evaluate ∞∑ i=0 fi(1) = ∞∑ i=0 1 2i e 1/2 = 2√e 5. Consider the parabola y = ax2 + 2019x + 2019. There exists exactly one circle which is centered on the x-axis and is tangent to the parabola at exactly two points. It turns out that one of these tangent points is (0, 2019). Find a. (Diagram below does not picture the speciﬁed parabola.) SMT 2019 Calculus Test Solutions March 2, 2019 Answer: − 1 4038 Solution: We work with a general parabola ax2 + bx + c with a, b, c ̸= 0. The vertex of the parabola has x-coordinate − b 2a , and we can see that if the circle is to be tangent to the parabola at exactly 2 points, then the circle’s center must be at (− b 2a , 0). Now, notice that the derivative of the parabola at (0, c) is b, so for the circle to be tangent at that point, the line from (− b 2a , 0) to (0, c) must have slope − 1 b . This gives us the equation c b/2a = − 1 b , which simpliﬁes to a = − 1 2c . Lastly, we plug in c = 2019 to get the answer. 6. What is the smallest natural number n for which the limit lim x→0 sin n x cos2 x (1 − cos x)3 exists? Answer: 6 Solution: First, note that the cos2 x in the denominator converges to 1 always and can be ignored. The Taylor series expansions of sin x and 1 − cos x to ﬁrst order are x and x2 2 , respectively. That means that: lim x→0 sin n x cos2 x (1 − cos x)3 = lim x→0 xn (x2/2)3 The limit exists exactly when the exponent of x in the numerator is at least the exponent of x in the denominator, so n must be at least 6 . 7. Turn the graph of y = 1 x by 45◦ counter-clockwise and consider the bowl-like top part of the curve (the part above y = 0). We let a 2D ﬂuid accummulate in this 2D bowl until the maximum depth of the ﬂuid is 2 √2 3 . What’s the area of the ﬂuid used? Answer: 40 9 − 2 ln 3 Solution: Observe that the level surface of the ﬂuid, in the non-rotated system, is given by the line x + y = 2c, for some c > 0. The “depth” of the ﬂuid is then the distance from the point (1, 1) (at the bottom of the rotated graph) to the point (c, c). This distance is 2 √2 3 , so it is clear that c = 5 3 . Thus, the region of ﬂuid is the area bounded by the curves y = 10 3 − x and y = 1 x . Through simple calculation, it is clear that these curves intersect at ( 1 3 , 3) and (3, 1 3 ). Hence, the area of ﬂuid is given by ∫ 3 1 3 10 3 − x − 1 x dx = [ 10 3 x − 1 2 x2 − ln x]3 1 3 = 40 9 − 2 ln 3 8. Compute lim x→∞ ((1 + 1 x )x x − ex) . Answer: − e 2 Solution: Consider the substitution y = 1 x . Then, the limit is lim y→0+ (1 + y)1/y − e y . SMT 2019 Calculus Test Solutions March 2, 2019 If we apply L’Hopital, we get lim y→0+ (1 + y)−1+1/y(y − (1 + y) ln(1 + y)) y2 . Notice that L’Hopital on y−(1+y) ln(1+y) y2 gives − ln(1+y) 2y , and L’Hopital on that gives − 1 2(1+y) , which has limit − 1 2 at y = 0. Now, we claim that the limit of (1 + y)−1+1/y is e. To see this, notice that (1 + y)−1 tends to 1, and (1 + y)1/y is just (1 + 1 x )x, which has limit e as x goes to inﬁnity. Putting these together yields the answer −1/2 × e = −e/2 . Solution: We can rewrite (1 + 1 x )x as ex ln(1+ 1 x ). Then, notice that the Taylor expansion of ln(1+ 1 x ) is x−1 − x−2 2 + x−3 3 −+ . . .. Moreover, the Taylor expansion of ey is 1+y+ y2 2! + y3 3! +. . .. Lastly, note that in the limit, we take x to ∞, i.e. we take 1 x to 0, so low-order terms like x−1 will become irrelevant. Therefore, we see that x ln(1 + 1 x ) is 1 − x−1 2 + x−2 3 − + . . .. Next, xex ln(1+ 1 x ) can be expanded as x + (x − 1 2 ) + 1 2! (x − 2 2 ) + 1 3! (x − 3 2 ) + 1 4! (x − 4 2 ) + . . ., where one should take care as to when low-order terms may be ignored. Moreover, we can expand ex as x + x + x 2! + x 3! + . . ., so the overall limit is just − 1 2 − 1 2! 1 2 − 1 3! 1 2 − . . . = − e 2 . 9. Magic liquid forms a cone whose circular base rests on the ﬂoor. Time is measured in seconds. At time 0, the cone has height and radius 1 cm. Let R(t) be the rate at which liquid evaporates in cm3/s at time t. As the liquid evaporates, the cone’s radius remains the same but its height decreases. Let S(t) be the surface area of the slanted part of the cone in cm2 at time t. If R(t) = S(t)2 (numerically in the speciﬁed units), how many seconds does it take for the liquid to evaporate entirely? Answer: 1 12 Solution: The circumference of the bottom circle is always 2π, and when the cone has height h, the slanted portion can be cut and ﬂattened so that 2π is the length of an arc along the circumference of a circle with radius √h2 + 1, which should have circumference 2π√h2 + 1. Thus, by examining ratios, we see that the surface area of the slanted portion is π√h2 + 1. Denote the cone’s volume by V so that V = 1 3 πh and ∂V ∂t = −R(t) = −S(t)2 = −π2(h2 + 1). By the deﬁnition of V , we also know that ∂V ∂t = π 3 ∂h ∂t . This gives us ∫ dh h2+1 = −3π ∫ dt, which we ﬁnd yields h = tan(C − 3πt). The initial condition is that when t = 0, h is 1, so C = π 4 . Therefore, h is 0 when t is π 4 1 3π = 1 12 . 10. Compute ∫ 2 0 ln(1 + x) x2 − x + 1 dx. Answer: π√3 6 ln 3 Solution: First, we do the substitution u = 1 + x, which gives ∫ 3 1 ln u u2 − 3u + 3 du. Then, the goal is to make a substitution such that we get a very similar integral with slightly diﬀerent integrand. In particular, we want the denominator and the bounds to be the same, SMT 2019 Calculus Test Solutions March 2, 2019 so we do the substitution w = 3 u , which gives − 1 3 ∫ 1 3 1 w2 ln 3 − ln w 9 w2 − 9 w + 1 dw, which simpliﬁes to ∫ 3 1 ln 3 − ln w w2 − 3w + 3 dw. Taking the average of these two u and w forms of writing the integral, we see that we need to calculate 1 2 ∫ 3 1 ln 3 w2 − 3w + 3 dw. Converting back to x and simplifying, we get ln 3 2 ∫ 2 0 1 (x − 1 2 )2 + 3 4 dx. This suggests that we make the trig subsitution 2x − 1 = √3 tan θ, which gives us ln 3 2 ∫ π/3 −π/6 1 3 4 (tan2 θ + 1) · ( √3 2 sec2 θ ) dθ Plugging in the identity tan2 θ + 1 = sec2 θ and cancelling, we ﬁnally compute ln 3 2 · π 2 · 4 3 · √3 2 = π√3 6 ln 3 .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
