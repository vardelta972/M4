Suppose the angle bisector of ∠ADC is tangent to the circumcircle of triangle ABD at D. Prove that ∠A = 90 ◦. Solution: Let P be the center of the circumcircle Γ of △ABC. Let the tangent at D to Γ intersect AC in E. Then P D ⊥ DE. Since DE bisects ∠ADC, this implies that DP bisects ∠ADB. Hence the cir- cumcenter and the incenter of △ABD lies on the same line DP . This implies that DA = DB. Thus DA = DB = DC and hence D is the circumcenter of △ABC. This gives ∠A = 90 ◦. 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that abc = 1 Prove that a 3 (a − b)(a − c) + b3 (b − c)(b − a) + c 3 (c − a)(c − b) ≥ 3. Solution: Observe that 1 (a − b)(a − c) = (b − c) (a − b)(b − c)(a − c) = (a − c) − (a − b) (a − b)(b − c)(a − c) = 1 (a − b)(b − c) − 1 (b − c)(a − c) . Hence a 3 (a − b)(a − c) + b3 (b − c)(b − a) + c 3 (c − a)(c − b) = a 3 − b 3 (a − b)(b − c) + c3 − a 3 (c − a)(c − b) = a 2 + ab + b 2 b − c − c2 + ca + a2 b − c = ab + b 2 − c2 − ca b − c = (a + b + c)(b − c) b − c = a + b + c. Therefore a 3 (a − b)(a − c) + b 3 (b − c)(b − a) + c 3 (c − a)(c − b) = a + b + c ≥ 3(abc) 1/3 = 3. 3. Let a, b, c, d, e, f be positive integers such that a b < c d < e f . Suppose af − be = −1. Show that d ≥ b + f . Solution: Since bc − ad > 0, we have bc − ad ≥ 1. Similarly, we obtain de − f c ≥ 1. Therefore d = d(be − af ) = dbe − daf = dbe − bf c + bf c − adf = b(de − f c) + f (bc − ad) ≥ b + f. 4. There are 100 countries participating in an olympiad. Suppose n is a positive integer such that each of the 100 countries is willing to communicate in exactly n languages. If each set of 20 countries can communicate in at least one common language, and no language is common to all 100 countries, what is the minimum possible value of n? Solution: We show that n = 20. We ﬁrst show that n = 20 is possible. Call the countries C1, · · · , C100. Let 1, 2, · · · , 21 be languages and suppose, the country Ci(1 ≤ i ≤ 20) communicates exactly in the languages {j : 1 ≤ j ≤ 20, j ̸= i}. Suppose each of the countries C21, · · · , C100 communicates in the languages 1, 2, · · · , 20. Then, clearly every set of 20 countries have a common language of communication. Now, we show that n ≥ 20. If n < 20, look at any country A communicating in the languages L1, · · · , Ln. As no language is common to all 100 countries, for each Li, there is a country Ai not communicating in Li. Then, the n + 1 ≤ 20 countries A, A1, A2, · · · , An have no common language of communication. This contradiction shows n ≥ 20. 5. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Extend AI and CI; let them intersect BC in D and AB in E respectively. Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I to meet AC in J; draw a line perpendicular to CI at I to meet AC in K. Suppose DJ = EK. Prove that BA = BC. Solution: Extend JI to meet CB extended at L. Then ALBI is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore ∠BLI = ∠BAI = ∠IAC. There- fore ∠LAD = ∠IBD = 45◦. Since ∠AIL = 90◦, it follows that ∠ALI = 45 ◦. Therefore AI = IL. This shows that the triangles AIJ and LID are congruent giving IJ = ID. Simi- larly, IK = IE. Since IJ ⊥ ID and IK ⊥ IE and since DJ = EK, we see that IJ = ID = IK = IE. Thus E, D, J, K are concyclic. This implies together with DJ = EK that EDJK is an isosceles trapezium. Therefore DE ∥ JK. Hence ∠EDA = ∠DAC = ∠A/2 and ∠DEC = ∠ECA = ∠C/2. Since IE = ID, it follows that ∠A/2 = ∠C/2. This means BA = BC. 6. (a) Given any natural number N ≥ 3, prove that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of N positive integers in harmonic progression. (b) Prove that there cannot exist a strictly increasing inﬁnite sequence of positive integers which is in harmonic progression. Solution: (a) Let N ≥ 3 be a given positive integer. Consider the HP 1, 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 4 , . . . , 1 N . If we multiply this by N !, we get the HP N !, N ! 2 , N ! 3 , N ! 4 , . . . , N ! N . This is decreasing. We write this in reverse order to get a strictly increasing HP: N ! N , N ! N − 1 , N ! N − 2 , . . . , N ! 3 , N ! 2 , N !. (b) Assume the contrary that there is an inﬁnite strictly increasing sequence ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . . , ⟩ of pos- itive integers which forms a harmonic progression. Deﬁne bk = 1/ak, for k ≥ 1. Then ⟨b1, b2, b3, . . .⟩ is a strictly decreasing sequence of positive rational numbers which is in an arithmetic progression. 2 Let d = b2 − b1 < 0 be its common diﬀerence. Then b1 − b2 > 0. Choose a positive integer n such that n > b1 b1 − b2 . Then bn+1 = b1 + (b2 − b1)n = b1 − (b1 − b2)n < b1 − ( b1 b1 − b2 ) × (b1 − b2) = 0. Thus for all large n, we see that bn is negative contradicting bn is positive for all n. ———-0———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
