Suppose n is odd, and the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 2n are written on a blackboard. You repeatedly pick two arbitrary numbers on the blackboard a and b, erase them, and write |a − b| instead. This continues until only one integer is left. Is the number at the end odd or even? Solution. Since a + b ≡ a − b ≡ |a − b| (mod 2), we can see that the parity (whether it is even or odd) of the sum of the numbers written on the blackboard remains invariant (i.e., unchanged) at every step. Because, if S be the sum of the numbers other than a and b, then S + a + b ≡ S + |a − b| (mod 2). But the number of numbers written on the blackboard decrease by 1 at each step. So eventually just one number will remain on the blackboard. The invariance property we observed above tells us that parity of that number must be same as the parity of the initial sum, which is given by 1 + 2 + · · · + 2n = 2n(2n + 1) 2 = n(2n + 1) which is odd (since n is odd). Therefore, the number that will remain at the end, must be odd. 2. Start with a ﬁnite sequence of positive integers, say, a1, a2, . . . , an. Whenever it is possible to choose two indices j ̸= k such that aj ∤ ak and ak ∤ aj, we replace aj and ak by the numbers gcd(aj, ak) and lcm(aj, ak). Prove that if this process is repeated, it must eventually stop. Solution. Since gcd(aj, ak) · lcm(aj, ak) = ajak, it follows that the product of the num- bers remains invariant (unchanged) after any step. Let us call this product S. Suppose at some step, we replace aj and ak with the numbers gcd(aj, ak) and lcm(aj, ak), where j ̸= k and aj ∤ ak and ak ∤ aj. Then observe that gcd(aj, ak) + lcm(aj, ak) > aj + ak. Why? If gcd(aj, ak) = d, we can write aj = dx and ak = dy where x, y are coprime. If x = 1 we get aj | ak and if y = 1 we get ak | aj, and neither of these can occur here. 1 So we must have x > 1 and y > 1. Now gcd(aj, ak) + lcm(aj, ak) > aj + ak ⇐⇒ d + dxy > dx + dy ⇐⇒ 1 + xy > x + y ⇐⇒ (x − 1)(y − 1) > 0, and the last inequality clearly holds for x, y > 1. Thus whenever we make a valid step, the sum of the numbers strictly increases. We say that the sum of the numbers is a monovariant. But the sum of the numbers cannot increase indeﬁnitely, because it can be at most nS (since all of them are positive integers and their product is S). We may therefore conclude that the process must eventually stop. 3. There are 5 red marbles and 6 green marbles in a jar. Pascal plays a strange game. He removes two marbles at a time, with the following rules: (i) If the marbles are of the same colour, he puts one green marble back. (ii) If there is one marble of each colour, he puts one red marble back. At the end, there will be one marble left. Which colour is it? Solution. Note that at any step, the number of red marbles may either decrease by 2 (if we pick two red marbles and (i) applies) or remains unchanged (if (ii) applies). Initially we start with 5 red marbles, so after any number of steps, the number of red marbles will be odd (this is the invariance here). As the total number of marbles decreases by 1 at each step, at the end there will be only one marble left. Since the number of red marbles is always is odd, it cannot be zero, implying that the marble that will remain at the end must be a red one. 4. Consider 2021 cards, each having one gold side and one black side, lying in a line on a long table. Initially all cards show their gold sides. Two players, standing by the same long side of the table, play a game with alternating moves. Each move consists of choosing a block of 40 consecutive cards, the leftmost of which is showing gold, and turning them all over, so those which showed gold now show black and vice versa. The last player who can make a legal move wins. (a) Does the game necessarily end? (b) Does there exist a winning strategy for the starting player? Solution. To understand the game, let us look at the following toy-example (where the two players are playing casually), and for simplicity change the number 2021 to 7 and the number 40 to 2. 2 G G G G G G G Player 1’s turn −−−−−−−−→ G G G B B G G (Now Player 2’s turn) G G G B B G G Player 2’s turn −−−−−−−−→ G G B G B G G (Now Player 1’s turn) G G B G B G G Player 1’s turn −−−−−−−−→ B B B G B G G (Now Player 2’s turn) B B B G B G G Player 2’s turn −−−−−−−−→ B B B B G G G (Now Player 1’s turn) B B B B G G G Player 1’s turn −−−−−−−−→ B B B B B B G (Now Player 2’s turn) Player 2 loses this game. Let us now focus on the main problem. Suppose at any step, we write 1 in place of a card with the gold-face up, and 0 for a card with the black-face up. This will give us a sequence of 2021 many 0’s and 1’s. Any conﬁguration of the cards corresponds to such a unique combination of 2021 many 0’s and 1’s, which we can interpret as the binary representation of a natural number. Now observe that this number decreases at each step. Because, a 40-digit binary number that starts with 1 is strictly greater than any 40-digit binary number that starts with 0. (. . . 10110 . . . 0 . . . )2 > (. . . 01001 . . . 1 . . . )2 Thus, the binary number corresponding to the conﬁguration of the cards strictly de- creases after each move. But it cannot decrease indeﬁnitely, because it is always a non-negative integer. Therefore, the game must end. This answers part (a) of the question. (b) Left as homework. 5. Given are n red points and n blue points in the plane, no three collinear. Show that we can draw n non-intersecting line segments connecting the blue points to the red points. Solution. First we match each blue point to a unique red point, in an arbitrary fashion. Now, whenever there is a point of intersection, we just change the pairs, as shown in the following diagram. 3 It is easy to observe, using the triangle inequality, that the sum of the lengths of the n line segments, call it ℓ, strictly decreases whenever we make a change as shown in the above diagram. Can this sum of the lengths (ℓ) decrease indeﬁnitely? The number of all possible conﬁgurations is ﬁnite (in fact, n!). So, we can take the minimum possible value of ℓ over all possible conﬁgurations. Therefore, no matter how we start, the process of strictly decreasing ℓ-value at each step cannot run indeﬁnitely. When it stops, we must get a conﬁguration with zero intersections, because otherwise the ℓ-value of this conﬁgurations can be lowered further, giving us a contradiction. 6. The numbers 1, 2, . . . , 100 are written on a blackboard. You may erase any two numbers a and b, and write the number ab + a + b on the board. What number will be left at the end? Solution. Note, (ab + a + b) + 1 = (a + 1)(b + 1). So if we consider the quantity P = ∏ x is written on the board(x + 1) remains invariant after any number of steps. Because if at any step, the numbers written on the board are x1, . . . , xk, a, b and we erase a, b and write ab + a + b, then Pprev = (x1 + 1) · · · (xk + 1)(a + 1)(b + 1) = (x1 + 1) · · · (xk + 1)((ab + a + b) + 1) = Pnew. Now, the number of numbers on the board decreases by 1 at each step, so eventually just one number will remain on the board, call it A. Since the product P is invariant at every step, we get (A + 1) = Pﬁnal = Pinitial = (1 + 1)(2 + 1) · · · (100 + 1) = 101! giving us A = 101! − 1. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
