They will appear on an irregular basis, as and when I get around to preparing them. There are no prizes or competition involved, just the opportunity to improve your problem solving, and perhaps learn some new maths. I welcome you to try them, and to send me any solutions you ﬁnd. I’ll try to acknowledge these, and might include (with credit!) any particularly clever or nice solutions from you in the “oﬃcial solutions”. These will appear on the web (somewhere, sometime!), or can be obtained from me by email if you provide evidence that you’ve tried the problems seriously. The solutions will contain hyperlinks where you can learn about some of the concepts involved and pursue them further. This month’s problems, perhaps a bit more diﬃcult than recently, are modiﬁcations of ones that have appeared recently in competitions from Bulgaria, Greece and Moldova. Michael Albert, 2008 NZ IMO team leader (malbert@cs.otago.ac.nz) 1. Let k be a positive integer such that k(k + 3) is a perfect square. Prove that k is not a multiple of 3. 2. Prove that, for every positive integer n: 1 11 + 2 21 + 3 31 + · · · + n 10n + 1 < n 10 . 3. A social network has 2008 members. Any two of them who are not already friends have at least one friend in common. What is the minimum possible number of pairs of people in the network who are already friends? 4. A cyclic quadrilateral ALN B is given. The point M is the midpoint of the arc not containing A and B determined by LN . Let D be the intersection of AM and BL, and E the intersection of AN and BM . Prove that DE ∥ LN .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
