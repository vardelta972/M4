If the polynomial has real coeﬃcients, then the roots αi will consist of the real roots together with pairs of complex conjugate roots. This means that the number of real roots the polynomial has is congruent to its degree modulo 2. • Although the roots individually cannot in general be expressed in terms of the coeﬃcients of the polyno- mial, the elementary symmetric functions of them can: ek(α1, . . . , αn) = (−1)k an−k an . • Descartes’ Rule of Signs: Let P (x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, and let C be the number of times the sign changes in the coeﬃcient list an, . . . , a0, where we ignore zeroes. Then the number of positive real roots of P (counted with multiplicity) is no larger than C and congruent to C mod 2. • Rolle’s Theorem: Let P (x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Then between any two zeroes of P (x), there will be (at least one) zero of the derivative P ′(x). • The division algorithm: If a(x) and b(x) are polynomials, then there exist unique polynomials q(x) and r(x) with deg(r) < deg(b) such that a(x) = b(x)q(x) + r(x). This can be used to compute GCDs! • Lagrangian interpolation: f (x) = d∑ i=0 f (xi) ∏ 0≤j≤d j̸=i x − xj xi − xj . • Newtonian interpolation: f (n) = d∑ i=0(∆if )(0) (n i ) . Here ∆f (x) = f (x + 1) − f (x) is the ﬁnite diﬀerence operator. • If f (x) is a polynomial with leading term cx d, then f (x + a) − f (x) is a polynomial with leading term acdx d−1. • Finite Taylor expansion: f (x + a) = f (x) + af ′(x) + a 2 f ′′(x) 2 + · · · 1 2 Special types of polynomials • Chebyshev polynomials: The Chebyshev polynomials T0 = 1, T1 = x, T2 = 2x 2 − 1, . . . are characterized by the property Tn(cos θ) = cos(nθ). They have many nice features: – A recursion: Tn+1 = 2xTn − Tn−1. – A useful identity: Tn ( x + x−1 2 ) = xn + x−n 2 . – If P (x) is a degree n polynomial with leading term axn, then |P (x)| ≥ a 2n for some x ∈ [−1, 1]. Equality here is acheived by Tn. • Cyclotomic polynomials: The nth cyclotomic polynomial is deﬁned by Φn(X) = ∏ 1≤j≤n (j,n)=1 (X − e2πij/n) = ∏ d|n(X n/d − 1) µ(d) ∈ Z[X]. They also satisfy the identity X n − 1 = ∏ d|n Φd(X). These polynomials are likely to be relevant whenever you see an expression of the form X n − 1. • Symmetric and alternating polynomials: A function f (x1, . . . , xn) is called symmetric if as a function of any two variables xi and xj, it satisﬁes f (xj, xi) = f (xi, xj). Similarly, f is called alternating if f (xj, xi) = −f (xi, xj). Basic fact about symmetric polynomials: any symmetric polynomial f (x1, . . . , xn) can be written as a (unique) polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials ei(x1, . . . , xn) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Basic fact about alternating polynomials: any alternating polynomial can be written as a symmetric polynomial multiplied by the Vandermonde polynomial ∆ = ∏ 1≤i<j≤n (xi − xj) = ∑ alt x n−1 1 xn−2 2 · · · xn−1, 3 Problems 1. (IMO Shortlist, modiﬁed) Suppose that P is a polynomial with degree 100 and such that P (n) = Fn for n = 102, 103, . . . , 202. (Here Fn is the nth Fibonacci number, i.e. F1 = 1, F2 = 1 and Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 for n ≥ 1.) Find P (203). 2. Determine all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x) + P (1/x) = P (x)P (1/x) for all x ̸= 0. 3. Let a, b, c, d be distinct real numbers with sum 0.

The Lucas numbers are deﬁned by L0 = 2, L1 = 1, and Ln = Ln−1 + Ln−2 for n ≥ 2. Show that for any positive integer k, L2k = k−1∏ j=0 ( 3 + 2 cos ( (2i + 1)π 2n )) . 5. Find all positive integers n such that every prime divisor of 2n − 1 also divides 2 k − 1 for some 0 < k < n. 6. (MOP 08) Let P be a polynomial of degree n with real coeﬃcients, and let t be a real number with t ≥ 3. Show that max 0≤k≤n+1 |t k − P (k)| ≥ 1. 7 (MOP 01). Let P (x) be a real-valued polynomial with P (n) = P (0). Show that there exist at least n distinct (unordered) pairs of real numbers {x, y} such that x − y is a positive integer and P (x) = P (y). 8. Let x, y, z be real numbers satisfying x + y + z = 5, x 2 + y2 + z2 = 9. Find the minimum and maximum of P = x2y + y2z + z2x. 9. Let Mj = 2 j − 1 for positive integer j. Prove the identity n∑ k=0 (−1) k2k(k+1)/2 (M1M2 · · · Mk)(M1M2 · · · Mn−k) = (−1)n for any positive integer n. 10. (FLT for polynomials) Prove that for each n > 2 there are no relatively prime non-constant polynomials a(x), b(x), c(x) (with complex coeﬃcients) such that a(x) n + b(x)n = c(x) n. 11 (USAMO 88). A certain polynomial product of the form (1 − z) b1(1 − z2)b2 · · · (1 − z32)b32 , where the bk are positive integers, has the surprising property that if we multiply it out and discard all terms involving z to a power larger than 32, we are left with 1 − 2z.
