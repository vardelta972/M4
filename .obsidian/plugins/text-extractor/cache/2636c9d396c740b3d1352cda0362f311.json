Consider three pairwise adjacent faces of an n × n × n cube. For what values of n is it possible to tile the three faces with 3 × 1 “band-aids”? A band-aid may wrap around from one face to another, but cannot bend. Answer. The faces may be tiled if and only if 3 | n. One direction is easy: if 3 | n then each of the faces may be individually tiled with band-aids. It remains to show the converse: if a tiling exists, then n is divisible by 3. We oﬀer two solutions, the second of which may be derived from the ﬁrst. Solution 1. This solution is motivated by the attempt to convert a tiling on the given surface to a tiling on a ﬂat surface, because tilings on rectangles or squares are well understood. Indeed, assuming the given surface can be tiled, the key idea is to “wrap” four copies of this tiling into a triple tiling of a 2n × 2n square, and then to show that such a triple tiling can only exist when 3 | n. Details follow. (a) The surface S3, drawn with smooth transitions be- tween the three faces. (b) The surface S4 is a 2n × 2n square. (c) The surface S12. Figure 1: The surfaces S3, S4, and S12 (shown with n = 4), drawn with smooth transitions between faces. Let Sk be the surface obtained by gluing k squares—or quadrants—together at a common point, so that the given surface is S3 (Figure 1(a)), S4 is a 2n × 2n square (Figure 1(b)), and S12 is as shown in Figure 1(c). Suppose we know a tiling T3 of S3 with n2 band-aids. There is a map p3 : S12 → S3 as shown in Figure 2(a) which sends the i th quadrant of S12 to the (i mod 3) th quadrant of S3. If we lift each tile in T3 to its four preimages on S12, we obtain a tiling T12 of S12 by 4n2 band-aids. Similarly, the map p4 : S12 → S4 as in Figure 2(b), which sends the i th quadrant of S12 to the (i mod 4) th quadrant of S4, maps the tiling T12 into a collection of tiles T4 on S4 such that every cell is covered by exactly three tiles. We now show that in order for such a triple tiling T4 of S4 to exist, n must be a multiple of 3. Indeed, label the 2n × 2n rectangle with “A”s, “B”s, and “C”s as in Figure 3, and note that any band-aid covers exactly one of each letter. As there are 4n2 tiles in T4 and each cell is covered three times, there must be 4n2/3 “A”s on the board, and the same number of “B”s and “C”s. Thus, 3 | 4n2, so 3 | n, as desired. □ Solution 2. Suppose the surface is tileable. Label the 3n2 cells as shown in Figure 4, and note that the sum of the cells covered by any band-aid is 2. As there are n2 band-aids in a tiling, the sum of all numbers in the Figure equals 2n2, so by symmetry the sum of numbers on one of the three faces is 2n2/3. As this must be an integer, the conclusion 3 | n follows. □ Note. To see how Solution 2 is derived from Solution 1, ask yourself the following question: for each cell c in S3, how many of the four cells in the set p4(p −1 3 ({c})) are labelled “A”? 1 2 ZACHARY ABEL (a) An illustration of the map p3 : S12 → S3. A copy of S12 (where the thick dotted edges should be joined together) lies above S3, and the map p3 is given by projecting straight down. The colors illustrate how S12 can be thought of as four copies of S3 stitched together. Each tile in T3 has exactly four preimages in S12, and these preimages form a tiling T12 of S12. (b) The map p4 : S12 → S4, shown in the style of (a). Because there are three cells of S12 mapping to each cell of S4, the tiling T12 becomes a triple-tiling of S4. Figure 2: Maps p3 and p4.
