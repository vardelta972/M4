A function is said to be convex (or concave up) if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies above the graph. A function is said to be concave (or concave down) if the line segment between any two points on the graph of the function lies below the graph. Formally, a function f : I → R is concave up if for any two points x1, x2 ∈ I and t ∈ [0, 1], f (tx1 + (1 − t)x2) ≤ tf (x1) + (1 − t)f (x2). The sign of the inequality is ﬂipped if f is concave down. An easy way to check if f is convex in an interval is by taking its second derivative, and checking that it is nonnegative for the interval. Deﬁnition 1.2. A sequence a1, a2, · · · , an is said to majorize the sequence b1, b2, · · · , bn if k∑ i=1 ai ≥ k∑ i=1 bi for all k = 1, 2, · · · , n, and is written as (a1, a2, · · · , an) ≻ (b1, b2, · · · , bn). Deﬁnition 1.3. A shorthand way of writing inequalities is by using summation notation. Deﬁne the cyclic sum of f (a, b, c) by ∑ cyc f (a, b, c) = f (a, b, c) + f (b, c, a) + f (c, a, b) and deﬁne the symmetric sum of f (a, b, c) by ∑ sym f (a, b, c) = f (a, b, c) + f (a, c, b) + f (b, a, c) + f (b, c, a) + f (c, a, b) + f (c, b, a). Cyclic products and symmetric products are deﬁned analogously. Deﬁnition 1.4. The gradient of a function f is deﬁned as ∇f = ∂f ∂xˆı + ∂f ∂y ˆ + ∂f ∂z ˆk. 2 The Standard Dozen As listed in the beginning of Thomas Mildorf’s Olympiad Inequalities 1, the following twelve inequalities are the most famous in Olympiad mathematics. 1http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Resources/Papers/MildorfInequalities.pdf 1 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park Theorem 2.1 (Jensen). Let f : I → R be a convex function. Then for any x1, x2, · · · , xn ∈ I and any nonnegative reals ω1, ω2, · · · , ωn, ω1f (x1) + ω2f (x2) + · · · + ωnf (xn) ≥ (ω1 + ω2 + · · · + ωn)f ( ω1x1 + ω2x2 + · · · + ωnxn ω1 + ω2 + · · · + ωn ) . Theorem 2.2 (Weighted Power Mean). If x1, x2, · · · , xn are nonnegative reals with a positive sum, then f (r) = ( ω1xr 1 + ω2xr 2 + · · · + ωnxr n ω1 + ω2 + · · · + ωn ) 1 r is a non-decreasing function of r, with the convention that r = 0 is the weighted gometric mean. f is strictly increasing unless all the xi are equal except possible for r ∈ (−ω, 0], where if some xi is zero f is identically 0. In particular, f (1) ≥ f (0) ≥ f (−1) gives the AM-GM-HM inequality. Theorem 2.3 (H¨older). Let a1, a2, · · · , an; b1, b2, · · · , bn; · · · ; z1, z2, · · · , zn be sequences of nonnegative real numbers, and let λa, λb, · · · , λz be positive reals which sum to 1. Then (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) λa (b1 + b2 + · · · + bn) λb · · · (z1 + z2 + · · · + zn)λz ≥ a λa 1 bλb 1 · · · zλz 1 + · · · + a λa n bλb n · · · zλz n . Theorem 2.4 (Rearrangement). Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers. Then, for any permutation π of {1, 2, · · · , n}, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a1bπ(1) + a2bπ(2) + · · · + anbπ(n) ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1. Theorem 2.5 (Chebyshev). Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers. Then a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn n ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n b1 + b2 + · · · + bn n ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 n . Theorem 2.6 (Schur). Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals and r > 0. Then a r(a − b)(a − c) + br(b − c)(b − a) + c r(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if a = b = c or some two of a, b, c are equal and the other is 0. Theorem 2.7 (Newton). Let x1, x2, · · · , xn be nonnegative real numbers. Deﬁne the symmetric polynomials s0, s1, · · · , sn by (x + x1)(x + x2) · · · (x + xn) = snx n + · · · + s1x + s0, and deﬁne the symmetric averages by di = si (n i) . Then d2 i ≥ di+1di−1. Theorem 2.8 (Maclaurin). Let di be deﬁned as above. Then d1 ≥ √d2 ≥ 3√d3 ≥ · · · ≥ n√dn. Theorem 2.9 (Majorization). Let f : I → R be a convex function on I and suppose that the sequence x1, x2, · · · , xn majorizes the sequence y1, y2, · · · , yn, where xi, yi ∈ I. Then f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + f (y2) + · · · + f (yn). Theorem 2.10 (Popoviciu). Let f : I → R be a convex function on I and let x, y, z ∈ I. Then for any 2 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park positive reals p, q, r, pf (x) + qf (y) + rf (z) + (p + q + r)f ( px + qy + rz p + q + r ) ≥ (p + q)f ( px + qy p + q ) + (q + r)f ( qy + rz q + r ) + (r + p)f ( rz + px r + p ) . Theorem 2.11 (Bernoulli). For all r ≥ 1 and x ≥ −1, (1 + x) r ≥ 1 + xr. Theorem 2.12 (Muirhead). Suppose the sequence a1, a2, · · · , an majorizes the sequence b1, b2, · · · , bn. Then for any positive reals x1, x2, · · · , xn, ∑ sym xa1 1 xa2 2 · · · xan n ≥ ∑ sym xb1 1 xb2 2 · · · xbn n . 3 Monotonicity Monotonicity of functions can be used to prove that the left side increases faster than the right side, so that the left side is always greater than the right side. Theorem 3.1. Let f : I → R and g : I → R be functions, where I = [a, b], such that f (a) = g(a), f and g are diﬀerentiable on I, and f ′(x) > g′(x) for all x ∈ I. Then f (x) > g(x) for all x ∈ I. Example 3.1. Let x, y, and z be nonnegative real numbers such that x + y + z = 1. Prove the inequality 0 ≤ xy + yz + zx − 2xyz ≤ 7 27 . Solution. WLOG let 0 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ z ≤ 1. Hence x ≤ 1 3 , and so xy + yz + zx − 2xyz = (1 − 3x)yz + xy + zx + xyz ≥ 0, which is the left inequality. Now we prove the right inequality. By AM-GM, yz ≤ ( y+z 2 )2 = ( 1−x 2 )2. Thus xy + yz + zx − 2xyz = x(y + z) + yz(1 − 2x) ≤ x(1 − x) + ( 1 − x 2 )2 (1 − 2x) = −2x3 + x2 + 1 4 . Let f (x) = −2x3+x2+1 4 . Diﬀerentiating f , we see that f ′(x) = −3x 2 + x 2 = 3x 2 ( 1 3 − x) ≥ 0, implying that f is increasing on [0, 1 3 ]. Therefore, f (x) ≤ f ( 1 3 ) = 7 27 , as desired. 4 pqr Method The pqr method is a method of solving inequalities by making substitutions and simplifying the inequality. Let x, y, and z be positive reals and deﬁne the variables p, q, and r by p = x + y + z, q = xy + yz + zx, r = xyz. A list of relationships between the variables x, y, z, and p, q, r are given below, where ∑ and ∏ are all taken to be cyclic. 3 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park 1. ∑ x2 = p 2 − 2q 2. ∑ x3 = p(p 2 − 3q) + 3r 3. ∑ x2y2 = q2 − 2pr 4. ∑ x4 = (p2 − 2q) 2 − 2(q2 − 2pr) 5. ∏ (x + y) = pq − r 6. ∑ (x + y)(y + z) = p 2 + q 7. ∑ (x + y) 2(y + z) = (p 2 + q) 2 − 4p(pq − r) 8. ∑ xy(x + y) = pq − 3r 9. ∏ (1 + x) = 1 + p + q + r 10. ∑ (1 + x)(1 + y) = 3 + 2p + q 11. ∑ (1 + x)2(1 + y) 2 = (3 + 2p + q) 2 − 2(3 + p)(1 + p + q + r) 12. ∑ x 2(y + z) = pq − 3r 13. ∑ x3y3 = q3 − 3pqr − 3r2 14. ∑ xy(x2 + y2) = p 2q − 2q2 − pr 15. ∏ (1 + x 2) = p 2 + q2 + r2 − 2pr − 2q + 1 16. ∏ (1 + x 3) = p 3 + q3 + r3 − 3pqr − 3pq − 3r2 + 3r + 1 There are also inequalities that relate p, q, and r to themselves: 1. p3 − 4pq + 9r ≥ 0 2. p4 − 5p 2q + 4q2 + 6pr ≥ 0 3. pq ≥ 9r 4. p2 ≥ 3q 5. p3 ≥ 27r 6. q3 ≥ 27r2 7. q2 ≥ 3pr 8. 2p 3 + 9r ≥ 7pq 9. p4 + 3q2 ≥ 4p 2q 10. 2p 3 + 9r2 ≥ 7pqr 11. p2q + 3pr ≥ 4q2 12. q3 + 9r2 ≥ 4pqr 13. pq2 ≥ 2p 2r + 3qr 4 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park The implementation of the pqr method is simple, but usually hidden. The transformation from the given inequality into pqr notation is probably the trickiest part, and the rest is generally just substituting the above inequalities/identities. Example 4.1. Let x, y, z > 0 such that x + y + z = 1. Prove the inequality (1 + 1 x ) ( 1 + 1 y ) ( 1 + 1 z ) ≥ 64. Solution. Let p = x+y+z = 1, q = xy+yz +zx, and r = xyz. The desired inequality is (x+1)(y+1)(z +1) ≥ 64xyz. The left side expands to 1 + p + q + r, and the right side is 64r. It remains to prove 2 + q ≥ 63r. We have that pq ≥ 9r, that is, q ≥ 9r. In addition, p 3 ≥ 27r, so r ≤ 1 27 . Now, 2 + q ≥ 63r ⇐⇒ 2 ≥ 54r, which is true. Example 4.2 (TSTST 2012). Positive real numbers x, y, z satisfy xyz + xy + yz + zx = x + y + z + 1. Prove that 1 3 (√ 1 + x2 1 + x + √ 1 + y2 1 + y + √ 1 + z2 1 + z ) ≤ ( x + y + z 3 )5/8 . Solution. (David Stoner) The given condition implies that p + 1 = q + r. Note that ∑ cyc 1 + x2 1 + x = p + ∑ cyc 1 − x 1 + x = p + ∑ cyc(x − 1)(y + 1)(z + 1) p + q + r + 1 = p + −q − 3r + p + 3 2p + 2 = p + 1 − r p + 1 = p2 + p − r + 1 p + 1 = p2 + q p + 1 . We have that 3q ≤ p 2, so ∑ cyc 1+x 2 1+x ≤ 4p2 3(p+1) . By Jensen’s Inequality, 1 3 ∑ cyc √ 1 + x2 1 + x ≤ √ 1 3 ∑ cyc 1 + x2 1 + x ≤ √ 4p2 9(p + 1) . Now 4p2 9(p+1) ≤ ( p 3 )5/4 ⇐⇒ 44p3 94(p+1)4 ≤ 1 35 ⇐⇒ 27(p+1) 4 ≥ 256p 3, which is true since 3p+3 = p+p+p+3 ≥ 4 4√3p3. 5 uvw Method The uvw method is similar to the pqr method in that it also involves substitution, but instead we use the substitutions 3u = a + b + c, 3v2 = ab + bc + ca, and w3 = abc. The theorems and proofs of these theorems are outlined in Tejs Knudsen’s article2 on this method. Theorem 5.1 (Idiot). If a, b, c ≥ 0, then u ≥ v ≥ w. Theorem 5.2 (Positivity). a, b, c ≥ 0 if and only if u, v2, w3 ≥ 0. 2http://tinyurl.com/uvwmethod 5 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park Theorem 5.3 (uvw). u, v2, w3 are real if and only if u 2 ≥ v2 and w3 ∈ [3uv2 − 2u 3 − 2√ (u2 − v2)3, 3uv2 − 2u3 + 2√ (u2 − v2)3] . Example 5.1. (IMO 2006/3) Determine the least real number M such that the inequality |ab(a 2 − b 2) + bc(b2 − c 2) + ca(c 2 − a 2)| ≤ M (a 2 + b 2 + c2) 2 holds for all real numbers a, b, and c. Solution. Since ab(a 2 − b2) + bc(b2 − c 2) + ca(c 2 − a 2) = (a − b)(b − c)(a − c)(a + b + c), the given inequality is equivalent to (a − b) 2(b − c)2(c − a)2(a + b + c) 2 ≤ M 2(a 2 + b 2 + c2) 4. Making the substitutions 3u = a + b + c, 3v2 = ab + bc + ca, and w3 = abc, the inequality becomes 9u2 · (33(−(w3 − (3uv2 − 2u 3))2 + (4u 2 − v2) 3)) ≤ M 2(9u 2 − 6v2)4. Since −(w3 −(3uv2 −2u 3))2 ≤ 0, it suﬃces to prove that 12u 2(u 2 −v2)3 ≤ M 2(3u 2 −2v2) 4. Dividing through by v8 and making the substitution t = u v , we have 12t(t − 1)3 ≤ M 2(3t − 2)4. Hence, the minimum value of M is attained at the maximum of f (t) = 12t(t−1) 3 (3t−2)4 . Diﬀerentiating f , we see that f ′(t) = 12(t−1)2(t+2) (3t−2)5 , which is positive for t ∈ [1, ∞). Thus f is increasing in [1, ∞), so in this interval, the maximum of f is lim t→∞ f (t) = lim t→∞ 12t(t − 1)3 (3t − 2)4 = 12 81 = 4 27 . If t is negative, solving f ′(t) = 0 shows that t = −2 yields a maximum. Now f (−2) = 3 4 29 > 4 27 , so the minimum of M 2 is 3 4 29 , implyping that the minimum value of M is 9 16 √ 2 . 6 ABC Method The Abstract Conconcreteness Method, abbreviated the ABC method, is an extremely powerful but limited way of proving polynomial inequalities. The main idea of the method is to express an inequality as a function of abc, ab + bc + ca, and a + b + c, and then observing where the minimum and maximum values occur, and checking the inequality for the speciﬁc case. Theorem 6.1 (ABC Theorem). If the function f (abc, ab + bc + ca, a + b + c) is monotonic/convex/concave, then f achieves its maximum and minimum values on R when (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0, and on R+ when (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0 or abc = 0. This theorem produces a few corollaries: Corollary 6.2. Let f (abc, ab + bc + ca, a + b + c) be a linear function/quadratic trinomial with variable abc. Then f achieves its maximum and minimum values on R iﬀ (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0, and on R+ iﬀ (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0 or abc = 0. Corollary 6.3. All symmetric three-variable polynomials of degree less than or equal to 5 achieve their maximum and minimum values on R if and only if (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0, and on R+ if and only if (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0 or abc = 0. 6 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park Corollary 6.4. All symmetric three-variable polnomials of degree less than or equal to 8 with nonnegative coeﬃcient of (abc) 2 in the form f (abc, ab+bc+ca, a+b+c) achieve their maximum on R iﬀ (a−b)(b−c)(c−a) = 0, and on R+ iﬀ (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0 or abc = 0. Example 6.1. Let a, b, c > 0 be real numbers. Prove that abc a3 + b3 + c3 + 2 3 ≥ ab + bc + ca a2 + b2 + c2 . Solution. Clearing denominators and bringing all of the terms to one side, we have to prove that abc(a 2 + b2 + c 2) + 2 3 (a 3 + b3 + c 3)(a 2 + b2 + c 2) − (a 3 + b 3 + c 3)(ab + bc + ca) ≥ 0. Both a 2 + b 2 + c 2 and a 3 + b 3 + c 3 can be written as polynomial expressions of abc, ab + bc + ca, and a + b + c, and so this function has degree 3 in abc. By Corollary 6.2, the minimum of the left hand side occurs when (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) = 0 or abc = 0. For the ﬁrst case, WLOG let a = b. We have to prove that a 2c 2a3 + c3 + 2 3 ≥ a 2 + 2ac 2a2 + c2 ⇐⇒ 2(a − b)4(a + b) 3(2a2 + b2)(2a3 + b3) ≥ 0, which is true. If abc = 0, then WLOG let a = 0. The inquality becomes 2 3 ≥ bc b2 + c2 ⇐⇒ b 2 + c2 + 3(b − c) 2 ≥ 0, which is true. 7 Sum of Squares (SOS) Sum of Squares, abbreviated SOS, is a brute-force but powerful method of proving 3-variable homogenous inequalities one of whose equality cases is a = b = c. This is the technique that the Vietnamese are well- known for on the Inequalities forum on AoPS. The main idea of the method is to transform an inequality into the form Sa(a − b) 2 + Sb(b − c) 2 + Sc(c − a) 2 ≥ 0 where Sa, Sb, and Sc are functions of a, b, and c. The steps to expressing an inequality X into SOS form are: 1. Group X into one or more terms that are 0 when a = b = c. 2. Write everything as a multiple of (a − b), (b − c), or (c − a). 3. Group everything by (a − b), (b − c), and (c − a), and ensure the coeﬃcients vanish when a = b = c. 4. Write everything as a multiple of (a − b)2, (b − c) 2, (c − a)2, (a − b)(b − c), (b − c)(c − a), or (c − a)(a − b). 5. Replace (a − b)(b − c) with 1 2 ((a − c) 2 − (a − b) 2 − (b − c) 2). This exact procedure is reiterated in David Arthur’s article3 on Sum of Squares for the Canada IMO Training Camp, and is much better explained because the author provides an example to go along with it. 3http://tinyurl.com/davidarthursos 7 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park Assuming that it has equality case a = b = c, it is possible to write any inequality in SOS form using this procedure. Steps 4 and 5 are optional, as there aren’t many inequalities that have that extraneous (a − b)(b − c) term. Example 7.1. Prove that 1 a2 + 2 + 1 b2 + 2 + 1 c2 + 2 ≤ 1 6ab + c2 + 1 6bc + a2 + 1 6ca + b2 for all positive real numbers a, b, and c satisfying a 2 + b 2 + c2 = 1. Solution 1. Let x = a 2, y = b2, and z = c 2. It suﬃces to show that ∑ cyc 1 x+3y+3z ≥ ∑ cyc 1 3x+2y+2z after using AM-GM and homogenizing. Now, ∑ cyc ( 1 x + 3y + 3z − 1 3x + 2y + 2z ) = ∑ cyc (x − y) + (x − z) (x + 3y + 3z)(3x + 2y + 2z) = ∑ cyc (x − y) ( 1 (x + 3y + 3z)(3x + 2y + 2z) − 1 (y + 3x + 3z)(3y + 2x + 2z) ) = ∑ cyc (x − y) ( 3(x2 − y2) + xz − yz (x + 3y + 3z)(3x + 2y + 2z)(y + 3x + 3z)(3y + 2x + 2z) ) = ∑ cyc (x − y)2 ( 3x + 3y + z (x + 3y + 3z)(3x + 2y + 2z)(y + 3x + 3z)(3y + 2x + 2z) ) ≥ 0. Solution 2. As above, it suﬃces to show that ∑ cyc 1 a2+3b2+3c2 ≥ ∑ cyc 1 3a2+2b2+2c2 . Note that (a 2 + 3b2 + c2, 3a 2 + b2 + 3c2, a 2 + 3b2 + 3c 2) ≻ (3a 2 + 2b2 + 2c2, 2a 2 + 3b2 + 2c2, 2a 2 + 2b2 + 3c2). Since f (x) = 1 x is concave up for x > 0, applying Majorization Inequality gives us the desired inequality. Solution 3. By Muirhead’s Inequality, we have that ∑ cyc x3y3z ≥ ∑ cyc x 3y2z2. Making the substitution x = ta 2− 1 7 , y = tb 2− 1 7 , and z = tc 2− 1 7 gives us ∑ cyc t 3a 2+3b 2+c2−1 ≥ ∑ cyc t3a2+2b2+2c 2−1, which implies that ∫ 1 0 ∑ cyc t 3a 2+3b 2+c2−1 dt ≥ ∫ 1 0 ∑ cyc t 3a 2+2b2+2c2−1 dt, implying the desired inequality. 8 SMV Method The Strongly Mixing Variables Method, or just the Mixing Variables Method, abbreviated SMV, is a technique based on averaging. For proofs to the following theorems and more example problems, Pham Kim Hung’s 8 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park article on the SMV Method 4 and Zdravko Cvetkovski’s book Inequalities - Theorems, Techniques, and Selected Problems are good resources. The main idea of the technique is proving that substituting the average of two variables in place of the two variables increases/decreases a function, and then after applying this substitution inﬁnitely many times, all of the variables must end up being equal. Written in mathematical terminology, Lemma 8.1. Let (x1, x2, · · · , xn) be a sequence of real numbers. Deﬁne a transformation as follows: 1. Let xi = min{x1, x2, · · · , xn} and xj = min{x1, x2, · · · , xn}. 2. Replace xi and xj with xi+xj 2 . After inﬁnitely many of the above transformation, each term of sequence x1, x2, · · · , xn tends to the same limit x = x1+x2+···+xn n . In fact, this transformation does not necessarily have to be the average a, b → a+b 2 . It can be the geometric mean √ab, or the quadratic mean √ a2+b2 2 , and so on. Let us call such transformations ∆-transformations. Theorem 8.2 (SMV Theorem). Let f : I ⊂ Rn → R be a symmetric and continuous function such that f (a1, a2, · · · , an) ≥ f (b1, b2, · · · , bn), where the sequence (b1, b2, · · · , bn) is obtained from the sequence (a1, a2, · · · , an) by some ∆-transformation. Then f (x1, x2, · · · , xn) ≥ f (x, x, · · · , x), where x = x1+x2+···+xn n . Example 8.1 (Nesbitt). Let a, b, and c be positive real numbers. Prove that a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ≥ 3 2 . Solution. Deﬁne f (a, b, c) = a b+c + b c+a + c a+b . Note that f (a, b, c) − f ( a + b 2 , a + b 2 , c ) = ( a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ) − ( a + b a + b + 2c + a + b a + b + 2c + c a + b ) = a b + c + b c + a − 2(a + b) a + b + 2c = a 3 + a 2c + b2c + b3 − 2abc − ab 2 − a 2b (b + c)(a + c)(a + b + 2c) ≥ 0. Hence f (a, b, c) ≥ f ( a+b 2 , a+b 2 , c ), and so applying the SMV Theorem, it remains to prove that f ( a+b+c 3 , a+b+c 3 , a+b+c 3 ) ≥ 3 2 , which is clearly true. Example 8.2 (ISL 1993). Let a, b, c, and d be four nonnegative real numbers satisfying a + b + c + d = 1. Prove the inequality abc + bcd + cda + dab ≤ 1 27 + 176 27 abcd. Solution. WLOG let a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d. Denote f (a, b, c, d) = abc + bcd + cda + dab − 176 27 abcd = ac(b + d) + bd (a + c − 176 27 ac ). Note that a + c ≤ 1 2 (a + b + c + d) = 1 2 , and so a + c ≥ 4ac a+c ≥ 8ac > 176 27 ac, implying that a + c − 176 27 ac > 0. Hence, f (a, b, c, d) ≤ f ( a, b + d 2 , c, b + d 2 ) . 4https://www.awesomemath.org/wp-content/uploads/reflections/2006_6/2006_6_mixing.pdf 9 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park By the SMV Theorem, we have that f (a, b, c, d) ≤ f (a, t, t, t), where t = b+c+d 3 . Now we must prove that t2(3a + t) ≤ 1 27 + 176 27 at3 given that a + 3t = 1. Letting a = 1 − 3t, we obtain the polynomial inequality (1 − 3t)(4t − 1) 2(11t + 1) ≥ 0, which is true. 9 Dumbassing To dumbass an inequality is to mindlessly brute-force the inequality by ﬁrst expanding it out into a polynomial expression, and then using Muirhead and AM-GM many, many times and adding everything up to obtain the desired inequality. This “art of dumbassing” is enunciated in Brian Hamrick’s article5 on Chinese Dumbass Notation. 10 Lagrange Multipliers The method of Lagrange multipliers is a technique for ﬁnding the maximum and minimum of a function subject to various constraints. This method is highly looked down upon by Olympiad graders, as it involves Multivariable Calculus, and thus it is often referred to as “Lagrange murderpliers” by MOPpers. In addition, in order to receive full points for a Lagrange multipliers solution, one must fully rigorize all of one’s steps, such as compactiﬁcation. The method is outlined below: Theorem 10.1. To ﬁnd the maximum and minimum values of f (x, y, z) subject to the constraint g(x, y, z) = k (assuming that these extreme values exist): 1. Find all values of x, y, z, and λ such that ∇f (x, y, z) = λ∇g(x, y, z), g(x, y, z) = k. 2. Evaluate f at all the points (x, y, z) that result from the previous step. The largest of these values is the maximum value of f ; the smallest is the minimum value of f . Example 10.1. Let 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1 2 be real numbers with a + b + c = 1. Show that a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 4abc ≤ 9 32 . Solution. (Thomas Mildorf) Let f (a, b, c) = a 3 + b3 + c3 + 4abc and g(a, b, c) = a + b + c − 1. Because f and g are polynomials, they have continuous ﬁrst partial derivatives. Moreover, the gradient of g is never zero. Hence, by the theorem of Lagrange multipliers, any extrema occur on the boundary or where ∇f = λ∇g for suitable scalars λ. As ∇f = ⟨3a 2 + 4bc, 3b2 + 4ca, 3c 2 + 4ab⟩ 5http://www.tjhsst.edu/~2010bhamrick/files/dumbassing.pdf 10 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Inequalities Robin Park and ∇g =< 1, 1, 1 >, we have λ = 3a 2 + 4bc, = 3b 2 + 4ca, = 3c 2 + 4ab, g(a, b, c) = a + b + c − 1. We have 3a 2 + 4bc = 3b 2 + 4ca or (a − b)(3a + 3b − 4c) = (a − b)(3 − 7c) = 0 for any permutation of a, b, and c. Hence, without loss of generality, a = b. Now, 3a2 + 4ac = 3c 2 + 4a 2 and a 2 − 4ac + 3c2 = (a − c)(a − 3c) = 0. The interior local extrema therefore occur when a = b = c or when two of {a, b, c} are three times as large as the third. Checking, we have f ( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ) = 7 27 < 13 49 = f ( 1 7 , 3 7 , 3 7 ). Recalling that f (a, b, c) is symmetric in a, b, and c, the only boundary check we need is f ( 1 2 , t, 1 2 − t) ≤ 9 32 for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 2 . We solve h(t) = f ( 1 2 , t, 1 2 − t ) = 1 8 + t3 + ( 1 2 − t)3 + 2t ( 1 2 − t) = 1 4 + t 4 − t 2 2 . h(t) is 1 4 at either endpoint. Its derivative h ′(t) = 1 4 − t is zero only at t = 1 4 . Checking, h( 1 4 ) = f ( 1 2 , 1 4 , 1 4 ) = 9 32 . Since h(t) has a continuous derivative, we are done. (As a further check, we could observe that h ′′(t) = −1 < 0, which guarantees that h( 1 4 ) is a local minimum.) 11 Problems 1.
