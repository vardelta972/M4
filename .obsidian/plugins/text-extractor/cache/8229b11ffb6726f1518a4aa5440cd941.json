Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC and let Γ denote its circumcircle. A point D is on arc AB of Γ not containing C. A point E is on arc AC of Γ not containing B. If AD = CE prove that BE is parallel to AD. 2. Find all triples (p, q, r) of primes such that pq = r + 1 and 2(p2 + q2) = r2 + 1. 3. A ﬁnite non-empty set of integers is called 3-good if the sum of its elements is divisible by 3. Find the number of non-empty 3-good subsets of {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}. 4. In a triangle ABC, points D and E are on segments BC and AC such that BD = 3DC and AE = 4EC. Point P is on line ED such that D is the midpoint of segment EP . Lines AP and BC intersect at point S. Find the ratio BS/SD. 5. Let a1, b1, c1 be natural numbers. We deﬁne a2 = gcd(b1, c1) , b2 = gcd(c1, a1) , c2 = gcd(a1, b1) , and a3 = lcm(b2, c2) , b3 = lcm(c2, a2) , c3 = lcm(a2, b2) . Show that gcd(b3, c3) = a2. 6. Let P (x) = x3 + ax2 + b and Q(x) = x3 + bx + a, where a, b are non-zero real numbers. Suppose that the roots of the equation P (x) = 0 are the reciprocals of the roots of the equation Q(x) = 0. Prove that a and b are integers. Find the greatest common divisor of P (2013! + 1) and Q(2013! + 1). ————— ◦ —————","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
