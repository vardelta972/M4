[10] Show that for every prime number p, we can ﬁnd some positive integer n so that 2 n + 3n + 6n − 1 is divisible by p. 11 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 4 — Modulo Arithmetic Week 2 Evaluation Test 2 Solutions Yufei Zhao July 28, 2007 1. (a) [3] State Fermat’s little theorem. Solution: If p is a prime number, and a is an integer not divisible by p, then ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). (b) [7] Prove Fermat’s little theorem. Solution: Consider the two sets {1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1} and {a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a}. We claim that the elements in the second set are simply a permutation of the elements in the ﬁrst set. This is because no two i, j gets taken to the same residue when multiplied by a, as ia ≡ ja implies that p | (i − j)a, which implies that p|i − j, which implies that i = j (as 1 ≤ i, j < p). Furthermore, none of the elements in the second set is divisible by p. Since there are only p − 1 nonzero residues in mod p, the second set must then be the same as the ﬁrst set. Then, by multiplying together all the elements in each set, we obtain that 1 · 2 · 3 · · · · · (p − 1) ≡ a · 2a · 3a · · · · · (p − 1)a ≡ 1 · 2 · 3 · · · · (p − 1) · a p−1 (mod p). Since 1 · 2 · 3 · · · · · (p − 1) is not divisible by p, it follows that ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). Alternate solution: We will prove that ap ≡ a for all a ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , p − 1} by induction on a. For a = 0, the result is clear. Assume ap ≡ a (mod p). Then (a + 1)p = ap + 1 + p−1∑ k=1 (p k ) a k ≡ ap + 1 ≡ a + 1 (mod p). Here we used the fact that (p k) is divisible by p for 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 1 (this is true since in the expansion (p k) = p! (p−k)!k! , the factor p in the numerator cannot get canceled by any factors in the denominator). Therefore, ap ≡ a (mod p) implies that (a + 1)p ≡ a + 1, and the induction is complete. Since ap ≡ a (mod p) is true for all residue classes mod p, it must be true for all integers a. Furthermore, if a is not divisible by p, then ap ≡ a (mod p) implies that ap−1 ≡ 1, as desired. 2. [10] Show that if a and b are relatively prime positive integers, then there exist integers m and n such that am + bn ≡ 1 (mod ab). Solution: Set m = ϕ(b) and n = ϕ(a). Then am ≡ 1 (mod b) and bn ≡ 1 (mod a) by Euler’ theorem. It follows that am + bn − 1 is divisible by both a and b, and so it’s divisible by ab (since a and b are relatively prime). Therefore, am + bn ≡ 1 (mod ab). 12 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 4 — Modulo Arithmetic Week 2 3. [10] Let a and b > 2 be positive integers. Show that 2a + 1 is not divisible by 2b − 1. Solution: Suppose that there exists such a pair a, b so that 2a + 1 is divisible by 2b − 1. Let a = qb + r, where q, r are integers and 0 ≤ r < b. Note that 2b ≡ 1 (mod 2b − 1). So 2 a + 1 = 2 qb+r + 1 = (2 b) q · 2 r + 1 ≡ (1)q · 2r + 1 = 2 r + 1 (mod 2b − 1). It follows that 2b − 1 divides 2r + 1, so 2b − 1 ≤ 2r + 1. However, since r < b, we have 2r + 1 ≤ 2b−1 + 1. Combining the two inequalities, we get 2b − 1 ≤ 2b−1 + 1, and thus 2b−1 ≤ 2, so b ≤ 2, which contradicts the hypothesis that b > 2. 4. [10] Show that for every prime number p, we can ﬁnd some positive integer n so that 2n + 3n + 6n − 1 is divisible by p. Solution: If p = 2 or p = 3, then we can choose n = 2. Otherwise, choose n = p − 2. Since none of 2, 3, 6 is divisible by p, using Fermat’s little theorem, we have 6(2 p−2 + 3p−2 + 6p−2 − 1) = 3 · 2 p−1 + 2 · 3p−1 + 6p−1 − 6 ≡ 3 + 2 + 1 − 6 = 0 (mod p) It follows that 6(2p−2 + 3p−2 + 6p−2 − 1) is divisible by p, and therefore 2p−2 + 3p−2 + 6p−2 − 1 is divisible by p. Remarks: This problem is related to the identity 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 − 1 = 0. Fermat’s little theorem tells us that the inverse of an element can be found by a−1 ≡ ap−2 (mod p). 13","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
