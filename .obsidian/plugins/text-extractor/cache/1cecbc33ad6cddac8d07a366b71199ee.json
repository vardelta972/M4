Sep. 23, start of class Instructions: For this assignment, you should do all problems by hand. 3.3 Inverses mod p Exercise 3.6. Let G = (Z/7Z)×. We represent the elements of G by 1, 2, . . . , 6. (i) Write down the multiplication table for G. (ii) Let H = {1, 6}. Show H is a subgroup of G. (It suﬃces to check H is closed under multiplication and each element of H has an inverse in H. In other words, you may use the ﬁrst lemma of the next section.) (iii) Determine the cosets of H in G. (iv) Repeat (ii) and (iii) for the set H = {1, 2, 4}. 3.4 Fermat’s little theorem Exercise 3.7. Check that the powers of a cyclically repeat in this example. (i) With the notation in the previous exercise (in (Z/7Z)×), compute 3k for 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. (ii) What is the cyclic subgroup of (Z/7Z)× generated by 3? What about generated by 2? Exercise 3.8. Use the formula a−1 ≡ ap−2 mod p to compute the inverse of 5 mod 11. 3.5 Congruence theorems of Wilson and Lagrange Exercise 3.9. Exercises 3.5.1, 3.5.2, 3.5.3. (Correction: 3.5.1 should say if n > 5 is not prime, show n|(n − 1)!) Exercise 3.10. Let P (x) = x2 +1. Clearly P (x) = 0 is not solvable in Z. However P (x) ≡ 0 mod 5 is solvable mod 5. Determine all solutions. 3.6 Inverses mod k Exercise 3.11. For 2 ≤ k ≤ 7 and k = 9, do the following. Write down the elements in (Z/kZ)× and state the order of the group. For each a ∈ (Z/kZ)×, ﬁnd the smallest n such that an = 1. Determine if (Z/kZ)× is cyclic or not. If it is cyclic, state an element that generates the group. Exercise 3.12. Show ϕ(pj) = pj−1(p − 1) for j ≥ 1. (Exercises 3.6.1, 3.6.2, 3.6.3.) Exercise 3.13. We will show in Chapter 9 that if m and n are relatively prime, then ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Check this in the special cases (i) m = 3 and n = 5 (Exercise 3.6.4), and (ii) m = 2 and n is an odd prime. Exercise 3.14. Determine ϕ(60). Exercise 3.15. Following the proof of Fermat’s little theorem, prove Euler’s theorem in the same way: For any invertible a mod k, we have aϕ(k) ≡ 1 mod k. (Cf. p. 56.) 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
