Suppose that A(x) = ∑n k=0 akxk, B(x) = ∑m k=0 bkxk and C(x) = ∑n−m k=0 ckxk. If A(x) = B(x)C(x) holds for all x ∈ R (or, for at least n + 1 many x ∈ R) then show that for each 0 ≤ k ≤ n, we must have ak = ∑ i+j=k bicj, where the sum is over all integers 0 ≤ i ≤ m and 0 ≤ j ≤ n − m such that i + j = k. 2. Prove that a quadratic or cubic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients having no rational root cannot be factorised into non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. 3. Show that there do not exist two non-constant polynomials p(x) and q(x) each having integer coeﬃcients such that p(x)q(x) = x5 + 2x + 1. (Hint? See the footnote 1.) Playing with Roots & Degree Our goal is to show that a given polynomial f (x) cannot be factorised as a product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. We begin with the assumption that f (x) = p(x)q(x). Then we use speciﬁc values of x (may be zeros of f or p, q) that eventually leads to a contradiction. We might construct a new polynomial (using p, q) which has more zeros than its degree, play with their coeﬃcients, bound the modulus of a root, use triangle inequality etc. Example. Suppose n is an odd natural number and a1, . . . , an are distinct integers. Show that the polynomial f (x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an) + 1 cannot be factorised as the product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Solution. Let, if possible, f (x) = p(x)q(x) for some polynomials p(x), q(x) with integer coef- ﬁcients. Putting x = ai in the equation p(x)q(x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an) + 1, we get p(ai)q(ai) = 1. Since p(ai), q(ai) are integers, this implies that p(ai) = q(ai) = ±1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Now consider h(x) = p(x) − q(x). We require p(x) and q(x) to be non-constant, which forces each of them to have degree < n. So deg h(x) is at most n − 1. But we have h(ai) = 0 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n and the ai’s are all distinct. Therefore h has more roots than its degree, which is possible only when h is the zero polynomial. But then p(x) = q(x), which implies (x − a1) · · · (x − an) + 1 = p(x)2. Note that the RHS is a polynomial of even degree, whereas the degree of the LHS is odd, a contradiction. □ 1Hint: First show that none of p or q can be linear. Then compare coeﬃcients. 1 Notation. We shall write p(x) ∈ Z[x] to denote that p(x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. If p(x) cannot be factorised as a product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, we say that p(x) is irreducible over Z[x]. Now try out the following problems. 4. Does the conclusion of the above example hold if n is even? 5. Let n be any natural number and a1, a2, . . . , an be distinct integers. Prove that the polynomial f (x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an) − 1 is irreducible over Z[x]. 6. Suppose p(x) is a polynomial of degree 2019 having integer coeﬃcients satisfying p(ai) ∈ {−1, +1} for 2019 distinct integers a1, . . . , a2019. Show that p(x) is irreducible over Z[x]. 7. Let a1, . . . , an be distinct integers. Show that f (x) = (x − a1) 2(x − a2)2 · · · (x − an)2 + 1 is irreducible over Z[x]. Example. Show that P (x) = xn + 4 is irreducible over Z[x] if and only if 4 ∤ n. Solution. If r be any zero of the polynomial P, the equation rn + 4 = 0 yields that |r| = 2 2/n. Suppose P (x) = Q(x)R(x) where Q and R are polynomials from Z[x] and deg Q = k. Then Q has k complex zeros, each with modulus 2 2/n. Hence |Q(0)|, which is the product of the moduli of the zeros of Q, equals 2 2k/n. Since this should be an integer, n must divide 2k, which implies that n = 2k because 0 < k < n. Now if k is odd, then the polynomial Q(x) must have a real zero. But P (x) has no real root, because x2k + 4 > 0 for any x ∈ R. Therefore k must be even. We have shown that if P (x) is reducible then n must be a multiple of 4. The other side follows from the identity x4m + 4 = (x2m + 2)2 − (2xm) 2 = (x2m + 2xm + 2)(x2m − 2xm + 2). □ 8. If α is a root of the polynomial p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn with real coeﬃcients (an ̸= 0), then show that |α| ≤ 1 + max 0≤k≤n−1 \f \f \f ak an \f \f \f. 9. Let a0 + 10a1 + · · · + 10nan be the decimal representation of a prime number such that an ≥ 2, n > 1. Prove that the polynomial p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn cannot be written as a product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. 10. Let P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that |a0| is prime and |a0| > |a1| + |a2| + · · · + |an|. Prove that P (x) is irreducible over Z[x]. (Hint: If r ∈ C is a zero of P (x) then show that |r| > 1. Assuming P (x) = Q(x)R(x), deduce that at least one among |Q(0)| and |R(0)| is 1. Now use Vieta’s formulae.) 11. Show that for n ≥ 2, the polynomial xn + xn−1 + 3 is irreducible in Z[x]. 2 12. Find all pairs of integers a, b for which there exists a polynomial P (x) ∈ Z[x] such that product (x2 + ax + b) · P (x) is a polynomial of a form xn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c1x + c0 where each of c0, c1, . . . , cn−1 is equal to 1 or −1. Eisenstein’s Criterion Theorem. (Eisenstein’s Criterion) Let A(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients and p be a prime dividing a0, a1, · · · , an−1, such that p ∤ an and p2 ∤ a0. Then A(x) is irreducible over Z[x]. Proof. Let, if possible, A(x) = B(x)C(x) for some non-constant polynomials B(x), C(x) with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose that B(x) = ∑m k=0 bkxk and C(x) = ∑n−m k=0 ckxk. Since A(x) = B(x)C(x) holds for all x ∈ R, it must hold for each 0 ≤ k ≤ n that ak = ∑ i+j=k bicj, where the sum is over all integers 0 ≤ i ≤ m and 0 ≤ j ≤ n − m such that i + j = k. Let us start with a0 = b0c0. Since p | a0 but p2 ∤ a0, we can say that exactly one among b0 and c0 is divisible by p. W.l.o.g assume that p | b0 and p ∤ c0. Next, a1 = b0c1 + b1c0. Since p | a1, p | b0 but p ∤ c0, we get p | b1. What does the next relation a2 = b0c2 + b1c1 + b2c0 give? It gives p | b2. Continuing in this manner, we eventually get from am = b0cm + · · · + bmc0 that p | bm. (Note that here we have p | am because m < n.) But now that we have shown p | bi for each i, we can see that an = ∑ i+j=n bicj implies p | an, which is a contradiction. □ The proof was straightforward. Let us now look at a few examples. Example. Consider the polynomial P (x) = 3x4 + 15x2 + 10. In order for Eisenstein’s criterion to apply for a prime number p it must divide both non-leading coeﬃcients 15 and 10, which means only p = 5 could work, and indeed it does, since 5 does not divide the leading coeﬃcient 3, and its square 25 does not divide the constant coeﬃcient 10. We therefore conclude that P (x) is irreducible over Z[x]. Example. Consider P (x) = 3x9 + 18x3 − 60x + 6. Here p = 3 won’t do, because it divides the leading coeﬃcient. However, p = 2 does the job. Eisenstein’s criterion with p = 2 tells us that P (x) must be irreducible over Z[x]. Remark. Eisenstein’s criterion is very speciﬁc. There are many problems (e.g. problem #3 above) where the polynomial is irreducible but the does not satisfy Eisenstein’s criterion for any prime p. It is also possible that a polynomial fails to satisfy the criterion for one prime, but satisﬁes for some other prime (e.g. the polynomial in the last example). 3 13. Show that the polynomial f (x) = (2 5 − 1) + (210 − 1)x2 + (215 − 1)x3 + (218 − 1)x4 is irreducible over Z[x]. 14. Show that for any positive integer n, there are inﬁnitely many irreducible polynomial of degree n having integer coeﬃcients. Often Eisenstein’s criterion does not apply directly, but it applies (for some prime number) to the polynomial obtained after substituting x + a for x (for some integer a). The fact that the polynomial after the substitution is irreducible then allows us to conclude that the original polynomial is irreducible as well. This idea is known as applying a shift. Trick 1. If f (x) ∈ Z[x] is irreducible over Z[x], then so is the polynomial g(x) = f (x + a), for any a ∈ Z. Proof. If f (x + a) can be factorised as p(x)q(x), then f (x) can be written as p(x − a)q(x − a). And if a polynomial p(x) has integer coeﬃcients then so does p(x − a). □ Example. Consider P (x) = x3 − 3x2 + 5. Note that Eisenstein’s criterion does not apply directly to P. But if one substitutes x + 1 for x in P, one obtains the polynomial Q(x) = P (x + 1) = (x + 1) 3 − 3(x + 1) 2 + 5 = x3 − 3x + 3 which satisﬁes Eisenstein’s criterion for the prime number 3. Thus Q(x) is irreducible over Z[x], which proves that P (x) must also be irreducible. Another possibility to transform a polynomial so as to satisfy the criterion (which may be combined with applying a shift), is reversing the order of its coeﬃcients, provided its constant term is nonzero (without which it would be divisible by x anyway). Trick 2. Suppose that a0, . . . , an ∈ Z such that f (x) = ∑n k=0 akxk is irreducible over Z[x]. Then the polynomial ˆf (x) = ∑n k=0 an−kxk, obtained by reversing the coeﬃcients of f (x), must also be irreducible. Proof. Observe that ˆf (1/x) = f (x)/x n. Let, if possible, ˆf (x) be factorised as p(x)q(x). Suppose deg p(x) = k and deg q(x) = m. Clearly, k + m = deg f (x) = n. Then we can write f (x) = xn ˆf (1/x) = xnp(1/x)q(1/x) = xkp(1/x) · xmq(1/x) for every x ̸= 0. Since p(x), q(x) are integer polynomials, so are xkp(1/x) and xmq(1/x) (their coeﬃcients are same as p and q, just in reverse order). Thus f becomes reducible if ˆf is so. □ 4 Remark. Here we are reversing the coeﬃcients in exact same order. For instance, ˆf corresponding to f (x) = x4 + 2x + 3 is ˆf (x) = 3x4 + 2x3 + 1 (not 3x4 + 2x + 1). And any arbitrary permutation of the coeﬃcients won’t do; e.g. 2x2 + x + 1 is irreducible but x2 + 2x + 1 is not. Example. The polynomial 2x5 − 4x2 − 3 satisﬁes the criterion for p = 2 after reversing its coeﬃcients, and is therefore irreducible in Z[x]. Example. Consider the polynomial p(x) = 4x3+12x2+3x+1. Note that p(x) satisﬁes the requirements of Eisenstein’s criterion neither directly, nor after reversing its coeﬃcients. So we try some shift. First we check p(x+1), which simpliﬁes to 4x3 +24x2 +39x+20. Since this does not work, we try with p(x − 1). Note that p(x − 1) = 4x3 − 9x + 6. Although this does not meet the requirements directly, it does so after reversing the coeﬃcients (with p = 3). Hence we conclude that p(x) is irreducible over Z[x]. 15. Show that the polynomial f (x) = x4 − 4ax2 + 1 is irreducible over Z[x] for any a ∈ Z. 16. Suppose p is a prime number. Show that the polynomial 1 + x + x2 + · · · + xp−1 is irreducible over Z[x]. 17. Prove that p(x) = x4 + x3 − 3x2 − 5x + 1 is irreducible over Z[x]. 18. Prove that q(x) = 3x5 − 9x3 − 2016x + 2018 is irreducible over Z[x]. 19. Show that f (x) = 20x4 − 2018x3 + 6x2 − 4x + 1 is irreducible over Z[x]. 20. (Extended Eisenstein’s Criterion) Let a0, a1, . . . , an be integers and p be a prime such that p divides each of a0, a1, a2, . . . , ak, but p ∤ ak+1 and p2 ∤ a0. Show that the polynomial f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 has an irreducible factor of degree more than k. That is, if f (x) = g(x)h(x) then at least one among g(x) and h(x) has degree > k. 21. For an integer n > 1, show that f (x) = xn + 5xn−1 + 3 is irreducible over Z[x]. 22. Let m, n and a be natural numbers and p < a − 1 a prime number. Prove that the polynomial f (x) = xm(x − a) n + p is irreducible. Rational Coeﬃcients The following three problems will tell you how to deal with rational coeﬃcients. 23. Suppose that f (x) is a polynomial wih rational coeﬃcients. Show that there exists a polyno- mial ̃f (x) with integer coeﬃcients such that f (x) = c d · ̃f (x) where c, d are coprime integers and gcd of the coeﬃcients of ̃f (x) is 1. 5 24. We call a polynomial f (x) having integer coeﬃcients to be primitive if the gcd of the co- eﬃcients of f (x) is 1. Show that product of two primitive polynomials is also a primitive polynomial. 25. (Gauss’ Lemma) Suppose f (x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Show that f (x) is irreducible over Z[x] if and only if f (x) is irreducible over Q[x], i.e. f (x) cannot be factorised into non-constant polynomials with rational coeﬃcients. References 1.

To show that x5 + 2x + 1 does not have any rational root, we can use the rational root theorem. Since f does not have any rational root, neither of p or q can be linear. Assume w.l.o.g that p is quadratic and q is cubic. Note that p and q may be written (by taking −p and −q if needed) as (x2 + bx + c) and (x3 + mx 2 + nx + k) respectively. Now compare coeﬃcients to get ck = 1, cn + kb = 2, k + nb + m = 0, c + mb + n = 0, b + m = 0. We wish to show that this set of equations has no solution for integers c, k, b, m, n. First note that ck = 1 implies c = k = ±1. Hence we can rewrite the equation cn + kb = 2 as n + b = 2c and we can equate the third and fourth equations to write nb + m = mb + n. Thus we get n + b = 2c, m + b = 0, nb + m = mb + n. First two of these tell us that m ̸= n. Hence the last one gives b = 1 and then m = −1, n = 2c − 1. But then c + mb + n ̸= 0 for either values of c (recall, c = 1 or −1), contradiction! 4. No. For instance, (x − 3)(x − 5) + 1 = (x − 4) 2. 5. Let, if possible, f (x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an) − 1 = p(x)q(x). Note that for each i we have p(ai)q(ai) = −1, which implies p(ai), q(ai) are (1, −1) or (−1, 1). Now consider the polynomial h(x) = p(x) + q(x), which vanishes for each ai (1 ≤ i ≤ n). But deg(h(x)) is at most n − 1. Hence h must be the zero polynomial, i.e. p(x) must be identically equal to −q(x). But considering the leading coeﬃcients on both sides of the identity (x − a1)(x − a2). . . (x − an) − 1 = −p(x)2 we get a contradiction. 6 6. Suppose that p(x) = u(x)v(x). Then one of these factors, say u(x) has degree 1009 or less. Since p(ai) = ±1 for the 2019 diﬀerent integers a1, . . . , a2019, this forces u(ai) = ±1 as well. But then for at least 1010 of these ai, we must have u(ai) equaling only one value, say −1. This forces u(x) to be the constant polynomial −1, contradicting the fact that it is a non-constant polynomial. 7. Let, if possible, f (x) = p(x)q(x). We must have p(ai) = q(ai) = ±1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If p(ai) = 1 and p(aj) = −1 then there exists c between ai and aj such that p(c) = 0. But this is not possible since p(c)q(c) = f (c) ≥ 1. Thus we conclude that all the p(ai)’s are equal and same for the q(ai)’s. We may assume w.l.o.g that p(ai) = q(ai) = 1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Now if any one among p and q, say p, had degree less than n then this would imply that p must be the zero polynomial. But this is not possible, again because f (x) ≥ 1 for all x ∈ R. Therefore we conclude that both p and q must have degree n. And note that p(x)q(x) = (x − a1)2 · · · (x − an) 2 + 1 implies that the leading coeﬃcients of p, q must be the same. Hence by considering the polynomial p(x) − q(x) we can show that p(x) and q(x) must be identical. Then the equation f (x) = p(x) 2 can be written as ((x − a1) · · · (x − an) − p(x)) ((x − a1) · · · (x − an) + p(x)) = 1. Now the leading coeﬃ- cients of both the factors above must be zero. If the leading coeﬃcient of p(x) be s then we need 1 − s = 0 as well as 1 + s = 0, which is not possible. 8. Note that the bound is trivial if |α| = 0 or 1. Assume now that |α| ̸= 0, 1. It is given that ∑n k=0 akαk = 0. We transfer the term anαn to the RHS and use triangle inequality to obtain |anαn| = \f \f \f n−1∑ k=0 akαk\f \f \f ≤ n−1∑ k=0 |ak||α| k ≤ max 0≤k≤n−1 |ak| ( n−1∑ k=0 |α| k) = max 0≤k≤n−1 |ak| ( |α| n − 1 |α| − 1 ) . The second inequality above comes from the fact that each |ai| is less than max 0≤k≤n−1 |ak|. Now just cross-multiply to arrive at |α| − 1 ≤ max 0≤k≤n−1 \f \f \f \f ak an \f \f \f \f ( |α| n − 1 |α|n ) ≤ max 0≤k≤n−1 \f \f \f \f ak an \f \f \f \f . 9. Let, if possible, q(x) and r(x) be non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients such that p(x) = q(x)r(x). Let x1, . . . , xk be the zeros of q(x) and xk+1, . . . , xn be the zeros of r(x). Since q(10)r(10) = p(10) which is a prime, and q(10), r(10) both are integers, one of them must be ±1. We can assume w.l.o.g that q(10) = ±1. Then |q(10)| = |(10 − x1)(10 − x2) · · · (10 − xk)| = 1. On the other hand, the inequality in the last problem tells us that each 7 zero xi has a modulus less than 1 + 9/2 = 11/2 < 9, hence |10 − xi| > 1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ k, which contradicts the above equality. 10. Some hints are already given. You may proceed as in problem 9. For full solution, consult Zhao’s note (cited in the references section above). 11. Use the previous problem. 12. The answer is the following: a = ±1 and b = ±1, in this case take P (x) ≡ 1; a = 0 and b = ±1, in this case take P (x) ≡ x + 1; a = ±2 and b = 1; in this case take P (x) ≡ x − 1. The main idea is: any root z of x2 + ax + b satisﬁes |z| ≤ 2. (Proof. Since z is a root of (x2 + ax + b) · P (x), we have |z| n = \f \f \f ∑n−1 k=0 ckzk\f \f \f ≤ ∑n−1 k=0 |z| k with the last inequality be triangle inequality. So if |z| ≥ 2, then we get a contradiction.) Next show that b = ±1. Now if |a| ≥ 3, the roots of x2 + ax ± 1 are 1 2(|a| + √ |a|2 ± 4) and one of these is greater than 2. The same is true for |a| = 2 and b = −1. Thus there are no answers other than the ones we claimed. 13. Use Eisenstein’s criterion. 14. For any prime p, the polynomial xn + p is irreducible. 15. & 16. Replace x by x + 1. 17. Replace x by x − 1. 18. Reverse the coeﬃcients. 19. Reverse the coeﬃcients and then change x to x + 1. 20. Mimic the proof of Eisenstein’s criterion. 21. Use the previous problem. 22. Let, if possible, f (x) = g(x)h(x) for some non-constant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Since |f (0)| = p, either |g(0)| = 1 or |h(0)| = 1 holds. Assume w.l.o.g. that |g(0)| = 1. Write g(x) = (x − α1) · · · (x − αk). Note that |g(0)| = 1 gives |α1 · · · αk| = 1. On the other hand, f (αi) = 0 yields that αm i (αi − a) n = −p for each i. Taking the product over i = 1, 2, . . . , k yields pk = |(α1 − a) · · · (αk − a)| = |g(a)| n. Now g(a) divides |g(a)h(a)| = p, and g(a) = ±1 makes the last equation impossible. So we must have |g(a)| = p and hence k = n. But then a must divide |g(a) − g(0)| = p ± 1, which is impossible. (P.S. You might be wondering why this problem is included in the section on Eisenstein’s criterion. I did that intentionally, to give you the message that one should not think Eisenstein’s criterion to be the only tool when you are asked to prove irreducibility of a polynomial that involves some prime.) 8 23. Take the lcm of the denominators and then extract out the gcd from the numerator. Here is an example of this algorithm: 3 4x2 − 3 2x + 15 7 = 1 28(21x2 − 42x + 60) = 3 28(7x2 − 14x + 20). 24. Let f (x) = ∑ k≥0 akxk and g(x) = ∑ k≥0 bkxk be two primitive polynomials. If the prod- uct f (x)g(x) is not primitive, there must be a prime p which is a common divisor of all its coeﬃcients. But p can not divide all the coeﬃcients of either f (x) or g(x) (otherwise they would not be primitive). Let r be the minimum index such that ar is not divisible by p and let s be the minimum index such that bs is not divisible by p. Now consider the term xr+s in the product. Its coeﬃcient (which can be 0 as well) must take the form: arbs + ar+1bs−1 + ar+2bs−2 + · · · + ar−1bs+1 + ar−2bs+2 + · · · . The ﬁrst term is not divisible by p (because p is prime), yet all the remaining ones are, so the entire sum cannot be divis- ible by p. But by assumption all coeﬃcients in the product are divisible by p, leading to a contradiction. 25. Let, if possible, f be irreducible over Z[x] but reducible over Q[x]. Suppose that f (x) = p(x)q(x) where p, q are polynomials having rational coeﬃcients. Use problem 23 to write f (x) = (a/b)̃p(x)̃q(x) where ̃p, ̃q are primitive. Now by problem 24, the polynomial ̃p(x)̃q(x) must also be primitive. Hence deduce from bf (x) = ãp(x)̃q(x) that b = ±1, which in turn implies that f is reducible (contradiction). Another way to visualise Eisenstein’s criterion: Reduce the equation A(x) = B(x)C(x) modulo p. What do I mean by that? Reduce every coeﬃcient mod p for each of these polynomials. Let a denote a reduced mod p. Since p | ai for each 1 ≤ i < n but not for i = n, we get A(x) = anxn. Let B(x) = ∑ j≥0 bjxj, C(x) = ∑ j≥0 cjxj. Reducing the identity A(x) = B(x)C(x) modulo p (note that we are actually reducing the coeﬃcients modulo p) we get the equation anxn = B(x)C(x) = (∑ j≥0 bjxj)( ∑ j≥0 cjxj) which is a polynomial identity by itself. It is clear that the last identity is possibly iﬀ B(x) and C(x) are of the form βxk and γxn−k for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n (where βγ = an). Now if 0 < k < n then both B(x) and C(x) do not have any constant term, which means that the constant terms of both B(x) and C(x) must be divisible by p, which contradicts that p2 ∤ a0. On the other hand, if k = 0 then p must divide each coeﬃcient of B(x) except its constant term, and this contradicts that p ∤ an. Similar contradiction arises through C(x) if k = n. Thus, if a polynomial meets the criteria given by Eisenstein, then it must be irreducible over Z[x]. 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
