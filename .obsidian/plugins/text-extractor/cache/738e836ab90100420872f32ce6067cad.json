Basic Properties Recall that in Unit 0, we came across the problem of finding the odd one out among the following group of numbers: 13, 17, 25, 39, 45 We remarked that 39 is the odd one out, for it leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 4, while the others leave a remainder of 1 when divided by 4. In view of this, integers can be classified into four types, according to whether they leave a remainder of 0, 1, 2 or 3 when divided by 4. Of course, there is no need to restrict ourselves to dividing by 4. The division algorithm (Lemma 2.2 in Unit 1) asserts that given any integers a, b with 0a ≠ , there exist unique integers q, r, 0 | |ra≤< , such that baq r=+ . The number r is called the remainder when b is divided by a. It may take one of the values 0, 1, …, 1a − . Hence we may classify the integers into a types according to their remainders upon division by a. This leads us to the following definition. Definition 1.1. Let 0m ≠ be an integer. We say that x is congruent to y modulo m, denoted as x ≡ y (mod m), if |mx y− . Illustrations. 38 ≡ 74 (mod 4), 6≡ –1 (mod 7), 83 ≡ 123 (mod 10). Note that xy≡ (mod m) means that x and y leave the same remainder when divided by m. As for divisibility, we have the following basic properties about congruences which are easy to verify. Mathematical Database Page 2 of 11 Theorem 1.1. Let a, b, c, d, m, n be integers, 0m ≠ , a ≡ b (mod m), c ≡ d (mod m). Then (1) ac bd±≡ ± (mod m) (2) ac bd≡ (mod m) (3) nnab≡ (mod m) (4) if |na , |nb and (m, n) = 1, we have ab nn ≡ (mod m). Example 1.1. Find the remainder when (a) 20028 is divided by 7 (b) 20033 is divided by 26 (c) 201978 is divided by 125 Solution. (a) 2002 200281 1≡= (mod 7). ∴ The remainder is 1. (b) 2003 3 667 2 667 2 667 23(3 ) (3 ) 27 3 1 3 9== ≡ = (mod 26) ∴ The remainder is 26. (c) 20 20 10 10 5 5 5 51978 ( 22) 484 ( 16) 256 6 2 3 32(243) 32( 7) 26≡− = ≡ − ≡ ≡ = = ≡ − ≡ (mod 125) ∴ The remainder is 26. Example 1.2. Show that a natural number N is divisible by 3 if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by 3. Solution. Write 12 1 0kkNa a a a a−= in its decimal notation. Then 12 12 1 0 12 12 1 0 12 1 0 10 10 10 10 1 11 1 1 1 (mod 3) kk kk kk kk kk Na a a a a aa a a a aa a a a − − − − − = × + × ++ × + ×+ × ≡× + × + + × + × + × =+ + + + + Mathematical Database Page 3 of 11 Hence 3 | N if and only if 3 | sum of digits of N. Remark. Compare this proof with the one given in Unit 1. In this proof, we showed that N is congruent to its sum of digits modulo 3. Hence we can easily find the remainder of a number upon division by 3 by considering its sum of digits. Example 1.3. Show that the sequence 11, 111, 1111, … contains no perfect squares. Solution. For all integers n, n ≡ 0, 1, 2 or 3 (mod 4). If n ≡ 0 or 2 (mod 4), then 2 0n ≡ (mod 4). If n ≡ 1 or 3 (mod 4), then 2 1n ≡ (mod 4). Note that in the sequence 11, 111, 1111, …, all terms leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 4. Thus there is no perfect square in the sequence. Example 1.4. Find the largest even number which cannot be expressed as the sum of two odd composite numbers. Solution. Let n be an even number. If 0n ≡ (mod 3), then we have 9 ( 9)nn=+ − . Since 9n − is divisible by 3, it is an odd composite number whenever 12n > . If 1n ≡ (mod 3), then we have 25 ( 25)nn=+ − . Since 25n − is divisible by 3, it is an odd composite number whenever 28n > . If 2n ≡ (mod 3), then we have 35 ( 35)nn=+ − . Since 35n − is divisible by 3, it is an odd composite number whenever 38n > . It follows that all even numbers greater than 38 can be expressed as the sum of two odd composite numbers. However, there is no way of writing 38 as the sum of two odd composite numbers (this can be seen by listing all odd composite numbers less than 38: 9, 15, 21, 25, 27, 35). Therefore, the answer is 38. Mathematical Database Page 4 of 11 2. The Euler φ-function In Example 1.1, part (b), we found that our calculation is very much simplified by expressing the number as a power of 33 , because 331≡ (mod 26). Therefore, in attempting to find the remainder when a certain power of a is divided by n, where a and n are given, we probably want to find an exponent k for which 1 ka ≡ (mod n). In the next section we will come across a theorem which enables us to find such an exponent efficiently. In order to understand the theorem, we first go over the Euler φ-function in this section. Definition 2.1. For positive integer n, we define ()nφ = number of positive integers not exceeding n that are relatively prime to n. Illustrations. (12) 4φ = since 1, 5, 7, 11 are relatively prime to 12. (16) 8φ = since 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 are relatively prime to 16. The Euler φ-function turns out to be an important function in number theory on which many theorems are built. Before we proceed, let’s study some nice properties of the function which facilitate easy computation of ()nφ for a given n. Theorem 2.1. Let a, b be relatively prime natural numbers, p be a prime number and m be a positive integer. Then (a) ( ) ( ) ( )ab a bφφ φ= (b) 1() mm mpp pφ −=− Illustrations. (a) (3) 2φ = , (4) 2φ = , (12) 4φ = ; (b) 44 3(16) (2 ) 2 2 8φφ== − =. Remark. Because of the property in (a), the function φ is said to be multiplicative. This is a very nice property because, if a function :f → is multiplicative, we need only know the value of f at prime powers. The other values can be computed via the prime factorization of a natural number. With the formula in (b), therefore, we can compute ( )nφ easily for all n. Mathematical Database Page 5 of 11 Example 2.1. Find (360)φ . Solution. 32 3 2 3 2 2 1 1 0(360) (2 3 5) (2 ) (3 ) (5) (2 2 )(3 3 )(5 5 ) 96φφ φ φ φ=× × = × × = − − − =. Example 2.2. Find all natural numbers n for which ( )nφ is odd. Solution. Clearly, (1) 1φ = is odd. Now suppose 1n > . Let 12 12 kee e knp p p= , where ip is prime and ie is a positive integer for i = 1, 2, …, k. Then () 1 1 () ii k ee ii i np pφ − = =−∏ . For ( )nφ to be odd, 1iiee iipp − − is odd for all i. If ip is odd, then 1iiee iipp − − is even since both ie ip and 1ie ip − are odd. So ip must be even, i.e. 2en = for some 0e > . Consequently, 1() 2 2 eenφ −=− . This cannot be odd unless 1e = , i.e. 2n = . Indeed, we check that (2) 1φ = is odd. Consequently, we see that ( )nφ is odd only if n = 1 or 2. 3. Euler’s and Fermat’s Theorems With the concept of the Euler φ-function in mind, we can now go into Euler’s Theorem, which helps us find an exponent k for which 1 ka ≡ (mod n) given integers a and n under certain conditions. Theorem 3.1. (Euler’s Theorem) Let a and n be relatively prime natural numbers. Then () 1 naφ ≡ (mod n). Mathematical Database Page 6 of 11 Illustration. (3, 100) = 1, 22 2 1 2 1(100) (2 ) (5 ) (2 2 )(5 5 ) 40φφ φ== − − =. Thus 4031≡ (mod 100). Remark. Given natural numbers a and n, we say that b is an inverse of a modulo n if ab ≡ 1 (mod n). For example, 7 is an inverse of 4 (mod 9) since 4 7 1×≡ (mod 9). Inverses are useful in simplifying computations and solving congruence equations such as 4 3x ≡ (mod 7), but in general finding an inverse is not easy. Nevertheless, Euler’s Theorem tells us that when (a, n) = 1, () 1naφ − is an inverse of a (mod n). Example 3.1. Find the last two digits of 200217 . Solution. As we have seen, (100) 40φ = . Since (17, 100) = 1, Euler’s theorem asserts that 4017 1≡ (mod 100). ∴ () 502002 40 2 5017 17 17 1 289 89≡≡ ⋅ ≡ (mod 100). Hence the last two digits are 89. When p is prime, then ( ) 1ppφ =− . As a particular case of the Euler’s theorem, we have Theorem 3.2. (Fermat Little Theorem) Let p be a prime and (a, p) = 1. Then 1 1 pa − ≡ (mod p). Illustration. 2003 is prime. (1234, 2003) = 1. Thus 20021234 1≡ (mod 2003). Example 3.2. Let p be a prime number, 3p ≡ (mod 4) and 22|pa b+ for some integers a and b. Prove that |pa and |pb . Solution. Suppose |pa/ . Then we must have |pb/ as well. Consequently, we have ( , ) ( , ) 1pa p b== and so Fermat Little Theorem applies. Mathematical Database Page 7 of 11 Since 22ba≡− (mod p), by Fermat Little Theorem, we have, on one hand, () ( ) ( ) ( ) 22 222 2 1 211 pp pab a a a −− −≡ − ≡− ≡− =− (mod p), so that () () 1 1 12 222 2(1) 1 p p pppab ab − − −−−=≡ − ≡ − (mod p), where we made use of the fact that p ≡ 3 (mod 4) which implies 1 2 p − is odd. On the other hand, 2pab − is also relatively prime to p, so Fermat Little Theorem asserts that () 12 1 ppab −− ≡ (mod p). Since 2p ≠ , this is a contradiction. So we must have |pa and hence |pb . 4. The Chinese Remainder Theorem To motivate our discussion, let’s consider the following example: A positive integer n leaves a remainder of 3 when divided by 5 and a remainder of 4 when divided by 7. What is the smallest possible value of n? Solving the question is not hard: we first note that the unit digit of n must be 3 or 8, and so n is among 3, 8, 13, 18, 23, 28, … We then find the smallest one among these integers which leaves a remainder of 4 upon division by 7. It is easy to see that the smallest n is 18. Note that the conditions imposed on n can be rephrased into t\u0000e system of congruences: 3 (mod 5) 4 (mod 7) n n ≡  ≡ and we have shown that the smallest positive n satisfying the system is 18. If we repeat the above process, it is not hard to see that n = 53, 88, 123, 158, … all satisfy the system and they occur at intervals of 35. Indeed, any integer n with 18n ≡ (mod 35) satisfies the system. Mathematical Database Page 8 of 11 A natural question to ask is whether all such systems are solvable. A little thought would tell us that the answer is negative, for the system 1 (mod 2) 2 (mod 4) n n ≡  ≡ is clearly not solvable (as the first constraint requires n to be odd and the second constraint requires n to be even). Despite this negative result, an extra constraint would give us something encouraging, as given in the next theorem. Theorem 4.1. (Chinese remainder theorem) If 1b , 2b , …, kb are integers and 1m , 2m , …, km are pairwise relatively prime integers, then the system 11 22 (mod ) (mod ) (mod )kk xb m xb m xb m ≡  ≡    ≡ is solvable and the solution is unique modulo 12 kmm m . Proof. We first prove the uniqueness, and then prove the existence. (Uniqueness) Suppose x and x' both satisfy the system. Then 'xx≡ (mod im ) for i = 1, 2, …, k, i.e. | 'imx x− for i = 1, 2, …, k. Since 1m , 2m , …, km are pairwisely relatively prime, we have 12 |'kmm m x x− , i.e. 'xx≡ (mod 12 kmm m ). (Existence) Define 12 k j j mm m M m = for j = 1, 2, …, k. Set 12() ( ) ( ) 11 2 2 kmm m kkxM b M b M b φφ φ =+ + + . Then for j = 1, 2, …, k, () (1) jm jj j jxM b b b φ ≡≡ = (mod jm ) where we made use of the fact that |jrmM for rj≠ and the Euler’s theorem (noting that jm is relatively prime to jM for all j). Mathematical Database Page 9 of 11 Q.E.D. In the above proof we gave an explicit formula to find x, but in practice this is rarely used as the number gets too large when we take powers. There is another formula which overcomes this difficulty but which is not as simple as the preceding one. Recall that b is said to be an inverse of a modulo n if 1ab ≡ (mod n). It can be shown that such b exists if and only if (a, n) = 1 (see exercise 8). Now, ( , ) 1jjmM = for all j, where jM is defined as above, since the im ’s are pairwise relatively prime. Hence jM has an inverse modulo jm , which we denote by jM . Then a solution for the system in Theorem 4.1 can be written as 11 1 2 2 2 kk kxb M M b M M b M M=+ + + . We leave it to the reader to verify that such x indeed satisfies the system. Example 4.1. Find all integers x for which 2x ≡ (mod 3), 3x ≡ (mod 5) and 4x ≡ (mod 7). Solution. Since 3, 5, 7 are pairwise relatively prime, the Chinese remainder theorem asserts that there is a unique solution modulo 3 5 7 105×× = . Now 1 3m = , 2 5m = , 3 7m = , 1 35M = , 2 21M = , 3 15M = , 1 2M = , 2 1M = , 3 1M = , so one solution for x is given by 235 2 321 1 4 15 1 263x =× × + × × + × × = . Note that 263 ≡ 53 (mod 105), so the general solution is 53 105xt=+ for any integer t. 5. Exercises 1. Prove or disprove each of the following statements. All variables denote natural numbers.

Find the remainder when 56781234 is divided by 13. 3. Show that a natural number N is divisible by 9 if and only if its sum of digits is divisible by 9. 4. In Unit 1 and its exercises, we came across various divisibility tests and proved their validity using divisibility arguments. Try to rephrase the proofs in the language of congruences that we have been using throughout this unit. 5. Find all prime numbers p for which 22 p p+ is prime. 6. Prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers p satisfying 3p ≡ (mod 4). 7. Suppose n has k distinct prime factors 1p , 2p , …, kp .

Show that 11 1 2 2 2 kk kxb M M b M M b M M=+ + + satisfies the system of congruences in the statement of Theorem 4.1. Mathematical Database Page 11 of 11 9. (a) Let 1p , 2p , …, 2np be distinct prime numbers. Show that there is an integer x such that 21 2iipp− divides x + i for i = 1, 2, …, n. (b) We say that a positive integer k is ‘good’ if it is not the power of a prime number. Using (a), show that for every natural number n we can find n consecutive ‘good’ integers. (Remark: Part (b) is essentially the same as a problem in IMO 1989.) 10. (a) Wilson’s Theorem asserts that (1)! 1p −≡ − (mod p) for all prime numbers p. Give a proof of this fact. (Hint: Group the terms of ( 1)!p − into pairs.) (b) Show that the converse of Wilson’s Theorem is also true. (c) In view of (a) and (b), we see that (1)! 1n −≡ − (mod n) if and only if n is prime. This gives a test of whether a given natural number n is prime. But in practice such a test is rarely used. Suggest a reason for this. 11.
