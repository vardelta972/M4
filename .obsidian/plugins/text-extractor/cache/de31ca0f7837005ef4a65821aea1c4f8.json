Nov. 11, start of class 9.2 Statement of quadratic reciprocity Exercise 9.1. Use quadratic reciprocity to determine for which primes p is 7 a square mod p. 9.3 Euler’s criterion Exercise 9.2. Show □p is a subgroup of (Z/pZ)×. Show the map σ : (Z/pZ)× → (Z/pZ) given by σ(x) = x2 is 2-to-1. Conclude the subgroup □p has index 2 in (Z/pZ)×, i.e., |□p| = p−1 2 . Exercise 9.3. Explicitly write down the values of ( · p) for p = 7, 11, 13. In each case, write down what the subgroup □p of (Z/pZ)× is. 9.4 The value of (2 p) Exercise 9.4. Let a, b ∈ N. Show for p prime (a + b)p ≡ ap + b p mod p. 9.5 The story so far Exercise 9.5. Compute (24 61 ), (30 61 ), and (31 61 ). 9.7 The full Chinese remainder theorem Exercise 9.6. Let gcd(m, n) = 1 and α : (Z/mnZ) → (Z/mZ) × (Z/nZ) be given by α(a, b) = (a mod m, b mod n). Check that α(0) = (0, 0), α(1) = (1, 1), α(a + b) = α(a) + α(b) and α(ab) = α(a)α(b). This means α is a ring homomorphism. Exercise 9.7. Exercises 9.7.1, 9.7.2. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
