A large rectangle in the plane is partitioned into smaller rectangles, each of which has either integer height or integer width (or both). Prove that the large rectangle also has this property. 2. Given positive integers a, b, and m with gcd(a, b) = 1. Let A be a nonempty set of positive integers such that for every positive integer n either an ∈ A or bn ∈ A. Determine the minimum number of elements the set A ∩ {1, 2, . . . , m} can have. 3. In the Cartesian coordinate plan deﬁne the strip Sn = {(x, y) : n ≤ x < n + 1} for every integer n. Assume that each strip Sn is colored either red or blue, and let a and b be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side lengths a and b such that its vertices have the same color. 4. What is the units digit of ⌊ 10 20000 10100 + 3 ⌋? 5. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that ⌊an⌋ + ⌊bn⌋ = ⌊cn⌋ for all positive integers n. Prove that at least one of a, b is an integer. 6. Find all integers a with the property that for inﬁnitely many positive integers n, ⌊ 2n2 ⌊ n√ 2 ⌋ ⌋ = ⌊ n√2 ⌋ + a. 7. For a prime p and a positive integer n, denote by νp(n) the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n!.

For a pair (a, b) of real numbers let F (a, b) denote the sequence of general term cn = ⌊an + b⌋. Find all pairs (a, b) such that F (x, y) = F (a, b) implies (x, y) = (a, b). 11.

A ﬂea moves in the positive direction along the x-axis, starting from the origin. It can only jump over distances equal to √ 2 and √2005.
