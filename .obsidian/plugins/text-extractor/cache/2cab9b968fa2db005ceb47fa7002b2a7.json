Let ABCD be a quadrilateral and let O be a point in the plane of the quadrilateral. HAB, HBC, HCD, HDA are the projections of O onto lines AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. HA, HB, HC, HD are the projections of O onto HDAHAB, HABHBC, HBCHCD, HCDHDA re- spectively. Suppose that HA, HB, HC, HD are concyclic. Prove that ABCD is cyclic. 2. Let A, B, C, D be points occurring in that order on circle ω and let P be the point of inter- section of AC and BD. Let EF be a chord of ω passing through P with P its midpoint, Q be the point of intersection of BC and EF , and R be the point of intersection of DA and EF . Prove that P Q = P R. This is known as the Butterﬂy Theorem. 3. Let AXY ZB be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter AB. Denote by P , Q, R, S the feet of the perpendiculars from Y onto lines AX, BX, AZ, BZ, respectively. Prove that the acute angle formed by lines P Q and RS is half the size of ∠XOZ, where O is the midpoint of segment AB. 2 Concurrency and Collinearity Often, a problem will ask you to prove concurrency or collinearity of points. Here are some basic ways to prove concurrency of lines AX, BY, CZ. 1. Turn it into a collinearity problem: C, Z, and AX ∩ BY (note: ∩ denotes intersection) 2. Describe the lines as loci. (Use of the Radical Center Theorem is a special case of this technique.) 3. Suppose that AX ∩ CZ = P and BY ∩ CZ = Q, then prove that P = Q. (This can be proven in several ways; for example, CP = CQ.) 4. Use Ceva’s Theorem. Here are some basic ways to prove collinearity of A, B, C: 1. Find some point P with ∠P AB = ∠P AC. 2. Find some point P with ∠P AB + ∠CAP = π. 3. Use Menelaus’s Theorem. 3 Ceva’s Theorem Let AD, BE, and CF be cevians of triangle △ABC. These cevians concur if and only if AE EC · CD DB · BF F A = 1. This is proven using the phantom point combined with area ratios. Ceva’s theorem also has a very useful trigonometric form: sin ∠ABE sin ∠EBC · sin ∠CAD sin ∠DAB · sin ∠BCF sin ∠F CA = 1. 1 This is derived from the standard form of Ceva’s theorem using the law of sines, and its use will often be accompanied by several uses of the law of sines. 4 Menelaus’s Theorem If and only if points X, Y , Z on the extensions of sides BC, CA, AB of triangle △ABC are collinear, then BX CX · CY AY · AZ BZ = −1. The appearance of −1 on the RHS is a consequence of the use of directed lengths. This theorem occasionally appears on Olympiad geometry problems. To avoid its use, it is possible to replace collinearity problems with concurrency problems. 5 Potpourri • Let A, B, C, D be points in the plane. Assume A ̸= B and C ̸= D. Then lines AB and CD and perpendicular if and only if AC2 + BD2 = AD2 + BC2. 6 Radical Axis Given two circles in the plane, their radical axis is the locus of points of equal power to the two circles. As an exercise, try to prove that this is always a line, as it so happens to be the case. If the two circles intersect, then note that the radical axis must pass through the two intersection points of the circle, so it is concurrent with their common chord. 7 Symmedian Let ABC be a triangle and Γ be its circumcircle. Suppose the tangents to Γ at B and C meet at D. Then AD is the symmedian, or reﬂection of the median across the angle bisector of ∠A. Try to prove this in three ways. For the ﬁrst proof, let the reﬂection of AD across the angle bisector of ∠A meet BC at M ′. Then consider BM ′ M ′C and use the Law of Sines. For the second proof, draw the circle centered at D with radius DB, and look for similar triangles. For the third proof, let the tangent of Γ at A meet line BC at E. Think about a projection. 8 Isogonal Conjugates The symmedian point is deﬁned as the point the centroid is mapped to when it is reﬂected over the angle bisector. This is one example of an isogonal conjugate. In general, the isogonal conjugate P ∗ of a point P is the point constructed by reﬂecting the lines P A, P B, and P C about the angle bisectors of A, B, C. The three reﬂected lines concur at the isogonal conjugate. This is a transformation of the points inside the triangle, as can be seen in Figure 1. 9 Pascal’s Theorem If the three pairs of opposite sides in a cyclic hexagon all intersect, then the three points of inter- section are collinear. 2 Figure 1: Isogonal conjugate transformation over points in the triangle. 10 Problems These problems are extremely important, as much of the theoretical substance of this lecture is hidden among the problems here. This means that it is especially important for you to work on these outside of TJUSAMO time and verify your solutions with either of us. 1. Let △ABC be a triangle. Points X, Y, and Z lie on sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of triangles △AY Z, △BXZ, △CXY meet at a common point. This is Miquel’s Theorem. 2. Let C1, C2, C3 be circles with distinct radii. Prove that the the centers of the external homo- theties taking C1 7→ C2, C2 7→ C3, and C3 7→ C1 are collinear. This is Monge’s Theorem. 3. Prove that if equilateral triangles are erected externally on the sides of any triangle, their centers form an equilateral triangle. This is Napoleon’s Theorem. 4. Consider a convex pentagon ABCDE such that ∠BAC = ∠CAD = ∠DAE, ∠ABC = ∠ACD = ∠ADE Let P be the point of intersection of the lines BD and CE. Prove that the line AP passes through the midpoint of the side CD. 5. Let △ABC be a triangle, and let P be another point on its circumcircle. Let X, Y, Z be the feet of perpendiculars from P to lines BC, CA, AB respectively. Prove that X, Y, Z are collinear. The line going through X, Y, Z is known as the Simson line. 6. Let ABC be a triangle whose intouch triangle (that is, the triangle whose vertices are the points of tangency of the incircle of △ABC with the sides of △ABC) is △A1B1C1. (a) Prove that AA1, BB1, CC1 are concurrent. The point of concurrency is known as the Gergonne point. (b) Prove that if A2, B2, C2 are points on the incircle of ABC such that AA2, BB2, CC2 are concurrent, then A1A2, B1B2, C1C2 are also concurrent. 7. Let △Q1Q2Q3 be the cevian triangle of point P with respect to △P1P2P3. Let △R1R2R3 be the cevian triangle 1 of point Q with respect to △Q1Q2Q3. Prove that the lines P1R1, P2R2, P3R3 are concurrent. This is the Cevian Nest Theorem. 1The cevian triangle of a point P with respect to triangle ABC is the triangle with vertices AP ∩ BC, BP ∩ AC, and CP ∩ AB, where ∩ denotes intersection. 3 8. Let C, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6 be circles such that C is tangent to Ci at Pi for all i, and Ci is externally tangent to Ci+1 for all i, with C6 externally tangent to C1. Prove that P1P4, P2P5, P3P6 are concurrent. This is the Seven Circles Theorem. 9. Points A1, B1, and C1 are chosen on sides BC, CA, and AB of a triangle ABC, respectively. The circumcircles of triangles AB1C1 , BC1A1 , and CA1B1 intersect the circumcircle of triangle △ABC again at points A2, B2, and C2 , respectively (A2 = A, B2 = B, and C2 = C). Points A3 , B3 , and C3 are symmetric to A1, B1 , C1 with respect to the midpoints of sides BC, CA, and AB, respectively. Prove that triangles A2B2C2 and A3B3C3 are similar. 10. Let △ABC be an acute, scalene triangle and let M , N , and P be the midpoints of BC, CA, and AB respectively. Let the perpendicular bisectors of AB and AC intersect ray AM in points D and E respectively, and let lines BD and CE intersect in point F , inside of triangle △ABC. Prove that points A, N, F, and P all lie on one circle. 11. Circles w1 and w2 with centres O1 and O2 are externally tangent at point D and internally tangent to a circle w at points E and F respectively. Line t is the common tangent of w1 and w2 at D. Let AB be the diameter of w perpendicular to t, so that A, E, O1 are on the same side of t. Prove that lines AO1, BO2, EF and t are concurrent. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
