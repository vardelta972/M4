Tese problems have been published in a book, but it is in Persian (Farsi). Problems are very nice, so I 1 decided to collect a set of solutions for them. I should thank pco, socrates, applepi2000, Potla, goldeneagle, and professordad who solved the problems and posted the solutions 2. Remark. A very few number of problems remained unsolved on AoPS. I will add the solutions of those problems as soon as I ﬁnd the book written by Mr. Jafari. As this happened, problems’ numbers are not the same as the ﬁle posted on AoPS by the author 3: they are consecutive. ∗User momed66 in AoPS website 1Amir Hossein Parvardi 2Topic in AoPS: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=444651 3Topic in AoPS: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=406530 1 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 2 1 Functional Equations 1. Find all functions f (x) from R → R that satisfy: f (x + y) = f (x)f (y) + xy Solution. [First Solution] [by pco 4] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x + y) = f (x)f (y) + xy. Let f (1) = u. Tthe function f (x) = 0 ∀x is not a Solution. Let then a such that f (a) ̸= 0 : P (a, 0) =⇒ f (a)(f (0) − 1) = 0 and so f (0) = 1. • P (−1, 1) =⇒ f (1)f (−1) = 2 =⇒ f (−1) = 2 u • P (1, 1) =⇒ f (2) = u2 + 1 • P (−1, 2) =⇒ f (1) = f (−1)f (2) − 2 =⇒ u = 2 u (u2 + 1) − 2 =⇒ u2 − 2u + 2 = 0, impossible And so no solution. Solution. [Second Solution] [by applepi2000] Let P (x, y) be the above assertion. Then: P (0, y) =⇒ f (y) = f (0)f (y). So, either f (y) is always 0, which isn’t a solution (test x = y = 1), or f (0) = 1. Thus f (0) = 1 and: P (x, −x) =⇒ f (x)f (−x) − x 2 = 1. Let x = 2a. Then: 1 + 4a2 = f (−2a)f (2a) = (f (a) 2 + a2)(f (−a) 2 + a2) ≥ a4. However, taking large a, such as a = 42, this is false. So, no such function exists. 4Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=378997 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 3 2. Find all functions f (x) from R \\ {1} → R such that: f (xy) = f (x)f (y) + xy ∀x, y ∈ R \\ {1}. Solution. [by pco] According to me, domain of functional equation must also contain xy ̸= 1. Let then g(x) = f (x) x deﬁned from (1, +∞) → R. The equation becomes P (x, y) : g(xy) = g(x)g(y) + 1. Let x > 1 : P ( √x, √ x) =⇒ g(x) = g( √ x) 2 + 1 ≥ 1. Let then m = inf x>1 g(x) and an a sequence of reals in (1, +∞) such that limn→+∞ g(an) = m. • P ( √an, √ an) =⇒ g(an) = g( √ an) 2 + 1 ≥ m2 + 1. Setting n → +∞ in this inequality, we get m ≥ m2 + 1, impossible. So no solution. 3. Find all functions f : Z → Z such that: f (x) = 2f (f (x)) ∀x ∈ Z. Solution. [by Rust and mavropnevma 5] From f (x) = 2f (f (x)) we get 2 | f (x). But then 2 | f (f (x)), so 4 | f (x). But then 4 | f (f (x)), so 8 | f (x). Repeating this, we have 2n | f (x) for all n ∈ N, so f (x) ≡ 0. 4. Find all functions f : Z → Z and g : Z → Z such that: f (x) = 3f (g(x)) ∀x ∈ Z. Solution. [by tkrass 6] f (g(x)) ∈ Z, so 3|f (x) for all x ∈ Z. Hence 3|f (g(x)) and 9|f (x) for all x. By easy induction we get that f (x) is divisible by any power of 3, hence f (x) ≡ 0. And g(x) may be any function taking integer values. 5Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=378363 6Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=378998 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 4 5. Find all functions f : Z → Z such that: 7f (x) = 3f (f (x)) + 2x ∀x ∈ Z. Solution. [by Sansa 7] Let f (x) = g(x) + 2x, substituting in the main equation we get: 7(g(x) + 2x) = 3f (g(x) + 2x) + 2x =⇒ 7g(x) + 12x = 3(g(g(x) + 2x) + 2g(x) + 4x) =⇒ g(x) = 3g(g(x) + 2x) Now let t(x) = g(x) + 2x, so we have: g(x) = 3g(t(x)) At ﬁrst we found out that 3|g(x) =⇒ 3|g(t(x)) =⇒ 9|g(x) · · · . Thus 3n | g(x) ∀n ∈ N, so g(x) ≡ 0 =⇒ f (x) = 2x ∀x ∈ R. 6. Find all functions f : Q → Q that for all x, y ∈ Q satisfy: f (x + y + f (x + y)) = 2f (x) + 2f (y). Solution. [by socrates] Put y := 0 to get f (x + f (x)) = 2f (x) + 2f (0). Now, put x := x + y into the last equality to get f (x + y + f (x + y)) = 2f (x + y) + 2f (0). This, together with the initial, gives f (x + y) − f (0) = f (x) − f (0) + f (y) − f (0), so f (x) = ax + b. Substituting into the original equation, we ﬁnd the solutions: 7Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=378999 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 5 • f (x) = x, ∀x • f (x) = −2x, ∀x. 7. Let f : R → R be a function that for all x, y ∈ R satisﬁes: f (x + f (x) + y) = x + f (x) + 2f (y). Prove that f is a bijective function. Solution. [by socrates] Let P (x, y) : f (x + f (x) + y) = x + f (x) + 2f (y). Consider a, b such that f (a) = f (b). Then P (a, b), P (b, a) give a = b. So f is injective. Putting y := −f (x) we get f (−f (x)) = − x 2 , so f is clearly surjective. Actually, no such function exists: Put y := 0, x := −f (0) so, since f (−f (0)) = 0, f (0) = 0. So x := 0 gives f ≡ 0 which is not a solution . 8. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all real x, y we have: f (x + f (x) + 2y) = x + f (f (x)) + 2f (y). Solution. [by applepi2000] Let P (x, y) be the above assertion, let a be an arbitrary real number. Then: P (−2a, a) =⇒ f (a) = a. We’re done! 9. Given a function f : R → R such that: f (x + f (x) + 2y) = x + f (x) + 2f (y). Prove that f is bijective and that f (0) = 0. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 6 Solution. [by applepi2000] Let P (x, y) be the above assertion. P (x, − f (x) 2 ) =⇒ − x 2 = f (− f (x) 2 ). So f is surjective. Now assume f (a) = f (b), then from above − a 2 = − b 2 , so a = b and thus f is injective. Finally, let f (0) = n. Then from the above, f (− n 2 ) = 0 =⇒ f (0) = n 4 . So n = 0 and f (0) = 0 as desired. 10. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ such that for all x > y > 0 we have: f (x − y) = f (x) − f (x)f ( 1 x )y. Solution. [by Dijkschneier 8] • P (x, y) : f (x − y) = f (x) − f (x)f ( 1 x )y • f (x − y) > 0 =⇒ f (x)(1 − yf ( 1 x )) > 0 • =⇒ 1 y > f ( 1 x ) • y → x =⇒ 1 x ≥ f ( 1 x ) • =⇒ x ≥ f (x)∀x > 0 • 1 > y > 0, P (1, y) =⇒ f (1 − y) = f (1) − f (1) 2y Now take in particular 1 > y > 1 (1+f (1)) and so: • =⇒ 1 − y ≥ f (1) − f (1) 2y • =⇒ 1 − f (1) ≥ y(1 − f (1))(1 + f (1)) • =⇒ (1 − f (1))(1 − y(1 + f (1))) ≥ 0 • =⇒ f (1) ≥ 1 • =⇒ f (1) = 1 So f (1 − y) = 1 − y, and hence f (y′) = y′∀1 > y′ > 0. • x − y ≥ f (x − y) = f (x) − f (x)f ( 1 x )y =⇒ x − f (x) ≥ y(1 − f (x)f (1/x)) For 0 < x < 1, we have x = f (x) and so from the inequality 1 x = 1 f (x) ≤ f ( 1 x ) ≤ 1 x , that is, f ( 1 x ) = 1 x . 8Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=424694 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 7 Hence f (x) = x∀x > 1 and so in conclusion: f (x) = x∀x > 0, which conversely is a solution. 11. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (f (x + f (y))) = x + f (y) + f (x + y), for all x, y ∈ R. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (f (x + f (y))) = x + f (y) + f (x + y) If f (a) = f (b) for some a, b, then, comparing P (x − b, a) and P (x − b, b), we get f (x) = f (x + a − b) ∀x But then, comparing P (x, y) and P (x + a − b, y), we get x = x + a − b and so a = b and f (x) is injective. P (−f (x), x) =⇒ f (f (0))) = f (x − f (x)) and so, since injective : f (0) = x − f (x) and f (x) = x + a, which is never a solution. So no solution. 12. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R+ ∪ {0} such that f (f (x + f (y))) = 2x + f (x + y), for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0}. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (f (x + f (y))) = 2x + f (x + y) If f (a) = f (b) for some a, b, then, comparing P (x, a) and P (x, b), we get f (x + a) = f (x + b) ∀x But then, comparing P (x + a, y) and P (x + b, y), we get a = b and so f (x) is injective. P (0, x) =⇒ f (f (f (x))) = f (x) and, since injective, f (f (x)) = x So P (x, 0) becomes x + f (0) = 2x + f (x) and so f (x) = f (0) − x which is never a Solution 1. (since < 0 for x great enough) 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 8 So no solution. 13. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y ∈ R : f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = x + f (x) + y + f (y). Solution. [by socrates] Putting x := 0 we see that f is injective. Put x := y, y := x to get f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = x + f (x) + y + f (y) = f (y + f (y) + 2f (x)), so x + f (x) + 2f (y) = y + f (y) + 2f (x) =⇒ f (x) − x = f (y) − y, that is f (x) − x is constant: f (x) = x + c. Substituing, we ﬁnd f (x) = x, ∀x. 14. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y ∈ R : f (2x + 2f (y)) = x + f (x) + y + f (y). Solution. [by socrates] As in the previous problem, we get f (2x + 2f (y)) = f (2y + 2f (x)) so f (x) = x + c. Substituing, we ﬁnd f (x) = x, ∀x. 15. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y ∈ R satisfy: f (f (x) + 2f (y)) = f (x) + y + f (y). Solution. [by socrates] Putting x := 0 we see that f is injective. Put y := −f (x) to ﬁnd f (−f (x)) = −f (x). So, x := −f (y) gives f (f (y)) = y and so f is surjective. Finally, put y := 0 to get f (f (x) + 2f (0)) = f (x) + f (0). Since f is surjective we get f (x) = x + c. Substituing, we ﬁnd f (x) = x, ∀x. 16. Find all functions f : R → R such that • f (x 2 + f (y)) = f 2(x) + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R • f (x) + f (−x) = 0 for all x ∈ R+ • The number of the elements of the set {x ∈ R|f (x) = 0} is ﬁnite. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 9 Solution. [by socrates] Assume f (x) > x for each x ̸= 0. Then 0 = f (x) + f (−x) > x − x = 0 contradiction. So f (a) ≤ a for some a ̸= 0. Put x := √ a − f (a), y := a into the ﬁrst condtion to get f (a) = f 2( √a − f (a))+ f (a) =⇒ f ( √ a − f (a)) = 0, so f (c) = 0 for some c. Now put x, y := c and we get f (c2) = 0 and by induction f (c2 n ) = 0. If c ̸= 0, 1, −1 then third condition is false. So c = 0, 1, −1. Observe that if f (k) > k (f (k) < k) then f (−k) < −k (f (−k) > −k) so for each x ̸= 0 we have f (x) = x, x + 1, x − 1. If f (l) = l − 1 for some l (the case f (l) = l + 1 reduses to f (−l) = −l − 1) then f (1) = 0. So f (1 + f (y)) = f (y). • If f (2) = 2 then f (3) = 2 and so f (9) = f 2(3) = 4, impossible. • If f (2) = 1 then f (4) = f 2(2) = 1, impossible. • If f (2) = 3 then f (4) = 9, impossible. Thus, f (x) = x, ∀x ̸= 0. Finally, x := 0 gives f (0) = 0 so the only solution is f (x) = x. 17. Let f : R → R be an injective function that for all x, y ∈ R satisﬁes: f (x + f (x)) = 2x. Prove that f (x) + x is a bijective function. Solution. [by socrates] Let x + f (x) = g(x). So f (g(x)) = 2x. g is clearly injective. Take y ∈ R, arbitrary and let f (y) = 2z = f (g(z)) so by injectivity of f we get g(z) = y. We’re done. 18. Find all functions f : R → R such that : f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = 2x + y + f (y) ∀x, y ∈ R. Solution. [by mousavi 9] It is obvious that f is injective. 9Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=378130 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 10 • x = y = 0 =⇒ f (3f (0)) = f (0) =⇒ f (0) = 0 • y = 0 =⇒ f (x + f (x)) = 2x • x = 0 =⇒ f (2f (y)) = y + f (y) =⇒ f f (2f (y)) = 2y Put f (2f (y)) instead of y =⇒ f (x + f (x) + 4y) = 2x + f (2f (y)) + 2y • x = 0 =⇒ f (4y) = 2y + f (2f (y)) • f (f (4y) − 2y) = 2y + f (y + f (y)) • f (4y) − f (y) = 3y • y = −2x =⇒ f (x + f (x) + 2f (−2x)) = f (−2x) • 3x + f (x) + 2f (−2x) = 0 • =⇒ −6x + f (−2x) + 2f (4x) = 0 • 2f (x) = −f (−2x) • x = −2x, y = x =⇒ f (−2x + f (−2x) + 2f (x)) = −4x + x + f (x) • f (−2x) = 3x + f (x) −2f (x) = −3x + f (x) • =⇒ f (x) = x. 19. Let f, g, h : R → R be functions such that f is injective and h is bijective, satisfying f (g(x)) = h(x) for all x ∈ R. Prove that g is a bijective function. Solution. [by socrates] Injectivity is obvious. Now take y ∈ R, arbitrary. There exists z : h(z) = f (y) = f (g(z)) so by injectivity of f we get g(z) = y. We are done. 20. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y ∈ R satisfy: f (2x + 2f (y)) = x + f (x) + 2y. Solution. [by socrates] Putting x := 0 we see that f is bijective. We have f (2f (0)) = f (0) so f (0) = 0. Put y := 0 to get f (2x) = x + f (x). So the initial equation becomes f (2x + 2f (y)) = f (2x) + f (2f (y)) or f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) from the surjectivity of f. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 11 So, x + f (x) = f (2x) = 2f (x) =⇒ f (x) = x which is indeed a Solution 1. 21. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R+ such that for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0}: f ( x + f (x) 2 + y) = f (x) + y. Solution. [by socrates] Put y := y + f (y) 2 to get f ( x + f (x) 2 + y + f (y) 2 ) = f (x) + y + f (y) 2 . So f (y) + x + f (x) 2 = f ( x + f (x) 2 + y + f (y) 2 ) = f (x) + y + f (y) 2 so f (x) − x = f (y) − y, that is f (x) − x is constant: f (x) = x + c. Substituing, we ﬁnd f (x) = x, ∀x. 22. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R+ ∪ {0} such that for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0}: f ( x + f (x) 2 + f (y)) = f (x) + y. Solution. [by socrates] Put x = y := 0 =⇒ f ( 3f (0) 2 ) = f (0). Put x := 0, y := 3f (0) 2 : f ( 3f (0) 2 ) = 5f (0) 2 so f (0) = 0. Now, x := 0 and y := 0 give f (f (y)) = y and f ( x+f (x) 2 ) = f (x), respectively. The former implies that f is injective and the latter f (x) = x, which is indeed a Solution 1. 23. Let f : R+ ∪ {0} → R be a function such that • f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0} • The number of the elements of the set {x|f (x) = 0, x ∈ R+ ∪ {0}} is ﬁnite. Prove that f is injective function. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 12 Solution. [by socrates] We easily ﬁnd f (0) = 0. Suppose there exist a, b ≥ 0 such that a ̸= b and f (a) = f (b). Wlog assume a > b. Then f (a) = f (a−b+b) = f (a − b) + f (b) so f (c) = 0 for some c ̸= 0. So, by induction, f (2nc) = 0 for each n ∈ N, contradicting the second condtion. So f is injective. 24. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R such that i) f (x + f (x) + 2y) = f (2x) + 2f (y), for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0} ii) The number of the elements of the set {x|f (x) = 0, x ∈ R+ ∪ {0}} is ﬁnite. Solution. [by goldeneagle 10 Let P (a, b) be the assertion. Let A be the set which mentioned in the second condition. Deﬁne k 2 = M ax(A). If x > f (x) then P (x, x−f (x) 2 ) ⇒ f ( x−f (x) 2 ) = 0 ⇒ f (x) ≥ x − k so ∀x ∈ R+ ∪ {0}: f (x) ≥ x − k (I). I want to prove that f is injective. If not, then ∃a < b : f (a) = f (b). Deﬁne t = b − a. • P ( a 2 , x 2 ), P ( b 2 , x 2 ), (I) ⇒ a 2 + f ( a 2 ) = b 2 + f ( b 2 ) (II) • P (a, b 2 ), P (b, a 2 ), (II) ⇒ f (2a) − f (2b) = t (III) P (a, x), P (b, x), (III) ⇒ ∀x ≥ a+f (a): f (x)−f (x+t) = t. But f (x) ≥ x−k, so this is contradiction! (t > 0) Now I want to prove that f (0) = 0. Deﬁne c = f (0). If c < 0, then P (0, − c 2 ) ⇒ f (− c 2 ) = 0 and since f is injective we should have c = 0, contra- diction! So c ≥ 0. We have • P (0, 0) ⇒ f (c) = 3c • P (0, x) ⇒ f (2x + c) = 2f (x) + c (*) • P (c, x) ⇒ f (2x + 4c) = 2f (x) + f (2c) (**) • (*), (**) ⇒ f (2x + 4c) − f (2x + c) = f (2c) − c ⇒ (x = c 2 )f (5c) = 2f (2c) − c Put x = 2c in (*): f (5c) = 2f (2c)+c, so c = 0 and then P (x, 0) ⇒ f (x) = x. 10http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=442600 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 13 25. Find all functions f : R → R such that: • f (f (x) + y) = x + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R • for each x ∈ R+ there exists some y ∈ R+ such that f (y) = x. Solution. [by socrates] Put y := 0 to get f (f (x)) = x + f (0) that is f is bijective. So, since f (f (0)) = f (0) we have f (0) = 0. So f (f (x)) = x and f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y). Since f bijective, for each x > 0 there exists unique y = f (x) such that f (y) = x, so second condition means f (x) > 0 for each x > 0. It is well known that since f is Cauchy function, it is increasing so f (x) = cx and substituing f (x) = x. 26. Find all functions f : R → R such that • f (f (x) + y) = x + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R • The set {x ∈ R|f (x) = −x} has a ﬁnite number of elements. Solution. [by socrates] Put y := 0 to get f (f (x)) = x + f (0) so f is bijective. Hence, f (0) = 0, f (f (x)) = x and f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y). Let g(x) = f (x) + x. Then g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y). If g(a) = 0 for some a ̸= 0 then g(2na) = 0, ∀n ∈ N, contradiction. So g(x) = 0 ⇐⇒ x = 0.( ∗) Now, take a, b such that f (a) = f (b). Then f (a) = f (a − b + b) = f (a − b) + f (b) =⇒ f (a − b) = 0 (∗) =⇒ a = b. Thus, g is injective. We have g(f (x)) = f (f (x)) + f (x) = x + f (x) = g(x) =⇒ f (x) = x. 27. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y, z ∈ R : f (f (f (x)) + f (y) + z) = x + f (y) + f (f (z)). Solution. [by socrates] Putting y, z := 0 we see that f is bijective. So f (c) = 0 for some c ∈ R. Putting x := 0, y := c we get f (f (z)) = f (z + f (f (0))) so, by injectivity, f (x) = x + c and ﬁnally f (x) = x. 28. Find all functions f : R → R such that f ( x + f (x) 2 + y + f (2z)) = 2x − f (x) + f (y) + 2f (z), 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 14 for all x, y, z ∈ R. Solution. [by goldeneagle] Let P (a, b, c) be the assertion. Now if f (a) = f (b), then P (0, 0, a 2 ), P (0, 0, b 2 ) ⇒ f ( a 2 ) = f ( b 2 ) and then P (a, b 2 , 0), P (b, a 2 , 0) ⇒ a = b. So f is injective. Also P (x, x, 0) gives us that f is surjective. Deﬁne f (0) = t and f (a) = 0. • P (0, 0, a) ⇒ a = t 2 + f (2a), • P (0, a, a) ⇒ f ( t 2 + a + f (2a)) = −t ⇒ f (2a) = −t, so t = −2a, f (2a) = 2a, • P (2a, a, a) ⇒ f (5a) = 2a ⇒ 5a = 2a ⇒ a = 0, • P (0, 0, x) ⇒ f (f (2x)) = 2f (x), • P (0, x, y) : f (x + f (2y)) = f (x) + 2f (y) = f (x) + f (f (2y)) ⇒ f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) (f is surjective!). Now f (f (2x)) = 2f (x) = f (2x) ⇒ f (x) = x ∀x ∈ R. 29. Find all functions f : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) such that f ( x + f (x) 2 + y + f (2z)) = 2x − f (x) + f (y) + 2f (z), for all x, y, z ≥ 0. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y, z) be the assertion f ( x+f (x) 2 + y + f (2z)) = 2x − f (x) + f (y) + 2f (z) Let f (0) = 2a • P (0, f (2x), 0) =⇒ f (3a + f (2x))) = f (2x) + 2a • P (0, f (2y), x) =⇒ f (3a + f (2x)) = 2f (x) And so f (2x) = 2f (x) − 2a ∀x P ( x 2 , x 2 , 0) =⇒ f (something) = x + 4a and any real ≥ 4a is in the image of f (x) So the quantity x+f (x) 2 + f (2z) may take any value ≥ 5a (choosing x = 0 and appropriate z) So we got f (u + y) = g(u) + f (y) ∀y ≥ 0 and ∀u ≥ 5a and for some function g(x) Setting there y = 0, we get g(u) = f (u) − 2a and so : f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) − 2a ∀x ≥ 0 and ∀y ≥ 5a 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 15 Writing h(x) = f (x) − 2a, the two properties are : h(2x) = 2h(x) ∀x h(x + y) = h(x) + h(y) ∀x ≥ 0 and ∀y ≥ 5a But, ∀y > 0, ∃n ∈ N such that 2ny > 5a So h(2nx + 2ny) = h(2nx) + h(2ny) So h(x + y) = h(x) + h(y) ∀x, y ≥ 0 And since h(x) is lower bounded, we get h(x) = cx and so f (x) = cx + 2a Plugging this back in original equation, we ﬁnd the unique solution f (x) = x ∀x. 30. Find all non decreasing functions f : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) such that f ( x+f (x) 2 + y) = 2x − f (x) + f (f (y)) ∀x, y ≥ 0. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f ( x+f (x) 2 + y) = 2x − f (x) + f (f (y)) If f (x) < x for some x, then P (x, x−f (x) 2 ) =⇒ f (x)−x = 1 2 f (f ( x−f (x) 2 )) ≥ 0 and so contradiction. So f (x) ≥ x ∀x If f (a) = f (b) for some b > a then f (x) = f (a) ∀x ∈ [a, b] since f (x) is non decreasing and then : ∀x ∈ [a, b] : P (x, 0) =⇒ f ( x+f (a) 2 ) = 2x − f (a) + f (f (0)) So ∀x ∈ [ a+f (a) 2 , b+f (a) 2 ] : f (x) = 4x − 3f (a) + f (f (0)) = 4x + c So ∀x ∈ [ a+f (a) 2 , b+f (a) 2 ], P (x, 0) =⇒ f ( 5x+c 2 ) = −2x − c + f (f (0)) which is impossible since f (x) is non decreasing So f (x) is injective. f (x) ≥ x =⇒ x+f (x) 2 + y ≥ x + y =⇒ f ( x+f (x) 2 + y) ≥ f (x + y) ≥ f (x) So 2x − f (x) + f (f (y)) ≥ f (x) and f (f (y)) ≥ 2(f (x) − x) Setting x = 0 and y = 0 in this inequality, we get f (f (0)) ≥ 2f (0) Setting x = f (0) and y = 0 in the same inequality, we get 2f (0) ≥ f (f (0)) And so f (f (0)) = 2f (0) Then P (f (0), x) =⇒ f ( 3f (0) 2 + x) = f (f (x)) and so, since injective : f (x) = x + 3f (0) 2 So f (0) = 0 and f (x) = x ∀x, which indeed is a solution. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 16 31. Find all functions f : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) such that f (x + f (x) + 2y) = 2x + f (2f (y)) ∀x, y ≥ 0. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x+f (x)+2y) = 2x+f (2f (y)). P (0, y) =⇒ f (2y + f (0)) = f (2f (y)) and P (x, y) becomes: New assertion Q(x, y) : f (x + f (x) + y) = 2x + f (y + f (0)). Let then f (a) = f (b) with a, b ≥ f (0): • Q(a, b − f (0)) =⇒ f (a + f (a) + b − f (0)) = 2a + f (a) • Q(b, a − f (0)) =⇒ f (b + f (b) + a − f (0)) = 2b + f (b) And so a = b and we have a kind of ”pseudo injectivity” (with limitation a, b ≥ f (0)) • P (0, 0) =⇒ f (f (0)) = f (2f (0)) So, since both f (0), 2f (0) ≥ f (0) applying previous ”pseudo injectivity”, we get f (0) = 2f (0) and so f (0) = 0 And pseudo injectivity above becomes injectivity : f (x) is injective. P (0, x) =⇒ f (2x) = f (2f (x)) and so, since injective : f (x) = x ∀x which indeed is a solution. 32. Find all functions f : Q → Q such that f (x + f (x) + 2y) = 2x + 2f (f (y)) ∀x, y ∈ Q. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x+f (x)+2y) = 2x+2f (f (y)) • P (0, 0) =⇒ f (f (0)) = 0 • P (f (0), 0) =⇒ f (0) = 0 • P (0, y) =⇒ f (2y) = 2f (f (y)) and so P (x, y) may be rewritten as : f (x + f (x) + y) = f (y) + 2x which implies f (y + n(x + f (x))) = f (y) + 2nx and so (setting y = 0): new assertion Q(x, n) : f (n(x + f (x))) = 2nx Let then x + f (x) = p q and 1 + f (1) = r s with q, s ̸= 0 • Q(x, rq) =⇒ f (pr) = 2rqx • Q(1, ps) =⇒ f (pr) = 2ps 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 17 And so rqx = ps ⇐⇒ r s x = p q = x + f (x) =⇒ f (x) = ( r s − 1)x Plugging then back in original equation f (x) = ax, we get a = 1 and so the unique solution f (x) = x ∀x. 33. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (x − f (y)) = f (y) 2 − 2xf (y) + f (x) ∀x, y ∈ R. Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x − f (y)) = f (y) 2 − 2xf (y) + f (x). f (x) = 0 ∀x is a solution. So let us from now look for non allzero solutions. And so let u such that f (u) ̸= 0. • P ( f (u)2−x 2f (u) , u) =⇒ f (a) = x + f (b) and so x = f (a) − f (b) for some a, b depending on x. • P (f (a), a) =⇒ f (f (a)) = f (a) 2 + f (0). • P (f (a), b) =⇒ f (f (a) − f (b)) = f (b) 2 − 2f (a)f (b) + f (f (a)) = f (b) 2 − 2f (a)f (b) + f (a) 2 + f (0) = (f (a) − f (b)) 2 + f (0) And since x = f (a) − f (b), this becomes f (x) = x 2 + f (0) which indeed is a solution, whatever is f (0). Hence the second solution f (x) = x 2 + a ∀x and for any a. 34. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all real x, y: (x + y)(f (x) − f (y)) = (x − y)(f (x) + f (y)). Solution. [by applepi2000] Simplifying, we get f (x) x = f (y) y ∀x, y ̸= 0, so f (n) = kn, which is indeed always a Solution 1. It remains to be shown that f (0) = 0, which is true by substituting x = 0, y = n into the above. This gives f (0) = −f (0) so indeed f (0) = 0. 35. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (x−y)(x+y) = (x−y)(f (x)+f (y)) ∀x, y ∈ R. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 18 Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x − y)(x + y) = (x − y)(f (x) + f (y)). • P (x + 1, 1) =⇒ f (x)(x + 2) = xf (x + 1) + xf (1). • P (x + 1, x) =⇒ f (1)(1 + 2x) = f (x + 1) + f (x) =⇒ f (1)(x + 2x 2) = xf (x + 1) + xf (x). Subtracting, we get f (x)(x + 1) = f (1)x(x + 1). And so f (x) = xf (1) ∀x ̸= −1. • P (0, 1) =⇒ f (−1) = −f (1) And so f (x) = xf (1) ∀x, which indeed is a solution. Hence the answer: f (x) = ax ∀x and for any real a 36. Find all functions f : R → R such that for all real x, y: f (x + y)(x − y) = f (x − y)(x + y). Solution. [by applepi2000] Let a, b be arbitrary positive reals, and let P (x, y) be the above assertion. Then: P ( a + b 2 , a − b 2 ) =⇒ f (a) a = f (b) b . and so f (x) = kx for a real constant k, and indeed this always works. (Also f (0) = 0 from plugging in (x, x) into the above with x ̸= 0). 37. Find all non decreasing functions f, g : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞) such that g(x) = 2x − f (x) ∀x, y ≥ 0. Prove that f and g are continuous functions. Solution. [by pco] f (0) + g(0) = 0 and so f (0) = g(0) = 0. • x ≥ y =⇒ f (x) ≥ f (y) and g(x) ≥ g(y) and so 2x − f (x) ≥ 2y − f (y) So x ≥ y =⇒ 0 ≤ f (x) − f (y) ≤ 2(x − y) and obviously 0 ≤ g(x) − g(y) ≤ 2(x − y). This prove continuity of the two functions. And the properties f (0) = 0 and 0 ≤ f (x) − f (y) ≤ 2(x − y) ∀x ≥ y and g(x) = 2x − f (x) are suﬃcient to build a solution: 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 19 • f (x) is non decreasing and ≥ f (0) = 0. • x ≥ y =⇒ f (x) − f (y) ≤ 2(x − y) =⇒ 2x − f (x) ≥ 2y − f (y) and so g(x) ≥ g(y) and so g(x) is non decreasing and ≥ g(0) = 0 And since there are inﬁnitely many such f , we have inﬁnitely many solutions and I dont think that we can ﬁnd a more precise form. If we limit our choice to diﬀerentiable, we can choose for example any function whose derivative is in [0, 2]. For example : f (x) = x + sin x and g(x) = x − sin x But a lot of non diﬀerentiable solutions exist too. 38. Find all bijective functions f : R → R such that f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = f (2x) + f (2y). Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = f (2x) + f (2y). • Let a such that f (a) = 0. • Let x ∈ R and y such that f (y) = x−f (x) 2 . • P (x, y) =⇒ f (2x) = f (2x) + f (2y) and so y = a 2 and f ( a 2 ) = x−f (x) 2 and so f (x) = x − 2f ( a 2 ). Plugging f (x) = x + c in original equation, we get c = 0. And so the solution f (x) = x. 39. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ such that f (x + f (x) + y) = f (2x) + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R+. Solution. [by goldeneagle] P (a, b) means put x = a, y = b. If f (a) = f (b)(a > b) then deﬁne t = a − b. • P (a, b), p(b, a) ⇒ f (2a) = f (2b) and then P (a, x), P (b, x) ⇒ f (x) = f (x + t)∀x > b + f (b) so we can ﬁnd r ∈ R+ that f (r) < r. Now P (r, r − f (r)) ⇒ f (r − f (r)) = 0, contradiction! 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 20 • So f (a) = f (b) ⇒ a = b now P (x, 2y), P (y, 2x) ⇒ f (x) − x = c so f (x) = x + c. 40. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R+ ∪ {0} such that f (x + f (x) + 2f (y)) = 2f (x) + y + f (y), for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0}. Solution. [by Babak 11] This is actually pretty simple; • Let A be the set of all numbers z such that z = x + f (x) + 2f (y) for some x, y non-negative. • Now note that if z belongs to A then for some x, y we have z = x + f (x) + 2f (y), so f (f (z)) = z. Let t be any non-negative number; • Now f (z + f (z) + 2f (t)) = 2f (z) + t + f (t) and also f (f (z) + f (f (z)) + 2f (t)) = 2z + t + f (t). But the LHS are the same and so this implies that for all z in A we have that f (z) = z. • Now let z = x + f (x) + 2f (y). We know that f (z) = y + f (y) + 2f (x) and also that f (z) = z = x + f (x) + 2f (y). So f (x) + y = f (y) + x for all non negative x and y. Let y = 0, hence f (x) = f (0) + x. One can easily see that f (0) = 0 and so f (x) = x. 41. Find all functions f : R+ ∪ {0} → R+ ∪ {0} such that f (0) = 0 and f (x + f (x) + f (2y)) = 2f (x) + y + f (y), for all x, y ∈ R+ ∪ {0}. Solution. [by goldeneagle] P (a, b) means put x = a, y = b. • P (0, x) ⇒ f (f (2x)) = x + f (x) (*) • P (x, 0) ⇒ f (x + f (x)) = 2f (x) (**) 11Here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=444477 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 21 Now consider f (2a) = f (2b) by (*) a+f (a) = b+f (b) and by (**) f (a) = f (b) so a = b ⇒ f is injective. • P (x, x) ⇒ f (x + f (x) + f (2x)) = x + 3f (x) , and P (0, x + f (x)) ⇒ f (f (2x + 2f (x))) = x + 3f (x) so f (2x + 2f (x)) = x + f (x) + f (2x). Since x + f (x) = f (f (2x)), so we have ∀a ∈ R+ ∪ 0 : f (2f (f (a))) = f (a) + f (f (a)). Now put x = f (f (a)) in (*) : f (f (a)+ f (f (a))) = f (f (a))+ f (f (f (a))) and by (**) replace f (f (a)+f (f (a))) with 2f (f (a)) and then f (f (a)) = f (f (f (a))) ⇒ a = f (a). 42. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ such that for all x, y ∈ R+ : f (x + yn + f (y)) = f (x), where n ∈ Nn≥2. Solution. [by bappa1971] Let ∃w, z such that, f (w)+wn f (z)+zn ̸∈ Q. Denote s = f (w) + wn, t = f (z) + zn. Then, ∀ǫ > 0, ∃a, b ∈ N such that, 0 < |as − bt| < ǫ. 12 So, f (x) = f (x + bt − bt) = f (x + bt + (as − bt)) = f (x + bt+ ∈) = f (x+ ∈). Which implies, lim∈−→0 f (x+ ∈) = f (x), so f in continious. Now, if f (x)+x n = c for some constant c then, for large x, f (x) = c−x n < 0. So, take, u = lim inf x−→∞(f (x) + x n) and v = lim supx−→∞(f (x) + x n), we have v = ∞. So, continiuty of f implies ∀x ≥ u, ∃j such that, x = f (j) + jn. Hence f (x) = f (x + k) for all k > u. Now, take arbitary x, y and then take z such that z > max(x, y) + u. Then, f (x) = f (z) = f (y). So, f is constant. Now let, f (b)+b n f (a)+an ∈ Q for all a, b. 12See here: http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/viewtopic.php?t=432389 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 22 Take r = f (1) + 1 > 1 and g : Q −→ Q, g(x) = f (x)+xn r . Then we have f (x) = rg(x) − x n. So, rg(x + rg(y)) − (x + rg(y)) n = rg(x) − x n. So g(x + rg(y)) − g(x) = (x + rg(y)) n − x n r = n∑ i=1 ciri−1g(y) ix n−i ∈ Q, for all x ∈ R+. • x = g(y) =⇒ ∑n i=1 ciri = (r+1)n−1 r ∈ Q (1). x = r =⇒ rn−1 ∈ Q (2). y = 1, x = r2 =⇒ rn−1((r + 1) n − rn) ∈ Q =⇒ (r + 1) n − rn = u ∈ Q (3). • (1)-(2) and (3) =⇒ u−1 r ∈ Q =⇒ r ∈ Q Now, y = 1, x = π =⇒ (r+π)n−πn r = v ∈ Q =⇒ (r + π) n − πn − rv = 0. The polynomial h(x) = (x + r) n − x n − rv has π as a root as well as has all rational co-eﬃcients. An impossibility! So, f (x) = c is the only solution. 43. Find all functions f : N → N such that f (n − 1) + f (n + 1) < 2f (n) ∀n ≥ 2. Solution. [by pco] So f (n+1)−f (n) < f (n)−f (n−1) and so f (n+1)−f (n) < 0 ∀n great enough. So f (n + 1) < f (n) ∀n great enough and so f (n) < 0 ∀n great enough And so no solution. 44. Find all functions f : {A such that A ∈ Q, A ≥ 1} → Q such that f (xy2) = f (4x)f (y) + f (8x) f (2y) . Solution. [by pco] Let P (x, y) be the assertion f (xy2) = f (4x)f (y) + f (8x) f (2y) Notice that f (x) ̸= 0 ∀x ≥ 2. 1 FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS 23 • P (x, 2) =⇒ f (8x) = f (4x)(1 − f (2))f (4) and so f (2x) = af (x) ∀x ≥ 4 and some a ̸= 0. Let x, y ≥ 4 and the equation becomes then f (xy2) = a2f (x)f (y) + a2 f (x) f (y) . Setting y → 2y in this equation, we get f (xy2) = af (x)f (y) + f (x) af (y) . And so (subtracting) : a2(a − 1)f (y) 2 = (1 − a3) and so a = 1 (the case |f (y)| = constant is easy to cancel). So f (xy2) = f (x)f (y) + f (x) f (y) ∀x, y ≥ 4. Setting y = 4 in the above equality, we get f (x)(f (4) + 1 f (4) − 1) = 0 ∀x ≥ 4 and so f (x) = 0, impossible. And so no solution.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
