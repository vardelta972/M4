Find clever values to plug in to your equation to give you a simpler equation: in particular, make things in your equation equal 0, 1, or cancel with each other. Try to guess the answer to your functional equation; sometimes it will be obvious, but there may also be other solutions besides the most obvious one. Constant, linear, or quadratic functions are most common, but others happen sometimes. Remember to check that the answers you get actually work! Sometimes it helps to change the function you are looking at (e.g. if you want to prove f (x) = cx it might be useful to look at the function g(x) = f (x)/x and prove that g is constant. If the domain of your function is Z + (positive integers), Z, or even Q, consider using inductive strategies in your proof. 1.1 Potentially useful lemmas/intermediate steps when solving a func- tional equation • Try to ﬁgure out the values of, f (0), f (1) or any other speciﬁc values of your function that seem useful. • Prove that f is odd/even/ﬁnd some other formula relating f (−x) to f (x). • Prove that the function is injective (one-to-one). • Prove that the function is surjective (onto). 1.2 WARNING!: Cauchy’s functional equation. If you have shown that f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) you CANNOT conclude that there is a constant k such that f (x) = kx for all x. The functional equation f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) is known as Cauchy’s functional equation, and (assuming the axiom of choice) there exist non-linear functions f : R → R that satisfy this equation. The proof of this is beyond the scope of the lecture, and such pathological counterexamples never come up in olympiad problems. However, you CAN deduce that conclusion IF one of the following is true: the domain of your function is Z or Q, or if f is monotonic (increasing or decreasing). In such cases you can generally cite “Cauchy’s functional equation,” unless it trivializes the problem. 1 MOP 2010, Red/Green Group Functional Equations June 9, 2010 2 Examples 1 (South Africa 1997).
