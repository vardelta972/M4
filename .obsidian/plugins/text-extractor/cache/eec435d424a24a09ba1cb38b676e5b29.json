The ﬁrst 9 problems (roughly) are basic, the other ones are competition-level. 1. Find a formula for Fn, where Fn is the Fibonacci sequence: F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1. 2. Fix any positive integer k. Show that there are inﬁnitely many Fibonacci numbers divisible by k. 3. Find a formula for an, where a0 = a1 = 2, an+1 = 4an − 4an−1. 4. Find a 3-term recurrence relation for the sequence an = 3 n+1 − 2 · 5n. Now do the same for an = 3 n+1 − 2 · 5n + n2. 5. Find (1 1 1 0 )n. 6. Suppose that a0 = 0, b0 = 1 and that an = an−1 + 2bn−1, bn = −an−1 + 4bn−1. Find formulas for an and bn. 7. Suppose that x0 = 18, xn+1 = 10 3 xn−xn−1, and that the sequence (xn) ∞ n=1 converges (to some real number). What is x1? 8. Show for positive integers m, n: m | n if and only if Fm | Fn (where (Fn)n is the Fibonacci sequence). 9. Suppose Bob keeps throwing a coin and each time scores one point for a head and two points for a tail. For a ﬁxed n ≥ 1, what is the probability that his score is precisely n points at some point? (Hint: let pn be the probability this happens, and try to ﬁnd a recurrence relation. Maybe wait until the probability session.) 10. Suppose a0 = 0, a1 = 2 and an+2 = 4an+1 − 4an + n2 − 5n + 2. Show that n divides an for all n ≥ 1. 11. Let an = ⌊(5 + √21) n⌋ + 1, so a0 = 2, a1 = 10, a2 = 92, . . . Prove that an is divisible by 2n. 12. Find the digit immediately to the left and right of the decimal point for ( √7 + √13) 2008. 13. Write (2 + √3) 2n−1 = an + bn√3 for integers an and bn (n ≥ 1). Show that an − 1 is a perfect square. 14. Let T0 = 2, T1 = 3, T2 = 6, and for n ≥ 3, Tn = (n + 4)Tn−1 − 4nTn−2 + (4n − 8)Tn−3. 1 The ﬁrst few terms are 2, 3, 6, 14, 40, 152, 784, 5168, 40576. Find, with proof, a formula for Tn of the form Tn = An + Bn, where {An} and {Bn} are well-known sequences. (A-1, Putnam 1990) 15. Deﬁne a selﬁsh set to be a set which has its own cardinality (number of elements) as an element. Find, with proof, the number of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} which are minimal selﬁsh sets, that is, selﬁsh sets none of whose proper subsets is selﬁsh. (B-1, Putnam 1996) 16. Let (xn)n≥0 be a sequence of nonzero real numbers such that x 2 n−xn−1xn+1 = 1 for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . . Prove there exists a real number a such that xn+1 = axn − xn−1 for all n ≥ 1. (A-2, Putnam 1993) 17. Deﬁne a sequence {un} ∞ n=0 by u0 = u1 = u2 = 1, and thereafter by the condition that det ( un un+1 un+2 un+3 ) = n! for all n ≥ 0. Show that un is an integer for all n. (By convention, 0! = 1.) (A-3, Putnam 2004) 18. Let 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009, 2012, 2016, . . . be a sequence deﬁned by xk = k for k = 1, 2, . . . , 2006 and xk+1 = xk + xk−2005 for k ≥ 2006. Show that the sequence has 2005 consecutive terms each divisible by 2006. (A-3, Putnam 2006) 19. Let x0 = 1 and for n ≥ 0, let xn+1 = 3xn + ⌊xn√5⌋. In particular, x1 = 5, x2 = 26, x3 = 136, x4 = 712. Find a closed-form expression for x2007. (⌊a⌋ means the largest integer ≤ a.) (B-3, Putnam 2007) 20. Deﬁne a sequence by a0 = 1, together with the rules a2n+1 = an and a2n+2 = an + an+1 for each integer n ≥ 0. Prove that every positive rational number appears in the set { an−1 an : n ≥ 1 } = { 1 1 , 1 2 , 2 1 , 1 3 , 3 2 , . . . } . (A-5, Putnam 2002) (Note: you will need some number theory we didn’t discuss two weeks ago.) 21. The sequence (an)n≥1 is deﬁned by a1 = 1, a2 = 2, a3 = 24, and, for n ≥ 4, an = 6a 2 n−1an−3 − 8an−1a 2 n−2 an−2an−3 . Show that, for all n, an is an integer multiple of n.
