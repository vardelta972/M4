This is, for most purposes, equivalent to having the property that for any a; b in the domain, f ( a+b 2 ) \u0014 f (a)+f (b) 2 . Then given positive weights \u00151; : : : ; \u0015n that sum to 1, Jensen's inequality says that f (\u00151x1 + : : : + \u0015nxn) \u0014 \u00151f (x1) + : : : + \u0015nf (xn): If your function is concave (the opposite of convex), apply Jensen to \u0000f . If you've got something where f looks like a product rather than a sum, take the logarithm and hope that the logarithm of components of f are convex or concave. If f is convex or concave on only a portion of the domain? Do it anyway, just be more careful. In general, \\smoothing\" is the process of nudging around parameters of an inequality so that it becomes tighter. Or, even more generally, nudging things in a small (i.e. simple) way, and watching closely. Jensen's is one particular form of this, where all the variables are nudged to their mean simultaneously, which might solve the problem in one shot. But there are many more speci\fc \\nudges\" to try if straight-up Jensen does not quite work. Try smoothing one pair of variables at a time, perhaps moving both variables by the same amount but in opposite directions, perhaps moving until one of them hits some crucial value, like the arithmetic mean of all the variables, or the max of all the variables; maybe consider a pair that includes the biggest or the smallest variable. In general, look for changes that \"make progress\" in some way, but are also \"simple\" in some way. And then watch closely. 2 Problems 1.
