Evaluate the following limits lim x→1 ( x x − 1 − 1 log x ) , lim x→∞ (ex + x) 1/x , lim x→0+ (cos 2x) 1/x2. 2. Determine, with proof, the value of lim x→0 2 sin x − sin 2x x − sin x and lim x→0 x − sin x x3 . 3. Evaluate lim x→0+ xx and hence justify what should be the convention for the value of 0 0 (in order to make the function xx right-continuous at 0). 4. Let f, g be functions deﬁned on [a, b] and f (a) = g(a) = 0. Suppose that f, g are both diﬀerentiable at a. Furthermore, assume that g(x) ̸= 0 for a < x < b and g′(a) ̸= 0. Show that lim x→a f (x)/g(x) exists and equals f ′(a)/g′(a). 5. Let f (x) = x2 sin(1/x) for x ̸= 0, let f (0) = 0, and let g(x) = x2 for x ∈ R. Show that lim x→0 f (x)/g(x) does not exist. Find out why the result of the last problem does not hold here. 6. Let f (x) = x2 for x rational, let f (x) = 0 for x irrational, and let g(x) = sin x for x ∈ R. Find out why we can’t use the standard L’hˆopital’s rule for this problem. Use one of the above problems to evaluate lim x→0 f (x)/g(x). 7. Let f (x) = x2 sin(1/x) for x ̸= 0, let f (0) = 0, and let g(x) = sin x for x ∈ R. Show that lim x→0 f (x)/g(x) = 0 but that lim x→0 f ′(x)/g′(x) does not exist. 8. For each of the following examples, explain why L’hˆopital’s rule can’t be applied to write lim x→∞ f (x)/g(x) = lim x→∞ f ′(x)/g′(x). (a) f (x) = 4 + 1/x, and g(x) = 2 + 1/x. (b) f (x) = x + sin x, and g(x) = x. (c) f (x) = x + sin x cos x, and g(x) = f (x)esin x. 9. Let f be a diﬀerentiable function such that lim x→∞ (f (x) + f ′(x)) = ℓ ∈ R. Show that lim x→∞ f ′(x) = 0. If we drop the assumption that ℓ is ﬁnite, will the conclusion still hold? 10 10. Let f : (0, ∞) → R be a diﬀerentiable function such that, lim x→∞ f (x) = 2019. Show that if lim x→∞ f ′(x) exists then it must be zero. Is it necessary that lim x→∞ f ′(x) exists? 11. Determine, with proof, the value of lim x→∞ x ((1 + 1 x )x − e ) . 12. Suppose that f is twice diﬀerentiable in a neighbourhood of c. Show that lim h→0 f (c + h) + f (c − h) − 2f (c) h2 = f ′′(c). 13. Suppose that f is a function such that the limit lim h→0 f (c + h) + f (c − h) − 2f (c) h2 exists and is ﬁnite. Does this imply that f ′′(c) exists and equals the above limit? 14. Show that for any polynomial P (x) with real coeﬃcients, lim x→∞ P (x)/ex = 0. 15. Deﬁne a function f : R → R by f (x) = e−1/x for x > 0 and f (x) = 0 for x ≤ 0. Determine, with proof, the value of f (n)(0) for every n ≥ 1. (Here f (n)(0) denotes the n-th derivative of f, evaluated at 0.) 16. Suppose that f is a function such that f ′′(a) exists. Deﬁne a quadratic polynomial p(x) = f (a) + f ′(a)(x − a) + f ′′(a)(x − a)2/2. Show that lim x→a f (x) − p(x) (x − a)2 = 0. (Note that in order to have f twice diﬀerentiable at x = a, we need f ′(x) to be deﬁned in a open neighbourhood of a, i.e. f must be diﬀerentiable in a open neighbourhood of a.)
