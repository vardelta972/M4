Here’s a slightly less intimidating form (though sometimes you will want to use the above form): a1 + a2 + . . . an n ≥ n√a1a2 . . . an Surprisingly, this is all you will need to know for this lecture other than basic algebra and the fact that x2 ≥ 0. The rest will be problems, because inequalities are a diﬃcult concept to master and the best way to master anything is to do a lot of problems! 1. Verify that a2 + b2 ≥ 2ab, ﬁrst with AM-GM and then with the fact that x2 ≥ 0. 2. If abc = 1, minimize a3 + b3 + c3 for positive reals a,b,c. 3. For x ≥ 0, minimize x2 + 2 x . 4. For a, b ≥ 0, maximize 2ab a2+b2 . 5. For a, b ≥ 0, maximize 6ab a2+9b2 . 6. For x ≥ 0, minimize x + 1 x+1 (no Calculus!). 7. For x ≥ 0, minimize x3+2 x+3 . 8. Which is bigger, 2007! or (1003)2007? 9. If you can have 1 of one coin, 5 of another coin, and 10 of a third coin, and can choose pennies, nickels, and dimes, in what way should you choose the coins to maximize your net gain? 10. This intuitive result can in fact be generalized: x2 + y2 + z2 ≥ xy + yz + zx. Show that this is always true. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
