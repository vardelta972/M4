Of course, they are not completely independent and many problems can be solved by using several methods. 2 Uniqueness of prime factorization This is a powerful method which we illustrate by the following example: Example 1 (New-York, 1977). Solve the Diophantine equation 2 x + 1 = y2. Solution: We write 2 x = y2 − 1 = (y − 1)(y + 1). Since the prime factorization is unique, we get y − 1 = 2k and y + 1 = 2 m with m > k > 0. But the 2m − 2 k = (y + 1) − (y − 1) = 2, whence 2 k(2m−k − 1) = 2 and k = 1 and m = 2. Finally we get x = y = 3. Example 2. (Moscow, 1945) Find all integer solutions of the equation xy + 3x − 5y = −3. Solution: Let us express y as a function of x: y = −3 − 3x x − 5 = 15 − 3x − 18 x − 5 = −3 − 18 x − 5 . Thus x − 5 divides 18, hence x − 5 can take any of the following values: ±1, ±2, ±3, ±6, ±9, ±18. Hence we will have 12 solutions shown in the following table: x − 5 -1 1 -2 2 -3 3 -6 6 -9 9 -18 18 x 4 6 3 7 2 8 -1 11 -4 14 -13 23 y 15 -21 6 -12 3 -9 0 -6 -1 -5 -2 -4 3 Proving that there are no large solutions Example 3 (Moscow, 1944). Find all integer solutions of x + y = x2 − xy + y2. Solution: We write this equation as 1 2 x2 − xy + 1 2 y2 + 1 2 x2 − x + 1 2 + 1 2 y2 − y 1 2 = 1. 1 or ((x − y) 2 + (x − 1)2 + (y − 1)2 = 2. Now it is clear that |x − y| ≤ 1, (x − 1) ≤ 1, (y − 1) ≤ 1, and we ﬁnd all solutions by inspection: (0, 0), (1, 0), (0, 1), (2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2). This method often involves using inequalities. Example 4. Find all pairs positive integers (x, y) which satisfy the equation x3 − y3 = xy + 61. Solution: Let (x, y) be a solution. By AM-GM inequality x 2 + y2 ≥ 2xy and hence x3 − y3 = (x − y)(x2 + xy + y2) ≥ 3(x − y)xy. Hence 3(x − y)xy ≥ xy + 61 or (3(x − y) − 1)xy ≤ 61. It is clear that x ̸= y. Let us consider the case, when x − y = 1. Then substituting x = y + 1 into the original equation we get 2y2 + 2y + 1 = 61 from which we deduce that y = 5, x = 6. If x − y = 2, we obtain the equation 5y2 + 10y + 8 = 61, which has no integer solutions. Finally, let us suggest that x − y ≥ 3. Then 3(x − y) − 1 ≥ 8, hence xy ≤ 7. Since x − y ≥ 3, the only possibility is x = 7 and y = 1 which do not satisfy the equation. Hence (x, y) = (6, 5) is the only solution. Solution: Alternatively, we can prove that the diﬀerence d = x − y is small by substituting x = y + d into the equation. We obtain (3d − 1)y2 + (3d 2 − d)y + d3 = 61 from which we deduce that d 3 ≤ 61 or d ≤ 3. We then need to consider three cases: d = 1, d = 2, and d = 3. We leave this to the reader. 4 Squeeze principle Squeezing an unknown between two consequtive squares is a method which is surprisingly often used. In its simplest form it works as follows: Example 5. Prove that the equation m2 = n4 + n2 + 1 does not have integer solutions. Solution: We note that (n2) 2 = n4 < m 2 < n 4 + 2n2 + 1 = (n2 + 1)2 which is impossible as the square m 2 is squezed between two consequtive squares (n2) 2 and (n 2 + 1)2. This argument can be more elaborate as in the following problem. Example 6 (GDR, 1973). Find all integer solutions to the equation x(x + 1)(x + 7)(x + 8) = y2. Solution: Let (x, y) be any solution. Then y2 = x(x + 8)(x + 1)(x + 7) = (x2 + 8x)(x2 + 8x + 7) = z2 + 7z, where z = x2 + 8x. If z > 9, then (z + 3)2 = z2 + 6z + 9 < z2 + 7z = y2 < z2 + 8z + 16 = (z + 4)2, which is impossible. Hence x2 + 8x = z ≤ 9 which implies −9 ≤ x ≤ 1. Trying these numbers one by one, we ﬁnd all solutions: (−9, ±12), (−8, 0), (−7, 0), (−4, ±12), (−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, ±12). 2 5 Inﬁnite descent This is a very well-known technique, used for instance in proving that √2 is irrational. We reformulate irra- tionality of √2 in terms of the existence of solutions of a Diophantine equation. Example 7. Prove that the equation x2 − 2y2 = 0 has no integer solutions apart from (0, 0). Solution: Suppose that an integer solution (x, y) exits. Then x must be even, hence x = 2x1 and (2x1)2 −2y2 = 0 which implies 2x2 1 − y2 = 0. Now we see that y must be also even, hence y = 2y1. Substituting this expression into the equation we get 2x2 1 − (2y1)2 = 0 or x2 1 − 2y2 1 = 0. Hence we obtained another solution (x1, y1) of the original equation with |x1| < |x|. What is wrong with that? Well, we can now repeat everything for the new solution and get a solution (x2, y2) with |x2| < |x1|. And we can repeat it again. Therefore we obtain an inﬁnite sequence of solutions (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xn, yn), . . . with |x1| > |x2| > . . . > |xn| > . . .. This is impossible since all the |xi| are natural numbers. 6 Quadratic residues and residues of higher order Let p be an odd prime. The nonzero squares modulo p are called the quadratic residues (mod p). If n ≥ p, then n = kp + r, where 0 ≤ r < p and n2 ≡ r2 (mod p), hence it is enough to consider the squares of the numbers from 1 to p − 1. Moreover since (p − a)2 ≡ (−a) 2 = a 2 (mod p), it is enough to consider the squares 12, 2 2, . . . , ( p − 1 2 )2 (mod p) These are distinct since if i2 ≡ j2 (mod p) for i > j and 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 1 2 (p − 1), then i2 − j2 = (i − j)(i + j) is divisible by p, which is only possible, when i = j, which is a contradiction. Therefore, among the numbers 0, 1, . . . , p − 1 there are 1 2 (p − 1) quadratic residues (mod p). The 1 2 (p − 1) remaining nonzero numbers are called quadratic nonresidues. Zero is neither a residue nor a nonresidue. Example 8. If p = 11, the quadratic residues (mod 11) are 1, 3, 4, 5, 9 since 12 = 1, 22 = 4, 32 = 9, 4 2 = 16 ≡ 5, 5 2 = 25 ≡ 3. We can now apply this to some Diophantine equations. If p = 3, then 1 is a quadratic residue and 2 is a nonresidue. This means that the equation x2 = 2003 cannot have a solution because 2003 ≡ 2 (mod 3) and 2 is a quadratic nonresidue. The next example is the equation x2 + y2 = z2. We can easily prove that it does not have any solutions with odd x and y. In such case x2 ≡ 1 (mod 3) and y2 ≡ 1 (mod 3) leading to the conclusion that z2 ≡ 2 (mod 3), which we know is impossible. Example 9. Prove that there are no positive integers a, b such that a 2 − 3b2 = 8. Solution: Let us consider this equation modulo 3. Then we get a 2 ≡ 2 (mod 3) which we know means no solution. Sometimes it is useful to consider residues for composite numbers as well. Example 10 (USA, 79). Find all integer solutions of the equation x4 1 + x4 2 + · · · + x4 14 = 1599. (1) Solution: We claim that x4 can have only two residues (mod 16), namely 0 and 1. Indeed, if x is even, then x4 ≡ 0 (mod 16). Suppose x = 2k + 1, where k is an integer. Then x4 = (2k + 1)4 = (4k2 + 4k + 1)2 = (8s + 1)2 = 64s 2 + 16s + 1 ≡ 1 (mod 16) Here we denoted k2 + k = 2s, because k2 + k = k(k + 1) is even. Since 1599 ≡ 15 (mod 16), the equation (1) does not have solutions at all. 3 7 Problems 1.
