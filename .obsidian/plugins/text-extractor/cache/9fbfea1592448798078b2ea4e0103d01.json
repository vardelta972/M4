Let x and y be non-negative real numbers. Prove that (x + y3)(x3 + y) ≥ 4x2y2. When does equality hold? 2. Find all functions f : N → N that satisfy the following two conditions: (a) f (n) is a perfect square for all n ∈ N; (b) f (m + n) = f (m) + f (n) + 2mn for all m, n ∈ N. (For the purposes of this problem we will consider N to be the set {1,2,3,. . . }, i.e., 0 is not considered to be a natural number.) 3. Consider two ordered sequences of real numbers a1 < a2 < · · · < an and b1 < b2 < · · · < bm, where n, m ∈ N, n, m ≥ 2. Prove that the set {ai + bj|1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} contains exactly n + m − 1 elements if and only if both sequences are arithmetic, with the same increment. 4. Determine the largest subset M ⊆ R + such that the inequality √ab + √ cd ≥ √a + b + √c + d holds for all a, b, c, d ∈ M . Determine whether the inequality √ab + √ cd ≥ √a + c + √ b + d also holds for all a, b, c, d ∈ M . (Note that R+ denotes the set of all positive real numbers.) 5. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c ≥ abc. Prove that a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ √3abc. 1 6. Find all functions f : Z → Z satisfying f (m + n) + f (mn − 1) = f (m)f (n) + 2 for all m, n ∈ Z. 7. Let (an) ∞ n=1 be a sequence of positive integers such that an < an+1 for all n ≥ 1. Suppose that for all 4-tuples of indices (i, j, k, l) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k < l and i + l = j + k, the inequality ai + al > aj + ak is satisﬁed. Determined the least possible value of a2010. 8. Find the least positive number x with the following property: if a, b, c, d are arbitrary positive numbers whose product is 1, then ax + bx + cx + dx ≥ 1 a + 1 b + 1 c + 1 d . 17th February 2010 www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
