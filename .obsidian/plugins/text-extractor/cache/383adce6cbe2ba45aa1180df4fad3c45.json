We also learned about the techniques of Dumbassing, Homogenizations, Smoothing, and Substitutions. As a review, here are the theorems from last time: Throughout this lecture, we refer to convex and concave functions. Write I and I ′ for the intervals [a, b] and (a, b) respectively. A function f is said to be convex on I if and only if λf (x)+(1−λ)f (y) ≥ f (λx + (1 − λ)y) for all x, y ∈ I and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Conversely, if the inequality always holds in the opposite direction, the function is said to be concave on the interval. A function f that is continuous on I and twice diﬀerentiable on I ′ is convex on I if and only if f ′′(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ I (Concave if the inequality is ﬂipped.) Let x1 ≥ x2 ≥ · · · ≥ xn; y1 ≥ y2 ≥ · · · ≥ yn be two sequences of real numbers. If x1 + · · · + xk ≥ y1 +· · ·+yk for k = 1, 2, . . . , n with equality where k = n, then the sequence {xi} is said to majorize the sequence {yi}. An equivalent criterion is that for all real numbers t, |t − x1| + |t − x2| + · · · + |t − xn| ≥ |t − y1| + |t − y2| + · · · + |t − yn| We use these deﬁnitions to introduce some famous inequalities. Theorem 1 (Trivial Inequality) For all real numbers x, x2 ≥ 0. Theorem 2 (Jensen) Let f : I → R be a convex function. Then for any x1, . . . , xn ∈ I and any nonnegative reals ω1, . . . , ωn with positive sum, ω1f (x1) + · · · + ωnf (xn) ≥ (ω1 + · · · + ωn) f ( ω1x1 + · · · + ωnxn ω1 + · · · + ωn ) If f is concave, then the inequality is ﬂipped. Theorem 3 (Weighted Power Mean) If x1, . . . , xn are nonnegative reals and ω1, . . . , ωn are nonnegative reals with a postive sum, then f (r) := ( ω1xr 1 + · · · + ωnxr n ω1 + · · · + ωn ) 1 r is a non-decreasing function of r, with the convention that r = 0 is the weighted geometric mean. f is strictly increasing unless all the xi are equal except possibly for r ∈ (−∞, 0], where if some xi is zero f is identically 0. In particular, f (1) ≥ f (0) ≥ f (−1) gives the AM-GM-HM inequality. Theorem 4 (H¨older) Let a1, . . . , an; b1, . . . , bn; · · · ; z1, . . . , zn be sequences of nonnegative real numbers, and let λa, λb, . . . , λz positive reals which sum to 1. Then (a1 + · · · + an) λa(b1 + · · · + bn) λb · · · (z1 + · · · + zn) λz ≥ a λa 1 bλb 1 · · · zλz 1 + · · · + a λz n bλb n · · · zλz n This theorem is customarily identiﬁed as Cauchy when there are just two sequences. 1Thanks to Thomas Mildorf for writing the lecture on Inequalities, available online at http://web.mit.edu/ tmil- dorf/www/Inequalities.pdf, as well as for generously providing me with the .tex ﬁle for said lecture so that I did not have to recopy all of the theorems. In addition, many example problems are also taken from his lecture. 1 Theorem 5 (Rearrangement) Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nonde- creasing sequences of real numbers. Then, for any permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a1bπ(1) + a2bπ(2) + · · · + anbπ(n) ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 with equality on the left and right holding if and only if the sequence π(1), . . . , π(n) is decreasing and increasing respectively. Theorem 6 (Chebyshev) Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an; b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers. Then a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn n ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n · b1 + b2 + · · · + bn n ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 n Theorem 7 (Schur) Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals and r > 0. Then a r(a − b)(a − c) + br(b − c)(b − a) + c r(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if a = b = c or some two of a, b, c are equal and the other is 0. Remark - This can be improved considerably. (See the problems section.) However, they are not as well known (as of now) as this form of Schur, and so should be proven whenever used on a contest. Theorem 8 (Majorization) Let f : I → R be a convex on I and suppose that the sequence x1, . . . , xn majorizes the sequence y1, . . . , yn, where xi, yi ∈ I. Then f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + · · · + f (yn) Theorem 9 (Muirhead) Suppose the sequence a1, . . . , an majorizes the sequence b1, . . . , bn. Then for any positive reals x1, . . . , xn, ∑ sym x a1 1 x a2 2 · · · x an n ≥ ∑ sym x b1 1 x b2 2 · · · x bn n where the sums are taken over all permutations of n variables. Remark - Although Muirhead’s theorem is a named theorem, it is generally not favorably regarded as part of a formal olympiad solution. Essentially, the majorization criterion guarantees that Muir- head’s inequality can be deduced from a suitable application of AM-GM. Hence, whenever possible, you should use Muirhead’s inequality only to deduce the correct relationship and then explicitly write all of the necessary applications of AM-GM. For a particular case this is a simple matter. 2 New Techniques 2.1 Notation This isn’t really a technique, but having good notation allows you to write out otherwise diﬃcult algebraic expansions with relative ease. The two major examples of this are the cyclic and symmetric sums, denoted by ∑ cyc and ∑ sym. In the 3-variable case (the idea should easily expand to other cases), ∑ cyc f (a, b, c) = f (a, b, c) + f (b, c, a) + f (c, a, b) ∑ sym f (a, b, c) = f (a, b, c) + f (a, c, b) + f (b, a, c) + f (b, c, a) + f (c, a, b) + f (c, b, a) 2 2.2 Calculus Some of the following techniques will be calculus-based. Therefore, before beginning, we will go through a quick crash-course on diﬀerentiating. δ δxi f (x1, . . . , xi, . . . , xn) is the partial derivative of f with respect to xi. It is equivalent to the derivative d dxi f (xi) of f with respect to xi where we treat x1, . . . , xi−1, xi+1, . . . , xn as constants. A function is increasing if its derivative is positive, decreasing if its derivative is negative, and constant if its derivative is zero. The following formulas should allow you to ﬁnd the derivative of any function you come across: 1. d dx ex = ex 2. f ′(x) := d dx f (x) 3. (Product Rule) (f g)′(x) = (f ′g + g′f )(x) 4. (Quotient Rule) ( f g )′(x) = f ′g−g′f gg (x) 5. (Chain Rule) d dx f (g(x)) = f ′(g(x)) ∗ g′(x) or dy dt = dy dx dx dt 6. d dx (cf (x)) = c d dx f (x) 7. d dx (f + g)(x) = d dx f (x) + d dx g(x) 8. (Power Rule) d dx xn = nxn−1 9. d dx ax = ax ln(a) 10. d dx ln(x) = 1 x 11. d dx sin(x) = cos(x) 12. d dx cos(x) = −sin(x) 2.3 Convexity A function is convex if its second derivative d2 dx2 f (x) = d dx d dx f (x) is positive, and concave if it is negative. In addition to the possible application of Jensen’s inequality, if a function is convex then its maximum occurs when all variables are at one of the endpoints of its domain, and its minimum can be found with Jensen (if an equality case exists). The opposite is true for a concave function. 2.4 Isolated Fudging The idea here is to compare some complicated function f (x1, . . . , xn) to a (generic) nicer func- tion. Common choices are linear and quadratic functions, as well as the function c xr i xr 1+...+xr n . After picking a generic function that you think would be helpful, you can ﬁgure out particular values of exponents, coeﬃcients, etc. through the use of calculus. In particular, both the functions and their derivatives must be equal at the equality cases for the inequality to be true. Here is an example: (IMO 2001, Problem 2) Let a, b, c be positive reals. Prove that 3 a √a2 + 8bc + b √b2 + 8ca + c √c2 + 8ab ≥ 1 Here we will compare ∑ cyc a√a2+8bc to ∑ cyc ar ar+br+cr = 1. One of the equality cases is a = b = c = 1, so we set b and c to 1. Then, taking the partial derivative of the ﬁrst term in both inequal- ities with respect to a yields d da a√a2+8 = √a2+8− a2 √a2+8 a2+8 = 8 27 when evaluated at a = 1, and d da ar ar+2 = rar−1(ar+2)−rar−1ar (ar+2)2 = 2 9 r when evaluated at a = 1. Then solving 2 9 r = 8 27 we have r = 4 3 . Then we need to show that a√a2+8bc ≥ a 4 3 a 4 3 +b 4 3 +c 4 3 , or, equivalently, a + ( b4 a ) 1 3 + ( c4 a ) 1 3 ≥ √a2 + 8bc. Squaring and subtracting a2 from both sides, we get a new inequality, which should follow directly from weighted AM-GM. This is what should go into your scratchwork. However, a writeup should look something like this: Consider the following inequality: 3√a2b4 + 3√a2b4 + 3√a2c4 + 3√a2c4 + 3√b8a−2 + 3√b4c4a−2 + 3√b4c4a−2 + 3√c8a−2 ≥ 8 24√b24c24 = 8bc If we add a2 to both sides, then this factors to (a + 3√b4a−1 + 3√c4b−1)2 ≥ a2 + 8bc, after which it follows that a√a2+8bc ≥ a 4 3 a 4 3 +b 4 3 +c 4 3 , so that ∑ cyc a √a2 + 8bc ≥ ∑ cyc a 4 3 a 4 3 + b 4 3 + c 4 3 = 1 the desired result. 2.5 Logs Oftentimes, when given a problem which involves many terms multiplied together instead of added, it can be useful to take the log of the expressions, then solve the new inequality, usually using something involving convexity and concavity. 2.6 Factoring To aid in factoring, consider that multi-variables polynomials behave like single-variable polynomi- als in that if, say, the polynomial has a zero at a = b, then (a − b) is a root of the polynomial. 3 Problems Thanks to Thomas Mildorf for assembling the following problems. 1.
