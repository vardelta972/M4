The first few chapters are devoted to a fuller discussion of Ratio, Proportion, Variation, and the Progressions, which in the former work were treated in an elementary manner ; and we have here introduced theorems and examples which are unsuitable for a first course of reading. From this point the work covers ground for the most part new to the student, and enters upon subjects of special importance : these we have endeavoured to treat minutely and thoroughly, discussing both bookwork and examples witli that fulness which we have always found necessary in our experience as teachers. It has been our aim to discuss all the essential parts as completely as possible within the limits of a single volume, but in a few of the later chapters it has been im- possible to find room for more than an introductory sketch ; in all such cases our object has been to map out a suitable first course of reading, referring the student to special treatises for fuller information. In the chapter on Permutations and Combinations we are much indebted to the Rev. W. A. Whitworth for per- mission to make use of some of the proofs given in his Choice and Chance. For many years we have used these proofs in our own teaching, and we are convinced that this vi PREFACE. part of Algebra is made far more intelligible to the beginner by a system of common sense reasoning from first principles than by the proofs usually found in algebraical text-books. The discussion of Convergency and Divergency of Series always presents great difficulty to the student on his first reading. The inherent difficulties of the subject are no doubt considerable, and these are increased by the place it has ordinarily occupied, and by the somewhat inadequate treatment it has hitherto received. Accordingly we have placed this section somewhat later than is usual; much thought has been bestowed on its general arrangement, and on the selection of suitable examples to illustrate the text ; and we have endeavoured to make it more interesting and intelligible by previously introducing a short chapter on Limiting Values and Vanishing Fractions. In the chapter on Summation of Series we have laid much stress on the \" Method of Differences\" and its wide and important applications. The basis of this method is a well- known formula in the Calculus of Finite Differences, which in the absence of a purely algebraical proof can hardly be con- sidered admissible in a treatise on Algebra. The proof of the Finite Difference formula which we have given in Arts. 395, 396, we believe to be new and original, and the development of the Difference Method from this formula has enabled us to introduce many interesting types of series which have hitherto been relegated to a much later stage in the student's reading. We have received able and material assistance in the chapter on Probability from the Rev. T. C. Simmons of Christ's College, Brecon, and our warmest thanks are due to him, both for his aid in criticising and improving the text, and for placing at our disposal several interesting and original problems. It is hardly possible to read any modern treatise on Analytical Conies or Solid Geometry without some know- PKEFACE. yii ledge of Determinants and their applications. We have therefore given a brief elementary discussion of Determi- nants in Chapter xxxm., in the hope that it may provide the student with a useful introductory course, and prepare him for a more complete study of the subject. The last chapter contains all the most useful propositions in the Theory of Equations suitable for a first reading. The Theory of Equations follows so naturally on the study of Algebra that no apology is needed for here introducing pro- positions which usually find place in a separate treatise. In fact, a considerable part of Chapter xxxv. may be read with advantage at a much earlier stage, and may conveniently be studied before some of the harder sections of previous chapters. It will be found that each chapter is as nearly as possible complete in itself, so that the order of their succession can be varied at the discretion of the teacher ; but it is recom- * mended that all sections marked with an asterisk should be reserved for a second reading. In enumerating the sources from which we have derived assistance in the preparation of this work, there is one book to which it is difficult to say how far we are indebted. Todhunter's Algebra for Schools and Colleges has been the recognised English text-book for so long that it is hardly possible that any one writing a text-book on Algebra at the present day should not be largely influenced by it. At the same time, though for many years Todhunter's Algebra has been in constant use among our pupils, we have rarely adopted the order and arrangement there laid down; in many chapters we have found it expedient to make frequent use of alternative proofs; and we have always largely sup- plemented the text by manuscript notes. These notes, which now appear scattered throughout the present work, have been collected at different times during the last twenty H. H. A. b Viii PREFACE. years, so that it is impossible to make definite acknowledge- ment in every case where assistance has been obtained from other writers. But speaking generally, our acknowledge- ments are chiefly due to the treatises of Schlomilch, Serret, and Laurent; and among English writers, besides Todhunter's Algebra, we have occasionally consulted the works of De Morgan, Colenso, Gross, and Chrystal. To the Rev. J. Wolsienholme, D.Sc, Professor of Mathe- matics at the Royal Indian Engineering College, our thanks are due for his kindness in allowing us to select questions from his unique collection of problems ; and the consequent gain to our later chapters we gratefully acknowledge. It remains for us to express our thanks to our colleagues and friends who have so largely assisted us in reading and correcting the proof sheets ; in particular we are indebted to the Rev. H. C Watson of Clifton College for his kindness in revising the whole work, and for many valuable suggestions; in every part of it. **' 1887 \" H. S. HALL, j S. R.

In this edition the text and examples are substantially the same as in previous editions, but a few articles havej been recast, and all the examples have been verified again. We have also added a collection of three hundred Miscel- laneous Examples which will be found useful for advanced students. These examples have been selected mainly but not exclusively from Scholarship or Senate House papers ; much care has been taken to illustrate every part of the subject, and to fairly represent the principal University and Civil Service Examinations.

Ratio is the relation which one quantity bears to another of the same kind, the comparison being made by considering what multiple, part, or parts, one quantity is of the other. • The ratio of A to B is usually written A : B. The quantities A and B are called the terms of the ratio. The first term is called the antecedent, the second term the consequent. 2. To find what multiple or part A is of B, we divide A by B ; hence the ratio A : B may be measured by the fraction -^ , and we shall usually find it convenient to adopt this notation. In order to compare two quantities they must be expressed in terms of the same unit. Thus the ratio of £2 to 15s. is measured .... 2x20 8 by the traction — ^ — or - . Note. A ratio expresses the number of times that one quantity con- tains another, and therefore every ratio is an abstract quantity. 3. Since by the laws of fractions, a ma b = mJ' it follows that the ratio a : b is equal to the ratio ma : mb ; that is, the value of a ratio remains unaltered if the antecedent and the consequent are multiplied or divided by the same quantity. H. H. A. 1 2 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 4. Two or more ratios may be compared by reducing their equivalent fractions to a common denominator. Thus suppose _ _ x- xt a a V i x bx , a : o and x : y are two ratios. JNow - = ~ and — = =— : hence J h by y by 3 the ratio a : b is greater than, equal to, or less than the ratio x : y according as ay is greater than, equal to, or less than bx. 5. The ratio of two fractions can be expressed as a ratio Ch C of two integers. Thus the ratio — : — is measured by the ° b a a fraction — , or =— : and is therefore equivalent to the ratio c be d ad : be. 6. If either, or both, of the terms of a ratio be a surd quantity, then no two integers can be found which will exactly measure their ratio. Thus the ratio J'2 : 1 cannot be exactly expressed by any two integers. 7. Definition. If the ratio of any two quantities can be expressed exactly by the ratio of two integers, the quantities are said to be commensurable ; otherwise, they are said to be incommensurable. Although we cannot find two integers which will exactly measure the ratio of two incommensurable quantities, we can always find two integers whose ratio differs from that required by as small a quantity as we please. J5 2-236068... ™ A1I , Thus V = -. = -559017... 4 4 , , . J5 559017 , 559018 and therefore — > mm(> and < -jooOOOO ; so that the difference between the ratios 559017 : 1000000 and J 5 : 4 is less than -000001. By carrying the decimals further, a closer approximation may be arrived at. 8. Definition. Ratios are compounded by multiplying to- gether the fractions which denote them ; or by multiplying to- gether the antecedents for a new antecedent, and the consequents for a new consequent. Example. Find the ratio compounded of the three ratios 2a : Sb, Q>ab : 5c 2 , c : a KATIO. m . . , ,. 2a Gab c The required ratio = -x --„ x - 6b be 1 a _4a ~ DC ' 9. Definition. When the ratio a : b is compounded with itself the resulting ratio is a 2 : b 2 , and is called the duplicate ratio of a : b. Similarly a 3 : b 3 is called the triplicate ratio of a : b. Also a 2 : b 2 \" is called the subduplicate ratio of a : b. Examples. (1) The duplicate ratio of 2a : 3b is 4a 2 : 96-. (2) The subduplicate ratio of 49 : 25 is 7 : 5. (3) The triplicate ratio of 2x : 1 is 8a; 3 : 1. 10. Definition. A ratio is said to he a ratio of greater inequality, of less inequality, or of equality, according as the antecedent is greater than, less than, or equal to the consequent. 11. A ratio of greater inequality is diminished, and a ratio of less inequality is increased, by adding the same quantity to both its terms. a , ,, .. , , , a + x Let T be the ratio, and let = be the new ratio formed by 6 b + x J erms. a a + x ax — bx adding x to both its terms. Now b b + x b(b+x) x(a — b) ~b(b + x) } and a - b is positive or negative according as a is greater or less than b.

Similarly it can be proved that a ratio of greater inequality is increased, and a ratio of less inequality is diminished, by taking the same quantity from both its terms. 12. When two or more ratios are equal many useful pro- positions may be proved by introducing a single symbol to denote each of the equal ratios. 1—2 4 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

Definition. When two ratios are equal, the four quantities composing them are said to be proportionals. Thus ft c if - = - , then a, b, c, d are proportionals. This is expressed by saying that a is to b as c is to d, and the proportion is written a : b : : c : d ; or a : b — c : d. The terms a and d are called the extremes, b and c the means. 19. If four quantities are in proportion, the product of the extremes is equal to the product of the means. Let a, b, c, d be the proportionals. Then by definition — =. — • J b d whence ad = be. Hence if any three terms of a proportion are given, the fourth may be found. Thus if a, c, d are given, then b = — . Conversely, if there are any four quantities, a, b, c, d, such that ad = be, then a, b, c, d are proportionals ; a and d being the extremes, b and c the means ; or vice versa. 20. Definition. Quantities are said to be in continued proportion when the first is to the second, as the second is to the third, as the third to the fourth ; and so on. Thus a, b, c, d, are in continued proportion when a b c bed 14 HIGHER ALGEBRA. If three quantities a, b, c are in continued proportion, then a : b — b : c \\ .-. ac = b 2 . [Art. 18.] In this case b is said to be a mean proportional between a and c \\ and c is said to be a third proportional to a and b. 21. If three quantities are proportionals the first is to the third in the duplicate ratio of the first to tJie second. Let the three quantities be a. b, c: then T = -. 1 be a a b Now = r x - cue a a a 2 = b X 6 = F ,; that is, a : c = a 2 : b 2 . It will be seen that this proposition is the same as the definition of duplicate ratio given in Euclid, Book v. 22.

If a : b = c : d, and b : x = d : v/, then a : x = c : y- This is the theorem known as ex cequali in Geometry. 23. If four quantities a, b, c, d form a proportion, many other proportions may be deduced by the properties of fractions. The results of these operations are very useful, and some of them are often quoted by the annexed names borrowed from Geometry. PROPORTION. 15 (1) If a : b = c : d, then b : a = d : c.

The results of the preceding article are the algebraical equivalents of some of the propositions in the fifth book of Euclid, and the student is advised to make himself familiar with them in their verbal form. For example, dividendo may be quoted as follows : When there are four proportionals, the excess of the first above the second is to the second, as the excess of the third above the fourth is to the fourth. 25. We shall now compare the algebraical definition of pro- portion with that given in Euclid. Euclid's definition is as follows : Four quantities are said to be proportionals when if any equi- multiples whatever be taken of the first and third, and also any equimultiples wJiatever of the second and fourth, the multiple of the third is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the fourth, according as the multiple of the first is greater than, equal to, or less than the multiple of the second. In algebraical symbols the definition may be thus stated : Four quantities a, b, c, d are in proportion when p>c = qd according as p>a = qb, p and q being any positive integers tcJudever. I. To deduce the geometrical definition of proportion from the algebraical definition. a c u Since -z - - , by multiplying both sides by - , we obtain pa 2 )C qb qd ' hence, from the properties of fractions, pc = qd according as pa = qb, which proves the proposition. II. To deduce the algebraical definition of proportion from the geometrical definition. Given that pc = qd according as pa = qb, to prove a c b = ~d' PROPORTION. 17 If -j- is not equal to - , one of them must be the greater. Suppose g > -^ ; then it will be possible to find some fraction 2 which lies between them, q and <p being positive integers. Hence - > - b p P 0). (2> and - < ? From (1) pa>qb; from (2) 2)c<qd\\ and these contradict the hypothesis. Therefore y and - are not unequal; that is - = -• which proves the proposition. 26. It should be noticed that the geometrical definition of pro- portion deals with concrete magnitudes, such as lines or areas, represented geometrically but not referred to any common unit of measurement. So that Euclid's definition is applicable to in- commensurable as well as to commensurable quantities ; whereas the algebraical definition, strictly speaking, applies only to com- mensurable quantities, since it tacitly assumes that a is the same determinate multiple, part, or parts, of b that c is of d. But the proofs which have been given for commensurable quantities will still be true for incommensurables, since the ratio of two incom- mensurables can always be made to differ from the ratio of two integers by less than any assignable quantity. This lias been shewn in Art. 7 ; it may also be proved more generally as in the next article. 27. Suppose that a and b are incommensurable; divide b into m equal parts each equal to /?, so that b = m/3, where m is a positive integer. Also suppose f3 is contained in a more than n times and less than n+ 1 times; i, a nB . (n+1) B then - > -^ and < * /^ , o mp imp that is, -= lies between — and ; o m m so that -j- differs from — by a quantity less than — . And since we H. H. A. 2 18 HIGHER ALGEBRA. can choose B (our unit of measurement) as small as we please, m can 1 be made as great as we please. Hence — can be made as small as we please, and two integers n and m can be found whose ratio will express that of a and b to any required degree of accuracy. 28. The propositions proved in Art. 23 are often useful in solving problems. In particular, the solution of certain equa- tions is greatly facilitated by a skilful use of the operations com- ponendo and dividendo. Example 1.

A crew can row a certain course up stream in 84 minutes; they can row the same course down stream in 9 minutes less than they could row it in still water : how long would they take to row down with the stream ? CHAPTER III. VARIATION. 29. Definition. One quantity A is said to vary directly as another B, when the two quantities depend upon each other in such a manner that if B is changed, A is changed in the same ratio. Note. The word directly is often omitted, and A is said to vary as B. For instance : if a train moving at a uniform rate travels 40 miles in 60 minutes, it will travel 20 miles in 30 minutes, 80 miles in 120 minutes, and so on; the distance in each case being increased or diminished in the same ratio as the time. This is expressed by saying that when the velocity is uniform the distance is ptroportional to the time, or the distance varies as the time. 30. The symbol oc is used to denote variation \\ so that A on B is read \"A varies as B.\" 31. If A. varies as B, tlien A is equal to B multiplied by some constant quantity. For suppose that a, a lt a„, a 3 ..., b, b x , b 2 , b 3 ... are corresponding values of A and B. mi i i /» •,• a b a b a b , Inen, by deimition, — = =- : — = — ; — = -r ; and so on, «, V ^ K »3 K /. s-i = =* = y^= ,.j- each being equal to T . 6, 6 2 6 3 b TT any value of A . Hence -= r . _ =— = is always the same : the corresponding value ot B that is, — — 7u, where m is constant. .'. A=mB. 22 HIGHER ALGEBRA. If any pair of corresponding values of A and B are known, the constant m can be determined. For instance, if A = 3 when ^=12, we have 3 =m x 12; and A = \\B. 32. Definition. One quantity A is said to vary inversely as another Z?, when A varies directly as the reciprocal of B. Thus if A varies inversely as B, A = -^ , where m is constant. The following is an illustration of inverse variation : If 6 men do a certain work in 8 hours, 12 men would do the same work in 4 hours, 2 men in 24 hours ; and so on. Thus it appears that when the number of men is increased, the time is proportionately decreased; and vice-versa. Example 1. The cube root of x varies inversely as the square of y ; if x=8 when y = 3, find x when y = l^. By supposition £/x= — , where m is constant. if Tit Putting x = 8, y = 3, we have 2 =n> .*. ?;t = 18, v 18 and *jx = — , ; r hence, by putting y = ^, we obtain a; = 512. Example 2. The square of the time of a planet's revolution varies as the cube of its distance from the Sun; find the time of Venus' revolution, assuming the distances of the Earth and Venus from the Sun to be 91-J and 66 millions of miles respectively. Let P be the periodic time measured in days, D the distance in millions of miles ; we have P 2 a D 3 , or P*=kD 3 , where k is some constant. For the Earth, 365 x 365 = k x 91± x 91| x 91£, 4x4x4 whence k = 365 . p2 _ 4 x 4 x 4 \" r ~ 365 \" ' VARIATION. 23 For Venus, pa^i^ili x 66 x 66 x 6G ; 3 b.) whence P = 4x66 :: /264 V 365 = 264 x a/*7233, approximately, = 264 x -85 = 224-4. Hence the time of revolution is nearly 224£ days. 33. Definition. One quantity is said to vary jointly as a number of others, when it varies directly as their product. Thus A varies jointly as B and C, when A = mBC. For in- stance, the interest on a sum of money varies jointly as the principal, the time, and the rate per cent. 3 -i. Definition. A is said to vary directly as B and in- versely as C, when A varies as -^ . 35. 7/*A varies as B when C is constant, and A varies as C when B is constant, then tvill A vary as BC ivhen both B and C vary. The variation of A depends partly on that of B and partly on that of C. Suppose these latter variations to take place sepa- rately, each in its turn producing its own effect on A ; also let a, b, c be certain simultaneous values of A, B, C. 1 . Let C be constant while B changes to b ; then A must undergo a partial change and will assume some intermediate value a\\ where \"=- (1) 2. Let B be constant, that is, let it retain its value b, while C changes to c ; then A must complete its change and pass from its intermediate value a' to its final value a, where From (1) and (2) — x - = — x - : x ' a a b c that is, A = =- . BC, be or A varies as BC. 24 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 36. The following are illustrations of the theorem proved in the last article. The amount of work done by a given number of men varies directly as the number of days they work, and the amount of work done in a given time varies directly as the number of men ; therefore when the number of days and the number of men are both variable, the amount of work will vary as the product of the number of men and the number of days. Again, in Geometry the area of a triangle varies directly as its base when the height is constant, and directly as the height when the base is constant ; and when both the height and base are variable, the area varies as the product of the numbers representing the height and the base. Example. The volume of a right circular cone varies as the square of the radius of the base when the height is constant, and as the height when the base is constant. If the radius of the base is 7 feet and the height 15 feet, the volume is 770 cubic feet ; find the height of a cone whose volume is 132 cubic feet and which stands on a base whose radius is 3 feet. Let h and r denote respectively the height ani radius of the base measured in feet ; also let V be the volume in cubic feet. Then V=mr 2 h, where m is constant. By supposition, 770 — m x 7 2 x 15 ; 22 whence m = — ; .*. by substituting V= 132, r = S, we get 22 132=- xOxft; — X whence 7i= 14 ; and therefore the height is 14 feet. 37. The proposition of Art. 35 can easily be extended to the case in which the variation of A depends upon that of more than two variables. Further, the variations may be either direct or inverse. The principle is interesting because of its frequent oc- currence in Physical Science. For example, in the theory of gases it is found by experiment that the pressure (p) of a gas varies as the \"absolute temperature\" (t) when its volume (v) is constant, and that the pressure varies inversely as the volume when the temperature is constant ; that is 2? oc t, when v is constant ; VARIATION. 25 and p cc - , when t is constant. v From these results we should expect that, when both t and v are variable, we should have the formula p cc - , or pv = kt, where k is constant ; and by actual experiment this is found to be the- case. Example. The duration of a railway journey varies directly as the distance and inversely as the velocity; the velocity varies directly as the square root of the quantity of coal used per mile, and inversely as the number of carriages in the train. In a journey of 25 miles in half an hour with 18 carriages 10 cwt. of coal is required; how much coal will be consumed in a journey of 21 miles in 28 minutes with 16 carriages? Let t be the time expressed in hours, d the distance in miles, v the velocity in miles per hour, q the quantity of coal in cwt., c the number of carriages. We have t oc - , v and v oc *!l , c whence t oc — , or t — — 7- , where k is constant. Substituting the values given, we have 1 _ k x 18 x 25 2 ~ jm ; that is, k = 25x36\" v/lO . cd Hence t = ^ — ^— T . 2o x 36 Jq Substituting now the values of t, c, d given in the second part of the question, we have 28 710x16x21 . 60\" 25x36^2 ' a •• / n/10x 16x21 ^ ,- that is, s/q=— 15x28 =5^10, whence q — -=- = 6|.

CHAPTER IV. ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION. 38. Definition. Quantities are said to be in Arithmetical Progression when they increase or decrease by a common dif- ference. Thus each of the following series forms an Arithmetical Progression : 3, 7, 11, 15, 8, 2, -4, -10, a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, The common difference is found by subtracting any term of the series from that which follows it. In the first of the above examples the common difference is 4 ; in the second it is — 6 ; in the third it is d. 39. If we examine the series a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . we notice that in any term the coefficient of d is always less by one than the number of the term hi the seiies. Thus the 3 rd term is a + 2d; 6 th term is a + 5d ; 20 th term is a + I9d', and, generally, the p th term is a + ( p — \\)d. If n be the number of terms, and if I denote the last, or ?i th term, we have I = a + (n — 1) d. 40. To find the sum of a number of terms in Arithmetical Progression. Let a denote the first term, d the common difference, and n the number of terms. Also let I denote the last term, and s ARITHMETICAL PROGRESSION. 29 the required sum ; then 8 = a+(a + d) + (a + 2d) + ... + (I - 2d) + (l-d) + l; and, by writing the series in the reverse order, s = I + (I - d) + (I - 2d) + ... + (a + 2d)+ (a + d) + a. Adding together these two series, 2s = (a + l) + (a + l) + (a + l)+ ... to n terms = n (a + I), •'• s = ^(a + l) (1); a and l~a + (n-l)d (2), .-. s = -^{2a + (n-l)d\\ (3). 41. In tlie last article we have three useful formula; (1), (2), (3) ; in each of these any one of the letters may denote the unknown quantity when the three others are known. For instance, in (1) if we substitute given values for s, n, I, we obtain an equation for finding a ; and similarly in the other formulae. But it is necessary to guard against a too mechanical use of these general formulae, and it will often be found better to solve simple questions by a mental rather than by an actual reference to the requisite formula. Example 1. Find the sura of the series 5^, GJ, 8, to 17 terms. Here the common difference is 1^; hence from (3), the sum = \\ 2 x — + 16 = y (11+20) 17x31 ~2 = 263£. Example 2. The first term of a series is 5, the last 45, and the sum 400 : find the number of terms, and the common difference. If n be the number of terms, then from (1) 400 = \" (5 + 4r>); whence n = 10. *li| 30 HIGHER ALGEBRA. If d be the common difference 45= the 16 th term = 5 + 15d; whence d = 2f . 42. If any two terms of an Arithmetical Progression be given, the series can be completely determined; for the data furnish two simultaneous equations, the solution of which will give the first term and the common difference. Example. The 54 th and 4 th terms of an A. P. are - 61 and 64 ; find the 23 rd term. If a be the first term, and d the common difference, - 61 = the 54 th term = a + 53d ; and 64 = the 4 th term = a + 3d ; 5 whence we obtain d= -jr, a = Hh. ; and the 23 rd term = a + 22d = 16£. 43. Definition. When three quantities are in Arithmetical Progression the middle one is said to be the arithmetic mean of the other two. Thus a is the arithmetic mean between a — d and a + d. 44. To find the arithmetic mean betiveen two given quantities. Let a and b be the two quantities ; A the arithmetic mean. Then since a, A, b are in A. P. we must have b - A = A — a, each being equal to the common difference ; a + b whence A — 2 45. Between two given quantities it is always possible to insert any number of terms such that the whole series thus formed shall be in A. P. ; and by an extension of the definition in Art. 43, the terms thus inserted are called the arithmetic means. Example. Insert 20 arithmetic means between 4 and 67. Including the extremes, the number of terms will be 22 ; so that we have to find a series of 22 terms in A.P., of which 4 is the first and 67 the last. Let d be the common difference ; then 67 = the 22 nd term = 4 + 21d ; whence d = S, and the series is 4, 7, 10, 61, 64, 67 ; and the required means are 7, 10, 13, 58, 71, 64.

The sum of three numbers in A.P. is 27, and the sum of their squares is 293 ; find them. Let a be the middle number, d the common difference ; then the three numbers are a - d, a, a + d. Hence a-d + a + a + d = 27 ; whence a = 9, and the three numbers are 9 - d, 9, $ + d. .-. (9-rf) 2 + 81 + (9 + d) 2 = 293; whence d=±5; and the numbers are 4, 9, 14. Example 2.

In an Arithmetical Progression when s, a, d are given, to determine the values of n we have the quadratic equation s = ^ <2a + (n- l)d\\ ; when both roots are positive and integral there is no difficulty in interpreting the result corresponding to each. In some cases a suitable interpretation can be given for a negative value of n. Example. How many terms of the series -9, -6, -3,... must be taken that the sum may be G6 ? Here ? {-18 + (»-l) 3}=66; that is, n--ln-U = Q, or (n-ll)(n+4)=0; .'. ?i=ll or - 4. If we take 11 terms of the series, we have - 9, - 6, - 3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 ; the sum of which is 66. If we begin at the last of these terms and count backwards four terms, the sum is also 66; and thus, although the negative solution does not directly answer the question proposed, we are enabled to give it an intelligible meaning, and we see that it answers a question closely connected with that to which the positive solution applies. 48. We can justify this interpretation in the general case in the following way. The equation to determine n is dn 2 + (2a-d)n-2s = (1). Since in the case under discussion the roots of this equation have opposite signs, let us denote them by n and - n . The last term of the series corresponding to n l is a + (n l - 1 ) d ; if we beirin at this term and count backwards, the common difference must be denoted by - d, and the sum of yi., terms is |{2 (« + »,-!</) + (», -!)(-</)} and we shall shew that this is equal to 6-.

When the value of n is fractional there is no exact num- ber of terms which corresponds to such a solution. Example. How many terms of the series 26, 21, 16, ...must be taken to amount to 71 ? n Here ~ {52 + (n-l)(-5)} = 74; that is, 5)i 2 - 57u + 148 = 0, or (n-4)(5n-37) = 0; .*. ?i = 4 or 1%. Thus the number of terms is 4. It will be found that the sum of 7 terms is greater, while the sum of 8 terms is less than 74. 50. We add some Miscellaneous Examples. Example 1. The sums of n terms of two arithmetic series are in the ratio of 7?t + l : 4« + 27; rind the ratio of their 11 th terms.

Quantities are said to be in Geometrical Progression when they increase or decrease by a constant factor. Thus each of the following series forms a Geometrical Pro- gression : 3, G, 12, 24, 1 - 1 I -I 3' 9' 27' a, ar, ar 2 , ar 3 , The constant factor is also called the common ratio, and it is found by dividing any term by that which immediately iwecedes it. In the first of the above examples the common ratio is 2 ; in the second it is — - ; in the third it is r. o 52. If we examine the series a, ar, ar 2 , ar 3 , ai A , we notice that in any term the index of r is always less by one tlian the number of the term in the series. Thus the 3 rd term is ar 2 ; the 6 th term is ar s ; the 20 th term is ar 19 ; and, generally, the p ih term is a?^ -1 . If n be the number of terms, and if I denote the last, or n ,h term, we have l = ar\"~\\ 53. Definition. When three quantities are in Geometrical Progression the middle one is called the geometric mean between the other two. 38 HIGHER ALGEBRA. To find the geometric mean between two given quantities. Let a and b be the two quantities ; G the geometric mean. Then since a, G, b are in G. P., b _G G~ a' each being equal to the common ratio ; .-. G 2 = ab; whence G = Jab. 54. To insert a given number of geometric means between two given quantities. Let a and b be the given quantities, n the number of means. In all there will be n + 2 terms ; so that we have to find a series of n + 2 terms in G. P., of which a is the first and b the last. Let r be the common ratio ; then b = the (n + 2) th term «r\" +1 ; \" ~a' i ••\"©\" <» Hence the required means are of, a?- 2 ,... ar n , where r has the value found in (1). Example. Insert 4 geometric means between 100 and 5. We have to find 6 terms in G. P. of which 160 is the first, and 5 the sixth. Let r be tbe common ratio ; tben 5 = the sixth term = 160?' 5 ; . 1 * ' ~32' whence r= o' and the means are 80, 40, 20, 10. GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION. o!) 55. To find the sum of a number of terms in Geometrical Progression. Let a be the first term, r the common ratio, n the number of terms, and s the sum required. Then 8 = a + car + ar 2 + + ar n ~ 2 + ar\"~ l ; multiplying every term by r, we have rs = ar + ar 2 + + ar\"~ 2 + ar\"\" 1 + ar*, Hence by subtraction, rs — s = ar n — a ; .-.

It will be found convenient to remember both forms given above for s. using (2) in all cases except when? 1 isj^ositive and greater than 1. Since ar'^ 1 ^ 1, the formula (1) may be written rl-a S= 7--T : a form which is sometimes useful. 2 3 Example. Sum the series - , -1, -, to 7 terms. 3 The common ratio = - - ; hence by formula (2) the sum = — (-23 II 2187] 128 I 2 2315 2 ~ 3 X 128 * 5 403 40 HIGHER ALGEBRA. n 111 56. Consider the series 1, r, ^- 2 , ~ 3 , The sum to n terms = 2 >- -H 1 .2- 2 27 2 «-i • From this result it appears that however many terms be taken the sum of the above series is always less than 2. Also we see that, by making n sufficiently large, we can make the fraction njr-^i as sma U a s we please. Thus by taking a sufficient number of terms the sum can be made to differ by as little as we please from 2. In the next article a more general case is discussed. 57. From Art. 55 we have s = \\ 1 -r a ar\" 1 — t 1 — r ' Suppose r is a proper fraction; then the greater the value of ar' 1 n the smaller is the value of ?•\", and consequently of ; and therefore by making n sufficiently large, we can make the sum of n terms of the series differ from ^ by as small a quantity as we please. This result is usually stated thus : the sum of an infinite number of terms of a decreasing Geometrical Progression is ^ : 1 — r or more briefly, the sum to infinity is a 1-r' Example 1. Find three numbers in G. P. whose sum is 19, and whose product is 216.

The general rule for reducing any recurring decimal to a vulgar fraction may be proved by the method employed in the last example ; but it is easier to proceed as follows. Tojind the value of a recurring decimal. Let P denote the figures which do not recur, and suppose them j> in number; let Q denote the recurring period consisting of q figures ; let D denote the value of the recurring decimal ; then ; > D = 'PQQQ .-. 10>xD = P'QQQ and 10T+' *D = PQ-QQQ therefore, by subtraction, (10 p+y - lC) D = PQ-P; that is, 10\" (10' - 1) D = PQ - P ; . D _ PQ-P ' ' (10''- 1)10''' Now 10\"- 1 is a number consisting of q nines; therefore the denominator consists of q nines followed by p ciphers. Hence we have the following rule for reducing a recurring decimal to a vulgar fraction : For the numerator subtract the integral number consisting of the nonrecurring fgures from the integral number consisting of the non-recurring and recurring figures ; for the denominator take a number consisting of as many nines as there are recurring jig n n 8 followed by as many ciphers as there are non-recurring figures. 44 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 60.

HARMON ICAL PROGRESSION. THEOREMS CONNECTED WITH THE PROGRESSIONS. 61. DEFINITION. Three quantities a, b, c are said to be in Harmonical Progression when - = 7 — . c o — c Any number of quantities are said to be in Harmonical Progression when every three consecutive terms are in Har- monical Progression. 62. The reciprocals of quantities in Harmonical Progression are in A rithmetical Progression. By definition, if «, b, c are in Harmonical Progression, a a — b ~c^~b^~c' } .'. a(b — c) = c (a — b), dividing every term by abc, 1111 c b b a' which proves the proposition. 63. Harmonical properties are chiefly interesting because of their importance in Geometry and in the Theory of Sound : in Algebra the proposition just proved is the only one of any importance. There is no general formula for the sum of any number of quantities in Harmonical Progression. Questions in H. P. are generally solved by inverting the terms, and making use of the properties of the corresponding A. P. 48 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 64. To find the harmonic 7tiean between two given quantities.

PROGRESSION. 49 which is positive if a and b are positive; therefore the arithmetic mean of any two positive quantities is greater than their geometric mean. Also from the equation G*--A1I, we see that G is inter- mediate in value between A and 11; and it lias been proved that A > G, therefore G > II ; that is, the arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic means between any tioo positive quantities are in descending order of magnitude. 66. Miscellaneous questions in the Progressions afford scope for skill and ingenuity, the solution being often neatly effected by some special artifice. The student will find the following hints useful. 1. If the same quantity be added to, or subtracted from, all the terms of an A P., the resulting terms will form an A. P. with the same common difference as before. [Art. 38.] 2. If all the terms of an A.P. be multiplied or divided by the same quantity, the resulting terms will form an A. P., but with a new common difference. [Art. 38.] 3. If all the terms of a G.P. be multiplied or divided by the same quantity, the resulting terms will form a G.P. with the same common ratio as before. [Art. 51.] 4. If a, b, c, d... are in G.P., they are also in continued pro- portion^ since, by definition, a b c 1 bed r ' Conversely, a series of quantities in continued proportion may be represented by x, aw, xr' 2 , Example 1. If a 2 , b 2 , c 2 are in A. P., shew that b + c, c + a, a + b are in H. P. By adding ab + ac + bc to each term, we see that a* + ab + ac + bc, b 2 + ba + bc + ac, c' 2 + ca + cb + ab are in A.P. ; that is {a + b) (a + c), {b + c)(b + a), (c + a) (c + b) are in A.

SCALES OF NOTATION. 76. The ordinary numbers with which we are acquainted in Arithmetic are expressed by means of multiples of powers of 10; for instance 25-2 x 10 + 5; 4705 = 4 x 10 3 + 7 x 10 2 + x 10 + 5. This method of representing numbers is called the common or denary scale of notation, and ten is said to be the radix of the scale. The symbols employed in this system of notation are the nine digits and zero. In like manner any number other than ten may be taken as the radix of a scale of notation ; thus if 7 is the radix, a number expressed by 2453 represents 2x7 3 + 4x7\" + 5x7 + 3; and in this scale no. digit higher than 6 can occur. Again in a scale whose radix is denoted by r the above number 2453 stands for 2r 3 + 4? ,2 + hr + 3. More generally, if in the scale whose radix is r we denote the digits, beginning with that in the units' place, by a tt , a,, a 2 ,...aj then the number so formed will be represented by a r n + a ,r n ~ 1 + a y~~ + . . . + a/ 2 + a,r + a, where the coefficients a , a ,,...«,. are integers, all less than r, of which any one or more after the first may be zero. Hence in this scale the digits are r in number, their values ranging from to r — 1 . 77. The names Binary, Ternary, Quaternary, Quinary, Senary, Septenary, Octenary, Nonary, Denary, Undenarv, and Duodenary are used to denote the scales corresponding to the values fae», three,... twelve of the radix. 58 HIGHER ALGEBRA. In the undenary, duodenary, . . . scales we shall require symbols to represent the digits which are greater than nine. It is unusual to consider any scale higher than that with radix twelve ; when necessary we shall employ the symbols t, e, T as digits to denote ' ten ', ' eleven ' and ' twelve '. It is especially worthy of notice that in every scale 10 is the symbol not for ' ten ', but for the radix itself. 78. The ordinary operations of Arithmetic may be performed in any scale ; but, bearing in mind that the successive powers of the radix are no longer powers of ten, in determining the carrying figures we must not divide by ten, but by the radix of the scale in question. Example 1. In the scale of eight subtract 371532 from 530225, and multiply the difference by 27. 530225 136473 371532 27 136473 1226235 275166 4200115 Explanation. After the first figure of the subtraction, since we cannot take 3 from 2 we add 8 ; thus we have to take 3 from ten, which leaves 7 ; then 6 from ten, which leaves 4 ; then 2 from eight which leaves 6 ; and so on. Again, in multiplying by 7, we have 3x7 = twenty one = 2x8 + 5; we therefore put down 5 and carry 2. Next 7x7 + 2 = fifty one = 6x8 + 3; put down 3 and carry 6 ; and so on, until the multiplication is completed. In the addition, 3 + 6 = nine = lx8 + l; we therefore put down 1 and carry 1. Similarly 2 + 6 + l = nine=l x 8 + 1; and 6 + l + l = eight = lx8 + 0; and so on. Example 2. Divide 15et20 by 9 in the scale of twelve. 9)15<?£20 lee96...G. Explanation. Since 15 = 1 x T + 5 = seventeen = 1 x9 + 8, we put down 1 and carry 8. Also 8 x T + e = one hundred and seven = e x 9 + 8 ; we therefore put down e and carry 8; and so on.

Let iV be the given number, and r the radix of the proposed scale. Let a u , a n a 2 ,...a t be the required digits by which iV is to be expressed, beginning with that in the units' place; then N= a r\" + a ,r\" _1 + ... + ar~ + a.r + a lt . n n — 1 2 10 We have now to find the values of « , a,, \"_...\",, 60 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

If this quotient is divided by r, the remainder is a i ; if the next quotient a 2 ; and so on, until there is no further quotient. Thus all the required digits a , a x , a g1 ...a n are determined by successive divisions by the radix of the proposed scale. Example 1.

The calculation is most readily effected by writing this expression in the form [{(7 x 12 + 2) } x 12 + 1] x 12 + 5 ; thus we multiply 7 by 12, and add 2 to the product; then we multiply 86 by 12 and add 1 to the product; then 1033 by 12 and add 5 to the product. SCALES OF NOTATION. f>l 80. Hitherto we have only discussed whole numbers; but fractions may also be expressed in any scale of notation ; thus 2 5 •25 in scale ten denotes — + — , ; 10 10*' 2 5 •25 in scale six denotes -= + ^ ; G 2 5 •25 in scale r denotes — h — . r r Fractions thus expressed in a form analogous to that of ordinary decimal fractions are called radix-fractions, and the point is called the radix-point. The general type of such fractions in scale r is ~ 3 ~ 3 ~ > r r r where 6 , b 2 , 6 a , ... are integers, all less than r, of which any one or more may be zero. 81. To express a given radix fraction in any proposed scale. Let F be the given fraction, and r the radix of the proposed scale. Let b , b , b 3 ,... be the required digits beginning from the left ; then F J-X + b A+ b ^ 3+ r r r We have now to find the values of 6 p b 2 , 6 3 , Multiply both sides of the equation by r ; then rF=b+- 2 + h -l+ ; Hence b l is equal to the integral part of rF ; and, if we denote the fractional part by F x , we have H-i. + J + Multiply again by r\\ then, as before, b is the integral part of rF x ; and similarly by successive multiplications by r, each of the digits may be found, and the fraction expressed in the pro posed scale. 62 HIGHER ALGEBRA. If in the successive multiplications by r any one of the products is an integer the process terminates at this stage, and the given fraction can be expressed by a finite number of digits. But & if none of the products is an integer the process will never terminate, and in this case the digits recur, forming a radix- fraction analogous to a recurring decimal. 13 Example 1. Express -^ as a radix fraction in scale six. 13 ft 13x3 7. 16 x6= -8- = 4 + 8' 7 a 7x3 Kj. 1 1 a lx3 I.. 1 ^x6 = 3. 4 5 13 .-. the required fraction = g + ^ + p + Qi = •4513. Example 2. Transform 16064-24 from scale eight to scale five.

In any scale of notation of which the radix is r, the sum of the digits of any whole number divided by r - 1 will leave the same remainder as the whole number divided by r — 1. Let N denote the number, a , a lt a 2 , a n the digits begin- ning with that in the units' place, and S the sum of the digits; then N = a Q + a x r + a 2 r 2 + + a„_/ , ~ 1 + ar n ; S=a + a x +a 2 + + a n _ l + a n r .tf-S=a 1 (r-l) + a 2 (r°--l)+ + •„_, (i*- - 1) + «, (f - 1). SCALES OF NOTATION. 03 Now every term on the right hand side is divisible by r — 1 • iV-S . * . =- — an integer ; r- 1 6 y that is, -=/ + r - 1 r - 1 ' when; / is some integer j which proves tlie proposition. Hence a number in scale r will be divisible by ?• — 1 when the sum of its digits is divisible by r — 1. 83. By taking ?-=10 we learn from the above proposition that a number divided by 9 will leave the same remainder as the sum of its digits divided by 9. The rule known as \" casting out the nines \" for testing the accuracy of multiplication is founded on this property. The rule may be thus explained : Let two numbers be represented by da + b and 9c -f d, and their product by P; then P^Slac + %c + 9ad + bd. Hence — has the same remainder as -^ ; and therefore the s?nn of the digits of /*, when divided by 9, gives the same remainder as the sum of the digits of bd, when divided by 9. If on trial this should not be the case, the multiplication must have been incorrectly performed. In practice b and d are readily found from the sums of the digits of the two numbers to be multiplied together. Example. Can the product of 31256 and 8127 be 263395312 ? The sums of the digits of the multiplicand, multiplier, and product are 17, 21, and 31 respectively; again, the sums of the digits of these three numbers are 8, 3, and 7, whence M = 8x3 = 24, which has 6 for the sum of the digits; thus we have two different remainders, 6 and 7, and the multiplication is incorrect. 84. If N denote any number in the scale of 'r, and D denote the difference, supposed positive, between the sums of the digit* in the odd and the even places; then N — D or N + D is a multiple, of r+ 1. 64 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Let a , «!, a , a n denote the digits beginning with that in the units' place; then JV= a + a,r + a r 2 + ar* + + a ,r\" -1 + a r\". .-. A r -a + a A -a 2 + a 3 - ...=<*, (r+1) + « 2 (r 2 - 1) + a 3 (r 3 + 1) + ...; and the last term on the right will be a w (r\"+l) or a n (r n — 1) according as n is odd or even. Thus every term on the right is divisible by r + I ; hence ^ ! % i '- = an mteo-er. r + 1 ° NOW a 0~ a } +fl 2~ CC 3 + —^D) .'. =— is an integer; which proves the proposition. Cor. If the sum of the digits in the even places is equal to the sum of the digits in the odd places, D = 0, and N is divisible by r + 1. Example 1. Prove that 4 •41 is a square number in any scale of notation whose radix is greater than 4. Let r be the radix ; then 4-41 = 4 + - + i=(2 + -Y; r r z \\ rj thus the given number is the square of 2*1. Example 2. In what scale is the denary number 2-4375 represented by 213? Let r be the scale ; then 13 7 2 + - + 2=2-4375=2-^; r r- 16 whence \" 7r 2 - 16r-48 = ; that is, (7r+12)(/--4) = 0. Hence the radix is 4. Sometimes it is best to use the following method. Example 3. In what scale will the nonary number 25607 be expressed by 101215 ? The required scale must be less than 9, since the new number appears the greater ; also it must be greater than 5 ; therefore the required scale must be 6, 7, or 8; and by trial we find that it is 7.

CHAPTER VIII. SURDS AND IMAGINARY QUANT1T1KS. 85. In the Elementary Algebra, Art. 272, it is proved that the denominator of any expression of the form -rr r- can be Jb + Jc rationalised by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by Jb — Jc, the surd conjugate to the denominator. Similarly, in the case of a fraction of the form Jb + Jc + Jd ' where the denominator involves three quadratic surds, we may by two operations render that denominator rational. For, first multiply both numerator and denominator by Jb + Jc — Jd; the denominator becomes (Jb + Jc) 2 — (Jd) 2 or b + c - d + 2 J be. Then multiply both numerator and denominator by (b + c - d) — 2 J be; the denominator becomes (b + c - d) 2 — Abe, which is a rational quantity. Example.

To find the factor which will rationalise any given bino- mial surd. Case I. Suppose the given surd is £]a - $b. Let ZJa = x, ?Jb = y, and let n be the l.c.m. of p and q ; then x n and y n are both rational. Now x n — y n is divisible by x - y for all values of n, and ar- _ y\" = (x-y) {x n ~' +x n ~ 2 y + x n Sf + + y\"\" 1 ). Thus the rationalising factor is .X'\"\" 1 + x n ~ 2 y + x n ~y + + y\"~ l ; and the rational product is x n — y'\\ Case II. Suppose the given surd is p Ja + fjb. Let x, y, n have the same meanings as before; then (1) If n is even, x n — y\" is divisible by x + y, and x n - y n = (x + y) (x n ~ l - x n ~ 2 y + + xf~* - y\"\" 1 ). Thus the rationalising factor is ur l -ary + + ay\"-'- 3 r 1 ; and the rational product is x\" — y n . (2) If n is odd, x\" + y\" is divisible by x + y, and x n + y n = (x + y) (x n ~ x - x n Sj + - xy n ~ 2 + y n ~'). Thus the rationalising factor is x n ~ 1 -x n ~ 2 y+ -xy n - 2 + y\"- 1 ; and the rational product is x\" + y n . Example 1. Find the factor which will rationalise ^/S + ^/5. i i Let x = 3 2 , y = 5 5 ; then x b and y 6 are both rational, and x e - y 6 — (x + y) (x 5 - x*y + xhj 2 - xhj 3 + xy i - y 5 ) ; thus, substituting for x and y, the required factor is 541 3223 14 5 32 - 32 . 53+ 32 . 53 - 32 . 53+ 32 . 53 - 53, 5 13 2 14 5 or 32-9. 5 5 + 32~. 53-15 + 32. 53-5 5 ; 6 6 and the rational product is 32 - 5 s \" = 3 3 - 5 2 = 2.

We have shewn in the Elementary Algebra, Art. 277, how to find the square root of a binomial quadratic surd. We may sometimes extract the square root of an expression contain- ing more than two quadratic surds, such as a + Jb + Jc 4- Jd. Assume Ja + Jb + Jc + Jd = Jx + Jy + Jz j .'. a + Jb + Jc + Jd = x + y + z + 2 Jxy + 2 Jxz + 2 Jyz. If then 2 Jxy = Jb, 2 Jxz = Jc, 2 Jyz = Jd, and if, at the same time, the values of x, y, z thus found satisfy x + y + z = a, we shall have obtained the required root. Example. Find the square root of 21 - 4^/5 + 8^/3 - 4^/15. Assume V 21 - V 5 + V 3 - V 15 = sl x + Jy - sl z \\ .'. 21 - 4^5 + 8^/3 - 4J15 = x + y + z + 2 Jxy- 2 Jxz - 2 Jyz. Put 2jxy = 8JS, 2jxl = 4J15, 2jyz = ±Jo\\ by multiplication, xyz = 240 ; that is Jxyz=4 s /lo ; whence it follows that ,Jx = 2j3, Jy = 2, „Jz = s /5. And since these values satisfy the equation x + y + z = 21, the required root is 2^3 + 2-^/5. 70 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 88. If J a, + Jh = x + Jy, then ivill J a, — Jh = x — Jy, For, by cubing, we obtain ci + Jb=x 3 + 3x 2 ^/y + 3xy + y Jy. Equating rational and irrational parts, we have a = x 3 + 3xy, Jb = 3x 2 Jy + y Jy \\ .'. a- Jb = x 3 - 3x 2 Jy + 3xy -y Jy; that is, J a - Jb = x— Jy. Similarly, by the help of the Binomial Theorem, Chap. XIII. , it may be proved that if Ja + Jb = x + Jy, then J a - Jb = x- Jy, where n is any positive integer. 89. By the following method the cube root of an expression of the form a ± Jb may sometimes be found. Suppose Ja + Jb = x + Jy ; then Ja- Jb = x- Jy. .-. Jtf^b=x 2 -y (1). Again, as in the last article, a = x 3 + 3xy (2). The values of x and y have to be determined from (1) and (2). In (1) suppose that J a 2 — b=c; then by substituting for y in (2) we obtain a = x 3 + 3x (x 2 — c) ; that is, kx 3 — 3cx — a. If from this equation the value of x can be determined by trial, the value of y is obtained from y = x 2 — c. Note. We do not here assume sjx + s ly for the cube root, as in the extraction of the square root; for with this assumption, on cubing we should have a + Jb = xjx + Sxjy + Syjx + yjy y and since every term on the right hand side is irrational we cannot equate rational and irrational parts. SUKDS AND IMAGINARY QUANTITIES. 71 Example. Find the cube root of 72 - 32 x /5. Assume sf 72 -'62^5 = x - ^/y ; then ^72 + 32 s /5 = x + s /y. By multiplication , ^5184 - 1024 x 5 = a; 2 - y ; that is, ± = x'--y (1). Again 72 - 32^/5 = .c 3 - fkcPJy + Sxy - y^'y ; whence 72 = x 3 + 3.t// (2). From (1) and (2) , 72 = x :i + Sx (x- - 4) ; that is, ar } -3x = 18. By trial, we find that x = S; hence y = o, and the cube root is 3-^/5. 90. When the binomial whose cube root we are seekhi\" consists of two quadratic surds, we proceed as follows. Example. Find the cube root of 9 N /3 + ll v /2. By proceeding as in the last article, we find that .-. the required cube root =*J3 ( 1 + * /- J = v /3+v/2. 91. We add a few harder examples in surds. 4 'Example 1.

Although from the rule of signs it is evident that a negative quantity cannot have a real square rootlet imaginary quantities represented by symbols of the form J- a, J- 1 are of frequent occurrence in mathematical investigations, and their use leads to valuable results. We therefore proceed to explain in what sense such roots are to be regarded. When the quantity under the radical sign is negative, we can no longer consider the symbol J as indicating a possible arithmetical operation ; but just as J a may be defined as a symbol which obeys the relation J a x Ja = a, so we shall define J— a to be such that J— a x J— a = - a, and we shall accept the meaning to which this assumption leads us. It will be found that this definition will enable us to bring imaginary quantities under the dominion of ordinary algebraical rules, and that through their use results may be obtained which can be relied on with as much certainty as others which depend solely on the use of real quantities. 93. By definition, J- I x J -I = - 1. .-. Ja.J-l x Ja. J-l^a^l); that is, ( J a . J- 1) 2 = - a. Thus the product J a . J— 1 may be regarded as equivalent to the imaginary quantity J— a. 94. It will generally be found convenient to indicate the imaginary character of an expression by the presence of the symbol J- 1 ; thus JZjtf = Jja 2 x ( - 1) = a J7 J-T. 95. We shall always consider that, in the absence of any statement to the contrary, of the signs which may be prefixed before a radical the positive sign is to be taken. But in the use of imaginary quantities there is one point of importance which deserves notice. SURDS AND IMAUiNAltY QUANTITIES. 75 Since (- a) x (- b) — ab, by taking the square root, we have J- a x J- b = ± Jab. Thus in funning the product of J a and J— b it would appear that either of the signs + or — might be placed before Jab. This is not the case, for J -a x J- b = J a . J- I x \\/b . J-l = - Jab. 96. It is usual to apply the term c imaginary ' to all expres sions which are not wholly real. Thus a+bj—l may be taken as the general type of all imaginary expressions. Here a and b are real quantities, but not necessarily rational. 97. In dealing with imaginary quantities we apply the laws of combination which have been proved in the case of other surd quantities. Example 1. a + b J - 1 ± (c + d J - 1) = a ± c + (b ± d) J - 1. Example 2. The product of a 4 b J - f and c + dj-l = (a + bj^l)(e + dj^l) = ac - bd 4- (be + ad) */ - 1. 98. If a + b J — 1 = 0, 2/tew a = 0, em(£ b = 0. For, if a + b J^\\ = 0, then bJ—\\=-a; .'. —6\" = a\"; .'. a 2 + b 2 = 0. Now « 2 and b 2 are both positive, therefore their sum cannot be zero unless each of them is separately zero ; that is, a — 0, and 6 = 0. 99. 7f& + bJ^T = c + d l J~- 1, then a = c, andh <I For, by transposition, a — c + (b — d) J- 1 = ; tlierefore, by the last article, a — c = 0, and 6 — ^ = 0; that is a = c, and 6 </. 76 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Thus in order that two imaginary expressions may be equal it is necessary and sufficient that the real parts should be equal, and the imaginary parts should be equal. 100. Definition. When two imaginary expressions differ only in the sign of the imaginary part they are said to be conjugate. Thus a — b J — 1 is conjugate to a + b J — 1. Similarly ^2 + 3^-1 is conjugate to J '2 - 3 J- 1. 101. The sum and the product of two conjugate imayinary expressions are both real. For ( a + b J -\\ +a-b J-\\ = 2a. Again (a + b J- 1) (a - b J- 1) = a 2 - (- b 2 ) = a 2 + b 2 . 102. Definition. The positive value of the square root of a 2 + b 2 is called the modulus of each of the conjugate expressions a + b J — 1 and a — b J — 1. 103. The modulus of the product of two imaginary expres- sions is equal to the product of their moduli. Let the two expressions be denoted by a+bj— 1 and c+dJ—\\. Then their product = ac — bd + (ad + bc) J — 1, which is an imaginary expression whose modulus = J(ac - bd) 2 + (ad + be) 2 = Ja s c* + b*<f + a*d* + b s (? = J (a 2 + b 2 ) (c 2 + dr) = J a 2 + b 2 x Jc 2 + d 2 ; which proves the proposition. 104. If the denominator of a fraction is of the form a + bj— 1, it may be rationalised by multiplying the numerator and the denominator by the conjugate expression a — b J — 1. SURDS AND IMAGINARY QUANTITIES. 77 For instance c + dj - 1 (c + dJ-\\)(a-bJ -\\ ) + b J=l ~(a + b J~i)(a-bJ-T) ac + bd + (ad — be) J — 1 2 72 a + b a ac + bd ad — be -i a + b~ a' + b • _• v Thus by reference to Art. 97, we see that the sum, difference, product, and quotient of two imaginary expressions is in each case an imaginary expression of the same form. 105. To find the square root of a + h J — 1. Assume J a + b V— 1 =x + y s/ — 1, where x and y are real quantities. By squaring, a + bj—\\=x 2 -y 2 + 2xy J — 1 ; therefore, by equating real and imaginary parts, x 2 -y 2 = a (1), ^!/ = b (2); .-. (x 2 + y 2 ) 2 = (x 2 - ff + (2xyY 2 , 2.2 = a + b ; .• . x s + if = J a 2 + 6\" (3). From (1) and (3), we obtain . Ja 2 + b 2 + a . Ja 2 + b 2 -a x -* — 2 .»\"=*— i ; Thus the required root is obtained. Since x and y are real quantities, x 2 + y- is positive, and therefore in (3) the positive sign must be prefixed before the quantity *Ja 2 + b-. Also from (2) we see that the product xy must have the same sign as b ; hence x and y must have like signs if b is positive, and unlike signs if b is negative. 78 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 1. Find the square root of - 7 - 24 J - 1.

From (1) and (2), x- = 9 and ?y 2 = 16 ; .-. x= ±3, ?/== ±4. Since the product xy is negative, we must take x - 3, y = - 4 j or # = - 3, ?/ = 4. Thus the roots are 3 - 4 „/ - 1 and -3 + 4 *J - 1 ; that is, 7 - 7 - 247\"TT= ± (3 - 4 J ~i). Example 2. To find the value of ^/ - 64a 4 . It remains to find the value of \\/ ±*J - 1. Assume SURDS AND IMAGINARY QUANTITIES. 70 106. The symbol J — 1 is often represented by the letter i; but until the student has had a little practice in the use of imaginary quantities he will find it easier to retain the symbol J — 1. It is useful to notice the successive powers of J — 1 or i ; thus (7-1)^1, i*=ij and since each power is obtained by multiplying the one before it by J — 1, or ?', we see that the results must now recur. 107. We shall now investigate the properties of certain imagi- nary quantities which are of very frequent occurrence. Suppose x - ^1 ; then x 3 = 1, or x 3 — 1 = ; that is, (x - 1 ) (x 2 + x+ 1)^0. . \\ either x — 1 = 0, or x 2 + x + 1 = ; -W-3 whence 35=1, or x = . It may be shewn by actual involution that each of these values when cubed is equal to unity. Thus unity has three cube roots, -l+JZTs -1-733 2 \"' 2 ~' two of which are imaginary expressions. Let us denote these by a and ft ; then since they are the roots of the equation x 2 + x + l =0. their product is equal to unity ; that is, aft= 1 ; . \\ aft = a 2 ; that is, . ft = a 2 , since a 8 = 1. Similarly we may shew that a = ft 2 . 108. Since each of the imaginary roots is thr, square of thr other, it is usual to denote the three cube roots of unity by 1, <d, «>~. 80 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Also a) satisfies the equation x 2 + x + 1 = ; . •. 1 + to + w 2 = ; that is, the sum of the three cube roots of unity is zero. Again, to . o> 2 — w = 1 ; therefore (1) the product of the two imaginary roots is unity ; (2) every integral power of w 3 is unity. 109. It is useful to notice that the successive positive integral powers of a> are 1, to, and w 2 ; for, if n he a multiple of 3, it must be of the form 3m ; and to\" = w 3m — 1. If n be not a multiple of 3, it must be of the form 3m + 1 or 3m + 2. -rt> n 1 n 3m + 1 3m It n = dm + 1 , W — o> =to .to = to. KO . O \" 3m +2 3m 2 2 w = om +-, w=w =w .w=to. 110. We now see that every quantity has three cube roots, two of which are imaginary. For the cube roots of a 3 are those of a 7 \" x 1, and therefore are a, ao>, aw 2 . Similarly the cube roots of 9 are ^9, o> ^9, a> 2 ^9, where ^ 7 9 is the cube root found by the ordinary arithmetical rule. In future, unless otherwise stated, the symbol %ja will always be taken to denote the arithmetical cube root of a. (9 4. 3 / _ 1 \\2 Example 1.

THE THEORY OF QUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 111. After suitable reduction every quadratic equation m;iy be written in the form (Lif J rbx + C — (1), and the solution of the equation is - b ± Jtf^iac x = \\ (2). 2a v ' We shall now prove some important propositions connected with the roots and coefficients of all equations of which (1) is the type. 112. A quadratic equation cannot have more than tiro roots. For, if possible, let the equation ax 2 + bx + c = have three different roots a, f3, y. Then since each of these values must satisfy the equation, we have aa 2 -t- ba + c~0 (1), afi 2 + bp + c = (2), ay 2 + by + c = (3). From (1) and (2), by subtraction, a(a 2 -p 2 ) + b(a-P) = 0; divide out by a — fi which, by hypothesis, is not zero; then a (a + ft) + b = 0. Similarly from (2) and (3) a {fi + y) + b = ; .•. by subtraction a (a - y) — ; which is impossible, since, by hypothesis, a is not zero, and u is not equal to y. Hence there cannot be three different roots. G— 2 84 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 113. In Art. Ill let the two roots in (2) be denoted by a and /3, so that -b + Jb 2 - Aac —b- Jb 2 — Aac _ a = , P = 2a ' ' 2a ' then we have the following results : (1) If b 2 - Aac (the quantity under the radical) is positive, a and (3 are real and unequal. (2) If b 2 — Aac is zero, a and ft are real and equal, each reducing in this case to — 77- . 2a (3) If b 2 - Aac is negative, a and ft are imaginary and unequal. (4) If b 2 — Aac is a perfect square, a and /3 are rational and unequal. By applying these tests the nature of the roots of any quadratic may be determined without solving the equation. Example 1. Shew that the equation 2x 2 -6a; + 7 = cannot be satisfied by any real values of x. Here a = 2, b = - 6, c — 7 ; so that &2_ 4ac= (_6)2-4.2.7=-20. Therefore the roots are imaginary. Example 2. If the equation a? 2 + 2 (k + 2) x + 91c = has equal roots, find l\\ The condition for equal roots gives (fc + 2) 2 = 9£, fc2_5ft + 4=0, (fc-4)(fc-l)=0j .-. k = A, or 1. Example 3. Shew that the roots of the equation x 2 - 2p3 +p 2 -q 2 + 2qr- r 2 = are rational. The roots will be rational provided (-- 2p) 2 - 4 (p 2 - q 2 + 2qr-r 2 ) is a perfect square. But this expression reduces to 4 (q 2 -2qr + r 2 ), or 4:(q-r) 2 . Hence the roots are rational. - - , D . - b + Jb 2 - Aac -b- Jb 2 - Aac 114.

Since __ =a+ £ and £ * the equation ar+ - a; + - = may be written x 2 -(a + f])x + ap = (1). Hence any quadratic may also be expressed in the form x 2 - (sum of roots) x + product of roots = (2). Again, from (1) we have (x-a)(x-p) = Q (3). We may now easily form an equation with given roots. Example 1. Form the equation whose roots are 3 and - 2. The equation is (* - 3) (*+ 2)=0, or ««-*- 6=0. When the roots are irrational it is easier to use the following metnou. ~> 86 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 2. Form the equation whose roots are 2 + ^3 and 2 - ^3. We have sum of roots = 4, product of roots = 1 ; . • . the equation is x- - Ax + 1 = 0, by using formula (2) of the present article. 116. By a method analogous to that used in Example 1 of the last article we can form an equation with three or more given roots. 7 Example 1. Form the equation whose roots are 2, - 3, and ^ . o The required equation must be satisfied by each of the following sup- positions : 7 #-2=0, # + 3 = 0, £-- = (); therefore the equation must be (*-2)(*+3)(*-|)=0j that is, [x - 2) (x +3) (5a;- 7) =0, or 5a; 3 -2a; 2 -37a; + 42 = 0. Example 2. Form the equation whose roots are 0, ±«, j . The equation has to be satisfied by c x = 0, x = a. x=-a, x=} ; b therefore it is x (x -J- a) (x - a) ( x - - j = ; that is, x (x 2 - a 2 ) (bx - c) = 0, or bx 4 - ex 3 - a~bx- + a-cx = 0. 117. The results of Art. 114 are most important, and they are generally sufficient to solve problems connected with the roots of quadratics. In such questions the roots should never be considered singly, but use should be made of the relations ob- tained by writing down the sum of the roots, and their product, in terms of the coefficients of the equation. Example 1. If a and /3 are the roots of x--px + q = 0, find the value of (l)a 2 + /3 2 , (2)a s + /3 3 . We have a + (2=p, a a(3 = q. .-. a 2 + /3 2 =(a + /3) 2 -2a/3 =p*-2q.

To find Vie condition that the roots of the equation ax 2 + bx + c = should be (1) equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, (2) reciprocals. The roots will be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign if their sum is zero ; hence the required condition is _ - = 0, or b = 0. a Again, the roots will he reciprocals when their product is unity ; hence we must have c i — = 1. or c = a. a The first of these results is of frequent occurrence in Analyti- cal Geometry, and the second is a particular case of a more general condition applicable to equations of any degree. Example. Find the condition that the roots of ax 2 + bx + c = may be (1) both positive, (2) opposite in sign, but the greater of them negative. b c We have a + B= — , a8=- . a a (1) If the roots are both positive, a/J is positive, and therefore c and a have like signs. Also, since a + fi is positive, — is negative; therefore b and a have unlike signs. Hence the required condition is that the signs of ft and c should be like, and opposite to the sign of b. (2) If the roots are of opposite signs, a/3 is negative, and therefore c and a have unlike signs. Also since a +/3 has the sign of the greater root it is negative, and there- fore - is positive; therefore b and a have like signs. (X Hence the required condition is that the signs of a and b should be like, and opposite to the sign of c. EXAMPLES. IX. a.

If x is a real quantity, prove that the expression -. can have all numerical values except such as lie between 2 and 6. Let the given expression be represented by y, so that a 2 + 2:r- ll_ 2(s-3) ~ y; then multiplying up and transposing, we have rr 2 +2.r(l-?/) + 6f/-ll = 0. This is a quadratic equation, and in order that x may have real values 4(1 -i/) 2 -4(Gy — 11) must be positive; or dividing by 4 and simplifying, ?/ 2 - 8*/ + 12 must be positive ; that is, (y - 6) (y - 2) must be positive. Hence the factors of this product must be both positive, or both negative. In the former case y is greater than 6; in the latter y is less than 2. Therefore y cannot lie between 2 and 6, but may have any other value. In this example it will be noticed that the quadratic expression y 2 — 8y + 12 is positive so long as y does not lie between the roots of the corresponding quadratic equation y 2 — Sy + 12 = 0. This is a particular case of the general proposition investigated in the next article. 120. For all real values of x tlie expression ax 2 + bx+c has the same sign as a, except when the roots of the equation ax 2 +bx + c =0 are real and unequal, and x has a value lying between them. Case I. Suppose that the roots of the equation ax 2 + bx + c = are real ; denote them by a and ft, and let a be the greater. THK THEORY OF QUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 91 Then ((.r 2 4 bx + c — a ( x* + - X + ) V a aj = a {x 2 - (tt + ft) X + aft = a (x - a) (x - ft). Now if x is greater than a, the factors x — a, x — ft are both positive ; and if x is less than ft, the factors x — a, x — ft are both negative; therefore in each case the expression (x — a)(x — ft) is positive, and ax 2 + bx + c lias the same sign as a. But if x has a value lying between a and ft, the expression (./• - a) (x - ft) is negative, and the sign of ax\" + bx + c is opposite to that of a. Case II. If a and ft are equal, then ax 2 + bx + c = a(x— a) 2 , and (x - a) 2 is positive fur all real values of x ; hence ax 2 + bx + c has the same sign as a. Case III. Suppose that the equation ax 2 + bx + c = Q lias imaginary roots ; then ax 2 + bx + c — alx* x + - a a\\ {-• (/ b\\- iae-b') But b 2 — 4«c is negative since the roots are imaginary ; hence iac-b* . . is positive, and the expression 4a 2 ( x + &) 2 Aac — b 2 ^- + \\a 2 is positive for all real values of x ; therefore ax 2 + bx + c has the same sign as a. This establishes the proposition. 121. From the preceding article it follows that the expression ax 2 + bx + c will always have the same sign whatever real value x may have, provided that b 2 - Aac is negative or zero; and if this condition is satisfied the expression is positive or negative accord- ing as a is positive or negative. Conversely, in order that the expression ax 2 + bx + c may be always positive, b 2 — Aac must be negative or zero, and a must be positive; and in order that ax 2 + bx + c may be always negative I 1 - Aac must be negative or zero, and a must be negative. 92 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

Find the limits between which a must lie in order that ax 2 - Ix + 5 5x 2 - Ix + a may be capable of all values, x being any real quantity. _ ax 1 -lx + 5 Put i- o rr =v; then (a-5?/)a: 2 -7.r(l-?/) + (5-a?/):=0. In order that the values of x found from this quadratic may be real, the expression 49 (1 - y)' 2 - 4 (a - 5y) (5 - ay) must be positive, that is, (49 - 20a) y 2 + 2 (2a 2 + l)y + (49 - 20a) must be positive ; hence (2a 2 + 1) 2 - (49 - 20a) 2 must be negative or zero, and 49 - 20a must be positive. Now (2a 2 + 1) 2 - (49 - 20a) 2 is negative or zero, according as 2 (a 2 - 10a + 25) x 2 (a 2 + 10a - 24) is negative or zero ; that is, according as 4 (a - o) 2 (a + 12) (a - 2) is negative or zero. This expression is negative as long as a lies between 2 and - 12, and for such values 49 - 20a is positive; the expression is zero when a = 5, - 12, or 2, but 49 -20a is negative when a = 5.

We shall conclude this chapter with some miscellaneous theorems and examples. It will be convenient here to introduce a phraseology and notation which the student will frequently meet with in his mathematical reading. Definition. Any expression which involves x, and whose value is dependent on that of x, is called a function of X. Functions of x are usually denoted by symbols of the form f(x), F(x),<f>(x). Thus the equation y =f(x) may be considered as equivalent to a statement that any change made in the value of as will pro- duce a consequent change in ;//, and vice versd. The quantities x and y are called variables, and are further distinguished as the independent variable and the dependent variable. 94 HIGHER ALGEBRA. An independent variable is a quantity which may have any value we choose to assign to it, and the corresponding dependent variable has its value determined as soon as the value of the inde- pendent variable is known. % 123. An expression of the form pjs\" + p x x n ] + pjf 2 + . . . + p n _ t x + p n where n is a positive integer, and the coefficients p lt , p lt p a ,...p n do not involve x, is called a rational and integral algebraical function of x. In the present chapter we shall confine our attention to functions of this kind. *124. A function is said to be linear when it contains no higher power of the variable than the first ; thus ax + b is a linear function of x. A function is said to be quadratic when it contains no higher power of the variable than the second ; thus ax 2 + bx + c is a quadratic function of x. Functions of the third, fourth,... degrees are those in which the highest power of the variable is respectively the third, fourth, Thus in the last article the expression is a function of x of the n th degree. *125. The symbol fix, y) is used to denote a function of two variables x and y ; thus ax + by + c, and ax 2 + bxy + cy 2 + dx + ey +f are respectively linear and quadratic functions of x, y. The equations fix) = 0, fix, y) — are said to be linear, quad- ratic, ... according as the functions f(x), f(x, y) are linear, quad- ratic,.... *126. We have proved in Art. 120 that the expression ax 2 + bx + c admits of being put in the form a (x — a) (x — fi), where a and j3 are the roots of the equation ax 2 + bx + c — 0. Thus a quadratic expression ax 2 + bx-\\- c is capable of being resolved into two rational factors of the first degree, whenever the equation ax 2 + bx + c = has rational roots ; that is, when b 2 - iac is a perfect square. *127. To find the condition that a quadratic function ofx,y may be resolved into two linear factors. Denote the function hy f(x, y) where f{x, y) = ax z +'2hxy + by 2 + 2gx+ 2fy + c. THE THEORY OF QUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 95 Write this in descending powers of x, and equate it to zero; thus ax* + 2x (hy + y) + by 2 + 2fy + c - . Solving this quadratic in x we have _ - (h + (j) ± J{hy + y)* - a (by 2 + 2fy + c) x — , a < >v ax + hy + g = ± Jy 2 (h* - ab) + 2y (hy — a/) + (g 2 - ac). Now in order that J\\.r, y) may be the product of two linear factors of the form px + qy + r, the quantity under the radical must be a perfect square ; hence (kg - a/) 2 = (h- - ab) {<f - ac). Transposing and dividing by a, we obtain abc + 2fyh — af 2 — by 2 — ch 2 = ; which is the condition required. This proposition is of great importance in Analytical Geometry. *128. To find the condition that the equations ax 2 + bx + c — 0, ax 2 f b'x + c - may have a common root. Suppose these equations are both satisfied by x a ; then aa. 2 + ba + c = 0, a'a 2 +b'a + c' = 0; .*. by cross multiplication a\" a 1 be — b'c ca — c'a ab' — ab ' To eliminate a, square the second of these equal ratios and equate it to the product of the other two ; thus a a 1 (ca — c'a) 2 (be — b'c) ' (ab' — ab) ' .'. (ca — ca) 2 = (be — b'c) (ab' — ab), which is the condition required.

In this chapter we propose to consider some mis- cellaneous equations ; it will be seen that many of the^l Z solved by the ordinary rules for quadratic equJtions, but others require some special artifice for their solution _ 3_ 3 Example I. Solve 8x 2n -8x~^=63. Multiply by .r 2n and transpose; thus - i. 8x n - 63x 2 '*-8 = 0; — L (a?\"-8)(8x^+l) = 0; - 1 «2n = 8, or--; 8' 2n =(*)* «(-p)*; .-.*=«», or A. Example 2.

Solve (*-5)(a:- 7)(« + 6) (* + 4) = 504. We have (x 2 - x - 20) (x 2 - x - 42) = 504 ; which, being arranged as a quadratic in x 2 - x, gives (a 2 - x) 2 - 62 (x 2 - x) + 336 = .-. (x 2 -a:-6)(x 2 -x-56) = .-. X *- X -Q = f or a 2 -a; -56 = whence x = S, -2, 8, -7. 130. Any equation which can be thrown into the form ax 2 + bx + c + p J ax 2 + bx + c — q may be solved as follows. Putting y = J ax 2 + bx + c, we obtain Let a and ft be the roots of this equation, so that J ax 2 + bx + c = a, J ax 2 +bx + c = ft ; from these equations we shall obtain four values of x. \"When no sign is prefixed to a radical it is usually understood that it is to be taken as positive; hence, if a and ft are both positive, all the four values of x satisfy the original equation. If however a or ft is negative, the roots found from the resulting quadratic will satisfy the equation ax 2 + bx + c — p J ax 2 + bx + c = q, but not the original equation. Example. Solve x 2 - ox + 2 Jx 2 - 5z + 3 = 12. Add 3 to each side ; then rc 2 -5a; + 3 + 2 N /^-5a; + 3 = 15. Putting Jx 2 -5x+3 = y, we obtain y 2 + 2y - 15 = ; whence y = 3 or - 5. Thus *Jx 2 - 5x + 3 = + 3, or Jx 2 -6x + S = -5. Squaring, and solving the resulting quadratics, we obtain from the first ic=6 or -1; and from the second x^ satisfies the given equation, but the second pair satisfies the equation ing quadratics, we obtain from the first : = — ^ . The first pair of values x 2 - 5x -2 Jx 2 -5x + 3 = 12. MISCELLANEOUS EQUATIONS. 99 131. Before clearing an equation of radicals it is advisable to examine whether any common factor can be removed by division. Example. Solve *J x' 2 - lax + 10a' 2 - Jx- + ax- 6a- — x- 2a. We have *J(x-2a)(x-5a) - J{x-2a) (x+Sa) = x-2a. The factor *J x - 2a can now be removed from every term ; .'. sjx -5a- Jx + 3a = „Jx - 2a ; x - 5a + x + 3a - 2 *J(x - 5a) (x + 3a) = x - 2a ; x = 2 Jx' 2 - 2ax - 15a' 2 ; 3ar-8aa;-60a 2 = 0; {x -6a) (3a; + 10a) =0; c 10a x — ba, or — — . Alsoxby equating to zero the factor Jx - 2a, we obtain x = 2a. On trial it will be found that x = 6a does not satisfy the equation : thus the roots are — — and 2a. D The student may compare a similar question discussed in the Elementary Algebra, Art. 281. 132. The following artifice is sometimes useful. Example. Solve J'3x- - 4.x + 34 + JSx' 2 - 4x - 11 = 9 (1). We have identically (3x--4a; + 34)-(3a; 2 -4x-ll) = 45 (2). Divide each member of (2) by the corresponding member of (1); thus J'dx- - 4.r + 34 - JSx 2 - 4x - 11 = 5 (3). Now (2) is an identical equation true for all values of x, whereas (1) is an equation which is true only for certain values of x ; hence also equation (3) is only true for these values of x. From (1) and (3) by addition v /3x 2 -4a; + 34 = 7; whence as = 3, or --. 7—7 100 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 133. The solution of an equation of the form ax 4 ± bx 3 ± ex 2 ± bx + a = 0, in which the coefficients of terms equidistant from the beginning and end are equal, can be made to depend on the solution of a quadratic. Equations of this type are known as reciprocal equa- tions, and are so named because they are not altered when x is changed into its reciprocal - . For a more complete discussion of reciprocal equations the student is referred to Arts. 568 — 570. Example. Solve 12a; 4 - 56x 3 + 89a; 2 - 56.x + 12 = 0. Dividing by x 2 and rearranging, 12/W- 2 ) -56^+^+89 = 0. Put x + -=z: then a; 2 + — = z 2 -2; x x- .-. 12 (z 2 - 2) -56^ + 89 = 0; whence we obtain z = - , or -=- . 2 u 1 5 13 a; 2 6 13 2 By solving these equations we find that x = 2, - , - , - . 134. The following equation though not reciprocal may be solved in a similar manner. Example. Solve 6a; 4 - 25a; 3 + 12a; 2 + 25a; + 6 = 0. We have 6 (^ 2 +^i) - 25 fx - -\\ + 12 = 0; whence 6(a; — j -25 (a; — 1+24 = 0; .-. 2 (^--^-3 = 0, or 3 fx- -]-8-0; whence we obtain a; = 2, - - , 3, - - . 135. When one root of a quadratic equation is obvious by inspection, the other root may often be readily obtained by making use of the properties of the roots of quadratic equations proved in Art. 114. MISCELLANEOUS EQUATIONS. 101 Example. Solve ( 1 - a-) {x + a) - 2a ( 1 - ar) = 0. This is a quadratic, one of whose roots is clearly a. Also, since the equation may be written 2ax- + (1 - a 2 ) x - a (1 + a 2 ) = 0, the product of the roots is - - ; and therefore the other root is — — . EXAMPLES. X. a.

Put x + 2 = m, and y + 3 = v ; then u+v + Juv = Sd (1), w 2 + v 2 + wv = 741 (2), hence, from (1) and (2), we obtain by division, u + v - Juv = 19 (3) . From (1) and (3), u+t?=29; and Juv = 10, or wv = 100; whence w = 25, or 4; v = 4, or 25 ; thus x = 23, or 2; y=l, or 22. Example 2. Solve .r 4 + y*= 82 (1), ar-y=2 (2).

Indeterminate Equations. 138. Suppose the following problem were proposed for solu- tion : A person spends .£461 in buying horses and cows; if each horse costs £23 and each cow £16, how many of each does he buy 1 ? Let x, y be the number of horses and cows respectively ; then 23a; + 16^ = 461. Here we have one equation involving two unknown quantities, and it is clear that by ascribing any value we please to x, we can obtain a corresponding value for y ; thus it would appear at first sight that the problem admits of an infinite number of solutions. But it is clear from the nature of the question that x and y must be positive integers ; and with this restriction, as we shall see later, the number of solutions is limited. If the number of unknown quantities is greater than the number of independent equations, there will be an unlimited number of solutions, and the equations are said to be indeter- minate. In the present section we shall only discuss the simplest kinds of indeterminate equations, confining our attention to posi- tive integral values of the unknown quantities ; it will be seen that this restriction enables us to express the solutions in a very simple form. The general theory of indeterminate equations will be found in Chap. xxvi. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS. Ill Example 1. Solve 7# + 12j/ = 220 in positive integers. Divide throughout by 7, the smaller coefficient ; thus x + y+^ =31 + -; .-. x + y+^-~ =31 ... Since x anil y are to be integers, we must have 5y-S (1) and therefore that is, and therefore 7 l%-9 = integer ; = integer ; w-2 %-l+ *-=-= integer; 1/-2 : integer =p suppose. or .-. y-2 = 7p, y = lp + 2 Substituting this value of y in (1), .r + 7p + 2 + 5> + l = 31; that is, x = 2§-l2p (2). .(3). If in these results we give to p any integral value, we obtain corresponding integral values of x and y; but if p > 2, we see from (3) that x is negative ; and if p is a negative integer, y is negative. Thus the only positive integral values of x and y are obtained by putting p = 0, 1, 2. The complete solution may be exhibited as follows : p= 0, 1, 2, a: = 28, 16, 4, y= 2, 9, 16. Note. When we obtained 5y-S integer, we multiplied by 3 in order to make the coefficient of y differ by unity from a multiple of 7. A similar artifice should always be employed before introducing a symbol to denote the integer. Example 2. Solve in positive integers, 14x - 11// = 29. Divide by 11, the smaller coefficient; thus (1). x + Sx 11 i/-2 + ir ; 3x-7 11 = 2 - x + y = integer ; 112 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 12£ - 28 . hence — ^ = m teg er *> g* ^ that is, x - 2 + —— = integer ; Qfc ^ .-. '— — = integer =_p suppose; ! .*. X = \\\\p + § and, from (1), y — 14p + 5 This is called the general solution of the equation, and by giving to p any positive integral value or zero, we obtain positive integral values of x and y ; thus we have p = 0, 1, 2, 3, .t = 6, 17, 28, 39, y = 5, 19, 33, 47, the number of solutions being infinite. Example 3. In how many ways can £5 be paid in half-crowns and florins? Let x be the number of half-crowns, y the number of florins ; then 5^ + 4y = 200; ••• x +y+\\= 5 °; x . .' . 2 — integer = 2^ suppose ; .*. x=4p, and y = 50-5p. Solutions are obtained by ascribing to p the values 1, 2, 3, ...9; and therefore the number of ways is 9. If, however, the sum may be paid either in half-crowns or florins, p may also have the values and 10. If ^ = 0, then x = 0, and the sum is paid entirely in florins ; if p = 10, then y = 0, and the sum is paid entirely in half-crowns. Thus if zero values of x and y are admissible the number of ways is 11. Example 4. The expenses of a party numbering 43 were £5. 14s. Qd. ; if each man paid 5s., each woman 2s. 6d., and each child Is., how many were there of each? Let x, y, z denote the number of men, women, and children, respectively; then we have x + y + z= 43 (1), 10.r + 5?/ + 2z = 229. Eliminating z, we obtain 8x + By = 143. The general solution of this equation is x=Sp + l, y = 45-8p; INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS. 113 Hence by substituting in (1), we obtain z = 5p-3. Here p cannot be negative or zero, but may have positive integral values from 1 to 5. Thus p= 1, 2, 3, 4, 5; x- 4, 7, 10, 13, 16; * y = 37, 29, 21, 13, 5; 2=2, 7, 12, 17, 22. EXAMPLES. X. d.

A. 8 CHAPTER XL Permutations and Combinations. 139. Each of the arrangements which can be made by taking some or all of a number of things is called a permutation. Each of the groups or selections which can be made by taking some or all of a number of things is called a combination. Thus the •permutations which can be made by taking the letters a, b, c, d two at a time are twelve in number, namely, ab, ac, ad, be, bd, cd, ba, ca, da, cb, db, dc ; each of these presenting a different arrangement of two letters. The combinations which can be made by taking the letters a, b, c, d two at a time are six in number : namely, ab, ac, ad, be, bd, cd; each of these presenting a different selection of two letters. From this it appears that in forming combinations we are only concerned with the number of things each selection contains ; whereas in forming permutations we have also to consider the order of the things which make up each arrangement; for instance, if from four letters a, b, c, d we make a selection of three, such as abc, this single combination admits of being arranged in the following ways : abc, acb, bca, bac, cab, cba, and so gives rise to six different permutations. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 115 140. Before discussing the general propositions of this chapter there is an important principle which we proceed to explain and illustrate by a few numerical examples. If one operation can be performed in m ivays, and (when it has been performed in any one of these ways) a second operation can then be performed in n tvays ; the number of ways of per- forming the two operations ivill be m x n. If the first operation be performed in any one way, we can associate with this any of the n ways of performing the second operation : and thus we shall have n ways of performing the two operations without considering more than one way of performing the first; and so, corresponding to each of the m ways of per- forming the first operation, we shall have n ways of performing the two; hence altogether the number of ways in which the two operations can be performed is represented by the product m x n. Example 1. There are 10 steamers plying between Liverpool and Dublin; in how many ways can a man go from Liverpool to Dublin and return by a different steamer? There are ten ways of making the first passage ; and with each of these there is a choice of nine ways of returning (since the man is not to come back by the same steamer) ; hence the number of ways of making the two journeys is 10 x 9, or 90. This principle may easily be extended to the case in which there are more than two operations each of which can be per- formed in a given number of ways. Example 2. Three travellers arrive at a town where there are four hotels; in how many ways can they take up their quarters, each at a different hotel? The first traveller has choice of four hotels, and when he has made his selection in any one way, the second traveller has a choice of three ; there- fore the first two can make their choice in 4 x 3 ways ; and with any one such choice the third traveller can select his hotel in 2 ways ; hence the required number of ways is 4 x 3 x 2, or 24. 141. To find the number of permutations of \\\\ dissimilar things taken r at a time. This is the same thing as finding the number of ways in which we can fill up r places when we have n different things at our disposal. The first place may be tilled up in n ways, for any one of the n things may be taken ; when it has been filled up in any one of 8—2 116 HIGHER ALGEBRA. these ways, the second place can then be filled up in n - 1 ways ; and since each way of filling up the first place can be associated with each way of filling up the second, the number of ways in which the first two places can be filled up is given by the product n (n - 1). And when the first two places have been filled up in any way, the third place can be filled up in h — 2 ways. And reasoning as before, the number of ways in which three places can be filled up is n (n - 1) (n - 2). Proceeding thus, and noticing that a new factor is introduced with each new place filled up, and that at any stage the number of factors is the same as the number of places filled up, we shall have the number of ways in which r places can be filled up equal to n (n- l)(n— 2) to r factors ; and the r th factor is n — (r— 1), or n — r+1. Therefore the number of permutations of n things taken r at a time is n{n- 1) (n- 2) (n-r + 1). Cor. The number of permutations of n things taken all at a time is n (n - 1) (?i - 2) to n factors, or n(n — Y)(n—2) 3.2.1. It is usual to denote this product by the symbol \\n, which is read \"factorial n.\" Also n\\ is sometimes used for \\n. 142. We shall in future denote the number of permutations of n things taken r at a time by the symbol n P r , so that \"P r = w(w-l)(w-2) (n-r + 1); also \"P = \\n. In working numerical examples it is useful to notice that the suffix in the symbol n P r always denotes the number of factors in the formula we are using. 143. The number of permutations of n things taken r at a time may also be found in the following manner. Let \"P r represent the number of permutations of n things taken r at a time. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 117 Suppose we form all the permutations of n things t;iken r — 1 at a time ; the number of these will be \"P . ' r—l With each of these put one of the remaining n — r + 1 tilings. Each time we do this we shall get one permutation of u things r at a time; and therefore the whole number of the permutations of n things r at a time is n P r _ ] x (n - r + 1) ; that is, By writing r—l for r in this formula, we obtain \"P_ 1 = '^ r _ 2 x(n-r-f2), similarly, 'P = 'P r _ a x (n - r + 3), \"P^P.x (71 -I), \"P x =7l. Multiply together the vertical columns and cancel like factors from each side, and we obtain n P r = n(n-l)(n-2) (n-r+l). Example 1. Four persons enter a railway carriage in which there are six seats ; in how many ways can they take their places ? The first person may seat himself in 6 ways ; and then the second person in 5 ; the third in 4 ; and the fourth in 3 ; and since each of these ways may be associated with each of the others, the required answer is 6x5x4x3, or 360. Example 2. How many different numbers can be formed by using six out of the nine digits 1, 2, 3, ...9? Here we have 9 different things and we have to find the number of per- mutations of them taken 6 at a time ; . * . the required result = 9 P 6 =9x8x7x6x5x4 = 60480. 144. To find the number of combinations of n dissimilar tilings taken r at a time. Let \"C r denote the required number of combinations. Then each of these combinations consists of a group of r dissimilar things which can be arranged among themselves in |r ways. [Art. 142.] 118 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence \"C r x \\r is equal to the number of arrangements of n things taken rata time ; that is, *C x\\r = \"P r | r = n (n — 1) (n — 2) . . . (n - r + 1) ; _ tt(w-l)(w-2)...(w-r+l) |r V '\" Cor. This formula for n C r may also be written in a different form ; for if we multiply the numerator and the denominator by \\n — r we obtain n (n - 1) (n - 2) ... {n - r + 1) x \\ n — r \\r n — r The numerator now consists of the product of all the natural numbers from n to 1 ; \\n .'. \"C r = . ~ (2). It will be convenient to remember both these expressions for n C r , using (1) in all cases where a numerical result is required, and (2) when it is sufficient to leave it in an algebraical shaj)e. Note. If in formula (2) we put r = n, we have \\n i n ~jn|_0\" |0' but n C n =l, so that if the formula is to be true for r = n, the symbol 10 must be considered as equivalent to 1. Example. From 12 books in how many ways can a selection of 5 be made, (1) when one specified book is always included, (2) when one specified book is always excluded ? (1) Since the specified book is to be included in every selection, we have only to choose 4 out of the remaining 11. Hence the number of ways = n C 4 1 1x10 x9x8 ~ 1x2x3x4 = 330. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 119 (2) Since the specified book is always to be excluded, we have to select the 5 books out of the remaining 11. Hence the number of ways = n C 6 _ 11x10x9x8x7 1x2x3x4x5 = 462. 145. The number of combinations of n things r at a time is equal to the number of combinations of\\\\ things n — r at a time. In making all the possible combinations of n things, to each group of r things we select, there is left a corresponding group of n - r things ; that is, the number of combinations of n things r at a time is the same as the number of combinations of n things n — r at a time ; .-. \"C = n C . r n — r The proposition may also be proved as follows : \\n \"0 _ r = =— [Art. 144.1 n — r n — (n - r) n n — r r Such combinations are called complementary. Note. Put r=w, then tt C = n C n =l. The result we have just proved is useful in enabling us to abridge arithmetical work. Example. Out of 14 men in how many ways can an eleven be chosen? The required number = 14 C U 14 x 13 x 12 1x2x3 = 364. If we had made use of the formula u C n , we should have had to reduce au expression whose numerator and denominator each contained 11 factors. 120 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 146. Tojind the number of ways in which m + n things can be divided into two groups containing in and n things respectively. This is clearly equivalent to finding the number of combi- nations of ra + n things ra at a time, for every time we select one group of ra things we leave a group of n things behind. Ira + n Thus the required number = h= 1 ra \\7b Note. If n = m, the groups are equal, and in this case the number of \\2m different ways of subdivision is - — ~ — [9 ; for in any one way it is possible to interchange the two groups without obtaining a new distribution. 147. To jind the number of ways in which m + n + p things can be divided into three groups containing m, n, p things severally. First divide ra + n + p things into two groups containing m and n + p things respectively : the number of ways in which this \\m + n+p can be done is -r= \\m n+p Then the number of ways in which the group of n+p things can be divided into two groups containing n and p things respec- \\n+p tively is n p Hence the number of ways in which the subdivision into three groups containing m, n, p things can be made is m + n+p n+p \\m + n + ]> x , , - , or in n + p \\n \\p 5 Ira \\n \\p J3wi Note. If we put ?i=p = m. we obtain : — r=-| — ; hut this formula regards as different all the possible orders in which ~th.e three groups can occur in any one mode of subdivision. And since there are 13 such orders cor- responding to each mode of subdivision, the number of different ways in |3ot which subdivision into three equal groups can be made is - — r^f — r^ • 771 771 m |3 Example.

In the examples which follow it is important to notice that the formula for 'permutations should not be used until the suitable selections required by the question have been made. Example 1. From 7 Englishmen and 4 Americans a committee of is to be formed; in how many ways can this be done, (1) when the committee con- tains exactly 2 Americans, (2) at least 2 Americans ? (1) \"We have to choose 2 Americans and 4 Englishmen. The number of ways in which the Americans can be chosen is 4 C, ; and the number of ways in which the Englishmen can be chosen is 7 C 4 . Each of the first groups can be associated with each of the second ; hence the required number of ways = 4 C 2 x 7 C 4 li \\1 = |~2\"[2 X TTJ3 17 'J^ = 210. |2|2|3 (2) The committee may contain 2, 3, or 4 Americans. \"We shall exhaust all the suitable combinations by forming all the groups containing 2 Americans and 4 Englishmen ; then 3 Americans and 3 English- men; and lastly 4 Americans and 2 Englishmen. The sum of the three results will give the answer. Hence the required number of ways = *C 2 x 7 C 4 + 4 C 3 x 7 (7 3 + 4 C 4 x 7 C, 17 |4 17 17 X TTT^ + TK X rl - ^ + 1 X [2 1 2 [4 j_3 j_3 |3|4 [2)5 = 210 + 140 + 21 = 371. In this Example we have only to make use of the suitable formulae for combinations, for we are not concerned with the possible arrangements of the members of the committee among themselves. Example 2. Out of 7 consonants and 4 vowels, how many words can be made each containing 3 consonants and 2 vowels? The number of ways of choosing the three consonants is 7 C 3 , and the number of ways of choosing the 2 vowels is *C a ; and since each of the first groups can be associated with each of the second, the number of combined groups, each containing 3 consonants and 2 vowels, is 7 C 3 x 4 C 2 . Further, each of these groups contains 5 letters, which may be arranged among themselves in [5 ways. Hence the required number of words = 7 C 3 x 4 C 2 x Jo ~|3|4 X [2]2 X \" = 5x|7 r = 25200. 122 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 3. How many words can be formed out of the letters article, so that the vowels occupy the even places? Here we have to put the 3 vowels in 3 specified places, and the 4 conso- nants in the 4 remaining places ; the first operation can be done in 1 3 ways, and the second in 1 4 . Hence the required number of words =|3x[4 = 144. In this Example the formula for permutations is immediately applicable, because by the statement of the question there is but one way of choosing the vowels, and one way of choosing the consonants.

Before considering cases in which some one or more sets of things may be like, it is necessary to point out exactly in what sense the words like and unlike are used. When we speak of things being dissimilar, different, un- like, we imply that the things are visibly unlike, so as to be easily distinguishable from each other. On the other hand we shall always use the term like things to denote such as are alike to the eye and cannot be distinguished from each other. For instance, in Ex. 2, Art. 1-48, the consonants and the vowels may be said each to consist of a group of things united by a common characteristic, and thus in a certain sense to be of the same kind; but they cannot be regarded as like things, because there is an individuality existing among the things of each group which makes them easily distinguishable from each other. Hence, in the final stage of the example we considered each group to consist of five dissimilar things and therefore capable of [5 arrangements among themselves. [Art. 141 Cor.] 150. Suppose we have to find all the possible ways of arrang- ing 12 books on a shelf, 5 of them being Latin, 4 English, and the remainder in different languages. The books in each language may be regarded as belonging to one class, united by a common characteristic ; but if they were distinguishable from each other, the number of permutations would be )12, since for the purpose of arrangement among them- selves they are essentially different. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 125 If, however, the books in the same language are not dis- tinguishable from each other, we should have to find the number of ways in which 12 things can be arranged among themselves, when 5 of them are exactly alike of one kind, and 4 exactly alike, of a second kind : a problem which is not directly included in any of the cases we have previously considered. 151. To find the number of ways in which n things may be arranged among themselves, taking them all at a time, when p of the things are exactly alike of one kind, q of them exactly alike of another kind, r of them exactly alike of a third kind, and the rest all different. Let there be n letters ; suppose p of them to be a, q of them to be b, r of them to be c, and the rest to be unlike. Let x be the required number of permutations ; then if in any one of these permutations the_p letters a were replaced by p unlike letters different from any of the rest, from this single permutation, without altering the position of any of the remaining letters, we could form I p new permutations. Hence if this change were made in each of the x permutations we should obtain x x \\p permutations. Similarly, if the q letters b were replaced by q unlike letters, the number of permutations would be x x \\p x |<7. In like manner, by replacing the r letters c by r unlike letters, we should finally obtain x x \\p x \\q x \\r permutations. But the things are now all different, and therefore admit of \\n permutations among themselves. Hence x x \\p x \\q x r- \\n; r that is, x — ~. — ' • \\p \\g p which is the required number of permutations. Any case in which the things are not all different may be treated similarly. 126 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 1. How many different permutations can be made out of the letters of the word assassination taken all together ? We have here 13 letters of which 4 are s, 3 are a, 2 are i, and 2 are n. Hence the number of permutations ~|^[3|2j£ = 13.11.10.9.8.7.3.5 = 1001 x 10800 = 10810800. Example 2. How many numbers can be formed with the digits 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, so that the odd digits always occupy the odd places? The odd digits 1, 3, 3, 1 can be arranged in their four places in l^2 wa y s (1) - The even digits 2, 4, 2 can be arranged in their three places in 13 y^ ways (2). Each of the ways in (1) can be associated with each of the ways in (2). 14 13 Hence the required number = y^=x- x -j^ = 6 x 3 = 18. 152. To find the number of permutations of n things r at a time, when each thing may be repeated once, twice, up to r times in any arrangement. Here we have to consider the number of ways in which r places can be filled up when we have n different things at our disposal, each of the n things being used as often as we please in any arrangement. The first place may be filled up in n ways, and, when it has been filled up in any one way, the second place may also be filled up in n ways, since we are not precluded from using the same thing again. Therefore the number of ways in which the first two places can be filled up iswxn or n 2 . The third place can also be filled up in n ways, and therefore the first three places in n 3 ways. Proceeding in this manner, and noticing that at any stage the index of n is always the same as the number of places filled up, we shall have the number of ways in which the r places can be filled up equal to n r . PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 127 Example. In how many ways can 5 prizes be given away to 4 boys, when each boy is eligible for all the prizes? Any one of the prizes can be given in 4 ways; and then any one of the; remaining prizes can also be given in 4 ways, since it may be obtained by the boy who has already received a prize. Thus two prizes can be given away in 4 a ways, three prizes in 4 :! ways, and so on. Hence the 5 prizes can be given away in 4 5 , or 1024 ways. 153. To find the total number of ways in which it is possible to make a selection by taking some or all of \\\\ things. Each tiling may be dealt with in two ways, for it may either be taken or left; and since either way of dealing with any one thing may be associated with either way of dealing with eacli one of the others, the number of selections is 2x2x2x2 to n factors. But this includes the case in which all the things are left, therefore, rejecting this case, the total number of ways is 2\"-l. This is often spoken of as \"the total number of combinations\" of n things. Example. A man has 6 friends ; in how many ways may he invite one or more of them to dinner? He has to select some or all of his 6 friends ; and therefore the number of ways is 2 s - 1, or 63. This result can be verified in the following manner. The guests may be invited singly, in twos, threes, ; therefore the number of selections = 6 C 1 + 6 C 2 + 6 C 3 + 6 C 4 + 6 C 5 + <>C 6 = 6 + 15 + 20 + 15 + 6 + 1 = 63. 154. To find for what value of r the number of combinations of n things r at a time is greatest. Since \"C = ^( ?l - 1 )( n - 2 ) (w-r + 2)(n-r + l) 1.2.3 (r-l)r , _ n(n-l)(n-2) (w-r + 2) 1. 2.3 (r-1) \"C = n C . x n — r + 1 r The multiplying factor may be written — - - 1, which shews that it decreases as r increases. Hence as r receives 128 HIGHER ALGEBRA. the values 1, 2, 3 in succession, n G r is continually increased 71 4- 1 until 1 becomes equal to 1 or less than 1. r Now 1^1, r i 71+1 ^ so long as > z ; r that is, — — - > r. We have to choose the greatest value of r consistent with this inequality. (1) Let n be even, and equal to 2m; then n + 1 2m +1 1 -2 2— — + s ; and for all values of ?• up to ?n inclusive this is greater than r. Hence by putting r — m = — , we find that the greatest number of combinations is \"C . n 2 (2) Let n be odd, and equal to 2m + 1 ; then n + 1 2m + 2 - — =-5— » + li and for all values of r up to m inclusive this is greater than r ; but when r - m + 1 the multiplying factor becomes equal to 1, and *C.= n C : that is, \"C + - n C • mi+I m ' ' n+ 1 7i—l J 2 2 and therefore the number of combinations is greatest when the things are taken — — , or — ^— at a time; the result being the same in the two cases. 155. The formula for the number of combinations of n things r at a time may be found without assuming the formula for the numbes of permutations. Let \"C r denote the number of combinations of n things taken r at a time; and let the n things be denoted by the letters a, b, c, d, PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 120 Take away a; then with tin 1 remaining letters we cm form \"~ X C combinations of n— 1 letters taken r - 1 at a time. With eaeli of these write a; thus we see that of the combinations of n tilings r at a time, the number of those which contain a is w ~ l C x \\ similarly the number of those which contain b is n ~ x C , : and so for each of the n letters. Tlierefore n x \"~*C r _ l is equal to the number of combinations r at a time which contain a, together with those that contain b, those that contain c, and so on. But by forming the combinations in this manner, each par- ticular one will be repeated r times. For instance, if r=3, the combination abc will be found anions; those containing a, amonir those containing b, and among those containing c. Hence *c= n - x c r 1 x-. r r— i ., By writing u — 1 and r — 1 instead of n and r respectively, ni 1 r-l° »-2 Similarly, -V^ = ^G r _ z x - n— r + 2/~1 _n-r + \\ri U — T + o >. 2 ^i 2 ; and finally, n - r+1 C 1 = »-r + 1. Multiply together the vertical columns and cancel like factors from each side ; thus \"C . n (rc-l)(n-2) (n-r+ l) r(r-l)(r-2) 1 156. To find the total number of ways in which it is -possible to make a selection by taking some or all out qfip + c x +r + tilings, ivJierenf-p are alike of one kind, q alike of a second kind, r alike of a third kind; and so on. The p things may be disposed of in p + 1 ways ; for wo may take 0, 1, 2, 3, p °f thorn. Similarly the q things may be disposed of in q + \\ ways; the r things in r+1 ways; and so on. H. II. A. 9 130 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence the number of Avays in which all the tilings may be disposed of is (^ + 1) (q + 1) (r + 1) But this includes the case in which none of the things are taken ; therefore, rejecting this case, the total number of ways is (jp + l)fe+l)(r + .l) -1. 157. A general formula expressing the number of permuta- tions, or combinations, of n things taken r at a time, when the things are not all different, may be somewhat complicated ; but a particular case may be solved in the following manner. Example. Find the number of ways in which (1) a selection, (2) an ar- rangement, of four letters can be made from the letters of the word proportion. There are 10 letters of six different sorts, namely o, o,o; p,p; r, r; t; i; n. In finding groups of four these may be classified as follows : (1) Three alike, one different. (2) Two alike, two others alike. (3) Two alike, the other two different. (4) All four different. (1) The selection can be made in 5 ways ; for each of the five letters, p, r, t, i s n, can be taken with the single group of the three like letters o. (2) The selection can be made in 3 C 2 ways ; for we have to choose two out of the three pairs o, o; p, p; r, r. This\" gives 3 selections. (3) This selection can be made in 3 x 10 ways ; for we select one of the 3 pairs, and then two from the remaining 5 letters. This gives 30 selections. (1) This selection can be made in 6 C 4 ways, as we have to take 4 different letters to choose from the six o, p, r, t, i, n. This gives 15 selections. Thus the total number of selections is 5 + 3 + 30 + 15 ; that is, 53. In finding the different arrangements of 4 letters we have to permute in all possible ways each of the foregoing groups. (1) gives rise to 5 x = , or 20 arrangements. (2) gives rise to 3 x -^=^ , or 18 arrangements. (3) gives rise to 30 x -=- , or 360 arrangements. (4) gives rise to 15 x j4 , or 3G0 arrangements. Thus the total number of arrangements is 20 + 18 + 360 + 360; that is, 758. PERMUTATIONS AND COMBINATIONS. 131 EXAMPLES. XI. b. 1.

Mathematical Induction. 158. Many important mathematical formula? are not easily demonstrated by a direct mode of proof; in such cases we fre- quently find it convenient to employ a method of proof known as mathematical induction, which we shall now illustrate. Example 1. Suppose it is required to prove that the sum of the cubes of the first n natural numbers is equal to < — ^— — 'J- . We can easily see by trial that the statement is true in simple cases, such as when re=l, or 2, or 3 ; and from this we might be led to conjecture that the formula was true in all cases. Assume that it is true when n terms are taken ; that is, suppose 13 + 2 3 + 33 + to itteims=| H ( ;t+1 )j 3 . Add the («+ l) th term, that is, (n+ 1) 3 to each side ; then 13 + 2 3 + 3 3 + to n + 1 terms =j n ^ 2 +1 ^ | +(n+iy = {n + iy-('j+n + l\\ \\- (n+l) 8 (n a +4n+4) 4 -\\ \\ (n + l)(K + 2) )\\ 2 ! ' which is of the same form as the result we assumed to be true for n terms, n + 1 taking the place of n ; in other words, if the result is true when we take a certain number of terms, whatever that number may be, it is true when we increase that number by one; but we see that it is true when 3 terms are taken ; therefore it is true when 4 terms are taken ; it is therefore true when 5 terms are taken; and so on. Thus the result is true universally. 134 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 2. To determine the product of n binomial factors of the form x + a. By actual multiplication we have (x + a) (x + b) (x + c) = x 3 + (a + b + c) x 2 + (ab + bc + ca) x + abc ; (x+a) (x + b) (x + c) (x + d) = x*+(a + b + c + d)x 3 + (ab + ac+ ad + bc+ bd + cd) x~ + (abc + abd + acd + bed) x + abed. In these results we observe that the following laws hold : 1. The number of terms on the right is one more than the number of binomial factors on the left. 2. The index of x in the first term is the same as the number of binomial factors ; and in each of the other terms the index is one less than that of the preceding term. 3. The coefficient of the first term is unity ; the coefficient of the second term is the sum of the letters a, b, c, ; the coefficient of the third term is the sum of the products of these letters taken two at a time; the coefficient of the fourth term is the sum of their products taken three at a time ; and so on ; the last term is the product of all the letters. Assume that these laws hold in the case of n - 1 factors ; that is, suppose (x + a) (x+b)... (x + h) = x 71 ' 1 +p 1 x n ~ 2 +p. 2 x n ~ 3 +p. i x n - i + ... +p> n ^ , where p 1 = a + b + c+ ...h; p. 2 = ab + ac + ... + ah + bc + bd+ ; p 3 = abc + abd+ ; p n _ x = abc...h. Multiply both sides by another factor x + k ; thus (x + a) (x + b) ... (x + h) (x + k) = x n + (p x + k) x n ~ l + (p. 2 +p x k) x n ~* + (p 3 + pJc) x n ~ 3 +... +l^ n - x k. Now ^i + A;:=(a + & + c + . ..+/*) + & = sum of all the n letters a, b, c,...k; p. 2 +p 1 k=p. 2 + k (a + b + ... + h) = sum of the products taken two at a time of all the n letters a, b, c, ... k; p. A +p. 2 k =p 3 + k (ab + ac + . . . + ah + bc + . . .) = sum of the products taken three at a time of all the n letters a, b, c, ... k; 2? n _ 1 A* = product of all the n letters a, b, c, ... k. MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION. 135 If therefore the laws hold when ?t-l factors are multiplied together they hold in the case of n factors. But we havo seen that they hold in the case of 4 factors; therefore they hold for 5 factors; therefore also for 6 factors ; and so on ; thus they hold universally. Therefore [x + a) (x + b) {x +c) ... (x + k) = x 11 + ,V U_1 + Stfp-* + S. A x n ~* + . . . + 8 n where S^the sum of all the n letters a, b, c ...

Example. Shew that .-c u -l is divisible by x-1 for all positive integral values of n. x n -l z' l-1 -l By division = x n ~ l ^ — ;J x-1 x-1 * if therefore x n ~ l - 1 is divisible by x - 1, then x* - 1 is also divisible by x - 1. But x' 1 - 1 is divisible by x - 1 ; therefore x 3 - 1 is divisible by x - 1 ; there- fore x 4, - 1 is divisible by^r - 1, and so on ; hence the proposition is established. Other examples of the same kind will be found in the chapter on the Theory of Numbers. 1G0. From the foregoing examples it will be seen that the only theorems to which induction can be applied are those which admit of successive cases corresponding to the order of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, n.

It may be shewn by actual multiplication that (x + a) (x + b) (x + c) {x + d) = x 4 + (a + b + c + d) x 3 + (ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd) x* + (abc + abd + acd + bed) x + abed (1). We may, however, write down this result by inspection ; for the complete product consists of the sum of a number \"of partial pro- ducts each of which is formed by multiplying together four letters, one being taken from each of the four factors. If we examine the way in which the various partial products are formed, we see that (1) the term x 4 is formed by taking the letter x out of each of the factors. (2) the terms involving x 3 are formed by taking the letter x out of any three factors, in every way possible, and one of the letters a, 6, c, d out of the remaining factor. (3) the terms involving x 2 are formed by taking the letter x out of any two factors, in every way possible, and two of the letters a, b, c, d out of the remaining factors. (4) the terms involving x are formed by taking the letter x out of any one factor, and three of the letters a, b, c, d out of the remaining factors. (5) the term independent of x is the product of all the letters «, b, c, d. . Example 1. (x - 2) (x + 3) (x - 5) (x + 9) = x 4 + (- 2 + 3 - 5 + 9) z 3 + (- 6 + 10 -18 -15 + 27 -45) a 2 + (30 - 54 + 90 - 135) x + 270 = x 4 + 5a; 3 - 47.<c 2 - 69z + 270. BINOMIAL THEOREM. POSITIVE INTEGRAL INDEX. 137 Example 2. Find the coefficient of x* in the product (x - 3) (* + 5) [x - 1) (x + 2) (x - 8). The terms involving x* are formed by multiplying together the x in any three of the factors, and two of the numerical quantities out of the two re- maining factors ; hence the coefficient is equal to the sum of the products of the quantities - 3, 5, -1,2, - 8 taken two at a time. Thus the required coefficient = -15 + 3- G + 2-1- 5 + 10-40- 2 + 8- 10 = -39. 1G2. If in equation (1) of the preceding article we suppose b=c=d=a, we obtain (x + a) 4 = x 4 + iax* + 6a V + 4a 3 as + a 4 . The method here exemplified of deducing a particular case from a more general result is one of frequent occurrence in Mathematics ; for it often happens that it is more easy to prove a general proposition than it is to prove a particular case of it. We shall in the next article employ the same method to prove a formula known as the Binomial Theorem, by which any binomial of the form x + a can be raised to any assigned positive integral power. 163. To find the expansion of (x + a) n ivhen n is a positive integer. Consider the expression (x + a) (x + b) (x + c) (x + k), the number of factors being n. The expansion of this expression is the continued product of the n factors, x + a, x + b, x + c, x + k, and every term in the expansion is, of n dimensions, being a product formed by multi- plying together n letters, one taken from each of these n factors. The highest power of x is x n , and is formed by taking the letter x from each of the n factors. The terms involving x n ~ l are formed by taking the letter x from any n—\\ of the factors, and one of the letters a, b, c, ... k from the remaining factor ; thus the coefficient of x n ~ 1 in the final product *is the sum of the letters a, b, c, k; denote it by^. The terms involving x n ~ 2 are formed by taking the letter x from any n — 2 of. the factors, and two of the letters a, b, c, ... k from the two remaining factors ; thus the coefficient of x n ~ in the final product is the sum of the products of the letters a, b, c, ... k taken two at a time; denote it by S 2 . 138 HIGHER ALGEBRA. And, generally, the terms involving x n ~ r are formed by taking the letter x from any n — r of the factors, and r of the letters a, b, c, ... k from the r remaining factors ; thus the coefficient of x\"~ r in the final product is the sum of the products of the letters a, b, c, ...k taken r at a time; denote it by S r . The last term in the product is abc ... k; denote it by S n . Hence (x + a)(x + b)(x + c) (x + k) = x n + Sx n ~ l + SjxT* + ••• + £ x\"~ r + ...+S ,x + S .12 r n— 1 n In $j the number of terms is n ; in S 2 the number of terms is the same as the number of combinations of n things 2 at a time ; that is, n C 2 ; in S 3 the number of terms is n C 3 ; and so on. Now suppose b, c, ... k, each equal to a; then S l becomes \"Ca: S, becomes \"C\\a 2 : S becomes \"Cjf: and so on: thus (x + a) n = x n + n C l ax n - 1 + n C 2 a 2 x n ~ 2 + \"C^aV\" 3 + . . . + \"Ca\" ; substituting for *C lt n C 2 , ... we obtain x» » «-i n(n—l) „ „_„ n(n — \\)(n—2) „ n „ (x+a) n = x\"+nax n l + - \\ — r-^oV J + v 1 /v — l a 3 x n 3 +... + a n , the series containing n+ 1 terms. This is the Binomial Theorem, and the expression on the right is said to be the expansion of (x + a)*. 164. The Binomial Theorem may also be proved as follows : By induction we can find the product of the n factors x + a, x + b, x + c, ...x + k as explained in Art. 158, Ex. 2; we can then deduce the expansion of (x + a) n as in Art. 163. 165. The coefficients in the expansion of (x + a)\" are very conveniently expressed by the symbols \"C,, \"C 2 , n C 3 , ... n C n . We shall, however, sometimes further abbreviate them by omitting n, and writing (7,, C 2 , C 3 , ... C n . With this notation we have (x + a) n = x\" + C x ax n ~ l + C 2 a 2 x n ~ 2 + C 3 a 3 x n ~ 3 + ... + Ca\\ If we write — a in the place of a, we obtain (x -a) n = x\" + C\\(- a) x n - l + C 2 (-a) 2 x n - 2 +C 3 (-a) 3 x n - 3 +... + C n (-a) n = x n - C,ax n ~ l + C„a 2 x n - 2 - C,a 3 x n ~ 3 + ... + (- IYG a\\ 1 2 3 \\ / n Thus the terms in the expansion of (x + a) n and (x — a) n are numerically the same, but in (x - a)' 1 they are alternately positive and negative, and the last term is positive or negative according as n is even or odd.

Example 3. Find the value of (a + Jtf^ly + (a- Ja- - 1)\". We have here the sum of two expansions whose terms are numerically the same ; but in the second expansion the second, fourth, sixth, and eighth terms are negative, and therefore destroy the corresponding terms of the first expansion. Hence the value = 2 {a 7 + 21a 5 (a 2 - 1) + 35a 3 (a 2 - l) 2 + la (a 2 - l) 3 } = 2a (64a 6 - 112a 4 + 56a 2 - 7 ). 166. In the expansion of (x + a) n , the coefficient of the second term is n C l ; of the third term is n G 2 ; of the fourth term is \"C 3 ; and so on ; the suffix in each term being one less than the number of the term to which it applies ; hence \"C r is the co- efficient of the (r + l) th terin. This is called the general term, because by giving to r different numerical values any of the coefficients may be found from n C r ; and by giving to x and a their appropriate indices any assigned term may be obtained. Thus the (r + l) th term may be written Cjrw, or »(»-l)(\"-2)-(» — +»,,-,„,. t In applying this formula to any particular case, it should 1><> observed that the index of a is the same as the svffix of C, and that the sum of the indices ofx and a is n. 140 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

The simplest form of the binomial theorem is the ex- pansion of (l+x) n . This is obtained from the general formula of Art. 163, by writing 1 in the place of x, and x in the place of a.

In Art. 163 we deduced the expansion of (x + «)\" from the product of n factors (x + a) (x + b) ... (x + k), and the method of proof there given is valuable in consequence of the wide gene- rality of the results obtained. But the following shorter proof of the Binomial Theorem should be noticed. It will be seen in Chap. xv. that a similar method is used to obtain the general term of the expansion of (a + b + c+ )\". 161). To prove the Binomial Theorem. The expansion of (x + a)' 1 is the product of n factors, each equal to x + a, and every term in the expansion is of n dimen- sions, being a product formed by multiplying together n letters, one taken from each of the n factors. Thus each term involving x\"~ r a r is obtained by taking a out of any r of the factors, and x out of the remaining n — r factors. Therefore the number of terms which involve x\"~ r a r must be equal to the number of ways in which r things can be selected out of n ; that is, the coellicient of x n ~ r cC is \"6' r , and by giving to r the values 0, 1, 2, 3, ... n in succession we obtain the coefficients of all the terms. Hence (x + a) n = x l 4- m C J X*- 1 a + n C,,x n -°-a 2 + . . . + n C r x\"-a r + ...+ a\", since *C and \"C n are each equal to unity. 142 HIGHER ALGEBRA. EXAMPLES. XIII. a.

[Art. 145.] Hence the proposition follows. 171. To find the greatest coefficient in the expansion of (l + x)» The coefficient of the general term of (1 +x)\" is m C r j and we have only to find for what value of r this is greatest. By Art. 154, when n is even, the greatest coefficient is \"C n ; i and when n is odd, it is \"C ,, or \"C , , ; these two coefficients 2 2 being equal. 172. To find the greatest term in the expansion of (x + a)\". We have (x + a)\" = x\" (l + -Y ; therefore, since x n multiplies every term in ( 1 + -j , it will be sufficient to find the greatest term in this latter expansion. 144 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

[Art. 166.1 r x \\ r J x L _ J Vh + ] The factor — 1 decreases as r increases ; hence the r (r+l) th term is not always greater than the r th term, but only until ( 1 ) - becomes equal to 1, or less than 1. \\ r J x + 1 Now — 1 - > 1 /n + 1 1 \\ a \\ r J x •j , n + 1 ., x so long as 1 > - ; a .. n + 1 x that is, > - + 1, r a or — — > r ( 1 ). a If — — be an integer, denote it by j> j then if r — ]) the - + 1 a multiplying factor becomes 1, and the (p + l) th term is equal to the /> th ; and these are greater than any other term. 71+1 If — — be not an integer, denote its integral part by q ; - + 1 a then the greatest value of r consistent with (1) is q\\ hence the (q + 1 ) th term is the greatest. Since we are only concerned with the numerically greatest term, the investigation will be the same for (x-a)\"; therefore in any numerical example it is unnecessary to consider the sign of the second term of the binomial. Also it will be found best to work each example independently of the general formula. BINOMIAL THEOREM. POSITIVE INTEGRAL INDEX. 1 to Example 1.

CHAPTER XIV. Binomial Theorem. Any Index. 177. In the last chapter we investigated the Binomial Theorem when the index was any positive integer; we shall now consider whether the formula? there obtained hold in the case of negative and fractional values of the index. Since, by Art. 167, every binomial may be reduced to one common type, it will be sufficient to confine our attention to binomials of the form (1 +x) n . By actual evolution, we have (1 + xf = V 1 + X = 1 + ^ X - - X 2 + yr. x 3 - ; and by actual division, (1 - x)~ 2 = 7^ - x - a = 1 + 2x + 3x* + ix 3 + : [Compare Ex. 1, Art. CO.] and in each of these series the number of terms is unlimited. In these cases we have by independent processes obtained an i expansion for each of the expressions (1 + x) 2 and (1 + x)~~. We shall presently prove that they are only particular cases of the general formula for the expansion of (1 + x) n , where it is any rational quantity. This formula was discovered by Newton. 178. Suppose we have two expressions arranged in ascending powers of x, such as , m (m - 1 ) „ m (m - 1 ) (m - 2) , I + mx+ v 'x-+ - x /x 'a?+ (I ). and l+n.v + - l g >x-+-± ] J K - a? + (2). 150 HIGHER ALGEBRA. The product of these two expressions will be a series in as- cending powers of x\\ denote it by 1+ Ax +Bx 2 + Cx 3 + Dx 4 + ; then it is clear that A, B, C, are functions of m and n, and therefore the actual values of A, B, C, in any particular case will depend upon the values of m and n in that case. But the way in which the coefficients of the powers of a; in (1) and (2) combine to give A, B, C, is quite independent of m and n ; in other words, whatever values in and n may have, A, B, C, preserve the same invariable form. If therefore we can determine the form of A, B, C, for any value of m and n, we conclude that A, B, C, will have the same form for all values of m and n. The principle here explained is often referred to as an example of \"the permanence of equivalent forms ; \" in the present case we have only to recognise the fact that in any algebraical product the form of the result will be the same whether the quantities in- volved are whole numbers, or fractions ; positive, or negative. We shall make use of this principle in the general proof of the Binomial Theorem for any index. The proof which Ave give is due to Euler. 179. To prove the Binomial Theorem ivhen the index is a positive fraction. Wliatever be the value of m, positive or negative, integral or fractional, let the symbol f(m) stand for the series , m (m - 1) „ m (m-Y) (m — 2) s 1 + mx + — y— ^ — -x- + — v ' v ' x 3 + ... ; then.y(n) will stand for the series - n(n — l)„ n(n — l)(n — 2) „ 1 + nx + \\ ' x 2 + v ' v '- x 3 + .... If we multiply these two series together the product will be another series in ascending powers of x, whose coefficients loill be unaltered inform whatever m and n may be. To determine this invariable form of the product we may give to m and n any values that are most convenient ; for this purpose suppose that m and n are positive integers. In this casey(m) is the expanded form of (1 + x) m , andy*(?i) is the expanded form of (1 +x) n ; and therefore BINOMIAL THEOREM.

( 1 + a;) = 1 + T x + x / x- + , « 1.2 which proves the Binomial Theorem for any positive fractional index. 152 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 180. To prove the Binomial Theorem when the index is any negative quantity. It has been proved that f(m) x/(w) =/(w* + n) for all values of m and n. Replacing in by — n (wliere n is positive), we have f(-n) •xf(n)=f(-n + 7i) =/(0) =% since all terms of the series except the first vanish ; •'• /hr /( - n) ' but/(w) = (l + x)'\\ for any positive value of n; or (1 + *)\"\" =/(-*)• But f(—n) stands for the series 1 + (- n) x + ^ '-f—, = ar + ; 1 . L ... (1 + «.)- = 1 + (_ W ) a. + (rg ) <\" \" \" *> g» + ; which proves the Binomial Theorem for any negative index. Hence the theorem is completely established. 181. The proof contained in the two preceding articles may not appear wholly satisfactory, and will probably present some dif- ficulties to the student. There is only one point to which we shall now refer. In the expression iov f(in) the number of terms is finite when vi is a positive integer, and unlimited in all other cases. See Art. 182. It is therefore necessary to enquire in what sense we BINOMIAL T11EOUEM. ANY INDEX. 153 are to regard the statement thaty(m) x/(n) =f(m + n). It a\\ ill be seen in Chapter xxi., that when x< 1, each of the series/^/), /( n )i/( m + n ) * s convergent, and/(m + «) is the true arithmetical equivalent of f(m) *f(n). But when sol, all these series are divergent, and we can only assert that if we multiply the series denoted by/(m) by the series denoted by f(u), the first r terms of the product will agree with the first r terms of f(m + n), whatever finite value r may have.

In finding the general term we must now. use the formula m(w-1)(w-2) (n-r + l) r x written in full ; for the symbol \"C r can no longer be employed when n is fractional or negative. Also the coefficient of the general term can never vanish unless one of the factors of its numerator is zero; the series will there- fore stop at the r th term, when n — r + 1 is zero ; that is, when r=oi+ l ; but since r is a positive integer this equality can never hold except when the index n is positive and integral. Thus the expansion by the Binomial Theorem extends to w+1 terms when n is a positive integer, and to an infinite number of terms in all other cases. 154 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 1 Example 1.

Suppose, for instance, that n — — l; then we have (1 -x)~ r = 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 + x* + (1); in this equation put x = 2 ; we then obtain (-l)~ 1 =l+2 + 2 2 + 2 3 + 2 4 + This contradictory result is sufficient to shew that we cannot take , n(n-l) l+nx+— \\ — ~— ' x 2 + as the true arithmetical equivalent of (1 + x) n in all cases. Now from the formula for the sum of a geometrical pro- gression, we know that the sum of the first r terms of the 1 - x r series (1) = -z v ' I —x 1 x r 1 - X 1 - x y and, when x is numerically less than 1, by taking r sufficiently x r large we can make ^ as small as we please ; that is, by taking a sufficient number of terms the sum can be made to differ as little as we please from ^ . But when x is numerically x r greater than 1, the value of ^ r increases with r. and therefore 1 - x no such approximation to the value of is obtained by taking JL vC any number of terms of the series 1 + X + X s + X 3 4- It will be seen in the chapter on Convergency and Diver- gency of Series that the expansion by the Binomial Theorem of (1+x)\" in ascending powers of a? is always arithmetically in- telligible when x is less than 1.

We may remark that we can always expand (x + y)\" by the Binomial Theorem ; for we may write the expression in either of the two following forms : x\" ('*!)'

Although the general term in the expansion of any binomial may always be found as explained in Art. 182, it will be found more expeditious in practice to use the above form of the general term in all cases where the index is negative, retaining the form n(n- l)(n-2) ...

If therefore we were required to find the numerical value of the given expression correct to 5 places of decimals it would be sufficient to substitute *002 for x in 1 + - x, neglect- o ing the term involving x 2 . Example 2.

From the result of Art. 190 we may deduce a theorem relating to the number of combinations of n things. Consider n letters a, b, c, d, ; then if we were to write down all the homogeneous products of r dimensions which can be formed of these letters and their powers, every such product would represent one of the combinations, r at a time, of the n letters, when any one of the letters might occur once, twice, thrice, ... up to r times. Therefore the number of combinations of n things r at a time when repetitions are allowed is equal to the number of homo- geneous products of r dimensions which can be formed out of n \\n + r — 1 letters, and therefore equal to , - , or n+r *C . \\r n—\\ T That is, the number of combinations of it things r at a time when repetitions are allowed is equal to the number of com- binations of n + r— 1 things r at a time when repetitions are excluded. 193.

We have already seen in Art. 175, how we may apply the Binomial Theorem to obtain the expansion of a multi- nomial expression. In the present chapter our object is not so much to obtain the complete expansion of a multinomial as to find the coefficient of any assigned term. Example. Find the coefficient of a 4 b\"c 3 d 5 in the expansion of (a + b + c + d) u . The expansion is the product of 14 factors each equal to a+b + c + d, and every term in the expansion is of 14 dimensions, being a product formed by taking one letter out of each of these factors. Thus to form the term a 4 b 2 c*d 5 , we take a out of any four of the fourteen factors, b out of any hco of the re- maining ten, c out of any three of the remaining eight. But the number of ways in which this can be done is clearly equal to the number of ways of ar- ranging 14 letters when four of them must be a, two 6, three c, and five d ; that is, equal to 114 A TT ralg . [Art. 151.] 412 3 5 L J This is therefore the number of times in which the term a 4 b 2 c*d 5 appears in the final product, and consequently the coefficient required is 2522520. 195. To find the coefficient of any assigned term in the ex- pansion of (a + b + c + cl + . ..) p , where p is a positive integer. The expansion is the product of p factors each equal to a + ft + c + cZ + ..., and every term in the expansion is formed by taking one letter out of each of these p factors ; and therefore the number of ways in which any term a a b^cyd 8 ... will appear in the final product is equal to the number of ways of arranging p letters when a of them must be a, (3 must be b, y must be c; and so on. That is, \\p the coefficient of a a bPcyd s ... is = — ~f~^ — , o p \\y 6 ... where a + j3 + y + S + ... =p. MULTINOMIAL THEOREM. 171 Cok.

(i), where a + p + y = \\). We have to obtain by trial all the positive integral values of /3 and 7 which satisfy the equation fi + 2y = 5; the values of a can then be found from the equation a + /3 + 7 = 9. Putting 7 = 2, we have /3 = 1, and a = G; putting 7 = 1, we have /3 = 3, and a = 5; putting 7 = 0, we have /3 = 5, and a = 4. The required coefficient will be the sum of the corresponding values of the expression (1). Therefore the coefficient required |9 19 19 = 252a 6 6c 2 + 5Q4a*&c + 12Ga 4 b\\ 19G. To find the general term in the expansion of (a + bx + ex 2 + clx 3 + . . .) n , vjhere n is any rational quantity. By the Binomial Theorem, the general term is n(n-l)(n-2)...(n-p + l) ( ,,_ v + rf + ^ + where jp is a positive integer 172 HIGHER ALGEBRA. And, by Art. 195, the general term of the expansion of (6a; + ex' + dx 3 + ...)'' \\P \\pjy_\\o_— where ft, y, 8 . . . are positive integers whose sum is p.

Logarithms. 199. Definition. The logarithm of any number to a given base is the index of the power to which the base must be raised in order to equal the given number. Thus if a x = JV, x is called the logarithm of N to the base a. Examples. (1) Since 3 4 = 81, the logarithm of 81 to base 3 is 4. (2) Since lO^lO, 10 2 = 100, 10 3 = 1000, the natural numbers 1, 2, 3,... are respectively the logarithms of 10, 100, 1000, to base 10. 200. The logarithm of iV to base a is usually written log a jy, so that the same meaning is expressed by the two equations a x = N; x = \\og a N. From these equations we deduce an identity which is sometimes useful. Example. Find the logarithm of 32 £/! to base 2 N /2. Let x be the required logarithm; then, by definition, (2 x /2)« = 32 4/4 ; 1 2 .-. (2. 2*)* = 2 s . 2* ; 3 2 .-. 2^ = 2 5 ^; 3 27 hence, by equating the indices, - x = - r ; .'. x = — = 3-6. o 176 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 201. When it is understood that a particular system of logarithms is in use, the suffix denoting the base is omitted. Thus in arithmetical calculations in which 10 is the base, we usually write log 2, log 3, instead of log 10 2, log l0 3, Any number might be taken as the base of logarithms, and corresponding to any such base a system of logarithms of all numbers could be found. But before discussing the logarithmic systems commonly used, we shall prove some general propositions which are true for all logarithms independently of any particular base. 202. TJie logarithm of 1 is 0. For a° = 1 for all values of a ; therefore log 1-0, whatever the base may be. 203. The logarithm of the base itself is 1. For a 1 = a ; therefore log a a = 1 . 201. To find the logarithm of a product. Let MN be the product; let a be the base of the system, and suppose a: = log. J/, y = \\og a J\\T; so that a* = M, a* = N. Thus the product MN==a x x a y = a x+y ; whence, by definition, log a MN = x + y = 100^1/\"+ low N. Similarly, \\og a 3INP = \\og a M+ log a iV+ log a P; and so on for any number of factors. Example. log 42 = log (2 x 3 x 7 ) = log2 + log3 + log7. 205. To find the logarithm of a fraction. M Let -zz be the fraction, and suppose x = \\og a M i 2/ = log a iT; so that a x = M t a y = N.

Logarithms to the base 10 are called Common Logar- ithms; this system was first introduced, in 1615, by Briggs, a contemporary of Napier the inventor of logarithms. From the equation 10 x - JV, it is evident that common logar- ithms \"will not in general be integral, and that they will not always be positive. For instance 3154 > 10 ' and < 10 4 ; ion. 12—2 .*. log 3151«=3 + a fraction. 180 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Again, -06 > 10~ 2 and < 10 _l ; .*. log *06 = - 2 + a fraction. 209. Definition. The integral part of a logarithm is called the characteristic, and the decimal part is called the mantissa. The characteristic of the logarithm of any number to the base 10 can be written down by inspection, as we shall now shew. 210. To determine the characteristic of the logarithm of any number greater than unity. Since 10 1 - 10, 10 2 =100, 10 3 -1000, it follows that a number with two digits in its integral part lies between 10' and 10 2 ; a number with three digits in its integral part lies between 10 2 and 10 3 ; and so on. Hence a number with n digits in its integral part lies between 10\" _I and 10\". Let N be a number whose integral part contains n digits; then J\\T— in(tt-l)+ a fraction . .*. log iV= (n — 1) + a fraction. Hence the characteristic is n — 1 \\ that is, the characteristic of the logarithm of a number greater than unity is less by one than the number of digits in its integral part, and is positive. 211. To determine the characteristic of the logarithm of a decimal fraction. Since 10°= 1, 1(rs =iJcr 01 ' 10-8 =i=' 001 > LOGARITHMS. 181 it follows that a decimal with one cipher immediately after the decimal point, such as -0324, being greater than -01 and less than -1, lies between 10~ 2 and 10 -1 ; a number with two ciphers after the decimal point lies between 10 _:i and 10\"\"; and so on. Hence a decimal fraction with n ciphers immediately after the decimal point lies between 10~ ( \" + 1) and 10~\". Let D be a decimal beginning with n ciphers ; thou /) _ 1 f)~(w + l) + fraction. .-. log J) = — (n + l) + n fraction. Hence the characteristic is - (n+ 1) ; that is, the characteristic of the logarithm of a decimal fraction is greater by unity titan the number of ciphers immediately after the decimal point, and is negative. 212. The logarithms to base 10 of all integers from 1 to 200000 have been found and tabulated j in most Tables they are given to seven places of decimals. This is the system in practical use, and it has two great advantages : (1) From the results already proved it is evident that the characteristics can be written down by inspection, so that only the mantissse have to be registered in the Tables. (2) The mantissse are the same for the logarithms of all numbers which have the same significant digits; so that it is sufficient to tabulate the mantissse of the logarithms of integers. This proposition we proceed to prove. 213. Let N be any number, then since multiplying or dividing by a power of 10 merely alters the position of the decimal point without changing the sequence of figures, it follows that N x 10''. and N -~ 10 7 , where p and q are any integers, are numbers whose significant digits are the same as those of N. Now log (N x 10 p ) = log N+p log 10 = log J\\ r +p (1 ). Again, log (A T - 1 9 ) - log N - q log 1 = logiV-7 (2). In (1) an integer is added to logiV^, and in (2) an integer is subtracted from log N ; that is, the mantissa or decimal portion of the logarithm remains unaltered. 182 HIGHER ALGEBRA. In this and the three preceding articles the mantissse have been supposed positive. In order to secure the advantages of Briggs' system, we arrange our work so as always to keep the mantissa positive, so that when the mantissa of any logarithm has been taken from the Tables the characteristic is prefixed with its appropriate sign according to the rules already given. 214. In the case of a negative logarithm the minus sign is written over the characteristic, and not before it, to indicate that the characteristic alone is negative, and not the whole expression. Thus 4-30103, the logarithm of -0002, is equivalent to -4 + -30103, and must be distinguished from — 4*30103, an expression in which both the integer and the decimal are negative. In working with negative logarithms an arithmetical artifice will sometimes be necessary in order to make the mantissa positive. For instance, a result such as - 3*69897, in which the whole expression is negative, may be transformed by subtracting 1 from the characteristic and adding 1 to the mantissa. Thus - 3-69897 - - 4 + (1 - -69897) = 4-30103. Other cases will be noticed in the Examples. Example 1. Required the logarithm of -0002432. In the Tables we find that 3859636 is the mantissa of log 2432 (the decimal point as well as the characteristic being omitted) ; and, by Art. 211, the characteristic of the logarithm of the given number is - 4 ; .-. log -0002432 = 4-3859636. Example 2. Find the value of ^-00000165, given log 165 = 2-2174839, log 697424=5-8434968. Let x denote the value required ; then I l log a- = l©g (-00000165) 5 = = log (-00000165) o = i (6-2174839) ; the mantissa of log -00000165 being the same as that of log 165, and the characteristic being prefixed by the rule. Now - (6-2174839) = - (10 + 4-2174839) = 2-8434968 LOGARITHMS. 183 and -8434908 is the mantissa of log 007424; hence x is a number consisting of these same digits but with one cipher after the decimal point. [Art. 211. J Thus a: = -0097424. 215. The method of calculating logarithms will be explained in the next chapter, and it will there be seen that they are first found to another base, and then transformed into common loga- rithms to base 10. It will therefore be necessary to investigate a method for transforming a system of logarithms having a given base to a new system with a different base. 216. Suppose that the logarithms of all numbers to base a are known and tabulated, it is required to find the logarithms to base b. Let N be any number whose logarithm to base b is re- quired. Let y = log 6 iV, so that b y = N ; •• log. (&\") = logJT; that is, ylog£ = log,JV; 1/ — r X log N. J log a 6 0u ' or k&^wK* 10 ^ C 1 )- 1U Oa° Now since N and b are given, los: N and log b are known from the Tables, and thus log^V may be found. Hence it appears that to transform logarithms from base a to base b we have only to multiply them all by ; this is a J r J J log b ' constant quantity and is given by the Tables; it is known as the modulus. 217. Tn equation (1) of the preceding article put a for N\\ thus . i , i On Oa log/t x log 8 /j = 1 . 184 HIGHER ALGEBRA. This result may also be proved directly as follows : Let x = log/?, so that a* = b ; then by taking logarithms to base b, we have x \\og b a = \\og b b .-. log a 6xlog 4 a = l. 218. The following examples will illustrate the utility of logarithms in facilitating arithmetical calculation ; but for in- formation as to the use of Logarithmic Tables the reader is referred to works on Trigonometry. 4 5 Example 1.

The student should notice that the logarithm of 5 and its powers can always be obtained from log 2 ; thus log 5 = log — = log 10 - log 2 = 1 - log 2. Example 2. Find the number of digits in 875 1C , given log 2 = -3010300, log 7 = -8450980. log (875 16 ) = 16 log (7x125) = 16 (log 7+ 3 log 5) = 16(log7 + 3-31og2) = 16x2-9420080 =47-072128; hence the number of digits is 48.

In the present chapter we shall prove certain formulae known as the Exponential and Logarithmic Series, and give a brief ex- planation of the way in which they are used in constructing a table of logarithms. 220.

The series ii 111 E + H + ~@ + ' which we have denoted by e, is very important as it is the base to which logarithms are first calculated. Logarithms to this base are known as the Napierian system, so named after Napier their inventor. They are also called natural logarithms from the fact that they are the first logarithms which naturally come into consideration in algebraical investigations. When logarithms are used in theoretical work it is to be remembered that the base e is always understood, just as in arithmetical work the base 10 is invariably employed.

We then find log(n+l) or log( w -l) and deduce the logarithm of the given number. ° Example. Calculate log 2 and log 3, given ^=-43429448.

CHAPTER XVIII. INTEREST AND ANNUITIES. 229. In this chapter we shall explain how the solution of questions connected with Interest and Discount may be simplified by the use of algebraical formulae. \"We shall use the terms Interest, Discount, Present Value in their ordinary arithmetical sense ; but instead of taking as the rate of interest the interest on ,£100 for one year, we shall find it more convenient to take the interest on £1 for one year. 230. To find the interest and amount of a given sum in a given time at simple interest. Let P be the principal in pounds, r the interest of £1 for one year, n the number of years, I the interest, and M the amount. The interest of P for one year is Pr, and therefore for n years is Pnr ; that is, / =Pnr (1). Also M = P + I; that is, M=P(l+nr) (2). From (1) and (2) we see that if of the quantities P, n, r, 7, or P, ?i, r, M, any three be given the fourth may be found. 231. To find the present value and discount of a given sum due in a given time, allowing simple interest. Let P be the given sum, V the present value, D the discount, r the interest of £1 for one year, n the number of years. I INTEREST AND ANNUITIES. 199 Since V is the sum which put out to interest at the present time will in u years amount to P, we have P= V(\\+nr); 1 + nr P And D = P - 1 + nr ' Pnr 1 + nr ' Note. The value of D given by this equation is called the true discount. But in practice when a sum of money is paid before it is due, it is customary to deduct the interest on the debt instead of the true discount, and the money so deducted is called the banker's discount; so that Banker's Discount = Pnr. Pnr True Discount = 1 + nr' Example. The difference between the true discount and the banker's discount on £1900 paid 4 months before it is due is 6s. 8d.; find the rate per cent., simple interest being allowed. Let r denote the interest on £1 for one year; then the banker's discount 1900r • 1900 '' i «. * a- * ~~ ^~ is — - — , and the true discount is i* 1900r 1900r ~3~ 1 \"\"• ~3~ 7~T~3 ; l +i r whence 1900r 2 =3 + >-; 1 ±Jl + 22800 _ 1±151 *'• r ~ 3800 ~ 3800 ' t, • • . , 152 1 Rejecting the negative value, we nave f—aSui = o? « .-. rate per cent. = 100r = 4. 232. To find the interest and amount of a given sum in a given time at compound interest. Let P denote the principal, 7? the amount of £1 in one year, n the number of years, I the interest, and M the amount. 200 HIGHER ALGEBRA. The amount of P at the end of the first year is PR ; and, since this is the principal for the second year, the amount at the end of the second year is PR x R or PR 2 . Similarly the amount at the end of the third year is PR 3 , and so on ; hence the amount in n years is PR\" \\ that is, M=PR\"; .'. I=P(R n -l). Note. If r denote the interest on £1 for one year, we have R = l+r. 233. In business transactions when the time contains a fraction of a year it is usual to allow simjyle interest for the fraction of the year. Thus the amount of ,£1 in ^ year is v reckoned 1 + - ; and the amount of P in 4f years at compound interest is PR* (1 + ^ r J . Similarly the amount of P in n + — years is PR\" (In — ) . m \\ m/ If the interest is payable more than once a year there is a distinction between the nominal annual rate of interest and that actually received, which may be called the true annual rate ; thus if the interest is payable twice a year, and if r is the nominal r annual rate of interest, the amount of £1 in half a year is 1 +-^ , and therefore in the whole year the amount of <£1 is (1 + -J, r 2 or 1 + r + — ; so that the true annual rate of interest is 4 r 2 234. If the interest is payable q times a year, and if r is the nominal annual rate, the interest on .£1 for each interval is r - , and therefore the amount of P in n years, or qn intervals, is In this case the interest is said to be \"converted into principal\" (f times a year. INTEREST AND ANNUITIES. 201 If the interest is convertible into principal every moment, then q becomes infinitely great. To find the value of the amount, r 1 put - = — , so that q - rx : thus q x the amount = P (l +-Y =P(l + -Y\" = P {(l + i)T' = Pe nr , [Art. 220, Cor.,] since x is infinite when q is infinite. 235. To find the present value and discount of a given stun due in a given time, allowing comjwund interest. Let P be the given sum, V the present value, D the discount, R the amount of £1 for one year, n the number of years. Since V is the sum which, put out to interest at the present time, will in n years amount to P, we have P=VR n ', it and D = P(l-R-). Example. The present value of £672 due in a certain time is £126; if compound interest at 4£ per cent, be allowed, find the time; having given log 2 = -30103, log 3 = -47712. Here Hol) = iI' *»**=!'

An annuity is a fixed sum paid periodically under certain stated conditions ; the payment may be made either once a year or at more frequent intervals. Unless it is otherwise stated we shall suppose the payments annual. An annuity certain is an annuity payable for a fixed term of years independent of any contingency ; a life annuity is an annuity which is payable during the lifetime of a person, or of the survivor of a number of persons. INTEREST AND ANNUITIES. 203 A deferred annuity, or reversion, is an annuity which does not begin until after the lapse of a certain number of years ; and when the annuity is deferred for n years, it is said to commence after n years, and the first payment is made at the end of n + 1 years. If the annuity is to continue for ever it is called a perpetuity ; if it does not commence at once it is called a deferred perpetuity. An annuity left unpaid for a certain number of years is said to be forborne for that number of years. 237. To find the amount of an annuity left unpaid for a given number of years, allowing simple interest. Let A be the annuity, r the interest of £1 for one year, n the number of years, M the amount. At the end of the first year A is due, and the amount of this sum in the remaining n - 1 years is A + (n — 1) rA ; at the end of the second year another A is due, and the amount of this sum in the remaining (a— 2) years is A + (ii — 2) rA • and so on. Now M is the sum of all these amounts ; .-. M={A + (n-l)rA} + {A + (n-2)rA} + + (A + rA) + A, the series consisting of n terms ; .-. J/=Wil+(l + 2 + 3+ +n-l)rA = nA + — K— — '- rA. 238.

In finding the present value of annuities it is always customary to reckon compound interest; the results obtained when simple interest is reckoned being contradictory and un- trustworthy. On this point and for further information on the subject of annuities the reader may consult Jones on the Value of Annuities and Reversionary Payments, and the article Annuities in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. 240. To find t/ie present value of an annuity to continue for a (jiven number of years, allowing compound interest. Let A be the annuity, R the amount of £>\\ in one year, n the number of years, V the required present value. The present value of A due in 1 year is AR~ l ; the present value of A due in 2 years is AR~' J ; the present value of A due in 3 years is AR~ 3 ; and so on. [Art. 235.] Now V is the sum of the present values of the different payments ; .-. V=AR- 1 +AR- 3 + AK- 3 + tow terms 1 - R~\" = AR~ l = A l-R- 1 1-R-\" R-l Note. This result may also be obtained by dividing the value of M, given in Art. 238, by R n . [Art. 232.] Cor. If we make n infinite we obtain for the present value of a perpetuity R-V r ' 241. If mA is the present value of an annuity A, the annuity is said to be worth m years' purchase. In the case of a perpetual annuity mA — — ; hence 1 100 m = - = r rate per cent. INTEREST AND ANNUITIES. 205 that is, the number of years' purchase of a perpetual annuity is obtained by dividing 100 by the rate per cent. As instances of perpetual annuities we may mention the income arising from investments in irredeemable Stocks such as many Government Securities, Corporation Stocks, and Railway Debentures. A good test of the credit of a Government is fur- nished by the number of years' purchase of its Stocks ; thus the 2| p. c. Consols at 96} are worth 35 years' purchase ; Egyptian 4 p. c. Stock at 96 is worth 24 years' purchase ; while Austrian 5 p. c. Stock at 80 is only worth 16 years' purchase. 242. To find the present value of a deferred annuity to commence at the end of p years and to continue for n years, allow- ing compound interest. Let A be the annuity, R the amount of £1 in one year, V the present value. The first payment is made at the end of (;> + l) years. [Art. 236.] Hence the present values of the first, second, third... pay- ments are respectively AR- { * +l \\ AR- (p+2 \\ AR- (p+3 \\ ... .'.

A freehold estate is an estate which yields a perpetual annuity called the rent ; and thus the value of the estate is equal to the present value of a perpetuity equal to the rent. It follows from Art. 241 that if we know the number of years' purchase that a tenant pays in order to buy his farm, we obtain the rate per cent, at which interest is reckoned by dividing 100 by the number of years' purchase. 206 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. The reversion after 6 years of a freehold estate is bought for £20000; what rent ought the purchaser to receive, reckoning compound interest at 5 per cent. ? Given log 1-05 = -0211893, log 1-340096 = -1271358. The rent is equal to the annual value of the perpetuity, deferred for 6 years, which may be purchased for £20000. ' Let £A be the value of the annuity; then since .R = l-05, we have 20000^* ^° 5 '- 6 ; •0o .-. A x (1-05) ~ 6 = 1000; log A -6 log 1-05 = 3, log A = 3-1271358 = log 1340-09G. .-. A = 1310-096, and the rent is £1340. Is. lid. 244. Suppose that a tenant by paying down a certain sum lias obtained a lease of an estate for p + q years, and that when q years have elapsed he wishes to renew the lease for a term p + n years ; the sum that he must pay is called the fine for renewing n years of the lease. Let A be the annual value of the estate ; then since the tenant has paid for p of the p + n years, the fine must be equal to the present value of a deferred annuity A, to commence after p years and to continue for n years ; that is, . n AR-* AR- p ~ n r 4 the fine = -= — .

CHAPTER XIX. INEQUALITIES. 245. Any quantity a is said to be greater than another quantity b when a -b is positive; thus 2 is greater than -3, because 2 - (- 3), or 5 is positive. Also b is said to be less than a when b- a is negative; thus -5 is less than -2, because — 5— (— 2), or - 3 is negative. In accordance with this definition, zero must be regarded as greater than any negative quantity. In the present chapter we shall suppose (unless the contrary is directly stated) that the letters always denote real and positive quantities. 246. If a > b, then it is evident that a + c > b + c ; a — c > b — c ; ac > be ; a b that is, an inequality will still hold after each side has been increased, diminished, multiplied, or divided by the same positive quantity. 247. If a-ob, by adding c to each side, a>b+ c; which shews that in an inequality any term may be transposed from one side to the other if its sign be changed. If a > b, then evidently b < a ; that is, if the sides of an inequality be transposed, the sign of inequality must be reversed. INEQUALITIES. 209 If a > b, then a - b is positive, and b-a is negative; that is, — a — (— b) is negative, and therefore — a < — b ; hence, if the signs of all the terms of an inequality be changed, the sign of inequality must be reversed. Again, if a > b, then —a < — b, and therefore — ac < — be ; that is, if the sides of an inequality be multiplied by the same negative quantity, the sign of inequality must be reversed. 248. If a.>b,, a. > b oi a^>b.,, a >b , it is clear that a l + a 2 + a 3 +...+ a m > 6, + b^+b a + ... + b m ; and a : a 2 a ,--' a ,n >h AK-'- b , > r 249. If a>b, and if p, q are positive integers, then ^/a>^Jb, 11 V V or a 1 > b 9 ; and therefore a' 1 > b' ; that is, a' 1 > b'\\ where n is any positive quantity. Further, — < =- ; that is a~ n < b~\". 250. The square of every real quantity is positive, and therefore greater than zero. Thus (a - b) 2 is positive ; . . a 2 — 2ab + b 2 > ; . • . a 2 + b 2 > 2ab. Similarly -— ^ > Jxy ; that is, the arithmetic mean of tivo positive quantities is greater than their geometric mean. The inequality becomes an equality when the quantities are equal. 251. The results of the preceding article will be found very useful, especially in the case of inequalities in which the letters are involved symmetrically. H. H. A. li 210 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 1. If a, b, c denote positive quantities, prove that a 2 + b 2 +c 2 >bc + ca + ab; and 2 (a 3 + b 3 + c 3 )>bc (b + c) + ca(c + a) + ab (a + b). For & 2 + c 2 >2bc (1); c 2 + a 2 >2c«; a 2 + b 2 >2al); whence by addition a 2 + b 2 + c 2 > be + ca + a&. It may be noticed that this result is true for any real values of a, b, c. Again, from (1) b 2 -bc + c 2 >bc (2); .-. b 3 + c 3 >bc(b+c) (3). By writing down the two similar inequalities and adding, we obtain 2 (a 3 + b 3 + c 3 ) > be (b + c) + ca [c + a) + ab{a+b). It should be observed that (3) is obtained from (2) by introducing the factor b + c, and that if this factor be negative the inequality (3) will no longer hold. Example 2. If x may have any real value find which is the greater, .r 3 +l or x 2 + x. x 3 +l- (x 2 + x) =x 3 - x 2 - (x - 1) = (x 2 -l)(x-l) = (.r-l) 2 (* + l). Now [x - l) 2 is positive, hence x 3 + 1 > or < x 2 + x according as x + 1 is positive or negative; that is, according as x > or < - 1. If x— - 1, the inequality becomes an equality. 252. Let a and b be two positive quantities, $ their sum and P their product ; then from the identity 4a6 = (a + bf - (a - b)\\ we have iP = S 2 - (a - b) 2 , and S 2 = ±P+(a- b) 2 . Hence, if S is given, P is greatest when a — b\\ and if P is given, S is least when a= b; that is, if the sum of two positive quantities is given, their product is greatest when they are equal ; and if the product of two positive quantities is given, their sum is least when they are equal. INEQUALITIES. 211 253. To find the greatest value of a product the sum of whose factors is constant. Let there be n factors a, b, c, ... k, and suppose that their sum is constant and equal to s. Consider the product abc ... k, and suppose that a and b are any two unequal factors. If we replace the two unequal factors Tii ii> a + b a + b , , .. , a, b by the two equal factors — — , -— — the product is increased while the sum remains unaltered ; hence so long as the product contains two unequal factors it can be increased tvithout altering the sum of the factors ; therefore the product is greatest when all the factors are equal. In this case the value of each of the n s /s\\\" factors is - , and the greatest value of the product is ( - ) , n \\nj /a + b + c + ... +k\\ \\ n ) or \\n/ ' a + b + c+ ... +k\\\" Cor. If «, b, c, ... k are uneqiud, /a + b + c + ... +k\\ n 7 7 ( ) > abc ... k ; \\ n J that is, a + b + c+ ... + k n > (abc ... k)\". By an extension of the meaning of the terms arithmetic mean and geometric mean this result is usually quoted as follows : the arithmetic mean of any number of positive quantities is greater than the geometric mean. Example. Shew that (l r + 2 r + S r + . . . + n r ) n > n n ( \\nY ; where r is any real quantity. c . lr + 2 r+Zr + +n r 1 Since >(l r .2 r .3 r « r )' 1 ; n .'. ( ) >l r .2 r .3 r n r , that is, >(|») r ; whence wo obtain the result required. 14—2 212 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 254. To find the greatest value q/'a m b\"c p . . . when a + b + c + ... is constant; m, n, p, ... being positive integers. Since m, n, p,... are constants, the expression a m b n c p ... will be greatest when ( — ) (-) ( - ) ... is greatest. But this last & \\mj \\nj \\pj & expression is the product of m + n + p + ... factors whose sum is m ( — )+ n (—) + p ( — ) + .. ., or a + b + c + . . ., and therefore con- \\mj \\nj * \\pj stant. Hence a m b n c p ... will be greatest when the factors a o c ni n p are all equal, that is, when a b c a + b + c + m n p m+n+p + Thus the greatest value is /a + b + c+ ...\\ M4 * 4 * + \" m m n n p p . . . ( ) Example. Find the greatest value of (a + x) s (a -a:) 4 for any real value of x numerically less than a. The given expression is greatest when ( — — J ( — j— j is greatest ; but the sum of the factors of this expression is 3 ( —^- J + 4 I — ^— ) , or 2a; hence {a + x) 3 (a - x)* is greatest when — ^— = — ^— , or x= - - . 6 3 . 8 4 Thus the greatest value is * a 7 . 255. The determination of maximum and minimum values may often be more simply effected by the solution of a quad- ratic equation than by the foregoing methods. Instances of this have already occurred in Chap. ix. ; we add a further illustration. Example. Divide an odd integer into two integral parts whose product is a maximum. Denote the integer by 2/i + 1 ; the two parts by x and 2n + 1 - x ; and the product by y ; then (2n + 1) x - x* = y ; whence 2x = (2n + 1) ± V^h + I) 2 -^ ; INEQUALITIES. 213 but the quantity under the radical must be positive, and therefore y cannot11 be greater than - (2/t + l) 2 , or n' 2 + n + - ; and since y is integral its greatest value must be n- + n\\ in which case x = n+ 1, or n ; thus the two parts are n and n+1. 256. Sometimes we may use the following method. Example. Find the minimum value of ' — ' — ' . c + x Put c+x=y ; then .. . (a-c + y){b-c + y) the expression = ^-^ - y _ (a - c) (b - c) +y+a-c+b-c ( a ~ C Jy b ~ C) -^yy + a-c + b-c + 2j (a-c)(b-c) . Hence the expression is a minimum when the square term is zero ; that is when y=J(a -c)(b- c). Thus the minimum value is a-c + b-c + 2 *J(a - c) (b - c) ; and the corresponding value of x is */(« - c) {b - c) -c. EXAMPLES. XIX. a. 1. Prove that (ab + xy) (ax + by) > 4abxy. 2.

CHAPTER XX. LIMITING VALUES AND VANISHING FRACTIONS. a 262. If a be a constant finite quantity, the fraction -- can x be made as small as we please by sufficiently increasing x ; that a is, we can make - approximate to zero as nearly as we please by taking x large enough ; this is usually abbreviated by saying, \" when x is infinite the limit of - is zero.\" x Again, the fraction - increases as x decreases, and by making x x as small as we please we can make as large as we please ; x thus when x is zero - has no finite limit; this is usually ex- JO pressed by saying, \" when x is zero the limit of - is infinite.\" 263. When we say that a quantity increases without limit or is infinite, we mean that we can suppose the quantity to become greater than any quantity we can name. Similarly when we say that a quantity decreases without limit, we mean that we can suppose the quantity to become smaller than any quantity we can name. The symbol go is used to denote the value of any quantity which is indefinitely increased, and the symbol is used to denote the value of any quantity which is indefinitely dimi- nished. LIMITING VALUES. 221 204. The two statements of Art. 2G2 may now be written symbolically as follows : if x is co , then - is ; x if x is , then is co . x But in making use of such concise modes of expression, it must be remembered that they are only convenient abbreviations of fuller verbal statements. 26~>. The student will have had no difficulty in understanding the use of the word limit, wherever we have already employed it; but as a clear conception of the ideas conveyed by the words limit and limiting value is necessary in the higher branches of Mathematics we proceed to explain more precisely their use and meaning. 266. Definition. If y =f(x), and if when x approaches a value a, the function f(x) can be made to differ by as little as we please from a fixed quantity b, then b is called the limit of y when x — a. For instance, if S denote the sum of n terms of the series 1+2 + 2 2 + 2~ J + '\" ; then ' S ' = 2 ~2^- t Art 56 *1 Here S is a function of n, and ^— , can be made as small as we please by increasing n ; that is, the limit of S is 2 when n is infinite. 267. We shall often have occasion to deal with expressions consisting of a series of terms arranged according to powers of some common letter, such as a + a x x + a a x\" + a 3 x 3 + where the coefficients o , a,, a 2 , a 3 , ... are finite quantities independent of x, and the number of terms may be limited or unlimited. It will therefore be convenient to discuss some propositions connected with the limiting values of such expressions under certain conditions. 222 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 268. The limit of the series a + a x x + a 2 x 2 + a 3 x 3 + when x is indefinitely diminished is a . Suppose that the series consists of an infinite number of terms. Let b be the greatest of the coefficients a lf a si o 3 , ... ; and let us denote the given series by a + S ; then S<bx + bx 2 + bx 3 + ... ; bx and if x < 1 , we have S < -= . 1 — x Thus when x is indefinitely diminished, S can be made as small as we please ; hence the limit of the given series is a . If the series consists of a finite number of terms, S is less than in the case we have considered, hence a fortiori the pro- position is true. 269. In the series ,3 a + a,x + a 2 x + a 3 x + . . . , by taking x small enough ive may make any term as large as we please compared with the sum of all that follow it ; and by taking x large enough we may make any term as large as we please compared with the sum of all that precede it. The ratio of the term a x n to the sum of all that follow n it is a x n a or a n+1 x n+l +a n+2 x\" + ' 2 + ... ' a n+1 x + a u+2 x*+.. When x is indefinitely small the denominator can be made as small as we please ; that is, the fraction can be made as large as we please. Again, the ratio of the term a n x n to the sum of all that precede it is a x n a or a ,cc n l +a »x n 2 +...' a ,y + a a y 2 +...' n—l n — 2 n — lts n—2<J where y = - . u x LIMITING VALUES. 223 When x is indefinitely largo, y is indefinitely small ; hence, as in the previous case, the fraction can be made as large as we please. 270. The following particular form of the foregoing pro- position is very useful. In the expression H-i a x + a ,x + + a.x + a , ii H — 1 1 » consisting of a finite number of terms in descending powers of x, by taking x small enough the last term a can be made as large as we please compared with the sum of all the terms that precede it, and by taking x large enough the first term ax* can be made as large as we please compared with the sum of all that follow it. Example 1. By taking n large enough we can make the first term of n 4 - 5/i 3 -7/i + 9 as large as we please compared with the sum of all the other terms ; that is, we may take the first term ?i 4 as the equivalent of the whole expression, with an error as small as we please provided n be taken large enough. 3.t 3 — 2x' 2 — 4 Example 2.

Sometimes the roots of an equation assume an in- determinate form in consequence of some relation subsisting between the coefficients of the equation. H. H. A. lo 226 HIGHER ALGEBRA. For example, if ax + b = ex + d, (a — c)x = d — b, d-b x = a — c But if c = a, then x becomes — j- — , or go ; that is, the root of a simple equation is indefinitely great if the coefficient of x is indefinitely small. 274. The solution of the equations ax + by + c = 0, a'x + b'y + c = 0, be' - b'e ca' — c'a ab' — ab 1 ab'-a'b ' If ab' — a'b = 0, then x and y are both infinite.

If — is equal to c. we have -=-=-, and the two equations m ^ a b c are now identical. Here, since be — b'e = and ca' — c'a — the values of x and y Q each assume the form - , and the solution is indeterminate. In fact, in the present case we have really only one equation involving two unknowns, and such an equation may be satisfied by an unlimited number of values.

VANISHING FHACTIONS. 227 275. We shall now discuss some peculiarities which may arise in the solution of a quadratic equation. Let the equation be ax 2 + bx + c - 0. If c = 0, then ax 2 + bx = 0; whence x = 0, or — : a that is, one of the roots is zero and the other is finite. If 6 = 0, the roots are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. [Art. 118.] If a = 0, the equation reduces to bx + c = ; and it appears that in this case the quadratic furnishes only one root, namely — =- . But every quadratic equation has two roots, and in order to discuss the value of the other root we proceed as follows. Write — for x in the original equation and clear of fractions ; *J thus cy 2 + by + a = 0. Now put a = 0, and we have cy 2 + by = 0; b c the solution of which is y — 0, or — ; that is, x = oo, or — T . J c> ' b Hence, in any quadratic equation one root will become infinite if the coefficient ofx 2 becomes zero. This is the form in which the result will be most frequently met with in other branches of higher Mathematics, but the student should notice that it is merely a convenient abbreviation of the following fuller statement : In the equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0, if a is very small one root is very large, and as a is indefinitely diminished this root becomes indefinitely great. In this case the finite root approximates to -y as its limit. o The cases in which more than one of the coefficients vanish may be discussed in a similar manner. 15—2 228 HIGHER ALGEBRA. EXAMPLES.

In the preset chapter we shall usually denote a series by an expression c- ° ue form u x + n 2 + i/- 3 + + u + / Suppose that we have a series consisting of w terms. The sum of the series will be a function of n; if n increases indetinitely, the sum either tends to become equal to a certain finite fcmi*, or else it becomes infinitely great. An infinite series is said to be convergent when the sum of the first n terms cannot numerically exceed some finite quantity however great n may be. An infinite series is said to be divergent when the sum of the first n terms can be made numerically greater than any finite quantity by taking n sufficiently great. 978 If we can find the sum of the first n terms of a given series we may ascertain whether it is convergent or divergent W examining whether the series remains finite, or becomes in- finite, when n is made indefinitely great. For example, the sum of the first n terms of the series . 1-*\" 1 + x + x 2 + x* + ... is . _ a . • 230 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

From (1) we see that the sum of any number of terms is a positive quantity; and from (2) that the sum of any nnmber of terms is less than «, ; hence the series is convergent. CONVEltGENCY AND DIVERGENCE OF SERIES. 231 281. For example, the series , 11111 1 f- 1 h 2 3 4 5 6 is convergent. By putting x -• 1 in Art. 223, we see that its sum is log e 2. Again, in the series 23 4 _5 6 _7 T~2 + 3\"4 + 5 ~6 + ' each term is numerically less than the preceding term, and the series is therefore convergent. But the given series is the sum of i 11111 m 1 -2 + 3-4 + 5\"6 + ' (1) ' and 1-1+1-1 + 1-1 + , (2). Now (1) is equal to log e 2, and (2) is equal to or 1 according' as the number of terms is even or odd. Hence the given series is convergent, and its sum continually approximates towards log,, 2 if an even number of terms is taken, and towards 1 + log 8 2 if an odd number is taken. 282. An infinite seizes in which all the terms are of the same sign is divergent \\f each term is greater than some finite quantity however small. For if each term is greater than some finite quantity a, the sum of the first n terms is greater than na ; and this, by taking n sufficiently great, can be made to exceed any finite quantity. 283. Before proceeding to investigate further tests of con- vergency and divergency, we shall lay down two important principles, which may almost be regarded as axioms. I. If a series is convergent it will remain convergent, and if divergent it will remain divergent, when we add or remove any finite number of its terms ; for the sum of these terms is a finite quantity. II. If a series in which all the terms are positive is con- vergent, then the series is convergent when some or all of the terms are negative ; for the sum is clearly greatest when all the terms have the same sign. We shall suppose that all the terms are positive, unless the contrary is stated. 232 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 284. An infinite series is convergent if from and after some fixed term the ratio of each term to the preceding term is numerically less than some quantity zuhich is itself numerically less than unity. Let the series beginning from the fixed term be denoted by u, + u c> + u^ + u^ + 12 3 4 U U 1 U A and let — < r, — < r, -* < r U : U 2 U s where r < 1. Then u, +u r , + u+u A + 12 3 4 /_. u 9 u. u a n u u 1 V ^ <f a u x u 3 u 2 Ul 1 < it, (1 + r + r 2 + r 3 + ) ; tliat is, < ~ 1 , since r < 1. 1 - r u. Hence the given series is convergent. 285. In the enunciation of the preceding article the student should notice the significance of the words \" from and after a fixed term.\" Consider the 1 CONVERGENCY AND DIVERGENCY OF SERIES. '2Xi 286. An infinite series in which all the terms are of the same sign is diverge) it if from and after some fixed term the ratio of ea<-li term to the 'preceding term is greater than unify, or equal to unify. Let the fixed term be denoted by t* . If the ratio is equal to unity, each of the succeeding terms is equal to u , and the sum of n terms is equal to nu l ; hence the series is divergent. If the ratio is greater than unity, each of the terms after the fixed term is greater than u x , and the sum of n terms is greater than nu } ; hence the series is divergent. 287. In the practical application of these tests, to avoid having to ascertain the particular term after which each term is greater or less than the preceding term, it is convenient to find the limit of — - when n is indefinitely increased; let this limit n—\\ be denoted by A. If X< 1, the series is convergent. [Art. 284.] If \\> 1, the series is divergent. [Art. 286.] If X=l, the series may be either convergent or divergent, and a further test will be required ; for it may happen that — — < 1 but continually approaching to 1 as its limit ivhen n is n — 1 m indefinitely increased. In this case we cannot name any finite quantity r which is itself less than 1 and yet greater than X. u Hence the test of Art. 284 fails. If, however, — — > 1 but con- u H — I tinually approaching to 1 as its limit, the series is divergent by Art. 286. We shall use \" Liin — — \" as an abbreviation of the words u , n — 1 U \"the limit of — — when n is infinite.\" u . n — 1 Example 1.

[See Art. 60, Cor.] 288. If there are two infinite series in each of which all the terms are ])Ositive, and if the ratio of the corresponding terms in the two series is always finite, the two series are both convergent, or both divergent. Let the two infinite series be denoted by u x + u a + u a + w 4 + , and v, + v, + v, + v. + 12 3 4 The value of the fraction u i + u , + u a^ +n n lies between the greatest and least of the fractions \\ -*, -», [Art. 14.1 and is therefore a, finite quantity, L say ; Hence if one series is finite in value, so is the other; if one series is infinite in value, so is the other; which proves the proposition. CONVERGENCY AND DIVERGENCY OF SERIES. 235 289. The application of this principle is very important, for by means of it we can compare a given series with an auxiliary series whose convergency or divergency has been already esta- blished. The series discussed in the next article will frequently be found useful as an auxiliary series. 290. The infinite series 1111 y T 2 P 3 P 4.1' is always divergent except when p is positive and greater than 1. Case I. Let;? > 1. The first term is 1 ; the next two terms together are less than 2 . 4 j—; the following four terms together are less than-—; the fol- Z 4 lowing eight terms together are less than — ; and so on. Hence o 2 4 8 the series is less than I + t^+th+ttt, +•••; 2 P 4' o 1 that is, less than a geometrical progression whose common ratio 2 ~j is less than 1, since p > 1 ; hence the series is convergent. Case II. Let_p=l. The series now becomes 1 + ^ + -^ + - + =;+ ... 2 3 4 5 2 1 The third and fourth terms together are greater than - or ^ ; t — 4 1 the following four terms together are greater thau ^ or - ; the o 2 8 1 following eight terms together are greater than — or - ; and so on. Hence the series is greater than 1111 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + '\"' and is therefore divergent. [Art. 2^6.] Case III. Let p<\\, or negative. Each term is now greater than the corresponding term in Case II., therefore the series is divergent. Hence the series is always divergent except in the case when p is positive and greater than unity. 236 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. Prove that the series 2 3 4 n+1 is divergent.

But the auxiliary series is divergent, therefore also the given series is divergent. This completes the solution of Example 1. Art. 287. 291. In the application of Art. 288 it is necessary that the limit of — should be finite ; this will be the case if we find our auxiliary series in the following way : Take u , the n th term of the given series and retain only the highest powers of n. Denote the result by v n ) then the limit of u - is finite by Art. 270, and v may be taken as the 7i th term of the auxiliary series. 3/2n 2 - 1 Example 1.

It is sometimes necessary to determine whether the product of an infinite number of factors is finite or not. Suppose the product to consist of n factors and to be denoted by uMAia io ; then if as n increases indefinitely u <<1, the product will ulti- mately be zero, and if u n > 1 the product will be infinite ; hence in order that the product may be finite, u- must tend to the limit 1 .

Now log« n = log (l -^)=- ~ ^32/i- 1 '•' therefore as in Ex. 2, Art. 291 the series is convergent, and the given product is finite. 297. In mathematical investigations infinite series occur so frequently that the necessity of determining their convergency or divergency is very important ; and unless we take care that the series we use are convergent, we may be led to absurd conclusions. [See Art. 183.] 240 HIGHER ALGEBRA. For example, if we expand (l—x)~ 2 by the Binomial Theorem, we find ( 1 - a;)- 2 = 1 + 2x + 3ar + 4a 3 + But if we obtain the sum of n terms of this series as ex- plained in Art. 60, it appears that in O 9 n-l * ^ ^^ 1 + 2.*; + 3ar + ... + nx = t= r a — = : (1 - x) 1 - x whence I +'2x+ 3x~ + ... + nx 4- 7 z ^ + (l-x) 2 -'—'— - (1-a?) 9 1-* i By making n infinite, we see that -z - a can only be re- J ° (l-x) 2 garded as the true equivalent of the infinite series 1 + 2x + 3x 2 + ix 3 + x nx when -rz ri + =— vanishes. (1 -x)~ l-x If n is infinite, this quantity becomes infinite when x=l, or aj>l, and diminishes indefinitely when a,*<l, [Art. 295], so that it is only when x < 1 that we can assert that \\ Ta =* 1 + 2x + 3x 2 + 4# 3 + to inf. j and we should be led to erroneous conclusions if we were to use the expansion of (1 - x)~ 2 by the Binomial Theorem as if it were true for all values of x. In other words, we can introduce the infinite series 1 + 2x + 3x 2 + ... into our reasoning without error if the series is convergent, but we cannot do so when the series is divergent. The difficulties of divergent series have compelled a distinction to be made between a series and its algebraical equivalent. For example, if we divide 1 by (1 - x) 2 , we can always obtain as many terms as we please of the series l + 2a;+3£ 2 +4a; 3 + whatever x may be, and so in a certain sense -p. ^ niay be called its algebraical equivalent ; yet, as we have seen, the equi- valence does not really exist except when the series is con- CONVERGENCY AND DIVERGENCY OF SERIES. 241 vergent. It is therefore more appropriate to speak of — — (l — X) as the generating function of the series 1 +2a,- + 3a 2 + being that function which Avhen developed by ordinary alge- braical rules will give the series in question.

We have seen in Art. 287 that a series is convergent or divergent according as the limit of the ratio of the ?i th term to the 'preceding term is less than 1, or greater than 1. In the remainder of the chapter we shall find it more convenient to use this test in the equivalent form : A series is convergent or divergent according as the limit of the ratio of the n th term to the succeeding term is greater than 1, or less than 1 ; that is, according as Lim — — > 1, or < 1.

In the first series let us consider the terms </>(«*+ 1), <f>(a k + 2), <f>(a k + S), <M« i+1 ) 0) beginning with the term which follows </>(«*). The number of these terms is a k+l - a k , or a k (a- 1), and each of them is greater than <£(a* +1 ); hence their sum is greater than 1 a k (a- 1) <f>(a k+1 ); that is, greater than x a k+l cf> (a k+1 ). By giving to k in succession the values 0, 1, 2, 3,... we have 4>(2) + 4>(3)-f<M4) + ++W>^x«*W; Co <]>(a + 1) + <£(« + 2) + <f>(a+ 3)+ + <£(«*)> x a 2 <f>(a 2 ) ; therefore, by addition, $! — <£(1) > S 2 , ct where £, , S 2 denote the sums of the first and second series respec- tively; therefore if the second series is divergent so also is the first. Again, each term of (1) is less than <£(«*), and therefore the sum of the series is less than (a— 1) x a k <j>(a k ). By giving to k in succession the values 0, 1, 2, 3... we have <j>{2) + <£(3) + 4>(4) + + <£(«) < (a- 1) x <£(1); <f>(a + I) + <f>(a + 2) + <f>(a + 3) + +<f>(a 2 )<(a- 1) x a<f>(a); therefore, by addition 4-+(l)<(«-l){4 + *(l)}; hence if the second series is convergent so also is the first. »' Note. To obtain the general term of the second series we take </>(») the general term of the first series, write a n instead of n and multiply by a n . 248 HIGHER ALGEBRA. *305. The series whose general term is — ^ r— is convergent n(logn) p u if p > 1, and divergent if p = 1, or p < 1.

We have shewn in Art. 183 that the use of divergent series in mathematical reasoning may lead to erroneous results. But even when the infinite series are convergent it is necessary to exercise caution in using them. For instance, the series - JC %)C Ou Jb + 4/2~J/3 + 474~^5 + '\" is convergent when x=l. [Art. 280.] But if we multiply the series by itself, the coefficient of x 2n in the product is 1 1 1 + 1 + 1 250 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Denote this by a 2n ; then since 1 1 J^ a„ > — ; — , and is therefore infinite when n is infinite. 2 \" Jn ' If x=l, the product becomes %-a x +a 3 - a B f ... + a gJ1 - a 2n+1 + a 2>I+a - ..., and since the terms ol, a .,. a ffl ._ ... are infinite, the series has 2h' 2/i+ 1' 2;i+2 ' no arithmetical meaning. This leads us to enquire under what conditions the product of two infinite convergent series is also convergent. *308. Let us denote the two infinite series a + a x x 4- a 2 x + a 3 x + . . . + a 2 x + . . ., b Q + b^x + b 2 x 2 + b 3 x 3 + . . . + b 2n x 2n + . . . by A and B respectively. If we multiply these series together we obtain a result of the form a <A + ( a A + a (A) x + ( a J>o + a fii + afiz) x 2 + ... Suppose this series to be continued to infinity and let us denote it by G ; then we have to examine under what conditions C may be regarded as the true arithmetical equivalent of the product AB. First suppose that all the terms in A and B are positive. Let A„ , B„ , C„ denote the series formed by taking the first 2/1 » 2« ' 2« JO 2w + 1 terms of A, B, C respectively. If we multiply together the two series A 2ai B 2ni the coefficient of each power of x in their product is equal to the coefficient of the like power of x in C as far as the term x 2 \" ; but in A 2n B, n there are terms containing powers of x higher than x 2n , whilst x 2n is the highest power of x in C 0n ; hence ^o B* > C 2 . 2/i 2/1 2/1 If we form the product A B the last term is a b x 2n ; but C 2n includes all the terms in the product and some other terms besides ; hence C. >A B . %n ii ii CONVERGENCY AND DIVERGENCY OF SERIES. 251 Thus C is intermediate in value between A B and A B , T 2 \" • 1 /. B B 2/» 2/i' whatever be the value or n. Let -4 and B be convergent series ; put A = A-X, B =B- Y. where X and Y are the remainders after n terms of the series have been taken; then when n is infinite X and Y are both indefinitely small. .-. A n B H = (A-X)(B-Y) = AB-BX-AY+XY' } therefore the limit of A B is AB. since A and B are botli finite. Similarly, the limit of A 2n B„ a is AB. Therefore C which is the limit of C 2n must be equal to AB since it lies between the limits of A B and A n B„ . B B 2« 2;« Next suppose the terms in A and B are not all of the same sign. In this case the inequalities A n B n > C„ > A B are not I 2n 2b 2b b b necessarily true, and we cannot reason as in the former case. Let us denote the aggregates of the positive terms in the two series by P t P' respectively, and the aggregates of the negative terms by iV, N'; so that A = P-N, B^F-N'. Then if each of the expressions P, P\\ JV, N' represents a con- vergent series, the equation AB = PF- NF- PN' + NN\\ has a meaning perfectly intelligible, for each of the expressions PP\\ NF, PN\\ NN' is a convergent series, by the former part of the proposition ; and thus the product of the two series A and B is a convergent series. Hence the product of two series will be convergent provided that the sum of all the terms of the same sign in each is a con- vergent series. But if each of the expressions P, N y P', N' represents a divergent series (as in the preceding article, where also F = P and N' = N), then all the expressions PF, NF, PN\\ NN' are divergent series. When this is the case, a careful investiga- tion is necessary in each particular example in order to ascertain whether the product is convergent or not. 252 HIGHER ALGEBRA. ^EXAMPLES. XXI. b.

Undetermined Coefficients. 309. In Art. 230 of the Elementary Algebra, it Avas proved that if any rational integral function of x vanishes when x = a, it is divisible by x — a. [See also Art. 514. Cor.] Let p x n + p x x n \" ' + pjf \" 2 + +p n be a rational integral function of x of n dimensions, which vanishes when x is equal to each of the unequal quantities «!> «*, %i «„• Denote the function hy f(x); tlien since f(x) is divisible by x - a l , we have f(x)=:(x-a l )(p x\"- i + ), the quotient being of n — 1 dimensions. Similarly, since f(x) is divisible by x -a, 7 , we have 2W n ~ X + = (x-aj-(pjf- + )« the quotient being of n — 2 dimensions; and Proceeding in this way, we shall finally obtain after n di- visions f(x) =p (x - a) (x-a}(x-a a ) (x- a H ). 310. If a rational integral function of\\\\ dimensions vanishes for more than n values of the variable, the coefficient of each power of the variable must be zero. Let the function be denoted hyf(x), where f(x) !>x\" +p ) x\"~ x +p,c'-' + +p n ; 254 HIGHER ALGEBRA. and suppose tha,tf(x) vanishes when x is equal to each of the unequal values a lt a 2i a 3 a n ; then f( x ) =Po ( x - a i) ( x ~ a 2 ) ( x ~ °0 ( x ~ a ,)- Let c be another value of x which makes f(x) vanish ; then since f(c) = 0, we have Po ( c ~ a i) (° ~ a *) ( G ~ a s) (c-«J = 0; and therefore p = 0, since, by hypothesis, none of the other factors is equal to zero. Hence f (x) reduces to 2\\x n - x +p 2 x n - 2 + 2 ) 3 X \"~ 3+ +P n - By hypothesis this expression vanishes for more than n values of x, and therefore p x = 0. In a similar manner we may shew that each of the coefficients 2>o, P 3 , Vn mus t be equal to zero. This result may also be enunciated as follows : If a rational integral function of n dimensions vanishes for more than n values of the variable, it must vanish for every value of the variable. Cor. If the function f(x) vanishes for more than n values of x, the equation f (x) — has more than n roots. Hence also, if an equation of n dimensions has more than n roots it is an identity. Example. Prove that (x - b) (x - c) (x - c) (x - a) (x - a) (x — b) _ 1 (a -b) (a- c) {b -c) (6 - a) (c-a) (c-b)~ This equation is of tivo dimensions, and it is evidently satisfied by each of the three values a, 6, c ; hence it is an identity. 311. If two rational integral functions of n dimensions are equal for more than n values of the variable, they are equal for every value of the variable. Suppose that the two functions 2 ) x n +p 1 x n - 1 +2> 2 x\"- 2 + +p H , q o x n + q^\"- 1 + q 2 x- 2 + + q mt are equal for more than n values of x ; then the expression U>» - %) x ' 1 + (Pi - ?i) x \"~ l + (p» - ad x \"~ 2 + + (p* - ?.) UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS. 255 vanishes for more than n values of x; and therefore, by the preceding article, that is, 2\\ = %> Pi=9li> Pi^Vv l> n = <l n > * Hence the two expressions are identical, and therefore are equal for every value of the variable. Thus if two rational integral functions are identically equal, we may equate the coefficients of the like powers of the variable. This is the principle we assumed in the Elementary Algebra, Art. 227. Cor. This proposition still holds if one of the functions is of lower dimensions than the other. For instance, if p x\" + pff~ l + pjf~ 2 + pjf~* + +p n = q 2 x n ~ 2 + q 3 x n ~ 3 + +q n , we have only to suppose that in the above investigation q o = 0, q = 0, and then Ave obtain ^o=°> Pi=°> P2=v s > Ps=q 3 > p,, = q»- 312. The theorem of the preceding article is usually referred to as the Principle of Undetermined Coefficients. The application of this principle is illustrated in the following examples. Example, 1. Find the sum of the series 1.2 + 2.3 + 3.4+ +n(n+l). Assume that 1.2 + 2. 3 + 3. 4 + ... + n(n + l)=A + Bn+Cn 2 + Dn 3 + En i +..., where A, B, C, D, E,... are quantities independent of n, whose values have to be determined. Change n into n + 1 ; then 1. 2 + 2.3+...+?i(;i + l) + (?t + l) (n + 2) = A+B(n + l) + C(n+l)* + D(n + l)3 + E(n + iy+.... By subtraction, (n + 1) [n+2) = B+C {2n + l) + D (3}v> + 3}i + l) + E {±-n* + 6ri- + ±n + l)+ .. . This equation being true for all integral values of n, the coefficients of the respective powers of n on each side must be equal ; thus E and all succeeding coefficients must be equal to zero, and 3D = 1; 3D + 2C = 3; D + C + B = 2; 1 2 whence 1) = - • , (7=1, B = - . o o 256 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence the sum =A + — + n 2 + - n 3 . o o To find A, put n = l; the series then reduces to its first term, and 2 = A + 2, or A = 0. Hence 1 .2 + 2 . 3 + 3. 4 + ... + n(;i + l) = - n (n + 1) (n + 2). Note. It will be seen from this example that when the n lh term is a rational integral function of n, it is sufficient to assume for the sum a function of n which is of one dimension higher than the w th term of the series. Example 2. Find the conditions that x 3 +px 2 + qx + r may be divisible by x 2 + ax + b. Assume x 3 +px 2 + qx + r=(x + k) (x 2 + ax + 6). Equating the coefficients of the like powers of x, we have k + a=p, ak + b = q, kb = r. From the last equation k = - ; hence by substitution we obtain b r n ar , r + a=p, and — +b = q; that is, r = b (p-a), and ar = b (q-b); which are the conditions required. EXAMPLES. XXII. a.

Expand -= „ in a series of ascending powers of x as far as the term involving x 5 . 2 + X 2 Let r— — '- — 2 = a + a x x + a 2 x' 2 + a.jx? + ..., where a , fl a , a. 2 , a :i ,... are constants whose values are to be determined; then 2 + x 2 — (1 + x - x 2 ) (a Q + Oj a; + a 2 ar + o a re 3 + . . . ) . In this equation we may equate the coefficients of like powers of x on each side. On the right-hand side the coefficient of x n is a n + a u _ 1 - a n _ 2 , and therefore, since x 2 is the highest power of x on the left, for all values of ?t>2 we have this will suffice to find the successive coefficients after the first three have been obtained. To determine these we have the equations a = 2, a 1 + a = 0, a. 2 + a 1 -a = l; whence a = 2, ^=-2, a 2 =5. Also a 3 + a 2 -a 1 = 0, whence a 3 = -7; a 4 + a 3 ~~ a 2 = 0, whence a 4 = 12 ; and a 5 + a±-a 3 = 0, whence a 5 = - 19 ; thus , 2 + X ~ „ = 2 - 2x + 5x 2 - 7.t 3 + 12x 4 - 19a 5 + . . . l + ic-a; 2 UNDETERMINED COEFFICIENTS. 250 Example 2.

CHAPTER XXIII. Partial Fractions. 315. In elementary Algebra, a group of fractions connected by the signs of addition and subtraction is reduced to a more simple form by being collected into one single fraction whose denominator is the lowest common denominator of the given fractions. But the converse process of separating a fraction into a group of simpler, or jwtial, fractions is often required. For 3 — 5a; example, if we wish to expand ^-- „ in a series of ascend- 1 — iX -r OXT ing powers of x, we might use the method of Art. 314, Ex. 1, and so obtain as many terms as we please. But if we wish to find the general term of the series this method is inapplicable, and it is simpler to express the given fraction in the equivalent form 1 2 1- — . Each of the expressions (1 —a;) -1 and (1 — 3aj) -1 I — x l — ox can now be expanded by the Binomial Theorem, and the general term obtained. 316. In the present chapter we shall give some examples illustrating the decomposition of a rational fraction into partial fractions. For a fuller discussion of the subject the reader is referred to Serret's Cours d'Algebre Superieure, or to treatises on the Integral Calculus. In these works it is proved that any rational fraction may be resolved into a series of partial fractions; and that to any linear factor x — a in the denominator there cor- responds a partial fraction of the form — - ; to any linear X — cc factor x - b occurring twice in the denominator there correspond 7? 7? two partial fractions, — l -j and -. — *__ . If x — b occurs three x — b (x — by times, there is an additional fraction . hnl au d so on - To (x-b)\" 262 HIGHER ALGEBRA. any quadratic factor x 2 +px + q there corresponds a partial Px + Q fraction of the form — : if the factor x 2 + vx + q occurs x' +])x + q P x + Q twice, there is a second partial fraction y—~ L — s ; and so on. ' r (x-+2)x + q) Here the quantities A v B lt P 2 , B 3 , P, Q, P v Q x are all independent of x. We shall make use of these results in the examples that follow. 5x — 11 Example 1. Separate =-^ ^ into partial fractions. Since the denominator 2.r 2 + x - 6 = (x + 2) (2x - 3), we assume 5.r-ll A B + 2x 2 + x-§ x + 2 2.c-3' where A and B are quantities independent of x whose values have to be determined. Clearing of fractions, 5x-ll = A (2x-S) + B(x + 2). Since this equation is identically true, we may equate coefficients of like powers of x ; thus 2A+B = 5, ~SA + 2B=-U; whence A = 3, B= -1. 5.r-ll 3 1 '\"' 2x 2 + x-6~ x + 2 2x-B' Example 2.

We might now equate coefficients and find the values of A and B, but it is simpler to proceed in the following manner. Since A and B are independent of x, we may give to x any value we please.

Recurring Series. 320. A series u + u l + u 2 + u 3 + in which from and after a certain term each term is equal to the sum of a fixed number of the preceding terms multiplied respec- tively by certain constants is called a recurring series. 321. In the series 1 + 2x + 3ar + 4a? + 5a; 4 + , each term after the second is equal to the sum of the two preceding terms multiplied respectively by the constants 2x, and - x 2 j these quantities being called constants because they are the same for all values of n. Thus 5x 4 = 2x . 4a; 3 + (- x 2 ) . 3a; 2 ; that is, u 4 = 2xn 3 — x 2 u 2 ; and generally when n is greater than 1, each term is connected with the two that immediately precede it by the equation u — 2xii , — x 2 u . , h n— 1 n—2* or u — 2xu , + x 2 u „ = 0. H n — 1 ii — 2 In this equation the coefficients of u n , «*,_,, and l*,_ a , taken with their proper signs, form what is called the scale of relation. Thus the series 1 + 2x + 3a; 2 + 4a; 3 + 5x 4 + is a recurring series in which the scale of relation is 1 - 2x + x 2 . 322. If the scale of relation of a recurring series is given, any term can be found when a sufficient number of the preceding 268 HIGHER ALGEBRA. terms are known. As the method of procedure is the same however many terms the scale of relation may consist of, the following illustration will be sufficient. If 1 - px - qx 2 - rx 3 is the scale of relation of the series a + a<x + a a x 2 + ajc 3 + we have a n x*=px - a n -i x \"~ 1 + <l x \" - a n - 2 x ' l ~ 2 + rx3 • a n - 3 x ' l ~ 3 i or a m =pa n _, + &».- + m «- 3 5 thus any coefficient can be found when the coefficients of the three preceding terms are known. 323. Conversely, if a sufficient number of the terms of a series be given, the scale of relation may be found. Example. Find the scale of relation of the recurring series 2 + 5x + 13x 2 + 35x 3 + Let the scale of relation be 1 -px - qx*-, then to obtain p and q we have the equations 13 - 5p - 2q = 0, and 35 - 13p - 5q = ; whence p = 5, and q= - 6, thus the scale of relation is 1 - 5x + 6a; 2 . 324. If the scale of relation consists of 3 terms it involves 2 constants, p and q ; and we must have 2 equations to de- termine p and q. To obtain the first of these we must know at least 3 terms of the series, and to obtain the second we must have one more term given. Thus to obtain a scale of relation involving two constants we must have at least 4 terms 'O given. If the scale of relation be 1 — px — qx 2 - rx 3 , to find the 3 constants we must have 3 equations. To obtain the first of these we must know at least 4 terms of the series, and to obtain the other two we must have two more terms given ; hence to find a scale of relation involving 3 constants, at least G terms of the series must be given. Generally, to find a scale of relation involving m constants, we must know at least 2m consecutive terms. Conversely, if 2m consecutive terms are given, we may assume for the scale of relation 1 ~ l\\ x ~ l\\ x * ~ lh x * ~ -PJ** RECURRING SERIES. 2G9 325. To find the sum ofn terms of a recurring series. The method of finding the sum is the same whatever be the scale of relation ; for simplicity we shall suppose it to contain only two constants. Let the series be a u + a x x + a 2 x 2 + aj£ + (1) and let the sum be S ; let the scale of relation be 1 — px — qx* ; so that for every value of n greater than 1, we have Now S—a it + a.x + a,x 2 + ...+ a ,x\"~\\ 1 2 /»— 1 ' — px S= — pa x — pa x x* — ... — 2^>ci H _ 2 x n ~ l — pa x* t - qa?

(i - px _ qtf) S - a + {a x -pa ) x - {pa n _ x + qa n _ a ) x n - qa^x** 1 , for the coefficient of every other power of x is zero in consequence of the relation a n-P a n-l-<2 a «-2= ' . s _ % + («, -P<-Q x (P a , t -, + qa n - 3 ) x\" + qa n _ } x H+l 1 -px— qx 2 1 - px — qx 2 Thus the sum of a recurring series is a fraction whose de- nominator is the scale of relation. 32G. If the second fraction in the result of the last article decreases indefinitely as n increases indefinitely, the sum of an infinite number of terms reduces to — \\ — — ! — - — ^ — . 1 — px — qx\" If we develop this fraction in ascending powers of x as explained in Art. 314, we shall obtain as many terms of the original series as we please; for this reason the expression 1 —px — qx 2 is called the generating function of the series. 327. From the result of Art. 325, we obtain a n + ( a , —P a .) X o .xi - °, v ' — £ —%— = a lt + a.x + ax- + ... +a x n + l 1 -px — qx' ° ' 2 \" -1 1 - px— qx 270 HIGHER ALGEBRA. from which we see that although the generating function 1 — px — qx 2 may be used to obtain as many terms of the series as we please, it can be regarded as the true equivalent of the infinite series a + a l x + a 2 x 2 + , only if the remainder ( I**,.-, +q a n- 2 ) xn + ( 2 a n-^\" +l 1 — poj — qx 2 vanishes when n is indefinitely increased ; in other words only when the series is convergent. o v 328. When the generating function can be expressed as a group of partial fractions the general term of a recurring series may be easily found. Thus, suppose the generating function can be decomposed into the partial fractions ABC h h 1— ax 1 + bx (I— ex) 2 ' Then the general term is & {Aa r + (- l) r M r + (r + 1) Cc r } x\\ In this case the sum of n terms may be found without using the method of Art. 325. Example. Find the generating function, the general term, and the sum to n terms of the recurring series 1 - Ix - x 2 - 43.-C 3 - Let the scale of relation be 1 -px - </.r 2 ; then -l + 7j>-<z = 0, -43 + 2> + 7</ = 0; whence p = l, 5 = 6; and the scale of relation is 1 - x - 6.r 2 . Let S denote the sum of the series ; then S = l-lx- x 2 -4Sx s - -xS= - x + 7x 2 + x*+ -Qx 2 S= -6x 2 + 42.r 3 + .-. (l-x-6x 2 )S = l-8x, s- J\" 8 * - which is the generating function.

CHAPTER XXV. CONTINUED FllACTIONS. 331. All expression of the form a + is called a a c + - e + ... continued fraction ; here the letters a, b, c, may denote any quantities whatever, but for the present we shall only consider the simpler form a x + , where a n a 2i « 3 ,... are positive 2 a 3 + ... integers. This will be usually written in the more compact form 1 1 a, + a 2 + a 3 + 332. When the number of quotients a a , « 3 ,... is finite the continued fraction is said to be terminating ; if the number of quotients is unlimited the fraction is called an infinite contirmed fraction. It is possible to reduce every terminating continued fraction to an ordinary fraction by simplifying the fractions in succession beginning from the lowest. 333. To convert a given fraction into a continued fraction. tn Let — be the tnven fraction ; divide in by n, let a be the quotient and j> the remainder ; thus m p 1 — — a. +- =a, + — : n n n P si. H.

It will be observed that the above process is the same as that of finding the greatest common measure of m and n ; hence if m and n are commensurable we shall at length arrive at a stage where the division is exact and the process terminates. Thus every fraction whose numerator and denominator are positive integers can be converted into a terminating continued fraction. 251 Example. Reduce ^^ to a continued fraction.

To shew that the convergents ewe alternately less and greater than the continued fraction. 1 1 Let the continued fraction be a l + a 2 + a 3 + The first convergent is «,, and is too small because the part is omitted.

The third convergent is a, -\\ , and is too small because a -\\ — is too a 2+ CC 3 % great ; and so on. When the given fraction is a proper fraction a t = ; if in this case we agree to consider zero as the first convergent, we may enunciate the above results as follows : The convergents of an odd order are all less, and the convergents of an even order are all greater, than the continued fraction. 336. To establish the law of formation of the successive con- vergents. Let the continued fraction be denoted by 1 1 1 a x + a 2 + a 3 + a 4 + then the first three convergents are a. a x a 3 + 1 o, (a, a, + !) + «, 1 a 2 a 3 . a 2 + 1 and we see that the numerator of the third convergent may be formed by multiplying the numerator of the second convergent by the third quotient, and adding the numerator of the first con- vergent ; also that the denominator may be formed in a similar manner. Suppose that the successive convergents are formed, in a similar way; let the numerators be denoted by^,^.,, p 3 ,..., and the denominators by q lt q , q 3 ,...

It will be convenient to call a H the n* partial quotient; the complete quotient at this stage being a n + a„ +1 + «« +2 4 We shall usually denote the complete quotient at'any stage by ft.

Again, since the error is less than — g , it follows that in order to find a convergent which will differ from the continued fraction by less than a given quantity - , we have only to calculate the a successive convergents up to — , where q n 2 is greater than a. 342. The properties of continued fractions enable us to find two small integers whose ratio closely approximates to that of two incommensurable quantities, or to that of two quantities whose exact ratio can only be expressed by large integers.

CHAPTER XXVI. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE. 345. In Chap. X. we have shewn how to obtain the positive integral solutions of indeterminate equations with numerical co- efficients; we shall now apply the properties of continued fractions to obtain the general solution of any indeterminate equation of the first degree. 346. Any equation of the first degree involving two un- knowns x and y can be reduced to the form ax±by = ± c, where a, 6, c are positive integers. This equation admits of an unlimited number of solutions ; but if the conditions of the problem require x and y to be positive integers, the number of solutions may be limited. It is clear that the equation ax + by = — c has no positive integral solution ; and that the equation ax — by = — c is equivalent to by — ax — c) hence it will be sufficient to consider the equations ax ±by — c. If a and b have a factor m which does not divide c, neither of the equations ax±by = c can be satisfied by integral values of x and y ; for ax ± by is divisible by m, whereas c is not. If a, b, c have a common factor it can be removed by division; so that we shall suppose a, b, c to have no common factor, and that a and b are prime to each other. 347. To find the general solution in positive integers of the equation ax — by — c. Let - be converted into a continued fraction, and let — denote 6 q the convergent just preceding j ; then aq—bp = ±l.

If either a or b is unity, the fraction j- cannot be con- verted into a continued fraction with unit numerators, and the investigation fails. In these cases, however, the solutions may be written down by inspection; thus if 6 = 1, the equation becomes ax — y = c; whence y = ax—c, and the solutions may be found by ascribing to x any positive integral value greater than - . a Note. It should be observed that the series of values for x and y form two arithmetical progressions in which the common differences are b and a respectively. 286 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example.

To find the solutions in positive integers of the equa- tion ax + by + cz — d, we may proceed as follows. By transposition ax + by = d — cz ; from which by giving to z in succession the values 0, 1, 2, 3, we obtain equations of the form ax + by = c, which may be solved as already explained. 353. If we have two simultaneous equations ax + by + cz=d, ax + b'y + cz = d\\ by eliminating one of the unknowns, z say, we obtain an equation of the form Ax + By = C. Suppose that x —f, y — g is a solution, then the general solution can be written x=f+Bs, y = g-As, where s is an integer. Substituting these values of x and y in either of the given equations, we obtain an equation of the form Fs + Gz = II, of which the general solution is 8 = h + Gt, z = k - Ft say. Substituting for s, we obtain x=f+Bh + BGt, y = g-Ah-AGt; and the values of x, y, z are obtained by giving to t suitable integral values. H. H. A. 19 290 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 354.

RECURRING CONTINUED FRACTIONS. 355. We have seen in Chap. XXV. that a terminating con- tinued fraction with rational quotients can be reduced to an ordinary fraction with integral numerator and denominator, and therefore cannot be equal to a surd ; but we shall prove that a quadratic surd can be expressed as an infinite continued fraction whose quotients recur. We shall first consider a numerical example. Example. Express ^19 as a continued fraction, and find a series of fractions approximating to its value. x /19 = 4 + ( v /19-4) = 4+ Tl9 3 - + -; v v /19 + 4_ 2 ,x/19 z _2_ 5 , 3 + 3 V19 + 2 ' N /19 + 2_ 1j _ ^19-3 , . 2 =1+^ — = 1 + 5 5 \\/19 + 3' ,/19 + S ^£9-8 5 . 2 2 \\/19 + 3' v /19 + 3_ 1 1 V 1 9-2_ 1 , 3 1 + 5 ~ 1 + N / 2 + /L9 + 2 n iN /19-4 0i 1 3 ~ \\/19 + 4' N /19 + 4 = 8 + ( N /19-4) = 8 + after this the quotients 2, 1, 3, 1, 2, 8 recur; hence 1 1 Jl_£ 1 2.

RECURRING CONTINUED FRACTIONS, 293 [Explanation. In each of the lines above we perform the same series of operations. For example, consider the second line : we first find the greatest integer in - — - — ; this is 2, and the remainder is - — 2, that o 6 is ^— ^ — . We then multiply numerator and denominator by the surd o 5 conjugate to ^19-2, so that after inverting the result . , we begin a new line with a rational denominator.] The first seven convergents formed as explained in Art. 336 are 4 9 13 48 61 170 1421 1 ' 2 ' 3 ' 11 ' 14 ' 39 ' 326 ' The eiTor in taking the last of these is less than , ' _ , and is therefore less than . — - , or , and a fortiori less than -00001.

We shall call the series of quotients JA r + a, JN + a 2 JJST+ a JA T . r x r 2 r 3 3 ) the first, second, third, fourth complete quotients. *358. From the preceding article it appears that the quan- tities a v r v b v b , b 3 are positive integers; we shall now prove that the quantities a 2 , a 3 , a 4 , , r 8 , r 3 , r 4 , . . . are also positive in- tegers. p p p Let — , —.. —r. be three consecutive convergents to JN. and q q q ° x P\" let — be the convergent corresponding to the partial quotient b n . The complete quotient at this stage is — ; hence v^= — p + p r , t = P JW+a„P+r v p Clearing of fractions and equating rational and irrational parts, we have «y + r nP = ^Y> c k<l + r n q =p ; whence a n ( pq - pq) =pp* ~ <Z<7 '^j r n {ptf —p<i) = A T q' 2 —p' 2 . But pq' —p'qssdslf and pq —pq-, pp' —qq'N, Nq 2 — p 2 have the same sign [Art. 344] ; hence a n and r n are positive integers. Since two convergents precede the complete quotient - r* this investigation holds for all values of n greater than 1. *359. To prove that the complete and partial quotients recur. In Art. 357 we have proved that r n r n _ l = N—a 2 . Also r n and r n _ l are positive integers ; hence a n must be less than ^/JV, thus a n cannot be greater than a v and therefore it cannot have any values except 1, 2, 3, ...a x ' } that is, the number of different values of a n cannot exceed a x . Again, a n+1 =r v b u -a h , that is r n b n = a n + a n+v and therefore r n b n cannot be greater than 2a l ; also b n is a positive integer ; hence r n cannot be greater than 2a v Thus r n cannot have any values except 1, 2, 3,...2a 1 ; that is, the number of different values ofi\\ cannot exceed 2a r RECURRING CONTINUED FRACTIONS. 297 Thus the complete quotient — — cannot have more than r n 2a* different values ; that is, some one complete quotient, and therefore all subsequent ones, must recur. Also b n is the greatest integer in — — ; hence the partial r n quotients must also recur, and the number of partial quotients in each cycle cannot be greater than 2a 2 '] *3G0. To prove that a, < a u + r n . We have «,_, + a n = b H _ 1 r n _ l ; «»_i + a «= or >?, t ,-i 5 since 6„_ l is a posit ive integer ; But N\"-a;=r n r n _ l - i a i ~ a n < r n , which proves the proposition. *361. To shew that the period begins loith the second partial quotient and terminates ivith a partial quotient double of the first. Since, as we have seen in Art. 359, a recurrence must take place, let us suppose that the (n+ l) th complete quotient recurs at the (*+ l) th ; then a. = a , r, = r , and b. = b ; we shall prove that a, . =a , . r m , = r , , b, = b , . 4 — 1 n — 1' »— 1 ii — 1' *— 1 ii — 1 We have r. , r = N -a, 2 ' — iV — a 2 = r ,r —r . r, ; * — i * » it H — i ii H — l * ' v = r Again, a , _ a * 1 7 7 .-. \" ' ~ -b , — o m . = zero, or an integer. n-1 298 HIGHER ALGEBRA. But, by Art. 360, a l -a n _ l <.r ii _ x , and a l -a s _ l <r s _ i ; that is a. -a. , < r ' , : therefore a , - a a , < r . ; hence -^ — is less n- 1 than unity, and therefore must be zero. Thus «,_! = «„_!, and also 6 # _ 1 = 6 fl _i. Hence if the (n + l) th complete quotient recurs, the ?^ th com- plete quotient must also recur; therefore the (n- l) th complete quotient must also recur; and so on. This proof holds as long as n is not less than 2 [Art. 358], hence the complete quotients recur, beginning with the second quotient — - . It follows therefore that the recurrence 1 r x begins with the second partial quotient b x ; we shall now shew that it terminates with a partial quotient 2a x . Let - \"be the complete quotient which just precedes the second complete quotient - when it recurs ; then — — a 1 H anc j v l ar e two consecutive complete quotients ; therefore »\", but N- a* = r, ; hence r n = 1. Again, a y — a H < ?'„, that is < 1 ; hence a x - a n - 0, that is «« = «,• Also a n + a = r n b n — b n ; hence b n = 2a i ; which establishes the proposition. *362. To shew that in any period the partial quotients equi- distant from the beginning and end are equal, the last partial quotient being excluded. Let the last complete quotient be denoted by * — ; then r n =l, ci n = a x , b n =2a r We shall prove that ^- 2 =^ 2) «h-2=« 3 > ^.-2= & 2^ r.

In this case the periodic part will not usually begin with the second partial quotient, nor will the last partial quotient be double the first.

INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. *366. The solution in positive integers of indeterminate equations of a degree higher than the first, though not of much practical importance, is interesting because of its connection with the Theory of Numbers. In the present chapter we shall confine our attention to equations of the second degree involving two variables. *367. To shew Iww to obtain the positive integral values of x arid y which satisfy the equation ax 2 + 2hxy + by 2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = 0, a, b, c, f, g, h being integers. Solving this equation as a quadratic in x, as in Art. 127, we have ax + hy+g = ±J(h 2 -ab) y 2 + 2 (hg - af)y+(g 2 -ac)...(l). Now in order that the values of x and y may be positive integers, the expression under the radical, which we may denote kv py 2 + 2gy + r, must be a perfect square ; that is py 2 + 2qy + r = z 2 , suppose. Solving this equation as a quadratic in y, we have py + q = ± Jq 2 -jjr+pz 2 ; and, as before, the expression under the radical must be a perfect square ; suppose that it is equal to t 2 ; then t 2 - pz 2 = q 2 - pr^ where t and z are variables, and j\\ q, r are constants. 304 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Unless this equation can be solved in positive integers, the original equation does not admit of a positive integral solution. We shall return to this point in Art. 374. If a, b, h are all positive, it is clear that the number of solutions is limited, because for large values of x and y the sign of the expression on the left depends upon that of ax 2 + 2hxy + by 2 [Art. 2G9], and thus cannot be zero for large positive integral values of x and y. Again, if h* — ab is negative, the coefficient of y 2 in (1) is negative, and by similar reasoning we see that the number of solutions is limited. Example. Solve in positive integers the equation a; 2 - 4xy + &y* - 2x - 20*/ = 29. Solving as a quadratic in x, we have x = 2y + 1 ± ^30 + 24// - 2y\\ But 30 + 24?/ - 2j/ 2 = 102 - 2 (y - G) 2 ; hence (y - 6) 2 cannot be greater than 51. By trial we find that the expression under the radical becomes a perfect square when (y-6) 8 =l or 49; thus the positive integral values of y are 5, 7, 13. When ?/ = 5, x = 21 or 1; when y = 7, x = 25 or 5; when y = 13, x = 29 or 25. *3G8. We have seen that the solution in positive integers of the equation ax 2 + 2hxy + by 2 + 2gx + 2fy + c = can be made to depend upon the solution of an equation of the form x 2 ± Ny 2 = ± a, where iV* and a are positive integers. The equation x 2 + Ny* = — a has no real roots, whilst the equation x 2 + Ny 2 = a has a limited number of solutions, which may be found by trial ; we shall therefore confine our attention to equations of the form x 2 - Ny 2 = ± a. *369. To sJiew that the equation x 2 -Ny 2 =l can always be solved in positive integers. Let JN be converted hito a continued fraction, and let 2_ l- '— be any three consecutive convergents; suppose that q q 9 INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 305 t 17\" a,/ ,n is the complete quotient corresponding to „ ; then *.

If the number of quotients in the period is even, -, i.s an even convergent, and is therefore greater than v /iV, and therefore P greater than ; thus pq —pq = 1. Jn this case p'* — N\"q' a = J, and therefore x=]>\\ y = q is a solution of the equation xr — Ny* = 1. p Since — is the penultimate convergent of any recurring period, the number of solutions is unlimited. If the number of quotients in the period is odd, the penultima 1 1 convergent in the tirst period is an odd convergent, but the penultimate convergent in the second period is an even convergent. Thus integral solutions will be obtained by putting x=p', y — q\\ where — is the penultimate convergent in the second, fourth, q sixth, recurring periods. Hence also in this case the number of solutions is unlimited. *370. To obtain a solution, in positive inte<iers of the equation As in the preceding article, we have f£ ~KT '2 ' I v -Jq =pq-pq> If the number of quotients in the period is odd, and if <1 > is an odd penultimate convergent in any recurring period, -,-<-, and therefore pq —pq ' — — 1.

Similarly if x = h i y = k is a solution of the equation x 2 — Xy 2 = — 1, and if n is any odd positive integer, x* - Ntf = (h 2 - Nk 2 )\\ Thus the values of x and y are the same as already found, but n is restricted to the values 1, 3, 5, *372. By putting x = ax', y = ay the equations x 2 — Ny 2 — ± a 3 become of 2 — IFy f * = d= 1, which we have already shewn how to solve. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE 307 *373. We have seen in Art. 3G9 that P n ~ N( f~ = ~ r n ( V<1 ~ V<l) = * r.. Hence if a is a denominator of any complete quotient which occurs in converting JX into a continued fraction, and if — is i • q the convergent obtained by stopping short of this complete quotient, one of the equations x~ — Xy 2 — ±a is satisfied by the values x =p\\ y = q'- Again, the odd convergents are all less than JN, and the even convergents are all greater than JX ; hence if — , is an even <2 t convergent, x=p, y = q is a solution of x* -Xif ' — a: and if —. q is an odd convergent, x =p , y — q is a solution of X s — Xy 2 = — a. *374. Tlie method explained in the preceding article enables us to find a solution of one of the equations x 2 — Xy 2 — ±a only when a is one of the denominators which occurs in the process of converting JX into a continued fraction. For example, if Ave convert J7 into a continued fraction, we shall find that and that the denominators of the complete quotients are 3, 2, 3, 1. The successive convergents are 2 3 5 8 37 45 82 127 1' 1' 2' 3' IT 17' 31' 18 ' ; and if we take the cycle of equations 2 I\" 2 O 2 *\" 2 CI o f o o o h' 2 1 x - ty = — 3, ar — Iff = 2, ar — 7^ = — 3, cc - / y = 1 , we shall find that they are satisfied by taking for x the values 2, 3, 5, 8, 37, 45, 82, 127, and iovy the values 1, 1, 2, 3, 14, 17, 31, 48, *375. It thus appears that the number of cases in which solu- tions in integers of the equations x 2 — Xy 2 = ± a can be obtained with certainty is very limited. In a numerical example it may, however, sometimes happen that we can discover by trial a 20—2 308 HIGHER ALGEBRA. positive integral solution of the equations x 2 — Ny 2 = =*= a, when a is not one of the above mentioned denominators ; thus we easily find that the equation # 2 -7?/ 2 = 53 is satisfied by y=2, # = 9. When one solution in integers has been found, any number of solutions may be obtained as explained in the next article. *376. Suppose that x =f, y = g is a solution of the equation x 2 _ Ny 2 = a ; and let x = h, y - k be any solution of the equation x 2 - JSfy 2 = 1 ; then x* ~ Ny 2 = (f 2 - Kg 2 ) (h 2 - Nk 2 ) = (fh±Ngk) 2 -N{fk±gh)\\ By putting x -fh ± Kgk, y -fk ± gh, and ascribing to h, k their values found as explained in Art. 371, we may obtain any number of solutions. *377. Hitherto it has been supposed that N is not a perfect square ; if, however, N is a perfect square the equation takes the form x 2 - n 2 y 2 = a, which may be readily solved as follows. Suppose that a = be, where b and c are two positive integers, of which b is the greater ; then (x + ny) (x — ny) = be. Put x + ny = b, x - ny = c ; if the values of x and y found from these equations are integers we have obtained one solution of the equation ; the remaining solutions may be obtained by ascribing to b and c all their possible values. Example. Find two positive integers the difference of whose squares is equal to 60. Let x, y be the two integers ; then ,xr - y 2 = 60 ; that is, (as + y) (x - y) = 60. Now 60 is the product of any of the pair of factors 1,60; 2,30; 3,20; 4,15; 5,12; 6,10; and the values required are obtained from the equations ic + y = 30, # + y = 10, x-y= 2; x-y= 6; the other equations giving fractional values of x and y. Thus the numbers are 16, 14; or 8, 2. INDETERMINATE EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE. 309 Cor. In like manner we may obtain the solution in positive integers of ax' + 2hxy + by 1 + %jx + *2/'y + c = k, if the left-hand member can be resolved into two rational linear factors. *378. If in the general equation a, or b, or both, are zero, instead of employing the method explained in Art. 3G7 it is simpler to proceed as in the following example. Example. Solve in positive integers 2.ry - 4a- 2 + V2x - 5y = 11 . Expressing y in terms of x, we have 4a; 2 - 12* + 11 „ , 6 V= — ^r-r — =2tf-l+; 2x - 5 2x - 5 n In order that y may be an integer = must be an integer ; hence 2.r - 5 2iX — O must be equal to ± 1, or ± 2, or ± 3, or ± G. The cases ±2, ±6 may clearly be rejected; hence the admissible values of x are obtained from 2x - 5 = ± 1, 2x - 5 = ± 3 ; whence the values of .x- are 3, 2, 4, 1. Taking these values in succession we obtain the solutions x = S, y = ll; s=2, y = -3; # = 4, ?/ = 9; ar=l, y= -1; and therefore the admissible solutions are a; = 3, y = 11; x = 4, y = 9. *379. The principles already explained enable us to discover for what values of the variables given linear or quadratic functions of x and y become perfect squares. Problems of this kind are sometimes called DiopJiantine Problems because they were first investigated by the Greek mathematician Diophantus about the middle of the fourth century. Example 1. Find the general expressions for two positive integers which are such that if their product is taken from the sum of their squares the difference is a perfect square. Denote the integers by x and y ; then x- -xy + y' 2 = z' 2 suppose ; .-. x(x-y) = z 2 -y-. This equation is satisfied by the suppositions mx= n {z + y), n (x -y) = m (z - y), where m and n are positive integers. 310 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence mx - ny - nz = 0, nx + (m -n)y- mz - 0. From these equations we obtain by cross multiplication x _ V 2 . 2mn - ri 2 m 2 - n 2 m 2 - mn + ri 1 ' and since the given equation is homogeneous we may take for the general solution x = 2mn-n 2 , y = m 2 -n 2 , z = m 2 -vin + n 2 . Here m and n are any two positive integers, »i being the greater; thus if ?n = 7, n = 4, we have x = ±0, y = SS, 3 = 37. Example 2. Find the general expression for three positive integers in arithmetic progression, and such that the sum of every two is a perfect square. Denote the integers by x-y, x, x + y; and let 2x-y=p 2 , 2x = q 2 , 2x + y = r 2 ; then p 2 + r 2 = 2q 2 , or i*-q*=q*-p>. This equation is satisfied by the suppositions, m (r - q) = n (q - j>), n (r + q) = m (q +p), where m and n are positive integers. From these equations we obtain by cross multiplication V = <l _ r w 2 + 2mn-m 2 m 2 + n 2 m 2 + 2mn- n 2 ' Hence we may take for the general solution p=n* + 2mn-m*, q = m 2 + n 2 , r = )u 2 + 2mn-u 2 ; whence x = = {m 2 + w 2 ) 2 , y = inin (m 2 - w 2 ) , and the three integers can be found. From the value of x it is clear that m and n are either both even or both odd ; also their values must be such that x is greater than y, that is, (m 2 + n 2 ) 2 >8mn{m 2 -n 2 ), or m z (m - Sn) + 2inn 2 + 8m n* + n 4 > ; which condition is satisfied if m>Sn. If m = 9, w=l, then a- = 3362, y =2880, and the numbers are 482, 33G2, 6242. The sums of these taken in pairs are 3844, 6724, 9604, which are the squares of 62, 82, 98 respectively.

CHAPTER XXIX. SUMMATION OF SERIES. 380. Examples of summation of certain series have occurred in previous chapters ; it will be convenient here to give a synopsis of the methods of summation which have already been explained. (i) Arithmetical Progression, Chap. IV. (ii) Geometrical Progression, Chap. Y. (iii) Series which are partly arithmetical and partly geo- metrical, Art. 60. (iv) Sums of the powers of the Natural Numbers and allied Series, Arts. 68 to 75. (v) Summation by means of Undetermined Coefficients, Art. 312. (vi) Recurring Series, Chap. XXIY. We now proceed to discuss methods of greater generality ; but in the course of the present chapter it will be seen that some of the foregoing methods may still be usefully employed. 381. If the r th term of a series can be expressed as the dif- ference of two quantities one of which is the same function of r that the other is of r - 1 , the sum of the series may be readily found. For let the series be denoted by and its sum by S , and suppose that any term u r can be put in the form v r -v r _ 1 ; then ^.=(«i-0+( w .-«i)+(*.-«f) + »- + ( w .-i-0 ! + (*.- ,, --i) = v - v n .

To jind the sum of\\\\ terms of a series each term of which is composed of r factors in arithmetical progression, the first factors of the several terms being in the same arithmetical progression. Let the series be denoted by u x + u 2 + u s + + u n , where u„ - (a + nb) (a + n + 1 . b) (a + n + 2 . b) ... (a + n + r — 1 . b). Replacing n by n— 1, we have «„ ! = (a + n — 1 . &) (a + nb) (a + n + 1 . 6) . .. (a + n + r — 2 . b) ; k »-i .'. (« + ?i — 1 . b) u n = (a + n + /• — 1 . b) ?.«.„_! = v n , say.

Find the sum of n terms of the series 1.3.5+3.5.7+5.7.9+ The n th term is {2n - 1) (2« + 1) (2n + 3) ; hence by the rule - _ (2w-l)(2n + l)(2n + 3)(2n+5) , n >\\- ^ +C7. To determine C, put n = 1 ; then the series reduces to its first term, and we have 15 = — - — -j — : — f- C ; whence C = — ; 8 8 (2n-l)(2n+l)(2n+3)(2n+5) 15 •'• S *~ 8 + 8\" = n (2n 3 + 8« 2 + In - 2), after reduction. 384. The sum of the series in the preceding article may also be found either by the method of Undetermined Coefficients [Art. 312] or in the following manner. We have u n = (2w - 1) (2w + 1) (2w + 3) = $n 3 + 12>i 2 - 2m - 3; . \\ S m = 82?i 3 + 122^ 2 - 22m - 3m, using the notation of Art. 70 ; . \\S U = 2m 2 (m + l) 2 + 2m (n + 1) (2n + 1) - n (n + 1) - 3m = w(2m 3 + 8m 2 + 7?i-2). 385. It should be noticed that the rule given in Art. 383 is only applicable to cases in which the factors of each term form an arithmetical progression, and the first factors of the several terms are in the same arithmetical progression. Thus the sum of the series 1.3. 5 + 2.4. 6 + 3.5. 7 + to n terms, may be found by either of the methods suggested in the preceding article, but not directly by the rule of Art. 383. Here u n = n (m + 2) (m + 4) - n (m +1 + 1 ) (m + 2 + 2) = n{n+ l)(™ + 2) + 2n(n+ \\) + u(a + '2) + 2/4 = n (m + 1) (m + 2) + 3m (n + 1) + 3m. The rule can now be applied to each term ; thus S n = \\n (m+ 1) (m + 2)(m + 3) +n (n+ 1) (m + 2) + |« (»+ 1) + C \\ )> (r h l)(/r»-l) (» + 5), the constant being zero. 316 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 386. To find the sum of\\\\ terms of a series each term of which is composed of the reciprocal of the product of r factors in arith- metical progression, the first factors of the several terms being in tlie same arithmetical progression. Let the series be denoted by u x + it, + u :i + + u n , where — = (a + nb) (a + n + 1 . b) (a + n + 2 . b) (a + n + r-l .b). 4i U n M„_i Replacing n by n - 1, — = (a + n - 1 . b) (a + nb) (a + n + 1 . b) ...(a + n + r—2 . b) ; l n-l .'.

Replacing n by n + 1, we have (a+nb)u n = v n+1 ; therefore, by subtraction, (r-l)b. u n = v n -v n+1 , Similarly (r - 1) b . u n _ x = v ll _ l - v n , (r — l)b . u. 2 = v. 2 — v St (r— 1) b .

In this example we may proceed as follows : n + 2 (n+2) 2 \" re(re+l)(re + 3) n{n+l) (n + 2) (re + 3) re (re 4-1) + 3re + 4 : re(re + l)(re + 2)(re + 3)\" 1 3 (re + 2)(w + 3) (re + l)(re + 2)(re + 3) w(re+l)(n + 2)(re + 3)' Each of these expressions may now be taken as the ?i th term of a series to which the rule is applicable. • S -c l 3 4 n + S 2(re + 2)(re + 3) 3 (re+ 1) (re + 2) (re + 3) ' put re=l, then 3-13 4 29 17271= C \"4 \" 27174 \" 372.3 .4' Whence C = 36 ; _29 1 3 4 n 36 re + 3 2 (re + 2) (re + 3) 3 (re + 1) (re + 2) (re + 3)' 318 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 387. In cases where the methods of Arts. 383, 386 are directly applicable, instead of quoting the rules we may always effect the summation in the following way, which is sometimes called ' the Method of Subtraction.' Example. Find the sum of n terms of the series 2.5 + 5.8 + 8.11 + 11.14+ The arithmetical progression in this case is 2, 5,8, 11, 14, In each term of the given series introduce as a new factor the next term of the arithmetical progression ; denote this series by &\", and the given series by S; then S' = 2. 5. 8 + 5. 8. 11 + 8. 11. 14+ +(3w-l)(3n+2)(3»+5); .-. £'-2.5.8 = 5.8.11 + 8. 11.14 + 11. 14.17+... to (u-1) terms.

When the n th term of a series is a rational integral function of n it can be expressed in a form which will enable us readily to apply the method given in Art. 383. For suppose <j> (n) is a rational integral function of n of p dimensions, and assume cf)(n) = A +Bn+ Cti(n + 1) +B)i(u+ l)(n + 2)+ , where A, JB, C, D, are undetermined constants p + l in number. This identity being true for all values of n, we may equate the coefficients of like powers of n; we thus obtain ^> + 1 simple equations to determine the p + 1 constants. Example. Find the sum of n terms of the series whose general term is n*+6n 3 + 5w 2 . Assume 7i 4 + 6/i 3 + 5/t 2 = A + Bn+ Gn [n + 1) + Dn [n + 1) (n + 2) + En (n + 1) (n + 2) (w + 3) ; it is at once obvious that ,4=0, 2? = 0, E = 1 ; and by putting n = - 2, n = - 3 successively, we obtain C = - 6, J) = 0. Thus « 4 + 6» 3 + 5/< 2 =//(n + l) (n+2) (?i + 3)-6/t(/i + l). SUMMATION OF SERIES. 310 Hence S n = s n (/t + l)(» + 2)(n + 3)(?i + 4) - 2n(n + l)(n + 2) o = \\n(n+l)(n+2){n' i + 7n + 2). o Polygonal and Figurate Numbers. • 389. If in the expression n+ \\n(n— l)b, which is the sum of n terms of an arithmetical progression whose first term is 1 and common difference b, we give to b the values 0, 1, 2, 3, we get •> n j u, \\n (n + 1), n* s \\n (Bn — 1) which are the u ih terms of the Polygonal Numbers of the second, third, fourth, fifth, orders; the first order being that in which each term is unity. The polygonal numbers of the second, third, fourth, fifth, orders are sometimes called linear, triangular square, pentagonal ) 390. To find the sum of the first n terms of the r th order of j>olygonal numbers. The n ih term of the r tb order is n + \\n (n - 1) (r — 2); .-. $ i =$n + l(r-2)%(n-l)u = \\n (n + 1) + 1 (r -2)(n-l) n (n + 1) [Art. 383] = in(n + l){(r-2)(n-l) + $}. 391. If the sum of n terms of the series 1, 1, 1, 1,1, , be taken as the ?* th term of a new series, we obtain 1,2,3,4,5, n in + 1 ) If again we take — , which is the sum of n terms of the -j last series, as the ?t th term of a new series, we obtain 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, By proceeding in this way, we obtain a succession of series such that in any one, the n ih term is the sum of n terms of the preceding series. The successive series thus formed are known as Figurate Numbers of the first, second, third, ... orders. 320 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 392. To find the n th term and the sum of n terms of ilie r th order offigurate numbers.

In applying the rule of Art. 383 to find the sum of n terms of any order of figurate numbers, it will be found that the constant is always zero. 393. The properties of figurate numbers are historically interesting on account of the use made of them by Pascal in his Traite du triangle arithmetique, published in 1665. The following table exhibits the Arithmetical Triangle in its simplest form 1 ... 1 1 SUMMATION OF SERIES. 321 Pascal constructed the numbers in the triangle by the follow- ing rule : Each number is the sum of that immediately above it and that immediately to the left of it; thus 15 = 5 + 10, 28 = 7 + 21, 126 = 56 + 70. From the mode of construction, it follows that the numbers in the successive horizontal rows, or vertical columns, are the hgurate numbers of the first, second, third, . . . orders. A line drawn so as to cut off an equal number of units from the top row and the left-hand column is called a base, and the bases are numbered beginning from the top left-hand corner. Thus the 6th base is a line drawn through the numbers 1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1 ; and it will be observed that there are six of these num- bers, and that they are the coefficients of the terms in the ex- pansion of (1 + x) 5 . The properties of these numbers were discussed by Pascal with great skill : in particular he used his Arithmetical Trianyle to develop the theory of Combinations, and to establish some interesting propositions in Probability. The subject is fully treated in Todhunter's History of Probability, Chapter n. 304. \"Where no ambiguity exists as to the number of terms in a series, we have used the symbol % to indicate summation ; but in some cases the following modified notation, which indicates the limits between which the summation is to be effected, will be found more convenient. Let cf> (x) be any function of x, then 2 <f> (x) denotes the sum x=l of the series of terms obtained from <f> (x) by giving to x all posi- tive integral values from I to m inclusive.

We proceed to investigate a method of finding u n when a certain number of the terms u x , u. 2 , w 3 , u 4 ,... are given. From the series u x , u 2 , u 3 , u A , u 5 ,... obtain a second series by subtracting each term from the term which immediately follows it.

A 3 Wj, A 3 u,, A 3 u 3 , it appears that any term in any series is equal to the term immediately preceding it added to the term below it on the left. Thus u. 2 = «j 4- Au ly and Ait. 2 = Au i + A.m^ . By addition, since u. 2 + Au. 2 = u 3 we have ii.j = t^ + 2Au ± + A. 2 u x . In an exactly similar manner by using the second, third, and fourth series in place of the first, second, and third, we obtain Au 3 = Au x + 2A. 2 u 1 + A^.

It will be seen that this method of summation will only succeed when the series is such that in forming the orders of differences we eventually come to a series in which all the terms are equal. This will always be the case if the n th term of the series is a rational integral function of n. ^» j For simplicity we will consider a function of three dimensions; the method of proof, however, is perfectly general. Let the series be u. + u a + u a + + u +u .,+u . „ + u , „ + 1 2 3 ii n + \\ n+2 u + 3 where u = An 3 + Bn 2 + Cn + D. \" and let v , w , % denote the ?i th term of the first, second, third n' ii* ii * * orders of differences; SUMMATION OF SERIES. 327 then v h - m m+1 — u n = A(3n* + 3n+ l) + 2?(2» + 1) +C: that is, v n = 3Au 2 + (3A + 2B) n + A + 11 + C ; Similarly w = v . , — v = 3A (2n + I) + 3A + 211 and z =w .— iv =6-4. H »ti ii Thus the terms in the third order of differences are equal; and generally, if the n ih term of the given series is of p dimensions, the terms in the p th order of differences will be equal. Conversely, if the terms in the ]j th order of differences are equal, the u tu term of the series is a rational integral function of ii of p dimensions. Example. Find the « th term of the series -1, - 3, 3, 23, G3, 129, The successive orders of differences are -2, 6, 20, 40, GO, 8, 14, 20,20, 6, 6, 0, Thus the terms in the third order of differeLces are equal ; hence we may assume it H = A+Bn+Cn 2 + Dn 3 , where A, B, G, D have to be determined. Putting 1, 2, 3, 4 for 7i in succession, we have four simultaneous equations, from which we obtain A =3, B = -3, C = - 2, D — \\ ; hence the general term of the series is 3 - 3n - 2n 2 + n 9 . 398. If a ri is a rational integral function of p dimensions in n, the series a, + ax + ajx 2 + ... + a x n 12 »i is a recurring series, ivhose scale of relation is (I — x) p+1 . Let S denote the sum of the series ; then S (1 - x) -- a o + (a x - a )x + {a, - ajx* + . .. + (a, - a ,_>\" - ax\" + l = a + b t x + bjc 2 + ... + bx\" - ax\" + \\ say; here b =a —a , , so that 6 n is of p - 1 dimensions in n. n h it — 1 ' \"• x Multiplying this last series by 1 - x, we have S(i-xy =s+(^-a„)*+(^-^K+..-+(6n-6„-iK-(« J ,+6>\" +l +«X +a = c^+{b-a )x+c^ 2 + c i x^...+cX-{a i +b i y , ^ + a i :c ,+ % say; here c n -b n -b u u so that c n is of p - 2 dimensions in n. 328 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence it follows that after the successive multiplications by 1 — x, the coefficients of x n in the first, second, third, . . . products are general terms in the first, second, third, . . . orders of differences of the coefficients. By hypothesis a n is a rational integral function of n of p dimensions ; therefore after p multiplications by 1 - x we shall arrive at a series the terms of which, with the exception of p terms at the beginning, and p terms at the end of the series, form a geometrical progression, each of whose coefficients is the same. [Art. 397.] Thus S (1 - xf = k(x p + x>' +1 + ...+ x\") +/(a?), where k is a constant, and f (x) stands for the p terms at the beginning and p terms at the end of the product. r.Sil-xy J^l^ K/ix); k x»(l-x\"-^) + (l-x)f(x) ^ that is, a = (1 -x) p+l ' thus the series is a recurring series whose scale of relation is (l-x) p+1 . [Art. 325.] If the general term is not given, the dimensions of a n are readily found by the method explained in Art. 397. Example. Find the generating function of the series 3 + 5a; + 9a; 2 +15a; 3 + 23a; 4 + 33a; 5 + Forming the successive orders of differences of the coefficients, we have the series 2, 4, G, 8, 10, 2, 2, 2, 2, ; thus the terms in the second order of differences are equal ; hence a n is a rational integral function of n of two dimensions ; and therefore the scale of relation is (1 - a;) 3 . We have S = 3 + 5x + 9a; 2 + 15.r 3 + 23a; 4 + 33a; 5 + - SxS = - 9.r - 15a; 2 - 27.x- 3 - 45a; 4 - 69^ - Sx 2 S = 9a; 2 + 15a; 3 + 27.r 4 + 45a; 5 + -x s S= - 3^- 5a; 4 - 9a; 5 - By addition, ( 1 - a;) 3 S = 3 - 4a; + 3a; 2 ; 3-4.r + 3a; 2 •*• b ~ (1-a;) 3 * SUMMATION OF SERIES. 329 399. We have seen in Chap, xxiv. that the generating function of a recurring series is a rational fraction whose denomi- nator is the scale of relation. Suppose that this denominator can be resolved into the factors (1 — ax) (1 — bx) (1 — ex) ; then the generating function can be separated into partial fractions of the - ABC to rm , 1- 1 - ax 1 — bx 1 - ex Each of these fractions can be expanded by the Binomial Theorem in the form of a geometrical series; hence in this case the re- curring series can be expressed as the sum of a number of geometrical series. If however the scale of relation contains any factor 1 - ax more than once, corresponding to this repeated factor there will be A A partial fractions of the form -^ — -7, ... — r=, : which (1 -axy (1 - ax) when expanded by the Binomial Theorem do not form geometrical series; hence in this case the recurring series cannot be expressed as the sum of a number of geometrical series. 400. The successive orders of differences of the geometrical progression a, ar, ar 2 , ar 3 , ar\\ ar n , are «(r-l), a(r—l)r, a(r-l)r 2 , a(r—\\)r ? ' a(r-l) 2 , a(r-l) 2 r, a(r-\\fr 2 , which are themselves geometrical progressions having the same common ratio r as the original series. 401. Let us consider the series in which where </>(rc) is a rational integral function of n of p dimensions, and from this series let us form the successive orders of differences. Each term in any of these orders is the sum of two parts, one arising from terms of the form ar n ~\\ and the other from terms of the form <£(?i) in the original series. Now since <f>(n) is of ;; dimensions, the part arising from <f>(n) will be zero in the (p + l) th and succeeding orders of differences, and therefore these series will be geometrical progressions whose common ratio is r. [Art. 400.] 330 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence if the first few terms of a series are given, and if the p th order of differences of these terms form a geometrical pro- gression whose common ratio is r, then we may assume that the general term of the given series is ar\"\" 1 +f(n), where f(n) is a rational integral function of n of p - 1 dimensions. Example. Find the n th term of the series 10, 23, 60, 169, 494, The successive orders of differences are 13, 37, 109, 335, 24, 72, 216, Thus the second order of differences is a geometrical progression in which the common ratio is 3 ; hence we may assume for the general term u n —a . S n -^ + bn + c. To determine the constants a, b, c, make n equal to 1, 2, 3 successively; then a + b + c=10, 3a + 2b+c = 23, 9a + 3b + c = 60; whence a = 6, 6=1, c = S. Thus u n = 6 . 3' 1 \" 1 + n + 3 = 2 . 3» + n + 3. 402. In each of the examples on recurring series that we have just given, on forming the successive orders of differences we have obtained a series the law of which is obvious on inspec- tion, and we have thus been enabled to find a general expression for the ?4 th term of the original series. If, however, the recurring series is equal to the sum of a number of geometrical progressions whose common ratios are «, b, c, ..., its general term is of the form Aa\"' 1 + Bb n ~ l + Cc n ~\\ and therefore the general term in the successive orders of differences is of the same form ; that is, all the orders of differ- ences follow the same law as the original series. In this case to find the general term of the series we must have recourse to the more general method explained in Chap. xxiv. But when the coefficients are large the scale of relation is not found without considerable arithmetical labour ; hence it is generally worth while to write down a few of the orders of differences to see whether we shall arrive at a series the law of whose terms is evident. 403. We add some examples in further illustration of the preceding principles. SUMMATION OF SERIES. 33] Example 1.

There are many series the summation of which can be brought under no general rule. In some cases a skilful modifi- cation of the foregoing methods may be necessary ; in others it Avill be found that the summation depends on the properties of certain known expansions, such as those obtained by the Binomial, Logarithmic, and Exponential Theorems.

In this chapter we shall use the word number as equi- valent in meaning to positive integer. A number which is not exactly divisible by any number except itself and unity is called a prime number, or a prime; a number which is divisible by other numbers besides itself and unity is called a composite number \\ thus 53 is a prime number, and 35 is a composite number. Two numbers which have no common factor except unity are said to be prime to each other ; thus 24 is prime to 77. 408. We shall make frequent use of the following elementary propositions, some of which arise so naturally out of the definition of a prime that they may be regarded as axioms. (i) If a number a divides a product be and is prime to one factor b, it must divide the other factor c. For since a divides be, every factor of a is found in be; but since a is prime to b, no factor of a is found in b; therefore all the factors of a are found in c ; that is, a divides c. (ii) If a prime number a divides a product bed..., it must divide one of the factors of that product ; and therefore if a prime number a divides b\", where n is any positive integer, it must divide b. (iii) If a is prime to each of the numbers b and c, it is prime to the product be. For no factor of a can divide b or c ; there- fore the product be is not divisible by any factor of a, that is, a is prime to be. Conversely if a is prime to be, it is prime to eacli of the numbers b and c. Also if a is prime to each of the numbers b, c, d, ..., it is prime to the product bed... ; and conversely if a is prime to any number, it is prime to every factor of that number. 342 HIGHER ALGEBRA. (iv) If a and b are prime to each other, every positive integral power of a is prime to every positive integral power of b. This follows at once from (iii). (v) If a is prime to b, the fractions =- and j- are in their bo ft lowest terms, n and m being any positive integers. Also if j and - are any two equal fractions, and j is in its lowest terms, then c and d must be equimultiples of a and b respectively. 409. The number of primes is infinite. For if not, let p be the greatest prime number; then the product 2 . 3 . 5 . 7 . 11 . . .p, in which each factor is a prime num- ber, is divisible by each of the factors 2, 3, 5, . . .p ; and therefore the number formed by adding unity to their product is not divisible by any of these factors ; hence it is either a prime number itself or is divisible by some prime number greater than p : in either case p is not the greatest prime number, and there- fore the number of primes is not limited. 410. No rational algebraical formula can represent prime numbers only. If possible, let the formula a + bx + ex 2 + dx 3 + ... represent prime numbers only, and suppose that when x = m the value of the expression is ]), so that p — a + bm + cm 2 + dm 3 + ; when x = m + np the expression becomes a + b (m + np) + c {m + np) 2 + d (m + np) 3 + ..., that is, a + bm + cm 2 + dm 3 + . . . + a multiple of p, or p + a multiple of p, thus the expression is divisible by £>, and is therefore not a prime number. 411. A number can be resolved into prime factors , in only one way. Let N denote the number; suppose N = abed..., where a, b, c, d, ... are prime numbers. Suppose also that JV = a/3yS..., where a, /3, y, 8, ... are other prime numbers. Then abed... = a/3yS... ; THEORY OF NUMHEHS. 343 hence a must divide; abed... ; but eacli of the factors of this pro- duct is a prime, therefore a must divide one of them, a suppose. But a and a are both prime ; therefore a must be equal to a. Hence bed. . . =/3yS. . . ; and as before, /? must be equal to one of the factors of bed... J and so on. Hence the factors in a/3y<$... are equal to those in abed..., and therefore iV can only be resolved into prime factors in one way. 412. To find the number of divisors of a composite number. Let N denote the number, and suppose N\"=a p b g <f..., where a, b, c, ... are different prime numbers and p, q, r, ... are positive integers. Then it is clear that each term of the product (l+a + a' + ...+a'')(l+b + b 2 + ... + V) (I + c + c 2 + ...+c r )... is a divisor of the given number, and that no other number is a divisor ; hence the number of divisors is the number of terms in the product, that is, (f>+l)fe+l)(r + l) This includes as divisors, both unity and the number itself. 413. To find the number of ways in which a composite number can be resolved into two factors. Let N\" denote the number, and suppose N = a'tyc' . . . , where a, b, c... are different prime numbers and ]), q, r... are positive integers. Then each term of the product (I + a + a 2 + ... + of) (1 + b + b 2 + . . . + b' 1 ) (1 + c + c 2 + . . . + c r ) . . . is a divisor of iV; but there are two divisors corresponding to each way in which iV can be resolved into two factors ; hence the required number is }(!>+l)& + l)(r + l) This supposes N not a perfect square, so that one at least of the quantities^, q, r, ... is an odd number. If N is a perfect square, one way of resolution into factors is x /iVx JNj and to this way there corresponds only one divisor JX. If we exclude this, the number of ways of resolution is !{(p+l)(? + l)(r + l)...-l}, and to this we must add the one way JN x N /iV; thus we obtain for the required number \\{(P + !)(</+ !)(<•+ l)- + lj 344 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 414. To find the number of ways in which a composite number can be resolved into two factors which are prime to each other. As before, let the number N = a v b q c r .... Of the two factors one must contain a p , for otherwise there would be some power of a in one factor and some power of a in the other factor, and thus the two factors would not be prime to each other. Similarly b q must occur in one of the factors only ; and so on. Hence the required number is equal to the number of ways in which the product abc... can be resolved into two factors; that is, the number of ways is -(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)... or 2\"\" 1 , where n is the number of different prime factors in N. 415. To find the sum of the divisors of a number. Let the number be denoted by a p b q c r ..., as before. Then each term of the product (1 +a + a 2 + ...+a r )(l+b + b 2 + ... + b' 1 ) (1 + c + c 2 + ...+c r )... is a divisor, and therefore the sum of the divisors is equal to this product ) that is, the sum required = a . _ i &»+'_! c r+1 -l a -1 * b-l \" c-1 Example 1. Consider the number 21600. Since 21600 = 6 3 . 10 2 = 2 3 . 3 3 . 2 2 . 5 2 = 2 3 . 3 3 . 5 2 , the number of divisors = (5 + 1) (3 + 1) (2 + 1) = 72 ; .. ... ,. . 26-1 3*-l 5 3 -l the sum of the divisors = — — ? . 5 — — . - — - 2 — 1 o — 1 5 — 1 = 63x40x31 = 78120. Also 21600 can be resolved into two factors prime to each other in 2 3_1 , or 4 ways. Example 2. If n is odd shew that n (n 2 - 1) is divisible by 24. We have n(n 2 - l) = 7i {n- 1) (n+1). Since n is odd, n - 1 and n+1 are two consecutive even numbers ; hence one of them is divisible by 2 and the other by 4. Again n - 1, n, n + 1 are three consecutive numbers ; hence one of them is divisible by 3. Thus the given expression is divisible by the product of 2, 3, and 4, that is, by 24. THEORY OF NUMBERS. 34\". Example 3. Find the highest power of 3 which is contained in J 100. Of the first 100 integers, as many are divisible by 3 as the number of times that 3 is contained in 100, that is, 33 ; and the integers are 3, G, 9,... 99. Of these, some contain the factor 3 again, namely 9, 18, 27,... 99, and their number is the quotient of 100 divided by 9. Some again of these last integers contain the factor 3 a third time, namely 27, 54, 81, the number of them being the quotient of 100 by 27. One number only, 81, contains the factor 3 four times. Hence the highest power required = 33 + 11 + 3 + 1 = 48. This example is a particular case of the theorem investigated in the next article. 416. To find the highest 'power of a prime number a which is contained in In. n iii n Let the greatest integer contained in -, — 2 , — tJ ... respectively Cv Ct CL be denoted by / ( -- ] , /(-,], /(-§),...

Similarly there are I[-A which contain a 2 at least once, and I ( — g ) which contain « 3 at least once; and so on. Hence the highest power of a contained in \\n is '©'©)*'6) + ~ 417.

Hence if the product of r — 1 consecutive integers is divisible by \\r — 1, we have P m+1 -P m = rM(\\r-l) = M(\\r). Now P, = |?', and therefore P 2 is a multiple of \\r \\ therefore also P. , P , . . . are multiples of (r. We have thus proved that if the product of r— 1 consecutive integers is divisible by \\r — 1, the product of r consecutive integers is divisible by \\r ; but the product of every two consecutive integers is divisible by 1 2 ; therefore the product of every three consecutive integers is divisible by 1 3 ; and so on generally. This proposition may also be proved thus : By means of Art. 416, we can shew that every prime factor is contained in \\n + r as often at least as it is contained in \\n \\r. This we leave as an exercise to the student. 419. If p is a prime number, the coefficient of every term in the expansion q/*(a + b) p , except the first and last, is divisible by p. \"With the exception of the first and last, every term has a co- efficient of the form p(p-l)(p-2)...(p-r + l) '- where r may have any integral value not exceeding p — 1. Now this expression is an integer; also since p is prime no factor of \\ r is a divisor of it, and since p is greater than r it cannot divide any factor of \\r ; that -is, (p — 1) (p — 2)... (p - r + 1) must be divisible by |r. Hence every coefficient except the first and the last is divisible by p. 420.

Since 7 is a prime, n 7 - n = M (7) ; a T 1S ° n? - n:=n (» G -l) = >i(n + l)(n-l)(n* + nS + l). Now (n - 1) n (n + 1) is divisible by |3 ; hence n? - n is divisible by 6 x 7, or 42.

If m is a prime number, and a, b two numbers less than m, prove that a m - 2 + a m ~ 3 b + a m - 4 b' i + + b m ~ 2 is a multiple of m. 423. If a is any number, then any other number N may be expressed in the form N = aq + r, where q is the integral quotient when N is divided by a, and r is a remainder less than a. The number a, to which the other is referred, is sometimes called the modulus ; and to any given modulus a there are a different 350 HIGHER ALGEBRA. forms of a number iV, each form corresponding to a different value of r. Thus to modulus 3, we have numbers of the form 3<7, 3q + l, 3q + 2; or, more simply, 3q, 3q±l, since 3q + 2 is equal to 3 (q+ 1) - 1. In like manner to modulus 5 any numbe^ will be one of the five forms 5q, 5q ± 1, 5q ± 2. 424. If 6, c are two integers, which when divided by a leave the same remainder, they are said to be congruent with respect to the modulus a. In this case b — c is a multiple of a, and following the notation of Gauss we shall sometimes express this as follows : b = c (mod. a), or b - c=0 (mod. a). Either of these formulae is called a congruence. 425. If b, c are congruent with respect to modulus a, then pb and pc are congruent, p being any integer. For, by supposition, b - c = ?za, where w is some integer ; therefore ])b — pc — pna ; which proves the proposition. 426. If a is prime to b, and the quantities a, 2a, 3a, (b — 1 ) a are divided by b, the remainders are all different. For if possible, suppose that two of the quantities ma and ma when divided by b leave the same remainder r, so that ma = qb + r, m'a = q'b + r ; then (m - 7/1') a = (q-q')b ; therefore b divides (m — m') a ; hence it must divide m — m', since it is prime to a ; but this is impossible since m and m' are each less than b. Thus the remainders are all different, and since none of the quantities is exactly divisible by b, the remainders must be the terms of the series 1, 2, 3, b — 1, but not necessarily in this order. Cor. If a is prime to b, and c is any number, the b terms of the a. p. c, c + a, c + 2a, c + (b — 1) a, THEORY OP NUMBERS. 351 when divided by b will leave the same remainders as the terms of the series c, c+ 1, c+ 2, c + (b- 1), though not necessarily in this order ; and therefore the re- mainders will be 0, 1, 2, b- 1. 427. -(/\"b., b.j b 3 , ... are respectively congruent to c n c„, c } , ... wn7A regard to modulus a, £/te?i //te products b,b a b a ..., ^c.c.^ ...

We can now give another proof of Fermat's Theorem. If p be a prime number and N prime to p, then N 1 ' -1 — 1 is a multiple of p. Since JV and p are prime to each other, the numbers if, 2tf, 3.V, (p-l)iV (1), when divided by p leave the remainders 1, 2, 3, (p-1) (2), though not necessarily in this order. Therefore the product of all the terms in (1) is congruent to the product of all the terms in (2), p being the modulus. That is, |^—1 N''~ i and \\p - 1 leave the same remainder when divided by p ; hence but i^—l is prime to p ; therefore it follows that JP\" 1 - 1 = M (j>). 429. We shall denote the number of integers less than a number a and prime to it by the symbol <f> (a) ; thus <f>(2) = 1 ; <£(13) = 12; </>(18) = G; the integers less than 18 and prime to it being 1, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. It will be seen that we here consider unity as prime to all numbers. 352 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 430. To shew that if the numbers a, b, c, d, ... are prime to each other, (f> (abccl . . .) = <£ (a) . </> (b) . <£ (c) . . . . Consider the product ab ; then the first ab numbers can be written in b lines, each line containing a numbers ; thus 1, 2, k, a, a+l, a + 2, a + k, a + a, 2a +1, 2a + 2, 2a + k, 2a + a, (&_ \\) a + 1, (6- 1) a + 2, ... (b-l)a + k, ... (b - 1) a + a. Let us consider the vertical column which begins with h ; if k is prime to a all the terms of this column will be prime to a ; but if k and a have a common divisor, no number in the column will be prime to a. Now the first row contains <£ (a) numbers prime to a \\ therefore there are <£ (a) vertical columns in each of which every term is prime to a ; let us suppose that the vertical column which begins with k is one of these. This column is an A. p., the terms of which when divided by b leave remainders 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 6 — 1 [Art. 426 Cor.]; hence the column contains <£ (b) integers prime to b. Similarly, each of the </> (a) vertical columns in which every term is prime to a contain <£ (b) integers prime to b ; hence in the table there are <f> (a) . cj> (b) integers which are prime to a and also to by and therefore to ab ; that is <£ (ab) - <£ (a) . <£ (6).

Shew that the sum of all the integers which are less than N and prime to it is ^N<p (N). If x is any integer less than N and prime to it, then N-x is also an integer less than N and prime to it. Denote the integers by 1, p, q, r, ... , and their sum by S; then S = l+p + q + r+... + (N-r) + {N-q) + (N-p) + {N-l), the series consisting of (N) terms. Writing the series in the reverse order, S = {N-l) + (N-p) + (N-q) + (N-r)+...+r + q+p + l; .-. by addition, 2S = N + N + N+ ... to <p (N) terms; .-. S = $N<p(N). 432.

Further, every integer is reckoned once, and once only ; thus, each multiple of ab will appear once among the multiples of a, once among the multiples of b, and once negatively among the multiples of ab, and is thus reckoned once only. iV N N Again, each multiple of abc will appear among the — , j- , — a o c terms which are multiples of a, b, c respectively; among the JV & iV — , — , =- terms which are multiples of ab, ac, be respectively ; ab' ac' be r ' r J ' and among the -j- multiples of abc; that is, since 3-3+1 = 1, each multiple of abc occurs once, and once only. Similarly, other cases may be discussed. 433. [Wilson's Theorem.] If -p be a prime number, 1 + \\p - 1 » is divisible by p. By Ex. 2, Art. 314 we have Ijp-1 = (P~ i)\"\" 1 - (P - i) (P - 2r ' + ^z^ipD (p - $y-> Jp-l)(p 2)(p-3) {p _ irl+ top _ lterms . and by Fermat's Theorem each of tlie expressions (j) - l) p ~ l , (p-2) p ~\\ (p-2>y~\\ ... is of the form 1 +M(p)-, thus p-l = M(p) +fl-(p-l) + (P~ l )(P~ 2 ) -...top- I terms! =M(p) + {(i-iy->-(-iy->} = M(p) — 1, since p — 1 is even. Therefore 1 + I p - 1 = M (p). This theorem is only true when p is prime. For suppose p has a factor q; then q is less than p and must divide \\p — 1 ; hence 1 + \\p — 1 is not a multiple of q, and therefore not a multiple of p. Wilson's Theorem may also be proved without using the result quoted from Art. 314, as in the following article. THEORY OF NUMBERS. ,'}:>5 434. [Wilson's Theorem.] If p be a prime number, 1 + lp— 1 is divisible by p. Let a denote any one of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 5 ... (p-1) (1), then a is prime to p, and if the products \\.a, 2. a, 3. a, (^; — 1 ) a are divided by p, one and only one of them leaves the re- mainder 1. [Art. 426.] Let this be the product ma; then we can shew that the numbers m and a are different unless a=j)~ 1 or 1- For if a 2 were to give remainder 1 on division by^>, we should have a~ - 1 = (mod. p), and since p is prime, this can only be the case when a + 1 - p, or a — 1 — 0; that is, when a=p— 1 or 1. Hence one and only one of the products 2a, 3a, ... (p — 2) a gives remainder 1 when divided by p ; that is, for any one of the series of numbers in (1), excluding the first and last, it is possible to find one other, such that the product of the pair is of the form M (p) + 1 . Therefore the integers 2, 3, 4, ... (p-2), the number of which is even, can be associated in pairs such that the product of each pair is of the form M (j?) + 1 . Therefore by multiplying all these pairs together, we have 2.3.4 ... (p-2) = M(p) + l; thatis, 1.2.3.4 ... (p-l) = (p-l){M(p) + l} ; whence \\p - 1 = M (p) +p - 1 j or 1 + 1^ — 1 is a multiple of p. Cor. If 2p + l is a prime number /jp\\ 2 + (- iy i s divisible by 2p + l. For by Wilson's Theorem 1 + \\2p is divisible by 2p + 1 . Put n = 2p + 1, so that p+ 1 = n —p ; then \\2p = 1.2.3.4 p(p+l)(p + 2) (n-1) = 1 (w-1) 2(n-2) 3(»-3) ... p (n-p) = a multiple of n + (- iy (\\p) 2 . Therefore 1 + ( - l) p (\\p) 2 is divisible by n or 2p + 1, and therefore (|^) 2 + (— l/ is divisible by 2;;+l. 23—2 356 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 435. Many theorems relating to the properties of numbers can be proved by induction. Example 1 . If p is a prime number, x p - x is divisible by p. Let x p - x be denoted by f(x) ; then / (x + 1) -/ (x) = {x + 1)p - (x + 1) - {xP - x) =px p ~ l + P< f~ 1) * p \" 2 + . . . +px J. • a = a multiple of p, if p is prime [Art. 419.] .-. f(x + 1) =f(x) + a multiple of p. If therefore/^) is divisible by^i, so also is/(.r + l); but /(2) = 2* 5 ~ 2 = (1 + 1)^-2, and this is a multiple of p when p is prime [Art. 419] ; therefore / (3) is divisible by p, therefore /(4) is divisible by^, and so on; thus the proposition is true universally. This furnishes another proof of Fermat's theorem, for if x is prime to p, it follows that x p ~ J - 1 is a multiple of p. Example 2. Prove that 5 2,l + 2 - 24/i - 25 is divisible by 576. Let 5 2n+2 - 24?i - 25 be denoted by f(n) ; then /(?i+l) = 5 2n+4 -24(w + l)-25 = 5 2 .5 2w + 2 -24n-49; .-. f(n+l) - 25/ (n) =25 (24n + 25) - 24u - 49 = 576 (n + 1). Therefore if f(n) is divisible by 576, so also is /(u + 1); but by trial we see that the theorem is true when n = l, therefore it is true when n=2, there- fore it is true when ?i = 3, and so on; thus it is true universally. The above result may also be proved as follows : 52n+2 _ 2in - 25 = 25 M + 1 - 24;i - 25 = 25 (1 + 24)\" -24rc-25 = 25 + 25 . n . 24 + M (24 2 ) - 24n - 25 = 576n + iW(576) = i)/(576). EXAMPLES.

In In-} By reasoning as in Art. 335, we may shew that every con- vergent of an odd order is greater than the continued fraction, and every convergent of an even order is less than the continued fraction ; hence every convergent of an odd order is greater than every convergent of an even order.

Suppose now that the number of components is infinite, then the convergents of an odd order must tend to some finite limit, and the convergents of an even order must also tend to some finite limit ; if these limits are equal the continued fraction tends to one definite limit ; if they are not equal, the odd convergents tend to one limit, and the even convergents tend to a different limit, and the continued fraction may be said to be oscillating; in this case the continued fraction is the symbolical representation of two quantities, one of which is the limit of the odd, and the other that of the even convergents. 362 HIGHER ALGEBRA. *441.

Thus A, B, C, D, ... form an infinite series of positive integers in descending order of magnitude ; which is absurd. Hence the given fraction cannot be commensurable. The above result still holds if some of the components are not proper fractions, provided that from and after a fixed com- ponent all the others are proper fractions.

Definition. If an event can happen in a ways and fail in b ways, and each of these ways is equally likely, the probability, or the chance, of its happening is z , and that of its failing is r r ° a + b G a + b ' For instance, if in a lottery there are 7 prizes and 25 blanks, . 7 the chance that a person holding 1 ticket will win a prize is — , 25 and his chance of not winning is — . Oa 450. The reason for the mathematical definition of pro- bability may be made clear by the following considerations : If an event can happen in a ways and fail to happen in b ways, and all these ways are equally likely, we can assert that the chance of its happening is to the chance of its failing as a to b. Thus if the chance of its happening is represented by ka, where k is an undetermined constant, then the chance of its failing will be represented by kb. .-. chance of happening + chance of failing = k (a + b) Now the event is certain to happen or to fail ; therefore the sum of the chances of happening and failing must represent certainty. If therefore we agree to take certainty as our unit, we have 1 = k (a + b), or k — T : v ' a + b .-. the chance that the event will happen is and the chance that the event will not happen is a + b b a + b Cor. If p is the probability of the happening of an event, the probability of its not happening is 1 — p. 374 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 451. Instead of saying that the chance of the happening of an event is T , it is sometimes stated that the odds are a to b a + o in favour of the event , or b to a against the event. 452. The definition of probability in Art. 449 may be given in a slightly different form which is sometimes Useful. If c is the total number of cases, each being equally likely to occur, and of these a are favourable to the event, then the probability that the event will happen is - , and the probability that it will not c happen is 1 . Example 1. What is the chance of throwing a number greater than 4 with an ordinary die whose faces are numbered from 1 to 6? There are 6 possible ways in which the die can fall, and of these two are favourable to the event required ; therefore the required chance = - = - . Example 2. From a bag containing 4 white and 5 black balls a man draws 3 at random ; what are the odds against these being all black ? The total number of ways in which 3 balls can be drawn is 9 <7 3 , and the number of ways of drawing 3 black balls is 5 C 3 ; therefore the chance of drawing 3 black balls ~*C % ~ 9.8.7 = 42 ' Thus the odds against the event are 37 to 5. Example 3. Find the chance of throwing at least one ace in a single throw with two dice. The possible number of cases is 6 x 6, or 36. An ace on one die may be associated with any of the 6 numbers on the other die, and the remaining 5 numbers on the first die may each be asso- ciated with the ace on the second die ; thus the number of favourable cases is 11. Therefore the required chance is — . 3b Or we may reason as follows : There are 5 ways in which each die can be thrown so as not to give an ace ; hence 25 throws of the two dice will exclude aces. That is, the chance 25 of not throwing one or more aces is ^ ; so that the chance of throwing one 36 ace at least is 1 - ^ , or ^, do oo PROBABILITY. 375 Example 4. Find the chance of throwing more than 15 in one throw with 3 dice. A throw amounting to 18 must be made up of 6, G, G, and this can occur in 1 way; 17 can be made up of G, G, 5 which can occur in 3 ways; 16 may be made up of G, G, 4 and 6, 5, 5, each of which arrangements can occur in 3 ways. Thereforo the number of favourable cases is 1 + 3 + 3 + 3, or 10. And the total number of cases is 6 3 , or 21G; therefore the required chance =^ = 21G 108 Example 5. A has 3 shares in a lottery in which there are 3 prizes and 6 blanks ; B has 1 share in a lottery in which there is 1 prize and 2 blanks : shew that A's chance of success is to ZJ's as 1G to 7. A may draw 3 prizes in 1 way ; 3 2 he may draw 2 prizes and 1 blank in —^— x 6 ways : JL • m 6 . 5 he may draw 1 prize and 2 blanks in 3 x -r-^r ways ; JL • m the sum of these numbers is 64, which is the number of ways in which A can 9.8.7 win a prize. Also he can draw 3 tickets in ' ' , or 84 ways ; therefore -4's chance of success = — r = — - . 84 21 Z»\"s chance of success is clearly - ; o 1 C 1 therefore A 's chance : B's chancer— : - — L O = 16 : 7. 6.5.4 Or we might have reasoned thus: A will get all blanks in * ' , or 20 5 20 ways ; the chance of which is —-. , or — ; J ' 84 21 therefore A's chance of success = 1 -— = -—. — 1 ZL 453. Suppose that there are a number of events A, B, C,..., of which one must, and only one can, occur ; also suppose that a, b, c, ... are the numbers of ways respectively in which these events can happen, and that each of these ways is equally likely to occur ; it is required to find the chance of eacli event. The total number of equally possible ways is a + b + c+ ..., and of these the number favourable to A is a; hence the chance 376 HIGHER ALGEBRA. that A will happen is = . Similarly the chance that B rr a + b + c+ ... J will happen is -. : and so on. ri a + b + c + ... 454. From the examples we have given it will be seen that the solution of the easier kinds of questions in Probability requires nothing more than a knowledge of the definition of Probability, and the application of the laws of Permutations and Combina- tions.

Generalize this result in the case of m shillings and n half-crowns. 455. We have hitherto considered only those occurrences which in the language of Probability are called Single events. When two or more of these occur in connection with each other, the joint occurrence is called a Confound event. For example, suppose we have a bag containing 5 white and 8 black balls, and two drawings, each of three balls, are made from it successively. If we wish to estimate the chance of chawing first 3 white and then 3 black balls, w^e should be dealing with a compound event. In such a case the result of the second drawing might or might not be dependent on the result of the first. If the balls are not replaced after being drawn, then if the first drawing gives 3 white balls, the ratio of the black to the white balls remaining is greater than if the first drawing had not given three white; thus the chance of drawing 3 black balls at the second trial is affected by the result of the first. But if the balls are re- placed after being drawn, it is clear that the result of the second drawing is not in any way affected by the result of the first. We are thus led to the following definition : Events are said to be dependent or independent according as the occurrence of one does or does not affect the occurrence of the others. Dependent events are sometimes said to be contingent. 378 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 456. If there are two independent events the respective pro- babilities of which are known, to find the probability that both will happen. Suppose that the first event may happen in a ways and fail in b ways, all these cases being equally likely ; and suppose that the second event may happen in a' ways and fail in b' ways, all these ways being equally likely. Each of the a + b cases may be associated with each of the a + b' cases, to form (a + b) (a! + b') compound cases all equally likely to occur. In aa' of these both events happen, in bb' of them both fail, in ab' of them the first happens and the second fails, and in a'b of them the first fails and the second happens. Thus aa (a + b){a'+b') bb' (a + b)(a+b') ab' (a + b)(a'+b') a'b (a + b)(a'+b') is the chance that both events happen ; is the chance that both events fail ; is the chance that the first happens and the second fails ; is the chance that the first fails and the second happens. Thus if the respective chances of two independent events are p and p\\ the chance that both will happen is pp'. Similar reasoning will apply in the case of any number of independent events. Hence it is easy to see that if p lf p 2 , p 3 , ... are the respective chances that a number of independent events will separately happen, the chance that they will all happen is p x p 2 p 3 ... ; the chance that the two first will happen and the rest fail is 2\\Po (1 — P 3 ) (1 —pj'- > an d similarly for any other par- ticular case. 457. If p is the chance that an event will happen in one trial, the chance that it will happen in any assigned suc- cession of r trials is p r ' ; this follows from the preceding article by supposing P 1 =P 2 =P 3 = =P- To find the chance that some one at least of the events will happen we proceed thus : the chance that all the events fail is (1 -p x ) (1 -]).,) (1 -p 3 ) -.-j and except in this case some one of the events must happen ; hence the required chance is PROBABILITY. 379 Example 1. Two drawings, each of 3 balls, arc made from a bag con- taining 5 wbitc and 8 black balls, the balls being replaced before tbe second trial : find the chance that the first drawing will give 3 white, and the second 3 black balls. The number of ways in which 3 balls may be drawn is 13 C 3 ; 3white 5C.,; 3black *C Z .

In tossing a coin, find the chance of throwing head and tail alternately in 3 successive trials. Here the first throw must give either head or tail ; the chance that the second gives the opposite to the first is - , and the chance that the third throw is the same as the first is ^ . Therefore the chance of the compound event =- x = = -j . 2 2 4 Example 3. Supposing that it is 9 to 7 against a person A who is now 35 years of age living till he is 65, and 3 to 2 against a person B now 45 living till he is 75 ; find the chance that one at least of these persons will be alive 30 years hence. 9 The chance that A will die within 30 years is — ; 3 the chance that B will die within 30 years is ^ ; 9 3 27 therefore the chance that both will die is ^ x '- , or — - ; lb o 8U therefore the chance that both will not be dead, that is that one at least will . .. . , 27 53 be alive, >sl-8o> or-. 458. By a slight modification of the meaning of the symbols in Art. 45G, we are enabled to estimate the probability of the concurrence of two dependent events. For suppose that when the first event has happened^ a denotes the number of ways in which the second event can follow, and b' the number of ways in which it will not follow ; then the number of ways in which the two 380 HIGHER ALGEBRA. events can happen together is aa\\ and the probability of their aa concurrence is -. 7 , , , — tr • (« + o) (a + o ) Thus if p is the probability of the first event, and p' the contingent probability that the second will follow, the probability of the concurrence of the two events is pp . Example 1. In a hand at whist find the chance that a specified player holds both the king and queen of trumps. Denote the player by A ; then the chance that A has the king is clearly 13 ^; for this particular card can be dealt in 52 different ways, 13 of which fall to A. The chance that, when he has the king, he can also hold the queen is 12 then — : for the queen can be dealt in 51 ways, 12 of which fall to A. ol m * « , . n 13 12 1 Therefore the chance required = — x ^ = --- . u 52 ol 17 Or we might reason as follows : The number of ways in which the king and the queen can be dealt to A is equal to the number of permutations of 13 things 2 at a time, or 13 . 12.

Two drawings, each of 3 balls, are made from a bag con- taining 5 white and 8 black balls, the balls not being replaced before the second trial: find the chance that the first drawing will give 3 white and the second 3 black balls.

PROBABILITY. 381 459. If an event can happen in ttvo or more different ways which are mutually exclusive, the chance that it wilt happen is the sum of the chances of its happening in these different ways. This is sometimes regarded as a self-evident proposition arising immediately out of the definition of probability. It may, how- ever, be proved as follows : Suppose the event can happen in two Avays which cannot concur ; and let ^ , =* be the chances of the happening of the event in these two ways respectively. Then out of bfi 2 cases there are a x b 2 in which the event may happen in the first way, and a b J ways in which the event may happen in the second; and tliese ivays cannot concur. Therefore in all, out of b l b 2 cases there are a,b„ + a k ,b, cases favourable to the event: hence the chance that the event will happen in one or other of the two ways is a x b 2 + a 2 b x a_ x a, bh 6, bf 12 Similar reasoning will apply whatever be the number of ex- clusive ways in which the event can happen. Hence if an event can happen in n ways which are mutually exclusive, and if p lt p a , p^ ---Pn are the probabilities that the event will happen in these different ways respectively, the pro- bability that it will happen in some one of these ways is Pi+Pl+Pa* +Pn- Example 1. Find the chance of throwing 9 at least in a single throw with two dice. 4 9 can be made up in 4 ways, and thus the chance of throwing 9 is , . 3 10 can be made up in 3 ways, and thus the chance of throwing 10 is ^ . 2 11 can be made up in 2 ways, and thus the chance of throwing 11 is-- . 12 can be made up in 1 way, and thus the chance of throwing 12 is -^ . Now the chance of throwing a number not less than 9 is the sum of these separate chances ; .*. the required chance = <V/ . = n . ou lb 382 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 2. One purse contains 1 sovereign and 3 shillings, a second purse contains 2 sovereigns and 4 shillings, and a third contains 3 sovereigns and 1 shilling. If a coin is taken out of one of the purses selected at random, find the chance that it is a sovereign. Since each purse is equally likely to be taken, the chance of selecting the first is - ; and the chance of then drawing a sovereign is - ; hence the chance of drawing a sovereign so far as it depends upon the first purse is - x j , or =^ . Similarly the chance of drawing a sovereign so far as it 3 4 12 12 1 depends on the second purse is - x - , or - ; and from the third purse the 3 6 9 13 1 chance of drawing a sovereign is - x - , or - ; .-. the required chance = — + - + -. = - . x*5 y tc o 460. In the preceding article we have seen that the pro- bability of an event may sometimes be considered as the sum of the probabilities of two or more separate events ; but it is very important to notice that the probability of one or other of a series of events is the sum of the probabilities of the separate events only when the events are mutually exclusive, that is, when the occurrence of one is incompatible with the occurrence of any of the others. Example. From 20 tickets marked with the first 20 numerals, one is drawn at random : find the chance that it is a multiple of 3 or of 7. The chance that the number is a multiple of 3 is — , and the chance that 2 it is a multiple of 7 is — ; and these events are mutually exclusive, hence the . , , 6 2 2 required chance is — + -^ , or - . But if the question had been: find the chance that the number is a multiple of 3 or of 5, it would have been incorrect to reason as follows : Because the chance that the number is a multiple of 3 is — , and the 4 chance that the number is a multiple of 5 is — , therefore the chance that 6 4 1 it is a multiple of 3 or 5 is ^ + ^ , or - . For the number on the ticket might be a multiple both of 3 and of 5, so that the two events considered are not mutually exclusive. 461. It should be observed that the distinction between simple and compound events is in many cases a purely artificial PROBABILITY. 383 one ; in fact it often amounts to nothing more than a distinction between two different modes of viewing the same occurrence. Example. A bag contains 5 white and 7 black balls; if two balls arc drawn what is the chance that one is white and the other black? (i) Regarding the occurrence as a simple event, the chance = (5*7H.=C 2 = 6 - 6 . (ii) The occurrence may be regarded as the happening of one or other of the two following compound events : (1) drawing a white and then a black ball, the chance of which is 12 * 11 ° r 132 ; (2) drawing a black and then a white ball, the chance of which is 7 5 35 i2 X ir 0r 132' And since these events are mutually exclusive, the required chance j$5 ^5_ _35 - 132 + 132~66' It will be noticed that we have here assumed that the chance of drawing two specified balls successively is the same as if they were drawn simul- taneously. A little consideration will shew that this must be the case. EXAMPLES. XXXII. b. 1. What is the chance of throwing an ace in the first only of two successive throws with an ordinary die ? 2.

If on an average 1 vessel in every 10 is wrecked, find the chance that out of 5 vessels expected 4 at least will arrive safely. PROBABILITY. 385 462. The probability of the happening of an event in one trial being known, required the probability of its happening once, twice, three times, ... exactly in n trials. Let p be the probability of the happening of the event in a single trial, and let q = 1 -p\\ then the probability that the event will happen exactly r times in n trials is the (r + l) th term in the expansion of (q + p)*. For if we select any particular set of r trials out of the total number n, the chance that the event will happen in every one of these r trials and fail in all the rest is p r q\"~ [Art. 456], and as a set of r trials can be selected in n C r ways, all of which are equally applicable to the case in point, the required chance is C r p q . If we expand (/; + q)\" by the Binomial Theorem, we have 2f + \"C 1 2) n - 1 q + n C jS'- 2 q 2 + ... +\"C n _ r p r q\"- r + ... + q n ; thus the terms of this series will represent respectively the probabilities of the happening of the event exactly n times, n — 1 times, n — 2 times, ... inn trials. 463. If the event happens n times, or fails only once, twice, ... (n — r) times, it happens r times or more ; therefore the chance that it happens at least r times in n trials is P n + \"Cy-*q + \"C aP n -Y+ ... tv^r. or the sum of the first n — r + 1 terms of the expansion of Example 1. In four throws with a pair of dice, what is the chanco of throwing doublets twice at least ? c i In a single throw the chance of doublets is -^ , or ^ ; and the chance of do o 5 failing to throw doublets is ^ . Now the required event follows if doublets are thrown four times, three times, or twice ; therefore the required chanco /l 5\\ 4 is the sum of the first three terms of the expansion of h+d . 1 19 Thus the chance = — (1 + 4.5 + 6.5-)= -^ . H. H. A. 25 386 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 2. A bag contains a certain number of balls, some of which are white; a ball is drawn and replaced, another is then drawn and replaced; and so on : if p is the chance of drawing a white ball in a single trial, find the number of white balls that is most likely to have been drawn in n trials. The chance of drawing exactly r white balls is n C r p r q n - r , and we have to find for what value of r this expression is greatest. Now n C r p r q n - r > n C r - l p r - l q n - (r ~ l \\ so long as (n-r + l)p>rq, or (n + l)p>(p + q)r. But p + 5 = 1; hence the required value of r is the greatest integer in p[n + l). If n is such that pn is an integer, the most likely case is that of pn successes and qn failures. 464. Suppose that there are n tickets in a lottery for a prize of £x; then since each ticket is equally likely to win the prize, and a person who possessed all the tickets must win, the money value of x each ticket is £ - : in other words this would be a fair sum to n pay for each ticket; hence a person who possessed r tickets might TX reasonably expect £ — as the price to be paid for his tickets by any one who wished to buy them; that is, he would estimate £- x as the worth of his chance. It is convenient then to in- n troduce the following definition : If p represents a person's chance of success in any venture and M the sum of money which he will receive in case of success, the sum of money denoted by pM is called his expectation. 465. In the same way that expectation is used in reference to a person, we may conveniently use the phrase probable value applied to things. Example 1. One purse contains 5 shillings and 1 sovereign : a second purse contains 6 shillings. Two coins are taken from the first and placed in the second ; then 2 are taken from the second and placed in the first : find the probable value of the contents of each purse.

If A has the first throw, what are their respective expectations? 1 5 5 1 In his first throw A' a chance is - ; in his second it is -^ x - x - , because b o 6 each player must have failed once before A can have a second throw ; in his /5\\ 4 1 third throw his chance is ( - J x ^ because each player must have failed twice; and so on. Thus A's chance is the sum of the infinite series 5MKi© 4+ }• Similarly #'s chance is the sum of the infinite series WM» ,+ G) 4 * J- .-. A' a chance is to 7>\"s as G is to 5; their respective chances are therefore -- and =y, and their expectations are £6 and £5 respectively. 26— 8 388 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 466. We shall now give two problems which lead to useful and interesting results. Example 1. Two players A and B want respectively m and n points of winning a set of games ; their chances of winning a single game are p and q respectively, where the sum of p and q is unity ; the stake is to belong to the player who first makes up his set : determine the probabilities in favour of each player. Suppose that A wins in exactly m + r games; to do this he must win the last game and m-1 out of the preceding m + r-1 games. The chance of this is ™+^- 1 m _ 1 p™- 1 q r 2 h or m ^~ 1 C m - 1 p m q r . Now the set will necessarily be decided in m + n - 1 games, and A may win his m games in exactly m games, or m+ 1 games, ... , or m + n - 1 games; therefore we shall obtain the chance that A wins the set by giving to r the values 0, 1, 2, ... n - 1 in the expression m+r - 1 C m _ 1 p m q r . Thus A J s chance is similarly B's chance is n(nA-l\\ \\m + n-2 ) 1.2 * jm-1 ii This question is known as the \" Problem of Points,\" and has engaged the attention of many of the most eminent mathematicians since the time of Pascal. It was originally proposed to Pascal by the Chevalier de Mere in 1654, and was discussed by Pascal and Fermat, but they confined themselves to the case in which the players were supposed to be of equal skill : their results were also exhibited in a different form. The formulae we have given are assigned to Montmort, as they appear for the first time in a work of his published in 1714. The same result was afterwards ob- tained in different ways by Lagrange and Laplace, and by the latter the problem was treated very fully under various modi- fications. Example 2. There are n dice with / faces marked from 1 to /; if these are thrown at random, what is the chance that the sum of the numbers exhibited shall be equal to p? Since any one of the / faces may be exposed on any one of the n dice, the number of ways in which the dice may fall is / n . Also the number of ways in which the numbers thrown will have p for their sum is equal to the coefficient of x p in the expansion of {x l + x* + x 3 + ... + x f ) n \\ for this coefficient arises out of the different ways in which n of the indices 1, 2, 3, .../can be taken so as to form p by addition. PROBABILITY. 3-S!) Now the above expression = x 11 (l + x + x 2 + ... + x f ')\" -(£?)\" We have therefore to find the coefficient of x p ~ n in the expansion of (I - x') n (I - x)~ n . . t n(n-l) .,. n(n-l)(n-2) .,, v « , »(n+l) „ ?t(»+l)(w + 2) _ and <1 - .r) -\" = 1 + nx + * ' a; 2 + . 1 ^ 3 — x 3 +...

The required probability is obtained by dividing this series by/ n . This problem is due to De Moivre and was published by him in 1730 j it illustrates a method of frequent utility. Laplace afterwards obtained the same formula, but in a much more laborious manner ; he applied it in an attempt to demon- strate the existence of a primitive cause which has made the planets to move in orbits close to the ecliptic, and in the same direction as the earth round the sun. On this point the reader may consult Todhunter's History of Probability, Art. 987. EXAMPLES. XXXII. c. 1.

In all the cases we have hitherto considered it lias been supposed that our knowledge of the causes which may produce a certain event is sucli as to enable us to determine the chance of the happening of the event. We have now to consider problems of a different character. For example, if it is known that an event has happened in consequence of some one of a certain number of causes, it may be required to estimate the probability of each cause being the true one, and thence to deduce the pro- bability of future events occurring under the operation of the same causes. *468. Before discussing the general case we shall give a numerical illustration. Suppose there are two purses, one containing 5 sovereigns and 3 shillings, the other containing 3 sovereigns and 1 shilling, and suppose that a sovereign lias been drawn : it is required to find the chance that it came from the first or second purse. Consider a very large number iV of trials ; then, since before the event eacli of the purses is equally likely to be taken, we may assume that the first purse would be chosen in ^ iV of the trials, 5 and in - of these a sovereign would be drawn ; thus a sovereign 8 ° 5 1 5 would be drawn - x ~iV, or —N times from the first purse. o 1 lb The second purse would be chosen in - N of the trials, and in 3 j of these a sovereign would be drawn ; thus a sovereign would 3 be drawn -JV times from the second purse. Now JV is very large but is otherwise an arbitrary number ; let us put iV-16n; thus a sovereign would be drawn 5 n times from the first purse, and Qn times from the second purse; that is, out of the lln times in which a sovereign is drawn it comes from the first purse bn times, and from the second purse 0?i 392 HIGHER ALGEBRA. times. Hence the probability that the sovereign came from the 5 first purse is — , and the probability that it came from the A' 6 second is rr. *469. It is important that the student's attention should be directed to the nature of the assumption that has been made in the preceding article. Thus, to take a particular instance, although in 60 throws with a perfectly symmetrical die it may not happen that ace is thrown exactly 10 times, yet it will doubtless be at once admitted that if the number of throws is continually increased the ratio of the number of aces to the number of throws will tend more and more nearly to the limit — . There is no reason why one face should appear oftener than 6 another ; hence in the long run the number of times that each of the six faces will have appeared will be approximately equal. The above instance is a particular case of a general theorem which is due to James Bernoulli, and was first given in the Ars Conjectandi, published in 1713, eight years after the author's death. Bernoulli's theorem may be enunciated as follows : If p is the probability that an event happens in a single trial, then if the number of trials is indefinitely increased, it becomes a certainty that the limit of the ratio of the number of successes to the number of trials is equal to p ; in other words, if the number of trials is N, the number of successes may be taken to be pN. See Todhunter's History of Probability, Chapter vn. A proof of Bernoulli's theorem is given in the article Probability in the Encyclopaedia Britannica. *470. An observed event has Jiappened through, some one of a number of mutually exclusive causes : required to find the . pro- bability of any assigned cause being the true one. Let there be n causes, and before the event took place ' suppose that the probability of the existence of these causes was estimated at P x , P 2 , P 3 , ... P n . Let p r denote the probability that when the r* 1 * cause exists the event will follow : after the event has occurred it is required to find the probability that the r th cause was the true one. PROBABILITY. 393 Consider a \\ cry great number JV of trials ; then the first cause exists in P X N of these, and out of this number the event follows in p x P x N j similarly there are p^^N trials in which the event follows from the second cause; and so on for each of the other causes. Hence the number of trials in which the event follows is ;md the number in which the event was due to the r th cause is 'P,.I\\N ', lience after the event the probability that the r th cause was the true one is pJPjr+NUpP); tli at is, the probability that the event was produced by the r\"' PrK cause is Mvn *471. It is necessary to distinguish clearly between the pro- bability of the existence of the several causes estimated before the event, and the probability after the event has happened of any assigned cause being the true one. The former are usually called a priori probabilities and are represented by P x , P , P . ... P n \\ the latter are called a posteriori probabilities, and if we denote them by Q t1 Q„, Q 3 , ... Q Hf we have proved that Qr 2 ( P P) ' where p r denotes the probability of the event on the hypothesis of the existence of the r th cause. From this result it appears that S (Q) = lj which is other- wise evident as the event has happened from one and only one of the causes. We shall now give another proof of the theorem of the pre- ceding article which does not depend on the principle enunciated in Art. 469. *472. An observed event has happened through some one of a member of mutually exclusive causes : required to find the pro- bability of any assigned cause being the true one. Let there be n causes, and before the event took place suppose that the probability of the existence of these causes was estimated at P t , P 2 , P z , ... P n . Let p r denote the probability that when the ?- th cause exists the event will follow ; then the antecedent proba- bility that the event would follow from the r th cause is p r P r . 394 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Let Q r be the a posteriori probability that the r th cause was the true one; then the probability that the r th cause was the true one is proportional to the probability that, if in existence, this cause would produce the event ; . A._JL = _ <?» . s(<?) _ i . \" pA pA '\" p. p , Hp p ) s( P P)' Pr p r <?,= 2 (pP) Hence it appears that in the present class of problems the product P r p r , will have to be correctly estimated as a first step; in many cases, however, it will be found that P lt P 2 , P 3 , ... are all equal, and the work is thereby much simplified. Example. There are 3 bags each containing 5 white balls and 2 black balls, and 2 bags each containing 1 white ball and 4 black balls : a black ball having been drawn, find the chance that it came from the first group. Of the five bags, 3 belong to the first group and 2 to the second ; hence If a bag is selected from the first group the chance of drawing a black 2 4 2 4 ball is - ; if from the second group the chance is - ; thus p x = - , p. 2 = ; 7 o / o p 6 ^ \" lh 1_ 3o' lh 2 ~~25' Hence the chance that the black ball came from one of the first group is JL^/A 8\\15 35 ' \\35\" h 25/ 43* *473. When an event has been observed, we are able by the method of Art. 472 to estimate the probability of any particular cause being the true one ; we may then estimate the probability of the event happening in a second trial, or we may find the probability of the occurrence of some other event. For example, p r is the chance that the event will happen from the r th cause if in existence, and the chance that the r th cause is the true one is Q r ; hence on a second trial the chance that the event will happen from the r th cause is p r Q r . Therefore the chance that the event will happen from some one of the causes on a second trial is 2 (2 } Q)' PROBABILITY. 395 Example. A purse contains 4 coins which arc either sovereigns or shillings; 2 coins are drawn and found to be shillings: if these are replaced what is the chance that another drawing will give a sovereign? This question may be interpreted in two ways, which we shall discuss separately. I. If we consider that all numbers of shillings are a priori equally likely, we shall have three hypotheses; for (i) all the coins may be shillings, (ii) three of them may be shillings, (iii) only two of them may be shillings. Here P^P.^P.^; also ^ = 1, J> a =g, P»=q- Hence probability of iirst hypothesis = 1-5- (1 + o + r) — tTv^ Qi> probability of second hypothesis = o ^ ( * + 2 + f ) = To ~ ^' J ' probability of third hypothesis — - -f- ( 1 + ~ + .- ) =T7\\=Qy Therefore the probability that another drawing will give a sovereign 1 3_ 2 1_ 5^ 1 ~4 *10 + 4 'To~40 - 8* II.

We shall now shew how the theory of probability may be applied to estimate the truth of statements attested by wit- nesses whose credibility is assumed to be known. We shall suppose that each witness states what he believes to be the truth, whether his statement is the result of observation, or deduction, or experiment; so that any mistake or falsehood must be attributed to errors of judgment and not to wilful deceit. The class of problems we shall discuss furnishes a useful intellectual exercise, and although the results cannot be regarded as of any practical importance, it will be found that they confirm the verdict of common sense. *475. When it is asserted that the probability that a person speaks the truth is p, it is meant that a large number of state- ments made by him has been examined, and that p is the ratio of those which are true to the whole number. *476. Two independent witnesses, A and B, whose proba- bilities of speaking the truth are p and p' respectively, agree in making a certain statement : what is the probability that the statement is true % Here the observed event is the fact that A and B make the same statement. Before the event there are four hypotheses ; for A and B may both speak truly ; or A may speak truly, B falsely; or A may speak falsely, B truly ; or A and B may both speak falsely. The probabilities of these four hypotheses are PP\\ p( l ~P\\ P'Q-P)* ( 1 -P)( 1 ~P') respectively. Hence after the observed event, in which A and B make the same statement, the probability that the statement is true is to the probability that it is false as pp to (1 - p) (1 -p') ; that is, the probability that the joint statement is true is pp' statement is true is ./„// ppp ppY + {1-p){i-p')(i-p\") } and so on for any number of persons. pp' + (l-p)(l-p')' Similarly if a third person, whose probability of speaking the truth is p\", makes the same statement, the probability that the PROBABILITY. 397 *477. In the preceding article it lias been supposed that we have no knowledge of the event except the statement made by A and B ; if we have information from other sources as to the probability of the truth or falsity of the statement, this must be taken into account in estimating the probability of the various hypotheses. For instance, if A and B agree in stating a fact, of which the a priori probability is P, then we should estimate the pro- bability of the truth and falsity of the statement by Ppp* and (1 - P) (1 — p>) (1 — p') respectively. Example. There is a raffle with 12 tickets and two prizes of £9 and £3. A, B, C, whose probabilities of speaking the truth are ^, §, f respectively, report the result to D, who holds one ticket. A and B assert that he has won the £9 prize, and C asserts that he has won the £3 prize; what is D's expectation? Three cases are possible; D may have won £9, £3, or nothing, for A, B, C may all have spoken falsely. Now with the notation of Art. 472, we have the a priori probabilities P-i P-A P-™. *i- 12 « *a-l2' ^ 3 ~12' 12 24 1133 1 1 2_ 2 also Pi~2 X 3 X 5-30> **~~2 X 3 X 5 ~ 30 ' A_ 2 * 3 X 5~3() ; \" 4 3 20 27' 4 3 hence D's expectation =— of £9 + — of £3 =£1. 13s. id. *478. With respect to the results proved in Art. 47G, it should be noticed that it was assumed that the statement can be made in two ways only, so that if all the witnesses tell falsehoods they agree in telling the same falsehood. If this is not the case, let us suppose that c is the chance that the two witnesses A and B will agree in telling the same falsehood ; then the probability that the statement is true is to the probability that it is false as pp' to c (1 —p) (1 — p'). As a general rule, it is extremely improbable that two independent witnesses will tell the same falsehood, so that c is usually very small; also it is obvious that the quantity c becomes smaller as the number of witnesses becomes greater. These con- siderations increase the probability that a statement asserted by two or more independent witnesses is true, even though the credibility of each witness is small. 398 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. A speaks truth 3 times out of 4, and B 7 times out of 10; they both assert that a white ball has been drawn from a bag containing 6 balls all of different colours : find the probability of the truth of the assertion. There are two hypotheses ; (i) their coincident testimony is true, (ii) it is false. •1 P- 5 - 6' 2 ~6' Here P x = ~ , P 2 ^ 1- 4 X 10' • P2 ~25 X 4 X 10 ; for in estimating p. 2 we must take into account the chance that A and B will both select the white ball when it has not been drawn ; this chance is 11 1 5 X 5 ° r 25 * Now the probabilities of the two hypotheses are as P^ to P 2 po, and 35 therefore as 35 to 1; thus the probability that the statement is true is — . *479. The cases we have considered relate to the probability of the truth of concurrent testimony; the following is a case of traditionary testimony. If A states that a certain event took place, having received an account of its occurrence or non-occurrence from B, what is the probability that the event did take place 1 The event happened (1) if they both spoke the truth, (2) if they both spoke falsely ; and the event did not happen if only one of them spoke the truth. Let p, p denote the probabilities that A and B speak the truth ; then the probability that the event did take place is pp' + (l-p)(l-p) } and the probability that it did not take place is p(l- 2 ))+p'(l-p). *480. The solution of the preceding article is that which has usually been given in text-books; but it is\" open to serious objec- tions, for the assertion that the given event happened if both A and B spoke falsely is not correct except on the supposition that the statement can be made only in two ways. Moreover, although it is expressly stated that A receives his account from B, this cannot generally be taken for granted as it rests on A'& testimony.

From a bag containing n balls, all either white or black, all numbers of each being equally likely, a ball is drawn which turns out to be white; this is replaced, and another ball is drawn, which also turns out to be white.

Geometrical Methods. *481. The application of Geometry to questions of Pro- bability requires, in general, the aid of the Integral Calculus; there are, however, many easy questions which can be solved by Elementary Geometry. Example 1. From each of two equal lines of length I a portion is cut off at random, and removed : what is the chance that the sum of the remainders is less than I? Place the lines parallel to one another, and suppose that after cutting, the right-hand portions are removed. Then the question is equivalent to asking what is the chance that the sum of the right-hand portions is greater than the sum of the left-hand portions. It is clear that the first sum is equally likely to be greater or less than the second; thus the required probability is - . a Cor. Each of two lines is known to be of length not exceeding I: the chance that their sum is not greater than Z is - . a Example 2. If three lines are chosen at random, prove that they are just as likely as not to denote the sides of a possible triangle. Of three lines one must be equal to or greater than each of the other two ; denote its length by I. Then all we know of the other two lines is that the length of each lies between and /. But if each of two lines is known to be of random length between and 1, it is an even chance that their sum is greater than /. [Ex. 1, Cor.] Thus the required result follows. Example 3. Three tangents are drawn at random to a given circle : shew that the odds are 3 to 1 against the circle being inscribed in the triangle formed by them. P O Draw three random lines P, (), 11, in the same plane as the circle, and draw to the circle the six tangents parallel to these lines. H. H.A. 2G 402 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Then of the 8 triangles so formed it is evident that the circle will be escribed to 6 and inscribed in 2 ; and as this is true whatever be the original directions of P, Q, R, the required result follows. *4:82. Questions in Probability may sometimes be con- veniently solved by the aid of co-ordinate Geometry. Example. On a rod of length a + b+c, lengths a, b are measured at random: find the probability that no point of the measured lines will coincide. Let AB be the line, and suppose AP = x and PQ = a; also let a be measured from P towards B, so that x must be less than b + c. Again let AP' = y, P'Q' = b, and suppose P'Q' measured from P' towards B, then y must be less than a + c. Now in favourable cases we must have AP'>AQ, or else AP>AQ\\ hence y>a + x, or x>b + y (1). Again for all the cases possible, we must have x>0, and <& + c) 2/>0, and <a + c) Take a pair of rectangular axes and make OX equal to b + c, and OY equal to a + c. Draw the line y = a + x, represented by TML in the figure; and the line x = b + y represented by KB. Q n •A P' W B f -0.—Q b - K Then YM, EX are each equal to c, 031, OT are each equal to a. X The conditions (1) are only satisfied by points in the triangles MYL and ItXR, while the conditions (2) are satisfied by any points within the rect- angle OX, OY; c 2 .*. the required chance = — . {a + c)(b + c) *483. We shall close this chapter with some Miscellaneous Examples. Example 1. A box is divided into m equal compartments into which n balls are thrown at random ; find the probability that there will be p com- partments each containing a balls, q compartments each containing b balls, r compartments each containing c balls, and so on, where Z>a+qb + rc + =n. PROBABILITY. 403 Since each of the n halls can fall into any one of the m compartments the total number of cases which can occur is m n , and these are all equally likely. To determine the number of favourable cases we must find the number of ways in which the n balls can be divided into p, <1, r, ... parcels containing a, b, c, ... balls respectively. First choose any g of the compartments, where s stands for p + q + r + ... ; \\m the number of ways in which this can be done is -. — — — (1). \\s \\m-s -v ' Next subdivide the s compartments into groups containing p t q, r, ... severally; by Art. 147, the number of ways in which this can be done is \\»\\1 r ..

The number of ways in which this can be done is In - (3). (\\a)*(\\b)«(\\c_) Hence the number of ways in which the balls can be arranged to satisfy the required conditions is given by the product of the expressions (1), (2), (3).

Now if a in any other arrangement occupies the place of an assigned letter b, this letter must either occupy a's place or some other. (i) Suppose b occupies a's place. Then the number of ways in which all the remaining n - 2 letters can be displaced is u n _ 2 , and therefore the numbers of ways in which a may be displaced by interchange with some one of the other n- 1 letters, and the rest be all displaced is (n - 1) «„_ 2 .

CHAPTER XXXIII. Determinants. 485. The present chapter is devoted to a brief discussion of determinants and their more elementary properties. The slight introductory sketch here given will enable a student to avail himself of the advantages of determinant notation in Analytical Geometry, and in some other parts of Higher Mathematics ; fuller information on this branch of Analysis may be obtained from Dr Salmon's Lessons Introductory to the Modern Higher Algebra, and Muir's Theory of Determinants. 48G. Consider the two homogeneous linear equations a ] x + b l y = 0, a 2 x + b 2 y = 0; multiplying the first equation by b si the second by 6 , sub- tracting and dividing by x, we obtain This result is sometimes written a x b x a„ b„ -0, and the expression on the left is called a determinant. It consists of two rows and two columns, and in its expanded form each term is the product of two quantities; it is therefore said to be of the second order. The letters « , b a a , b 2 are called the constituents of the determinant, and tile terms «,/>,,, ab. are called the elements, 410 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 487. Since a. a. a A - «A = a. a„ it follows that the value of the determinant is not altered by chang- ing the rows into columns, and the columns into rows. 488.

These results may easily be generalised; thus if the con- stituents of the three columns consist of m, n, p terms respec- tively, the determinant can be expressed as the sum of mnp determinants.

Tims we see that the given determinant is equal to a new one whose first column is obtained by subtracting from the constituents of the first column of the original determinant equimultiples of the corresponding constituents of the other columns, while the second and third columns remain unaltered. Conversely, a C 2 c. a { + j)b x + qc } b { a ., + PK + <7 C 2 ^ 2 c„ and what has been here proved with reference to the first column is equally true for any of the columns or rows ; hence it appears that in reducing a determinant we may replace any one of the rows or columns by a new row or column formed in the following way : Take the constituents of the row or column to be replaced, and increase or diminish them by any equimidtij)les of the cor- responding constituents of one or more of the other rows or columns. After a little practice it will be found that determinants may often be quickly simplified by replacing two or more rows or columns simultaneously : for example, it is easy to see that a i + 2 } b } b } - qc x c, % + P h 2 K ~ C 1 C 2 °2 a 3 +2 jb 3 K-Q c s c 3 €l l Ct 2 a.. b 2 b„ c., but in any modification of the rule as above enunciated, care must be taken to leave one row or column unaltered. Thus, if on the left-hand side of the last identity the con- stituents of the third column were replaced by c l +ra li c 2 + ra^ c, + ra respectively, we should have the former value in- creased by a x + 2>b t b x — qc x ra x « a + i'K K - v c i ra„ ra.. 416 HIGHER ALGEBRA. and of the four determinants into which this may be resolved there is one which does not vanish, namely ra, pb s - qc 2 . „ 9 ra Example 1, Find the value of I 29 26 22 25 31 27 ! 63 54 46 The given determinant 3 26-4l = -3x4x -6 31 -4 9 54 -8 1 DETERMINANTS. 417 [Explanation. In the first new determinant the first row is the sum of the constituents of the three rows of the original determinant, the second and third rows being unaltered. In the third of the new determinants the first column remains unaltered, while the second and third columns are obtained by subtracting the constituents of the first column from those of the second and third respectively. The remaining transformations are suffi- ciently obvious.] 497.

Hence if equations (5) and (6) hold, equation (4) must also hold ; and therefore the determinant in (4) must contain as factors the determinants in (5) and (6) ; and a consideration of the dimensions of the determinants shews that the remaining factor of (4) must be numerical ; hence «i a i + & A »i a , + h A the numerical factor, by comparing the coefficients of afyafl, on the two sides of the equations, being seen to be unity. a l DETERMINANTS. 419 4 420 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 12.

The left-hand member of this equation is a determinant which consists of n rows and n columns, and is called a determinant of the II th - order. The discussion of this more general form of determinant is beyond the scope of the present work ; it will be sufficient here to remark that the properties which have been established in the case of determinants of the second and third orders are quite general, and are capable of being extended to determinants of any order. For example, the above determinant of the n th order is equal to a 1 A 1 -b 1 B l + c 1 C 1 -d 1 D 1+ ... + (-l)\"- 1 k 1 K l , or ct l A 1 -a 2 A 2 + a B A 3 -a 4 A 4 + ... + (-1)\"- 1 a n A n , according as we develop it from the first row or the first column. Here the capital letters stand for the minors of the constituents denoted by the corresponding small letters, and are themselves determinants of the (n-l) th order. Each of these may be ex- pressed as the sum of a number of determinants of the (n — 2) th order ; and so on ; and thus the expanded form of the deter- minant may be obtained. Although we may always develop a determinant by means of the process described above, it is not always the simplest method, especially when our object is not so much to find the value of the whole determinant, as to find the signs of its several elements. 502. The expanded form of the determinant a l DETERMINANTS. 425 cording as it can be deduced from the leading element by an even or odd number of permutations of two suffixes ; for instance, the element a 3 b 2 c 1 is obtained by interchanging the suffixes 1 and 3, therefore its sign is negative ; the element ajb 1 c 2 is obtained by first interchanging the suffixes 1 and 3, and then the suffixes 1 and 2, hence its sign is positive. 503. The determinant whose leading element is a x b 2 c 3 d A ... may thus be expressed by the notation %^aJ> a e B d A , the 2 * placed before the leading element indicating the aggregate of all the elements which can be obtained from it by suitable interchanges of suffixes and adjustment of signs. Sometimes the determinant is still more simply expressed by enclosing the leading element within brackets; thus (a^crf ...) is used as an abbreviation of 5 ± a,b„c„d A .... Example. In the determinant (a^c^e^ what sign is to be prefixed to the element a^c^e.,1 From the leading element by permuting the suffixes of a and d we get a 4 b 2 c 3 d x e 5 ; from this by permuting the suffixes of b and c we have a 4 b 3 c 2 d 1 e 5 ; by permuting the suffixes of c and d we have a i b. i c 1 d 2 e 5 ; finally by permuting the suffixes of d and e we obtain the required element rt 4 & 3 c 1 rf 5 ? 2 ; and since we have made four permutations the sign of the element is positive. 504. If in Art. 501, each of the constituents 6 , c , ... k is equal to zero the determinant reduces to a A ; in other words it is equal to the product of a y and a determinant of the (n — l) th order, and we easily infer the following general theorem. If each of the constituents of the first row or column of a determinant is zero except the first, and if this constituent is equal to m, the determinant is equal to m times that determinant of lower order ivhich is obtained by omitting the first column and first row, Also since by suitable interchange of rows and columns any constituent can be brought into the first place, it follows that if any row or column has all its constituents except one equal to zero, the determinant can immediately be expressed as a deter- minant of lower order. This is sometimes useful in the reduction and simplification of determinants. 426 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. Find the value of DETERMINANTS. 427 EXAMPLES. XXXIII. b.

CHAPTER XXXIV. MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS AND EXAMPLES. 506. We shall begin this chapter with some remarks on the permanence of algebraical form, briefly reviewing the fundamental laws which have been established in the course of the work. 507. In the exposition of algebraical principles we proceed analytically : at the outset we do not lay down new names and new ideas, but we begin from our knowledge of abstract Arithmetic ; we prove certain laws of operation which are capable of verification in every particular case, and the general theory of these operations constitutes the science of Algebra. Hence it is usual to speak of Arithmetical Algebra and Sym- bolical Algebra., and to make a distinction between them. In the former we define our symbols in a sense arithmetically intelligible, and thence deduce fundamental laws of operation ; in the latter we assume the laws of Arithmetical Algebra to be true in all cases, whatever the nature of the symbols may be, and so find out what meaning must be attached to the symbols in order that they may obey these laws. Thus gradually, as we transcend the limits of ordinary Arithmetic, new results spring up, new lan- guage has to be employed, and interpretations given to symbols which were not contemplated in the original definitions. At the same time, from the way in which the general laws of Algebra are established, we are assured of their permanence and uni- versality, even when they are applied to quantities not arithmeti- cally intelligible. 508. Confining our attention to positive integral values of the symbols, the following laws are easily established from a priori arithmetical definitions. 430 HIGHER ALGEBRA. I. The Law of Commutation, which we enunciate as follows : (i) Additions and subtractions may be made in any order. Thus a + b-c = a-c + b = b-c + a. (ii) Multiplications and divisions may be made in any order. Thus axb=bxa; axbxc = bxcxa = axcxb' } and so on. ab-±- c = a x b -=- c = (a -f- c) x b = (b + c) xa. II. The Law of Distribution, which we enunciate as follows : | Multiplications and divisions may be distributed over additions and subtractions. Thus {a - b + c) m = am —bm + cm, (a — b)(c — d) = ac — ad — bc + bd. [See Elementary Algebra, Arts. 33, 35.] And since division is the reverse of multiplication, the distri- butive law for division requires no separate discussion. III. The Laws of Indices. (i) a m xa n = a m+n 3 a m + a H = a m -\". (n) [a ) = a . [See Elementary Algebra, Art. 233 to 235.] These laws are laid down as fundamental to our subject, having been proved on the supposition that the symbols employed are positive and integral, and that they are restricted in such a way that the operations above indicated are arithmetically intelligible. If these conditions do not hold, by the principles of Symbolical Algebra we assume the laws of Arithmetical Algebra to be true in every case and accept the interpretation to which this assump- tion leads us. By this course we are assured that the laws of Algebraical operation are self-consistent, and that they include in their generality the particular cases of ordinary Arithmetic. 509. From the law of commutation we deduce the rules for the removal and insertion of brackets [Elementary Algebra, Arts. 21, 22] ; and by the aid of these rules we establish the law MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS AND EXAMPLES. 431 of distribution as in Art. 35. For example, it is proved that (a -b)(c — d)~ac — ad—bc + bd, with the restriction that a, b, c, d are positive integers, and a greater than b, and c greater than d. Now it is the province of Symbolical Algebra to interpret results like this when all restric- tions are removed. Hence by putting a = and c = 0, we obtain (— b) x (— d) = bd, or the product of two negative quantities is positive. Again by putting 6 = and c= 0, we obtain a x (—d) =—a<I, or the product of two quantities of opposite signs is negative. \"We are thus led to the Rule of Signs as a direct consequence of the law of distribution, and henceforth the rule of signs is included in our fundamental laws of operation. 510. For the way in which the fundamental laws are applied to establish the properties of algebraical fractions, the reader is referred to Chapters xix., xxi., and xxn. of the Elementary Algebra ; it will there be seen that symbols and operations to which we cannot give any a priori definition are always interpreted so as to make them conform to the laws of Arithmetical Algebra. 511. The laws of indices are fully discussed in Chapter xxx. of the Elementary Algebra. When m and n are positive integers and m > n, we prove directly from the definition of an index that a m xa n = a m+n ; a m -r a' 1 = a m ~ n j (a m ) n = a m \". We then assume the first of these to be true when the indices are free from all restriction, and in this way we determine mean- ings for symbols to which our original definition does not apply. p The interpretations for a\\ a , a~\" thus derived from the first law are found to be in strict conformity with the other two laws ; and henceforth the laws of indices can be applied consistently and with perfect generality. 512. In Chapter vill. we defined the symbol i or J— 1 as obeying the relation i 2 = — 1 . From this definition, and by making i subject to the general laws of Algebra we are enabled to discuss the properties of expressions of the form a + ib, in which real and imaginary quantities are combined. Such forms are sometimes called complex numbers, and it will be seen by reference to Articles 92 to 105 that if we perform on a complex number the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, the result is in general itself a complex number, 432 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Also since every rational function involves no operations but those above mentioned, it follows that a rational function of a complex number is in general a complex number. Expressions of the form a x+ly , \\og(x±iy) cannot be fully- treated without Trigonometry; but by the aid of De Moivre's theorem, it is easy to shew that such functions can be reduced to complex numbers of the form A + iB. The expression e x+iy is of course included in the more general form a x+i \\ but another mode of treating it is worthy of attention. We have seen in Art. 220 that (x\\ n 1 H — ) , when n is infinite, nj x being any real quantity ; the quantity e x+i!/ may be similarly defined by means of the equation e *+iy = Lini (1 H ) , when n is infinite, \\ n J x and y being any real quantities. The development of the theory of complex numbers will be found fully discussed in Chapters x. and XI. of Schlomilch's Handbuch der algebraischen Analysis. 513. We shall now give some theorems and examples illus- trating methods which will often be found useful in proving identities, and in the Theory of Equations. 514. To find the remainder ivhen any rational integral function of x is divided by x - a. Let fix) denote any rational integral function of x ; divide f(x) hyx-a until a remainder is obtained which does not involve x ; let Q be the quotient, and R the remainder ; then f(x) = Q(x-a) + R. Since R does not involve x it will remain unaltered whatever value we give to x ; put x = a, then f(a) = QxO + R; now Q is finite for finite values of x, hence .MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS AND EXAMPLES. 433 Cor. If f{x) is exactly divisible by x - a, then R == 0, that is f(a) = ; hence if a rational integral function of x vanishes when x — a, it is divisible by x - a. 515. The proposition contained in the preceding article is so useful that we give another proof of it which has the advantage of exhibiting the form of the quotient. Suppose that the function is of n dimensions, and let it be denoted by p x n +2\\ x \"~ }+ P^\"~ 2 +P-^\"\" 3+ -+P»> then the quotient will be of n - 1 dimensions ; denote it by q{f c\"- x + qi x n - 2 +q 2 x n - 3 + ... +q H _ l ; let R be the remainder not containing x ; then pjf +p 1 x- 1 +2> 2 x'- 2 +p. a x\"~ 3 + ••• +P„ = (x-a) (q X^ + qi x\"~ 2 + q 2 x\"~ 3 + ... + q a _ x ) + R Multiplying out and equating the coefficients of like powers of x, we have 9. 2 - a Qi=P 2 > or qs = a 4i+P a '> q 3 - n 2 = ihi or & = «<i 2 + ih ; R - oq n - % =P n , or R = aq n _ l +p n ; thus each successive coefficient in the quotient is formed by multiplying by a the coefficient last formed, and adding the next coefficient in the dividend. The process of finding the successive terms of the quotient and the remainder may be arranged thus : Po Pi P 2 P 3 Pa-X Pa «?0 Ct( lx Cl( l 2 Cl( In-2 (l( 2n-l % q x % v, ?.-, x Thus R = aq^ +p n - « («<?„-- +#.-i) + P* = =P<P* +P^\"~ 1 +P/<< n ~ 2 + ••• +P,r If tlie divisor is x + a the same method can be used, only in this case the multiplier is - a.

In the preceding example the work has been abridged by writing down only the coefficients of the several terms, zero coefficients being used to represent terms corresponding to powers of x which are absent. This method of Detached Coefficients may frequently be used to save labour in elementary algebraical processes, particularly when the functions we are dealing with are rational and integral. The following is another illustration. Example. Divide 3a; 5 - 8a; 4 - 5a; 3 + 26a; 2 - 33a; + 26 by a; 3 - 2a; 2 - 4a; + 8. 1 + 2 + 4-8)3-8- 5 + 26-33 + 26(3-2 + 3 3 + 6 + 12-24 -2 + -2- MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS AND EXAMPLES. 435 we form the next horizontal line, and add the terms in the third column; this gives 3, which is the coefficient of the third term of the quotient. By adding up the other columns we get the coefficients of the terms in the remainder. ] Example. Divide 6a 5 + ba*b - 8a?b 2 - 6a 2 b 3 - 6a ¥ by 2a 3 + 3a 2 6 - b z to four terms in the quotient. 2 436 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Put z = 0, then A = 3, being the coefficient of x 2 y in the ex- pansion of (x + y) 3 . Put x = y = z = l, and we get 27 = 3 + (3 x 6) + B ; whence B = 6. Thus (x + y + z) 3 = x 3 + y 3 + z 3 + 3x 2 y + 3xy 2 + 3y 2 z + 3yz 2 + 3z 3 x + 3zx 2 + 6xyz. 520. A function is said to be alternating with respect to its variables, when its sign but not its value is altered by the inter- change of any pair of them. Thus x — y and a 2 (b-c) + b 2 (c-a) + c 2 (a - b) are alternating functions. It is evident that there can be no linear alternating function involving more than two variables, and also that the product of a symmetrical function and an alternating function must be an alternating function. 521. Symmetrical and alternating functions may be con- cisely denoted by writing down one of the terms and prefixing the symbol % ; thus %a stands for the sum of all the terms of which a is the type, %ab stands for the sum of all the terms of which ab is the type; and so on. For instance, if the function involves four letters a, b, c, d } ^a-a + b + c + d; %ab = ab + ac + ad +bc + bd+ cd; and so on. Similarly if the function involves three letters a, b, c, $a 2 (b -c) = a 2 (b-c)± b 2 (c - a) + c 2 (a - b) • %a 2 bc = a 2 bc + b 2 ca + c 2 ab; and so on. It should be noticed that when there are three letters involved %a 2 b does not consist of three terms, but of six : thus 2<a 2 b = a 2 b + a 2 c + b 2 c + b 2 a + c 2 a + c 2 b. The symbol 2 may also be used to imply summation with regard to two or more sets of letters; thus %yz (b-c) = yz (b~c) + zx (c-a) + xy (a - b). MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS AND EXAMPLES. 437 522. The above notation enables us to express in an abridged form the products and powers of symmetrical expressions : thus (a+b + c) 3 = %a 3 + 32a 2 b + Gabc j (a + b + c + df = 2« 3 + 3$a 2 b + Gtabc; (a + b + c) 4 = %a A + i%cfb + 6Sa\"6 fl + 1 2%a 2 bc; %a x 2« 2 = 2a 3 + %a 2 b . Example 1. Prove that (a + b) 5 - a 5 - b* = 5ab (a + b) (a 2 + ab + b 2 ). Denote the expression on the left by E ; then E is a function of a which vanishes when a = ; hence a is a factor of E ; similarly 6 is a factor of E. Again E vanishes when a— - b, that is a + b is a factor of E; and therefore E contains ab(a + b) as a factor. The remaining factor must be of two dimensions, and, since it is symmetrical with respect to a and b, it must be of the form Act? + Bab + Ab' z ; thus (a + b) 5 - a 5 - b 5 = ab (a + 6) (Aa* + Bab + A b~), where A and B are independent of a and b. Putting a = 1, b = 1, we have 15 = 2A + B ; putting a = 2, b = - 1, we have 15 = 5A - 2B ; whence A = o, J5 = 5; and thus the required result at once follows. Example 2. Find the factors of (&3 + c 3) (b-c) + (c 3 + a 3 ) (c-a) + (a 3 + b 3 ) (a - b). Denote the expression by E ; then E is a function of a which vanishes when a = b, and therefore contains a - b as a factor [Art. 514]. Similarly it contains the factors b-c and c-a; thus E contains (b - c) (c - a) (a - b) as a factor. Also since E is of the fourth degree the remaining factor must be of the first degree; and since it is a sj^mmetrical function of a, b, c, it must be of the form M{a + b + c). [Art. 518]; .-. E = M (b-c) (c-a) (a-b)(a + b + c). To obtain M we may give to a, b, c any values that we find most con- venient; thus by putting a = 0, 6 = 1, c = 2, we find M=l, and we have the required result. Example 3. Shew that (x + y + zjt-x 5 -y b - z? = 5 (y + z) (z + x) (x + y) (x 2 + y 2 + z~ + yz + zx+ xy). Denote the expression on the left by E ; then E vanishes when y=-z, and therefore y + z is a factor of E; similarly z + x and x + y are factors; therefore E contains (y + z) (z + x) [x + (/)asa factor. Also since E is of the 438 HIGHER ALGEBRA. fifth degree the remaining factor is of the second degree, and, since it is symmetrical in x, y, z, it must be of the form A (x 2 + y 2 + z 2 ) + B (yz + zx + xy) . Put»=2/=z=l; thus 10=^1+5; put x=2, y=l, 2 = 0; thus 35 = 5A + IB ; whence A=B = 5, and we have the required result. 523. We collect here for reference a list of identities which are useful in the transformation of algebraical expressions; many of these have occurred in Chap. xxix. of the Elementary Algebra. ^bc (b — c) = —(b-c)(c- a) (a - b). $a 2 (b-c) = -(b-c)(c-a)(a-b). $a(b 2 -c 2 ) = (b-c)(c-a)(a-b). 2a 3 (b-c) = -(b-c) (c-a) (a-b) (a + b + c). a s + b 3 + c 3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a 2 +b 2 + c 2 - bc-ca- ab). This identity may be given in another form, a 3 + b 3 + c 3 -3abc = l(a + b + c){(b-c) 2 + (c-a) 2 + (a-b) 2 }. (b-c) 3 + (c-a) 3 + (a-b) 3 = 3(b-c)(c-a)(a-b). (a + b + c) 3 -a 3 -b 3 -c 3 = 3(b + c)(c + a)(a + b). Hbc (b + c) + 2abc = (b + c)(c + a)(a + b). %a 2 {b + c) + 2abc =(b + c)(c + a) (a + b).

Many identities can be readily established by making use of the properties of the cube roots of unity; as usual these will be denoted by 1, w, o> 2 . Example. Shew that (x + yf -x 7 -y 7 = Ixy (x + y) (x 2 + xy + y 2 ) 2 . The expression, E, on the left vanishes when x = 0, y = 0, x + y = 0; hence it must contain xy (x + y) as a factor. Putting x = coy, we have E = {(1 + ta)7 - W 7 - 1} y7= {(_ w 2)7 _ w 7 _ !} y i = (_ w 2 - w -l)y 7 = 0; hence E contains x - wy as a factor ; and similarly we may shew that it con- tains x - ury as a factor; that is, E is divisible by (x- ury) (x - to 2 ?/), or x^ + xy + y 2 . MISCELLANEOUS IDENTITIES. 441 Further, E being of seven, and xy(x + y) (x 2 + xy + y 2 ) of five dimensions, the remaining factor must be of the form A (x 2 + y' 2 ) + Bxy ; thus (x + y) 7 - x 7 - y 7 = xy {x + y) (x 2 + xy + y 2 ) (Ax 2 + Bxy + Ay 2 ). Putting a; = l, y = l, we have 21 = 2^+5; putting x = 2, y=- 1, we have 21 = 5^1 -2B; whence A = 7, B = 7 ; .-. (x + y) 7 - x 7 - y 7 = Ixy (x + y)(x 2 + xy + y 2 ) 2 . 525. We know from elementary Algebra that a a + b 3 + c 3 - 3abc = (a+ b + c) (a 2 + b 2 + c 2 -be- ca — ab) ; also we have seen in Ex. 3, Art. 110, that a* + b 2 + c 2 — be — ca — ab = (a + ub + ore) (a + <a 2 b + wc) ; hence a 3 + b 3 + c 3 — 3abc can be resolved into three linear factors; thus a 3 + b 3 + c 3 - 3abc = (a + b +c) (a + mb + arc) (a + <D 2 b + wc). Example. Shew that the product of a 3 + b 3 + c 3 - dabc and a; 3 + y 3 + z 3 - Sxyz can be put into the form A 3 + B 3 + C 3 - SABC. The product = [a + b + c) (a + wb + ore) (a + w 2 & + wc) x (x + y + z) (x + uy + urz) (x + w 2 y + uz). By taking these six factors in the pairs (a + b + c) (x + y + z); (a + u>b + w 2 c) (x + cry + uz) ; and (a + urb + uc) (x + wy + urz), we obtain the three partial products A + B + C, A + wB + u-C, A+u 2 B + u)C, where A = ax + by + cz, B — bx + cy + az, C = cx + ay + bz. Thus the product = (A + B + C) [A + wB + u 2 C) (A + orB + «C) = A 3 + B 3 +C 3 -SABC. 526. In order to find the values of expressions involving a, b, c when these quantities are connected by the equation a + b + c = 0, we might employ the substitution a — h + k, b = ioh + (x> 2 k, c = ufh + u>k. If however the expressions involve a, b, c symmetrically the method exhibited in the following example is preferable. 442 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. If a + b + c = 0, shew that 6 (a 5 + b 5 + c 5 ) = 5 (a 3 + 6 3 + c 3 ) (a 2 + 6 2 + c 2 ). We have identically (1 + ax) (1 + bx) (1 + cz) = 1 +px + qx 2 +rx 3 , w here p — a + b + c, q = bc + ca + ab, r — abc. Hence, using the condition given, (1 + ax) (1 -t bx)(l + cx) = l + qx 2 + rx 3 . Taking logarithms and equating the coefficients of x n , we have (~ ' (a n + b n + c n ) = coefficient of x n in the expansion of log(l + qx 2 + rx 3 ) n = coefficient of x n in [qx 2 + rx 3 ) - ^ {qx 2 + rx 3 ) 2 + ^ (qx 2 + rx 3 ) 3 - . . .

Elimination. 527. In Chapter xxxiii. we have seen that the eliminant of a system of linear equations may at once be written down in the form of a determinant. General methods of elimination ap- plicable to equations of any degree will be found discussed in treatises on the Theory of Equations ; in particular we may refer the student to Chapters iv. and VI. of Dr Salmon's Lessons Intro- ductory to the Modern Higher Algebra, and to Chap. xm. of Burnside and Panton's Theory of Equations. These methods, though theoretically complete, are not always the most convenient in practice. We shall therefore only give a brief explanation of the general theory, and shall then illustrate by examples some methods of elimination that are more practi- cally useful. 528. Let us first consider the elimination of one unknown quantity between two equations. Denote the equations by f(x) = Q and <£ (x) = 0, and suppose that, if necessary, the equations have been reduced to a form in which f(x) and <£ (x) represent rational integral functions of x. Since these two functions vanish simultaneously there must be some value of x which satisfies both the given equations ; hence ELIMINATION. 445 the eliminant expresses the condition that must hold between the coefficients in order that the equations may have a common root. Suppose that x = a, x = J3, x = y,... are the roots of f(x) = 0, then one at least of the quantities <f> (a), <f> (/?), <f> (y), must be equal to zero ; hence the eliminant is 4> (a) <f> tf) <f> (y) =0. The expression on the left is a symmetrical function of the roots of the equation fix) = 0, and its value can be found by the methods explained in treatises on the Theory of Equations. 529. We shall now explain three general methods of elimina- tion : it will be sufficient for our purpose to take a simple example, but it will be seen that in each case the process is applicable to equations of any degree. The principle illustrated in the following example is due to Euler. Example. Eliminate x between the equations ax* + bx 2 + cx + d = 0, fx 2 + gx + h = 0. Let x + k be the factor corresponding to the root common to both equa- tions, and suppose that ax 3 + bx 2 + ex + d = (x + k) (ax 2 + lx + m), and fx 2 + gx + h = (x + k) (fx + n) , k, I, m, n being unknown quantities. From these equations, we have identically (ax s + bx 2 + cx + d)(fx + n) = (ax 2 + Ix + m) (fx 2 + gx + h). Equating coefficients of like powers of x, we obtain fl -an + ag-bf=0, gl +fm -bn + ah- cf= 0, Jd + gm- en - df= 0, hm-dn =0. From these linear equations by eliminating the unknown quantities I, in, n, we obtain the determinant / a ag-bf g f b ah-cf h g c -df h d = 0. 446 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 530. The eliminant of the equations f(x) = 0, <f> (x) = can be very easily expressed as a determinant by Sylvester's Dialytic Method of Elimination. We shall take the same example as before. Example. Eliminate x between the equations ax s + bx 2 + cx + d = 0, fx 2 +gx + h = 0. Multiply the first equation by x, and the second equation by x and x 2 in succession ; we thus have 5 equations between which we can eliminate the 4 quantities x 4 , x z , x 2 , x regarded as distinct variables. The equations are ax* + bx 2 +cx + d=0, ax i + bx 3 +cx 2 + dx =0, fx 2 + gx + h = 0, fx s + gx 2 + hx = 0, fx 4 + gx 3 + ltx 2 =0. Hence the eliminant is a / a b / 9 b c f 9 h c d 9 h d h = 0. 531. The principle of the following method is due to Bezout; it has the advantage of expressing the result as a determinant of lower order than either of the determinants obtained by the pre- ceding methods. We shall choose the same example as before, and give Cauchy's mode of conducting the elimination. Example. Eliminate x between the equations ax 3 + bx 2 + cx + d=0, fx 2 + gx + h = 0. From these equations, we have a _ bx 2 + ex + d f gx 2 +hx ' ax + b cx + d fx +g~ Jix ' (ag - bf) x 1 + {ah ~cf)x- df= 0, (ah - cf) x 2 +(bh - eg - df) x - dg = 0. Combining these two equations with fx 2 +gx + h = 0, whence and ELIMINATION. 447 and regarding x' z and x as distinct variables, we obtain for the eliminant f g h =o. ag - bf ah -cf - df a h - cf bh - eg -df - dg 532. If we have two equations of the form <£, (x, y) — 0, <£.,(#, 2/)=0, then y may be eliminated by any of the methods already explained; in this case the eliminant will be a function of x. If we have three equations of the form 0, (*» y> z ) = °> 2 (^ y> z ) = °> 03 ( a; > y» *) = °> l>y eliminating z between the first and second equations, and then between the first and third, we obtain two equations of the form •A, (»> V) = °> ^ ( x > y) = °- If we eliminate y from these equations we have a result of the form/* (a:) = 0. By reasoning in this manner it follows that we can eliminate n variables between n + 1 equations. 533. The general methods of elimination already explained may occasionally be employed with advantage, but the eliminants so obtained are rarely in a simple form, and it will often happen that the equations themselves suggest some special mode of elimination. This will be illustrated in the following examples. Example 1. Eliminate Z, m between the equations lx + my = a, vix-ly = b, Z 2 + m 2 =l. By squaring the first two equations and adding, 7-.c 2 + m-x 2 + »»V + *V = a2 + & 2 > that is, (Z 2 + /» 2 ) (.t 2 + y*) = a 2 + Z, 2 ; hence the eliminant is .t 2 + ?/ 2 = a 2 + ZA If Z = cos0, m= sin $, the third equation is satisfied identically; that is, the eliminant of x cos 6 + y sin 6 = a , x sin 6 - y cos = Z> is x 2 + y* = a° + b*. 448 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example 2. Eliminate x, y, z between the equations y*+z*=zayz, z 2 + x 2 =bzx, x 2 + y* = cxy. v z z x . x , y We have * + -=a, - + ~ = h -+\" = c 5 z y x z y x by multiplying together these three equations we obtain, w 2 z 2 z 2 z 2 z 2 y 2 . z 2 t/ 2 a; 2 s a 2/ 2 X' hence 2 + (a 2 - 2) + (6 2 - 2) + (c 2 -2) = abc ; .-. a 2 + & 2 +c 2 -4 = a&c. Example 3. Eliminate #, ?/ between the equations x 2 -y 2 =px-qy, ±xy = qx+py, x 2 + y 2 =l. Multiplying the first equation by x, and the second by y, we obtain x s + Sxy~=p {x 2 + y 2 )\\ hence, by the third equation, p = x 3 + Sxy 2 . Similarly q = Bx 2 y + y s . Thus p + q={x+y) 3 > p-q={x-y) 3 \\ .: (p + q)* + (p- q)* = {x + y)* + {x - yf = 2(x 2 + y 2 ); Example 4.

CHAPTER XXXV. THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 534. Ix Chap. ix. we have established certain relations be- tween the roots and the coefficients of quadratic equations. We shall now investigate similar relations which hold in the case of equations of the n th degree, and we shall then discuss some of the more elementary properties in the general theory of equations. 535. Let 2? x\" + 2) 1 x\"~ 1 + 2 ) 2 X \"~ 2 + + Pn-i x+ Pn ^ e a ra tional integral function of x of n dimensions, and let us denote it by f(x); then y (a?) = is the general type of a rational integral equa- tion of the n th degree. Dividing throughout by^> , we see that without any loss of generality we may take x n +2) i x\"~ 1 +2 , o^\"~ 2 + + 2 :> n-i x ' ] -2 ) n = Q as the type of a rational integral equation of any degree. Unless otherwise stated the coefficients £>, , ^> , . . . p n will always be supposed rational. 536. Any value of x which makes f(x) vanish is called a root of the equation f(x) = 0. In Art. 514 it was proved that when f(x) is divided by x-a, the remainder is f(a) ; hence if f (x) is divisible by x — a without remainder, a is a root of the equation f{x) = 0. 537. We shall assume that every equation of the form f(x) = has a root, real or imaginary. The proof of this proposition will be found in treatises on the Theory of Equations ; it is beyond the range of the present work. 29—2 452 HIGHER ALGEBHA. 538. Every equation of the n th degree has n roots, and no more. Denote the given equation by/(a;) = 0, where f(x) =p Q «? +PJXT 1 +2> 2 x n ~°' + + P*' The equation f(x) = has a root, real or imaginary; let this be denoted by a,; then/(a) is divisible by x-a } , so that f(x) = (x-a i )<f> l (x), where <t> (x) is a rational integral function of n-1 dimensions Igain, the equation *» = has a root real or \"0^^** this be denoted by a 2 ; then <£» is divisible by x-a 2 , so that fa^^ix-aj^x), where <f> a (x) is a rational integral function of n - 2 dimensions. Thus /(a>) = (« ~ «,) (* - O *b(*> Proceeding in this way, we obtain, as in Art. 309, /(«) = PoO* ~ °i) ( a \" ^) (* - a -)* Hence the equation f(x)= has n roots, since f(x) vanishes when sc has any of the values a x , a 2 , a 3 ,...a n . Also the equation cannot have more than n roots; for if x has any value different from any of the quantities a xi a 2 , a ...«„, all the factors on the right are different from zero, and therefore f(x) cannot vanish for that value of x. In the above investigation some of the quantities a l ,a 2 ,a 3 ,...a n j may be equal; in this case, however, we shall suppose that the equation has still n roots, although these are not all different. 539. To investigate the relations between the roots and the J coefficients in any equation. Let us denote the equation by x n +p 1 x n - l +2> 2 x n ~ 2 + +Pn-l X + P» = > j and the roots by a, b, c, k; then we have identically x\"+p 1 x n - l +2) x n ~'+ +P n -i x+ P» = (x-a) (x-b)(x-c) (x-k)' } hence, with the notation of Art. 163, we have x n +p l x H ~ l +p a x n -* + +P n .^+P m - wT - S x x n ~ l + S s x*~* - + (- iy-%-^ + (\" !)\"£, THE011Y OF EQUATIONS. 453 Equating coefficients of like powers of x in this identity, - %> x — S l ~ sum of the roots ; p a = S„ = sum of the products of the roots taken two at a time; —p B — S a -sum of the products of the roots taken three at a time ; (— \\)*p **S U = product of the roots. If the coefficient of x\" is p oi then on dividing each term by ]? ui the equation becomes aj\" + ; - 1 x n - l + ] -^x\"- 2 + + P»=1 X + P» = Po Po Pu Po and, with the notation of Art. 521, we have & = -&, 2aft=&, %abe = -%>. , abc...k = (- 1)\"^ . Po V, P Po Example 1. Solve the equations x + ay + a 2 z = a 3 1 x + by + b 2 z = b*, x + cy + c 2 z = c*. From these equations we see that a, &, e are the values of t which satisfy the cubic equation t 3 -zt 2 -yt-x = 0; hence z = a + b + c, y= -(bc + ca + ab), x = abc. Example 2. If a, b, c are the roots of the equation x 3 +p 1 x 3 +-PzC+p a =0, form the equation whose roots are a 2 , 6 2 , c 2 . The required equation is (y - a 2 ) (y - b 2 ) (y - c 2 )=0, or (x 2 - a 2 ) (a; 2 - 6 2 ) (x 2 - c 2 ) = 0, if y = x 2 ; that is, (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) (x + a) (x + b) (x + c) = 0. But (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) = x 3 +p 1 x 2 +p 2 x +p t ; hence {x + a)(x + b) (x + c) = x 3 - p x x 2 +p.& - p v Thus the required equation is (x 3 +p 1 x' z +p 2 x +p 3 ) (x 3 -p x x 2 +p*x -p 3 ) = 0, or (x 3 +p&) 2 - (p x x 2 +p 3 ) 2 = 0, or x 6 + (2ft - j^ 2 ) x 4 + (p. 2 - 2p 1 p. i ) x 2 - p. 2 = ; and if we replace x 2 by y, we obtain f + (2p,-p 2 ) y 2 + (p.? - 2p dh ) y -p : 2 =0. 454 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 540. The student might suppose that the relations established in the preceding article would enable him to solve any proposed equation; for the number of the relations is equal to the number of the roots. A little reflection will shew that is this not the case • for suppose we eliminate any n - 1 of the quantities a, b,c,...k and so obtain an equation to determine the remaining one; then since these quantities are involved symmetrically in each of the equations, it is clear that we shall always obtain an equation having the same coefficients; this equation is therefore the original equation with some one of the roots a, b, c,...k sub- stituted for x. Let us take for example the equation x 3 + p x x 2 + p 2 x + p 3 = ; and let a, b, c be the roots; then a + b + c = —] :> x > ab + ac + bc= p s) abc= — p 3 . Multiply these equations by a 2 , - a, I respectively and add ; thus rf = -l\\rf-l\\u>-p 3i that is, a 3 + p x a? + p 2 a + p 3 = 0, which is the original equation with a in the place of x. The above process of elimination is quite general, and is applicable to equations of any degree. 541. If two or more of the roots of an equation are con- nected by an assigned relation, the properties proved in Art. 539 will sometimes enable us to obtain the complete solution. Example 1. Solve the equation 4.r 3 - 24a; 2 + 23x + 18 = 0, having given that the roots are in arithmetical progression. Denote the roots by a - b, a, a + b ; then the sum of the roots is 3a ; the sum of the products of the roots two at a time is 3a 2 - 6 2 ; and the product of the roots is a (a 2 - 6 2 ) ; hence we have the equations 3a = 6, 3a 2 -Z> 2 = ^, a( a 2 -6 2 )=-|; 5 from the first equation we find a = 2, and from the second 6=±-, and a since these values satisfy the third, the three equations are consistent. 1 9 Thus the roots are - - , 2, - . 2 £ THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 455 Example 2. Solve the equation 24a; 3 - 14.r 2 - (ftx + 45 = 0, one root being double another. Denote the roots by a, 2a, b\\ then we have Sa + b = ^, 2a 2 + 3a&=--^, 2a-6=-^. From the first two equations, we obtain 8a 2 -2a-3 = 0; 3 1 , , 5 25 .-. a = -or--and&=--or-. 1 25 It will be found on trial that the values a= --, 6 = ^ do not satisfy 15 the third equation 2a 2 6 = ~ — - ; hence we are restricted to the values o 3 5 a = - v b=--. Thus the roots are 7 , ~ > - o • 542. Although we may not be able to find the roots of an equation, we can make use of the relations proved in Art. 539 to determine the values of symmetrical functions of the roots. Example 1. Find the sum of the squares and of the cubes of the roots of the equation x 3 -px 2 + qx-r — 0. Denote the roots by a, b, c ; then a + b + c=p, bc + ca + ab = q. Now a 2 + b 2 + c 2 = (a + b + c) 2 - 2 (bc + ca + ab) —p 2 - 2q. Again, substitute «, b, c for x in the given equation and add; thus a 3 + b 3 + <?-p{a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ) + q{a + b + c)-Sr = 0; .-. a 3 + b 3 + c 3 =p(p 2 -2q) -pq + Sr =p 3 - Spq 4- dr. Example 2. If a, 6, c, d are the roots of x A +px* + qx 2 + rx + s = 0, find the value of Ha 2 b. We have a + b + c + d = - p (1), ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = q (2), abc + abd + acd + bcd — -r (3). 456 HIGHER ALGEBRA.

Suppose that f(x) = is an equation with real coefficients, and suppose that it has an imaginary root a + ib ; we shall shew that a — ib is also a root. The factor of f(x) corresponding to these two roots is (x — a — ib) (x — a + ib), or (x — a) 2 + b 2 . Let f(x) be divided by (x — a) 2 + b 2 ; denote the quotient by Q, and the remainder, if any, by Rx + E ', then f(x) = Q{(x- a) 2 + b 2 } + Rx + E. In this identity put x = a + ib, then f(x) — by hypothesis ; also (x - a) 2 + b 2 = ; hence R (a + ib) + E = 0. Equating to zero the real and imaginary parts, Ra + E=Q, Rb = 0; and b by hypothesis is not zero, .-. R = and # = 0. Hence f (x) is exactly divisible by (x — a) 2 + b 2 , that is, by (x — a - ib) (x — a + ib) \\ hence x = a-ib is also a root. 544. In the preceding article we have seen that if the equa- tion f{x) = has a pair of imaginary roots a ± ib, then (x — a) 2 + b 2 is a factor of the expression f(x). 458 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Suppose that a±ib, c±id, e±ig,... are the imaginary roots of the equation f(x) - 0, and that cf> (x) is the product of the quadratic factors corresponding to these imaginary roots; then <j>(x) = {(x-a) 2 + b 2 }{(x-c) 2 + d 2 }{(x-e) 2 + /}.... Now each of these factors is positive for every real value of x; hence <f> (x) is always positive for real values of x. 545. As in Art. 543 we may shew that in an equation with rational coefficients, surd roots enter in pairs; that is, if a + Jb is a root then a- Jb is also a root. Example 1. Solve the equation 6z 4 - 13x 3 - 35z 2 - x + 3 = 0, having given that one root is 2 - ^3. Since 2-^/3 is a root, we know that 2+^/3 is also a root, and corre- sponding to this pair of roots we have the quadratic factor x 2 - 4# + 1. Also 6z 4 - 13z 3 - 35a: 2 - x + 3 = {x 2 - 4x + 1) (6a; 2 + 11* + 3) ; hence the other roots are obtained from 6a; 2 + 11a; + 3 = 0, or (3a; + 1) (2z + 3)=0; 1 3 thus the roots are - - , - - , 2 + ^/3, 2-^3. Example 2. Form the equation of the fourth degree with rational coefficients, one of whose roots is ,J2 + sj - 3. Here we must have /J2 + /J-3, J2-J- 3 as one pair of roots, and - >/2 + ^/ - 3, - J2 - J - 3 as another pair. Corresponding to the first pair we have the quadratic factor x 2 - 2 /v /2x + 5, and corresponding to the second pair we have the quadratic factor x 2 + 2 f J2x + 5. Thus the required equation is (x 2 + 2,J2x + 5) (x 2 -2 f J2x + 5) = 0, or (x 2 + 5) 2 -8a 2 = 0, or a^ + 2x 2 + 25 = 0. Example 3. Shew that the equation A 2 B 2 C 2 H 2 , + 7 + + ... + — ,=&, x-a x-b x-c ' x-h has no imaginary roots. If possible let p + iq be a root ; then p - iq is also a root. Substitute these values for x and subtract the first result from the second ; thus {(p-a A 2 B 2 C 2 H* i) 2 + q 2 (p-b) 2 + q 2 ^(p-c) 2 + q 2 ' \"\" ' (p-h) 2 + q which is impossible unless q = THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 459 546. To determine the nature of some of the roots of an equation it is not always necessary to solve it ; for instance, the truth of the following statements will be readily admitted. (i) If the coefficients are all positive, the equation has no positive root ; thus the equation # 5 + x 3 + 2x + 1 = cannot have a positive root. (ii) If the coefficients of the even powers of x are all of one sign, and the coefficients of the odd powers are all of the contrary sign, the equation has no negative root; thus the equation x 7 + x 5 - 2x 4 + x 3 - 3x 3 + 7x- 5 =0 cannot have a negative root. (iii) If the equation contains only even powers of x and the coefficients are all of the same sign, the equation has no real root ; thus the equation 2x 8 + 3x* + x 2 + 7 = cannot have a real root. (iv) If the equation contains only odd powers of x, and the coefficients are all of the same sign, the equation has no real root except x = ; thus the equation x 9 + 2x 5 + 3x 3 + x = has no real root except x = 0. All the foregoing results are included in the theorem of the next article, which is known as Descartes' Rule of Signs. 547. An equation f(x) = cannot have more positive roots than there are changes of sign in f (x), and cannot have more negative roots than there are changes of sign in f (-x). Suppose that the signs of the terms in a polynomial are + H 1 1 1— ; we shall shew that if this polynomial is multiplied by a binomial whose signs are A — , there will be at least one more change of sign in the product than in the original polynomial. Writing down only the signs of the terms in the multiplica- tion, we have + 460 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Hence we see that in the product (i) an ambiguity replaces each continuation of sign in the original polynomial; (ii) the signs before and after an ambiguity or set of am- biguities are unlike; (iii) a change of sign is introduced at the end. Let us take the most unfavourable case and suppose that all the ambiguities are replaced by continuations; from (ii) we see that the number of changes of sign will be the same whether we take the upper or the lower signs; let us take the upper; thus the number of changes of sign cannot be less than in + + + + - + -+, and this series of signs is the same as in the original polynomial with an additional change of sign at the end. If then we suppose the factors corresponding to the negative and imaginary roots to be already multiplied together, each factor x — a corresponding to a positive root introduces at least one change of sign; therefore no equation can have more positive roots than it has changes of sign. Again, the roots of the equation f(—x) = are equal to those of /(^) = but opposite to them in sign; therefore the negative roots of f(x)-0 are the positive roots of /*(-#) = 0; but the number of these positive roots cannot exceed the number of changes of sign in f{— x) ; that is, the number of negative roots of f(x) = cannot exceed the number of changes of sign in /(- > Example. Consider the equation a; 9 + 5x 8 - x* + Ix + 2 = 0. Here there are two changes of sign, therefore there are at most two positive roots. Again /(- x)= — x 9 + 5x 8 + x 3 -7x + 2, and here there are three changes of sign, therefore the given equation has at most three negative roots, and therefore it must have at least four imaginary roots.

The student who knows the elements of the Differential Cal- culus will see that the above expansion of f(x + h) is only a particular case of Taylor's Theorem; the functions f (x), f\" (x), f'\"{x) may therefore be written down at once by the ordinary rules for differentiation: thus to obtain f'(x) £romf(x) we multiply each term in f(x) by the index of x in that term and then diminish the index by unity.

Let f{x) =p x n +p 1 x n ~ 1 + p 2 x\"~ 2 + ... +p n _ l x + p n ; put x — y + h, and suppose that f [x) then becomes Now y = x — h; hence we have the identity p x\" +p 1 x n ~ l + p 2 x n ~ 2 +... +p n _ 1 x + p n = q o (x- h) n +q x (x- h)- 1 + . . . + q n _ x (x - h) + q n ; therefore q n is the remainder found by dividing f(x) by x-h; also the quotient arising from the division is q (x-h)*- l +q l {x-hy-'+...+q H _ i .

It does not follow that f(x) = has only one root between a and b; neither does it follow that if f(a) and /(b) have the same signf(x) = has no root between a and b. 553. Every equation of an odd degree has at least one real root whose sign is opposite to that of its last term. In the function f(x) substitute for x the values + co , 0, -co successively, then /( + oo) = + co, f(0)=p nJ /(-oo) = -oo. If p n is positive, then f(x) = has a root lying between and — oo , and if p n is negative f(x) = has a root lying between and + co . 554. Every equation which is of an even degree and has its last term negative has at least two real roots, one positive and one negative. For in this case /(+co) = +co, f(0)=p n , f(-co) = + co; but p n is negative; hence f(x) = has a root lying between and + co , and a root lying between and - co . 555. If the expressions f (a) and f (b) have contrary signs, an odd number of roots of f (x) = will lie between a and b; and «/*f(a) andi(h) have the same sign, either no root or an even number of roots will lie between a and b. Suppose that a is greater than b, and that a, /3, y, . . . k represent all the roots of f(x) = which lie between a and b. Let <f> (x) be the quotient when f(x) is divided by the product (x — a) (x — /3) (x — y) ... (x — k ) ; then f(x) — (x — a)(x—/3)(x- y) ... (x — k ) <£ (x). Hence f (a) = (a — a) (a — /3) (a — y) ... (a - k) </> («)• /(8)=(5-a)(6- J 3)(6- r )...(ft-K)*(5). Now <{>(a) and <f>(b) must be of the same sign, for otherwise a root of the equation <j£>(.x') = 0, and therefore of f (x) = 0, would lie between a and b [Art. 552], which is contrary to the hypo- H. H. A. 30 466 HIGHER ALGEBRA. thesis. Hence if /(a) and /(b) have contrary signs, the ex pressions (a - a) (a -fi)(a-y) ... (a - k), (b-a)(b-P)(b-y)...(b- K ) must have contrary signs. Also the factors in the first expression are all positive, and the factors in the second are all negative; hence the number of factors must be odd, that is the number of roots a, /?, y, ... k must be odd. Similarly if /(a) and /(b) have the same sign the number of factors must be even. In this case the given condition is satisfied if a, /?, y, . . . k are all greater than a, or less than b ; thus it does not necessarily follow that y* (as) = has a root between a and b. 556. If a, b, c, ...k are the roots of the equation /(x) = 0, then / (x) = j? (x — a)(x-b)(x — c) ... (x — k). Here the quantities a, b, c, ... k are not necessarily unequal. If r of them are equal to a, s to b, t to c, . . . , then /(x) = p (x — a) r (x - b) s (x — c)' In this case it is convenient still to speak of the equation /{x) — as having n roots, each of the equal roots being considered a distinct root. 557. 1/ the equation f(x) = has r roots equal to a, then the j equation f (x) = will have r — 1 roots equal to a. Let <£(#) be the quotient when /(x) is divided by (x — a) r ; then /(x) = (x — a) r $>{x). Write x + h in the place of x; thus /(x + h) = (x-a + h) r 4>(x+ h) ; .-../(») + ¥'(x) + %/\"(x)+.. . = Ux-a) r + r(x-a) r - x h + ...\\U(x) + hcf>'(x)+~ <}>\"(x)+ ...] . In this identity, by equating the coefficients of A, we have /'(x)=r(x - ay-'^x) + (x - a) r $ (x). Thus/'(aj) contains the factor x-a repeated r-\\ times; that is, the equation /' (x) = has ?• - 1 roots equal to a. THEORY OF EQUATIONS. 4G7 Similarly we may shew that if the equation f (x) = has s roots equal to b, the equation f (x) = has s — 1 roots equal to b ; and so on. 558. From the foregoing proof we see that if f{x) contains a factor (x — a)\\ then f (x) contains a factor (x — a)* -1 ; and thus f{x) and f'(x) have a common factor (x — a) r ~\\ Therefore if f(x) and fix) have no common factor, no factor in f(x) will be repeated ; hence the equation f (x) = has or has not equal roots, according as f (x) and f (x) have or have not a common factor involving x. 559. From the preceding article it follows that in order to obtain the equal roots of the equation f(x) = 0, we must first find the highest common factor of f(x) and /*'(#). Example 1. Solve the equation ar 1 - llx 3 + 44ar -76x+ 48 = 0, which has equal roots. Here / {x) = x 4 - lis 3 + 44a? - 76a + 48, /' {x) = 4x 3 - 33a 2 + 88x - 76 ; and by the ordinary rule we find that the highest common faetor of f(x) and /' (a;) is x - 2 ; hence (x - 2) 2 is a factor of f(x) ; and /(a;) = (a:-2) 2 (a: 2 -7x+12) = (a;-2) 2 (a;-3)(a:-4); thus the roots are 2, 2, 3, 4. Example 2. Find the condition that the equation aar 3 + 36a; 2 + 3ca; + d — may have two roots equal. In this case the equations f(x) = 0, and /' (x) = 0, that is ax s + Sbx 2 + 3cx + d = (1), ax 2 -f 2bx + c = Q (2) must have a common root, and the condition required will be obtained by eliminating x between these two equations. By combining (1) and (2), we have bx 2 + 2cx + d = (3). From (2) and (3), we obtain a; 2 _ x _ 1 2 (bd - c 2 ) ~ be-all ~ 2{ac - ft 2 ) ' thus the required condition is (6c - adf =4 (ac - b-) (bd - <-). 30—2 4fi8 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 560 We have seen that if the equation/^) = has r roots equal to a, the equation /(a) = has r - 1 roots equal to a. But r(x) is the first derived function of f (x); hence the equation f'\\x) = must have r-2 roots equal to a; similarly the equation f>t x \\ = o must have r - 3 roots equal to a; and so on. IheseL considerations will sometimes enable us to discover the equal roots of f(x) = with less trouble than the method ot Art. 559. 561.

', hence f(x) is equal to the coefficient of h in the right-hand member of (1); therefore, as in Art. 163, f(x)= (x-b) (x-c) ... (x-k) + (x -a)(x- c) ...

By equating coefficients, S 1 + 5p = ±p, whence 8 X .— - p ; S 2 +pS l = 0, whence S 2 =p z ; S 3 +pS 2 + oq = 2q, whence S 3 = - p % -Sq; S 4 +pS 3 + qS x = 0, whence S 4 =p i + 4j)q. To find the value of S k for other values of k, we proceed as follows. Multiplying the given equation by #*~ 5 , x* +px k ~ 1 + qx*~ 3 + to* -5 = 0. Substituting for x in succession the values a, b, c, d, e and adding the results, we obtain S k +pS k _ x + qS k _ 3 + tS k _ 5 = 0. Put k = 5 ; thus S 5 +pS 4 + qS 2 + 5t = 0, whence S 5 = -p 5 - op 2 q - bt. Put k = 6 ; thus S 6 +pS 5 + qS 3 + tS x = 0, whence S 6 =p 6 + 6p'*q + Sq 2 + bpt. To find 5_ 4 , put k = 4, 3, 2, 1 in succession; then S i +pS 3 + qS 1 + *#_! = (), whence S_ x = 0; 2,/ S 3 +pS 2 + 5q + tS_ 2 = 0, whence S_. 2 = - — ; S. 2 +pS 1 + qS- 1 + tS_ 3 = 0, whence S_ 3 = 0; S 1 + 5p + qS_ 2 + tS_ 4 = 0, whence £_ 4 = % - Ap . 563. When the coefficients are numerical we may also pro- ceed as in the following example. - Example. Find the sum of the fourth powers of the roots of x*-2x 2 + x-l = 0.

The discussion of an equation is sometimes simplified by transforming it into another equation whose roots bear some assigned relation to those of the one proposed. Such transforma- tions are especially useful in the solution of cubic equations. 565. To transform an equation into another ivhose roots are those of the proposed equation with contrary signs. Let f(x) = be the proposed equation. Put -y for x; then the equation f(—y) - is satisfied by every root of f(x) - with its sign changed ; thus the required equation is f(—y) = 0. 472 HIGHER ALGEBRA. If the proposed equation is then it is evident that the required equation will be p y n -py~ l + p 2 f~ 2 - + (- ir x A-,y + (- W. = o, which is obtained from the original equation by changing the sign of every alternate term beginning with the second. 566. To transform an equation into another whose roots are equal to those of the proposed equation multiplied by a given quantity. Let f{x) = be the proposed equation, and let q denote the given quantity. Put y — qx, so that x — - , then the required equation is f ( - J = 0. The chief use of this transformation is to clear an equation of fractional coefficients. Example. Remove fractional coefficients from the equation *»-•*-* .+1-0. Put x = - and multiply each term by q 3 ; thus 3 13 By putting q = 4 all the terms become integral, and on dividing by 2, we obtain y s -Sy 2 -y + Q = 0. 567. To transform an equation into another whose roots are the reciprocals of the roots of the proposed equation. Let f(x) = be the proposed equation ; put y = - , so that X — y - ; then the required equation isy( - ) = 0. One of the chief uses of this transformation is to obtain the values of expressions which involve symmetrical functions of negative powers of the roots. TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 473 Example 1.

Here S 1= -3; £ 2 =(-3) 2 -2(-2) = 13; and S 3 + 3S. 2 -2S 1 -3 = 0; whence we obtain S,= -42. 1 568. If an equation is unaltered by changing x into — , it is called a reciprocal equation.

In this case tlie coefficients of terms equidistant from the begin- ning and end are equal in magnitude and opposite in sign, and if the equation is of an even degree the middle term is wanting. 569. Suppose that f (x) = is a reciprocal equation. If f (x) = is of the first class and of an odd degree it has a root —1; so that f (x) is divisible by aj + 1. If <f>(x) is the quotient, then <f>(x) =0 is a reciprocal equation of the first class and of an even degree. If f(x) = is of the second class and of an odd degree, it has a root + 1 ; in this case f(x) is divisible by as— 1, and as before <j> (x) = is a reciprocal equation of the first class and of an even degree. If f(x) = is of the second class and of an even degree, it has a root + 1 and a root - 1 ; in this case f{x) is divisible by x 2 — 1, and as before <f>(x) = Q is a reciprocal equation of the first class and of an even degree. Hence any reciprocal equation is of an even degree with its last term positive, or can be reduced to this form; which may therefore be considered as the standard form of reciprocal equations. 570. A reciprocal equation of the standard form can be re- duced to an equation of half its dimensions. Let the equation be ax 2m + bx 2m - ] + cx 2m ~ 2 + ... + kx m + ... + ex 2 + bx + a = 0; dividing by x m and rearranging the terms, we have i) + 6(^' +5 L) + .(.r-' +; l,)+... + *=a.a x m + x TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS. 475 Now * +,+ ^^4)K)-(*- ,+ ^); hence writing % for x + - , and giving to p in succession the values 1, 2, 3,... we obtain x 2 + - 2 = s* - 2, a 3 + - j = z (z 2 -2) -z = z 3 - 3z ; x x 4 + - 4 = z (z 3 - 2>z) - (z 2 - 2) = z* - iz 2 + 2 ; and so on; and generally x m + — is of m dimensions in z, and therefore the equation in z is of m dimensions. 571. To find the equation whose roots are the squares of those of a proposed equation. Let f(x) = be the given equation ; putting y = x 2 , we have x— Jy\\ hence the required equation is f(Jy) — 0. Example. Find the equation whose roots are the squares of those of the equation vP+p^+ptfc+p-^Q. Putting x=Jy, and transposing, we have (y+P2)Jy= -(PiU+2h)> whence {y 2 + 2p 2 y +pf) y =p x hj 2 + 2p x p z y + p 3 2 , or 2/ 3 + (3p a - Pl *) tf- + (i> 2 2 - 2 Pnh ) y-p. A 2 = 0. Compare the solution given in Ex. 2, Art. 539. 572. To transform an equation into another whose roots exceed those of the proposed equation by a given quantity. Let f (x) = be the proposed equation, and let h be the given quantity ; put y = x + h, so that x = y — h; then the required equation is f(y — h) — 0. Similarly f(y + h) = is an equation whose roots are less by h than those oif(x) = 0. 476 HIGHER ALGEBRA. Example. Find the equation whose roots exceed by 2 the roots of the equation 4x* + 32a; 3 + 83a; 2 + 76a; + 21 = 0. The required equation will be obtained by substituting x - 2 for a; in the proposed equation ; hence in Horner's process we employ x + 2 as divisor, and the calculation is performed as follows : 4 TRANSFORMATION OF EQUATIONS 477 Sometimes it will be more convenient to proceed as in the following example. Example. Remove the second term from the equation px? + qx 2 + rx + s = 0. Let a, /9, 7 be the roots, so that a + p + y= --. Then if we increase each of the roots by £- , in the transformed equation the sum of the roots dp will be equal to - - + - ; that is, the coefficient of the second term will p p be zero. Hence the required transformation will be effected by substituting x--~ 6p for x in the given equation. 574. From the equation f(x) = we may form an equation whose roots are connected with those of the given equation by some assigned relation. Let y be a root of the required equation and let cf>(x, y) = denote the assigned relation; then the transformed equation can be obtained either by expressing a; as a function of y by means of the equation <£ (x, y) = and substituting this value of x in f(x) = §; or by eliminating x between the equations f(x) = Q and <f> (x, y) = 0. Example 1. If a, b, c are the roots of the equation x 3 +p>x 2 + qx + r=0, form the equation whose roots are 11 1 a - — , b , c — r . be ca ab When x = a in the given equation, y = a- =- in the transformed equation j , , 1 a a but a-— = a — — =a + -; be abc r and therefore the transformed equation will be obtained by the substitution x ry y = x + - , or x = ~- ; v r 1 + r thus the required equation is r 2 y 3 +Pr{l + r)y 2 + q{l + r) 2 y + (l + r)* = 0. Example 2. Form the equation whose roots are the squares of the differences of the roots of the cubic x 3 + qx + r = Q. Let a, b, c be the roots of the cubic ; then the roots of the required equation are (b - c) 2 , (c - a) 2 , (a - b) 2 . 478 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 2a6c 2abc Now (b-c) 2 = fc 2 + c 2 -2fcc = a 2 + & 2 + c 2 -a 2 - a a = (a + b + c) 2 - 2 (be + ca + ah) - a 2 = -2 5 -a 2 + ^; a also when x = a in the given equation, y = (b-c) 2 in the transformed equation ; . 2r .*. ?/ = - 2o- a; J H . x Thus we have to eliminate x between the equations x s + qx + r=0, and .r 3 + (2# + y) x - 2r = 0. By subtraction (#+?/)# = 3r ; or a: = . Substituting and reducing, we obtain y s + 6 (2 ^2 + 9^ + 27,-2 + 4^3 _ . Cor. If a, &, c are real, (& - c) 2 , (c - a) 2 , (a - 6) 2 are all positive ; therefore 27r 2 + 4g 3 is negative. Hence in order that the equation x z + qx + r = may have all its roots real 27r 2 + 4<7 3 must be negative, that is (-) +(f) must be negative. If 27r 2 + 4# 3 =0 the transformed equation has one root zero, therefore the original equation has two equal roots. If 27r 2 + 4g 3 is positive, the transformed equation has a negative root [Art. 553], therefore the original equation must have two imaginary roots, since it is only such a pair of roots which can produce a negative root in the transformed equation.

The general type of a cubic equation is x 3 +Px 2 + Qx + fi=0, but as explained in Art. 573 this equation can be reduced to the simpler form x 3 + qx + r = 0, which we shall take as the standard form of a cubic equation. 576. To solve the equation x 3 + qx + r = 0. Let x = y + z ; then x 3 =y 3 + z 3 + 3yz (y + z) = y 3 + z 3 + 3yzx, and the given equation becomes y 3 + z 3 + (3yz + q)x+r = 0. At present y, z are any two quantities subject to the con- dition that their sum is equal to one of the roots of the given equation ; if we further suppose that they satisfy the equation 3yz + q = 0, they are completely determinate. We thus obtain o 3 y 3 + z 3 =-r, y 3 z 3 = -^; hence y 3 , z 3 are the roots of the quadratic Solving this equation, and putting y z =-\\ + J r i + it » sr ~ 2 V 4 27 ™ we obtain the value of x from the relation x = y + z; thus 1 r fr 2 q 3 Y f r 11 -2 + V4 + 27} + H-V\" r 2 q 3 ^ ' 4 + 97 The above solution is generally known as Cardan's Solution, as it was first published by him in the Ars Magna, in 1545. Cardan obtained the solution from Tartaglia; but the solution of the cubic seems to have been due originally to Scipio Ferreo, about CU13IC EQUATIONS. 481 1505. An interesting historical note on this subject will be found at the end of Burnside and Panton's Theory of Equations. 577. By Art. 110, each of the quantities on the right-hand side of equations (1) and (2) of the preceding article lias three cube roots, hence it would appear that x has nine values ; this, however, is not the case. For since yz = — ^, the cube roots are to be taken in pairs so that the product of each pair is rational. Hence if y, z denote the values of any pair of cube roots which fulfil this condition, the only other admissible pairs will be wy, ta*z and ii> 2 y, a)Z, where co, or are the imaginary cube roots of unity. Hence the roots of the equation are y + z, wy + w 2 z, <x) 2 y + wz. Example. Solve the equation x 3 - 15.r = 126. Put y + z for x, then y\"* + z* + {3yz-15)x = 126; put 3f/2-15 = 0, then y^z 3 = 126; also y*z s = 125 ; hence y' s , z :i are the roots of the equation i 2 -126£ + 125 = 0; .-. 2/3 = 125, sfc=l; y = 5, 2 = 1. Thus j/ + 2 = 5 + l = 6; u,y + u~z = ^—- 5 + - 2 = -3 + 2^/^3; w-y + wz = - 3-2^/^3; and the roots are 6, -3 + 2*7-3, -3-2 J -3. 578. To explain the reason why we apparently obtain nine values for x in Art. 576, we observe that y and z are to be found from the equations y 3 + z 3 + r = 0, yz = — \\ j but in the process of o q 3 solution the second of these was changed into y J z 3 = - ^ , which H.H. A. 31 482 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 2 would also hold if yz = — ~ , or yz = ^ ; hence the other six values of x are solutions of the cubics x 3 + wqx + r — 0, x 3 + ou 2 <p; + r = 0. 579. We proceed to consider more fully the roots of the equation x 3 + qx + r = 0. 2 3 v q . (i) If -r + ~ h positive, then y 3 and z 3 are both real; let y and # represent their arithmetical cube roots, then the roots are y + z, wy + oy 2 z, (o 2 y + wz. The first of these is real, and by substituting for a> and w 2 the other two become r 2 <7 3 . (ii) If -j + ^=- is zero, then y 3 — z 3 \\ in this case ?/ = z, and the roots become 2y, 2/(w + co 2 ), 2/(00 + to 2 ), or 2y, —3/, — ?/. r 2 <7 3 (iii) If — + ~ is negative, then ?/ 3 and 2 3 are imaginary ex- pressions of the form a + ib and a — ib. Suppose that the cube roots of these quantities are m + in and m — in; then the roots of the cubic become m + in + m — in, or 2m ; (m + m) o> + (m — in) <o 2 , or — m — w ^/3 ; (m + m) co 2 + (m — in) <o, or —m + n ^3 ; which are all real quantities. As however there is no general arithmetical or algebraical method of finding the exact value of the cube root of imaginary quantities [Compare Art. 89], the solution obtained in Art. 576 is of little practical use when the roots of the cubic are all real and unequal. This case is sometimes called the Irreducible Case of Cardan's solution. 580. In the irreducible case just mentioned the solution may be completed by Trigonometry as follows. Let the solution be 1 1 x = (a + ib) 3 + (a - ib) 3 ; BIQUADHATIC EQUATIONS. 483 put a = r cos 6, b = r sin 0, so that r 2 = a 2 + b\\ tan = - then (« + ^) 3 = {r (cos + i sin 6)f.

It will be found that in each of the methods we have first to solve an auxiliary cubic equation ; and thus it will be seen that as in the case of the cubic, the general solution is not adapted for writing clown the solution of a given numerical equation. • 58 i 2 ; J he solution of a biquadratic equation was first ob- tained by Ferrari, a pupil of Cardan, as follows. Denote the equation by x 4 + 2px 3 + qx 2 + 2rx + s=0; add to each side (ax + b) 2 , the quantities a and b being determined so as to make the left side a perfect square; then x 4 + 2px 3 +(q + a 2 )x 2 + 2(r + ab)x + s + b 2 = (ax + b) 2 . Suppose that the left side of the equation is equal to (rf+px+k)*- then by comparing the coefficients, we have p* + 2k - q + a 2 , pk = r + ab, If = s + b' 2 ; 31—2 484 HIGHER ALGEBRA. by eliminating a and b from these equations, we obtain (pk - r) 2 = (21c +p* - q) (k 2 - s), or 2k 3 -qk 2 + 2 ( pr - s) k + p 2 s - qs - r 2 = 0. From this cubic equation one real value of k can always be found [Art. 553]; thus a and b are known. Also (x 2 +px + W = ( ax + W'> .'. x 2 +px + k = ±(ax + b); and the values of x are to be obtained from the two quadratics x 2 + (p — a) x + (k — b) = t and x 2 + (2) + a)x+ (k + b) = 0. Example. Solve the equation x i - 2.x 3 - 5x- + Hh; - 3 = 0. Add a 2 x 2 + 2abx + b 2 to each side of the equation, and assume x* - 2x* + (a 2 - 5) x 2 + 2 {ab + 5) x + 6 2 - 3 = (x 2 - x + k) 2 • then by equating coefficients, we have a 2 =2fc + 6, ab = -k-5, b 2 =k 2 + 3; .-. (2fc + 6)(fc 2 + 3) = (7c + 5) 2 ; .-. 2k* + 5k 2 -M- 7 = 0. By trial, we find that k= - 1 ; hence a 2 = 4, & 2 = 4, ab= - 4. But from the assumption, it follows that (x 2 -x + k) 2 =(ax + b) 2 . Substituting the values of k } a and b, we have the two equations x 2 - x - 1 = ± (2x - 2) ; that is, z 2 -3.r + l = 0, and x 2 + x-3 = Q; whence the roots are — ~— , ^ — . a - 583. The following solution was given by Descartes in 1637. Suppose that the biquadratic equation is reduced to the form x 1 + qx 2 + rx + s = ; assume x 4 + qx 2 + rx + s = (x 2 + kx + 1) (x 2 - kx + m) ; BIQUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 485 then by equating coefficients, we have I + vi — k 2 — q, k (m — l) = r, Im = s. From the first two of these equations, we obtain v v 2m = AT + q + t , 2l=k 2 + q -j; hence substituting in the third equation, (k 3 + qk + r) (k 3 + qk - r) = 4sk 2 , or ¥ + 2qk 4 + (q 2 - 4s) k 2 - r 2 = 0. This is a cubic in k 2 wliich always has one real positive solu- tion [Art. 553]; thus when k 2 is known the values of I and m are determined, and the solution of the biquadratic is obtained by solving the two quadratics x 2 + kx + I = 0, and x 2 — kx + m=0. Example. Solve the equation z 4 -2a; 2 + 8j;-3 = 0. Assume x 4 - 2a; 2 + 8# - 3 = (x 2 + kx + 1) (x 2 - kx + m) ; then by equating coefficients, we have l + m-k 2 = -2, k(m-l) = 8, lm = -Z; whence we obtain {k 3 - 2k + 8) (A; 3 - 2k - 8) = - 12& 2 , or fc 6 -4fc 4 + 16fc 2 -64 = 0. This equation is clearly satisfied when A; 2 -4 = 0, or k— ±2. It will be sufficient to consider one of the values of k ; putting k = 2, we have m+l = 2, 7n-l = 4] that is, l = -l, m = 3. Thus as* - 2.r 2 + 8.r - 3 = (.r 2 + 2x - 1 ) {x 2 - 2x + 3) ; hence a; 2 + 2.r-l = 0, and x--2x + 3 = ; and therefore the roots are - 1 ± J2, 1± J^2. 584. The general algebraical solution of equations of a degree higher than the fourth has not been obtained, and Abel's demonstration of the impossibility of such a solution is generally accepted by Mathematicians. If, however, the coefficients of an equation are numerical, the value of any real root may be found to any required degree of accuracy by Horner's Method of ap- proximation, a full account of which will be found in treatises on the Theory of Equations. 486 HIGHER ALGEBRA. 585. We shall conclude with the discussion of some miscella- neous equations. Example 1. Solve the equations : x + y + z + u = 0, ax + by +cz + du = 0, a 2 x + b 2 y + c 2 z + d 2 u = 0, a?x + b 3 y + c 3 z + d 3 u = k. Multiply these equations, beginning from the lowest, by 1, p, q, r re- spectively ; p, q, r being quantities which are at present undetermined. Assume that they are such that the coefficients of y, z, u vanish ; then x (a 3 +pa 2 + qa + r) = k, whilst b, c, d are the roots of the equation t 3 +pt 2 + qt + r = 0. Hence a 3 +pa 2 + qa + r = (a-b){a-c){a- d) ; and therefore (a -b)(a- c) {a -d)x = h. Thus the value x is found, and the values of y, z, u can be written down by symmetry. Cor. If the equations are x + y + z + u = l, ax + by + cz + du = I; a 2 x + b 2 y + c*-z + d 2 u = k 2 , a 3 x + b s y + c 3 z + dhi = A; 3 , by proceeding as before, we have x (a 3 +pa 2 + qa + r) = k 3 +pk 2 + qk + r; .'. (a-b)(a-c)(a-d) x = (k- b)(k-c)(k-d). Thus the value of x is found, and the values of y, z, u can be written down by symmetry. The solution of the above equations has been facilitated by the use of Undetermined Multipliers. Example 2. Shew that the roots of the equation {x -a){x- b) (x - c) -f 2 (x -a)-g 2 (x-b)- h 2 {x -c) + 2fgh = are all real. From the given equation, we have {x-a){(x-b)(x-c)-f*}-{g*{x-b) + h*(x-c)-2fgh}=0. Let p, q be the roots of the quadratic {x-b)(x-e)-f*=0, BIQUADRATIC EQUATIONS. 487 and suppose ^ to be not less than q. By solving the quadratic, we have 2x = b + c±J(b-c)* + tf :i (1); now the value of the surd is greater than b ~ c, so that p is greater than h or c, and q is less than b or c. In the given equation substitute for x successively the values + °°» v, q> - 30 ; the results are respectively + °° , -fajp^b-h Jp ~ c ) 2 > +{<J Jb-q- h Jc - q)~, - cc , since {p -b)(p- c) =f* = (b - q) (c - q). Thus the given equation has three real roots, one greater than 2', one between _p and q, and one less than q. If p = q, then from (1) we have (6-c) 2 + 4/ 2 = and therefore b = c,f=0. In this case the given equation becomes (x -b){{x- a) (x -b)-g*- lr} =0 ; thus the roots are all real. If p is a root of the given equation, the above investigation fails ; for it only shews that there is one root between q and + oo , namely p. But as before, there is a second real root less than q ; bence the third root must also be real. Similarly if q is a root of the given equation we can shew that all the roots are real. The equation here discussed is of considerable importance ; it occurs frequently in Solid Geometry, and is there known as the Discriminating Cubic. 586. The following system of equations occurs in many branches of Applied Mathematics. Example.
