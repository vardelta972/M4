All answers must be expressed in simplest form unless speciﬁed otherwise. Only answers written inside the boxes on the answer sheet will be considered for grading. No calculators. 1. If f (x) = nx, g(x) = e2x, and h(x) = g(f (x)), ﬁnd n such that h′(0) = 100. 2. Farmer Joe will plant carrots to cover a rectangle in the ﬁrst quadrant with a vertex at the origin and sides parallel to the x and y axes. However, he can not grow carrots on his neighbor’s land. If the border between his and his neighbor’s land is along the curve y = − ln(2x), what is the maximum area of carrotland Farmer Joe can create? 3. For all θ from 0 to 2π, Annie draws a line segment of length θ from the origin in the direction of θ radians. What is the area of the spiral swept out by the union of these line segments? 4. The Chebyshev Polynomials are deﬁned as Tn(x) = cos(n cos−1(x)), for n = 0, 1, 2, .... Compute the following inﬁnite series: ∞∑ n=1 ∫ 1 −1 T2n+1(x)dx. If the series diverges, your answer should be ”D.” 5. What is (2020) 2 + (2021)2 1! + (2022)2 2! + (2023)2 3! + (2024)2 4! + . . . 6. Let us deﬁne the sequence an = (−1)n/(n). Now, we deﬁne the partial sums AN = N∑ n=1 an. What is the diﬀerence ∞∑ N =1 ( AN − lim M →∞ AM )) ? 7. Deﬁne f1(x) = x and for every integer n ≥ 2, we deﬁne fn(x) = xfn−1(x). Compute lim n→∞ ∫ 2020 e f ′ n(x) fn(x)fn−1(x) ln x − f ′ n−1(x) fn−1(x) dx. 8. Compute ∫ ∞ 0 dx x4 − 6x2 + 25 . SMT 2020 Calculus Test February 22, 2020 9. Deﬁne an = √ 2 + √2 + √2 + . . . | {z } n square roots . For example a1 = √2 and a2 = √2 + √2. Find the value of lim n→∞ 4 n(2 − an). 10. Let Im = ∫ 2π 0 sin(x) sin(2x) · · · sin(mx)dx. Find the sum of all integers 1 ≤ m ≤ 100 such that Im ̸= 0.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
