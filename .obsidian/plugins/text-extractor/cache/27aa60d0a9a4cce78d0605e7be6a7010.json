Solution: We shall show that there does not exist such function. Let us assume to the contrary that f is such a function. Now, for any positive integer n, the number 1 − 1/n belongs to [0, 1) which is the range of f , hence there exists xn ∈ [0, 1] such that f (xn) = 1 − 1/n. Thus, we get a sequence xn in [0, 1] such that f (xn) = 1 − 1/n holds for every n ≥ 1. This sequence xn might not converge; but since it is bounded, it has a convergence subsequence (by Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem). Say that subsequence is {xnk}k≥1 and suppose that it converges to c. Since 0 ≤ xnk ≤ 1 for every k ≥ 1, so 0 ≤ c ≤ 1 (this ensures that f is continuous at c). Now, xnk → c and f is continuous, hence f (xnk) → f (c). But f (xnk) = 1 − 1/nk which converges to 1 as k → ∞. Thus we get f (c) = 1, which is a contradiction. □ One key idea in the above solution is to get hold of a sequence xn such that f (xn) has a desired property, and then use a convergent subsequence of xn to derive some contradiction. This idea will be used again and again in this note for proving some theorems on continuous functions. Theorem. Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is a continuous function. Then f must be bounded. Proof. Let, if possible, f be unbounded. Without loss of generality, we may assume that f is unbounded above. Then for every n ∈ N, there exists xn ∈ [a, b] such that f (xn) > n. Now, xn is bounded, hence it has a convergent subsequence. Say that subsequence is xnk which converges to c. Since a ≤ xnk ≤ b for every k ≥ 1, it follows that a ≤ c ≤ b. Thus, xnk → c and f is continuous at c, which implies that f (xnk) converges to f (c). This in turn implies that f (xnk) must be bounded. But, f (xnk) > nk for each k ≥ 1 and nk’s are strictly increasing, which means that f (xnk) is unbounded 1. Thus we arrive at a contradiction. □ 1If a sequence is unbounded above, it need not be true that any subsequence of it must also be un- bounded. But here we have f (xn) > n for every n ≥ 1. This ensures that the subsequence f (xnk ) is also unbounded. 1 The last theorem says that if a function is continuous on a closed bounded interval, then it must be bounded on that interval. But it does not tell us whether the function attains a maximum or minimum there. However, it turns out that such a function indeed attains its extreme values: Theorem. Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is a continuous function. Then there exists c, d ∈ [a, b] such that f (c) ≥ f (x) ≥ f (d) holds for every x ∈ [a, b]. Proof.(Optional) Let us show that f attains a maximum value (the proof for min- imum will be similar). Consider the set S = {f (x) : a ≤ x ≤ b} (which is just the range of f ). The last theorem shows that S is bounded above, hence S has a supremum (least upper bound of S). Call u = sup S. Now, for every n ∈ N, u − 1/n is not an upper bound of S, which means that there is member of S which is greater than u − 1/n. Therefore, there exists xn in [a, b] such that u − 1/n < f (xn) ≤ u. Therefore, Sandwich theorem tells us that f (xn) → u as n → ∞. Now, xn might not converge, but it has a convergent subsequence xnk. Suppose xnk → c and it follows that c ∈ [a, b]. Since f is continuous at c, we get f (xnk) → f (c). But earlier we had f (xn) → u. Hence, f (c) = u = sup S =⇒ f (x) ≤ f (c) for every x ∈ [a, b]. □ The last two theorems can be combined to say the following: if a function is continuous on a closed bounded interval then not only it must be bounded, but it also attains a maximum and a minimum inside that interval. This result is known as the Extreme Value Theorem. This theorem will be crucial for some results on diﬀerentiation and integration that we shall see in due course of time. Next, we shall explore another property of continuous function. Suppose a kid measures his height every time he goes to a doctor. On two successive occasions, he measured his height to be 4 ft 2 inches and 4 ft 4 inches respectively. Since height increases continuously w.r.t. time, we can surely say that at some point of time, he was exactly 4 ft 3 inches tall. This is known as the Intermediate Value Property (IVP). The next theorem tells us that if a function is continuous on a closed bounded interval then it has this property. Theorem. Suppose f is a function continuous on [a, b] and k ∈ R such that f (a) < k < f (b). Then there exists c between a and b such that f (c) = k. This is known as the Intermediate Value Theorem. In order to prove this theo- rem, we may assume w.l.o.g. that k = 0. Because, once we prove it for k = 0, we can apply that to the function g(x) = f (x) − k. The proof for k = 0 is given below. 2 Theorem. Suppose f is a function continuous on [a, b] such that f (a) < 0 < f (b). Then there exists c between a and b such that f (c) = 0. Proof.(Optional) Consider S = {x : a ≤ x ≤ b and f (x) ≤ 0}. The set S is bounded above and hence it has a supremum. Let us call c = sup S. We shall show that f (c) = 0. Since a ≤ c ≤ b, it follows that f is continuous at c. Fix any ε > 0. Then there exists δ > 0 such that f (x) − ε < f (c) < f (x) + ε holds whenever x ∈ (c − δ, c + δ). Now, the deﬁnition of supremum tells us that the interval (c − δ, c] contains a member of S, call it x0. And the interval (c, c + δ) does not contain a member of S, call it y0. We have f (c) < f (x0) + ε ≤ ε and f (c) > f (y0) − ε > −ε. Therefore, −ε < f (c) < ε. Since ε > 0 is arbitrary, it follows that f (c) = 0. □ Note, in the above theorem we had f (a) < 0 < f (b). The result holds even if f (a) > 0 > f (b). So we can restate the theorem as: if f is continuous on [a, b] and f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs, then there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that f (c) = 0. The last theorem is known as Bolzano’s theorem. There is an alternate proof of this theorem that essentially does a binary search for ﬁnding a root (see section 5.3 in the book ‘Introduction to Real Analysis’ by Bartle and Sherbert). An important corollary of the extreme value theorem and intermediate value theorem is the following: Corollary. A continuous function maps a closed bounded interval into a closed bounded interval. In other words, if f : [a, b] → R is continuous, then image of f is [c, d] for some c < d. Let f : [a, b] → R be a function. We showed that if f is continuous then f has the intermediate value property (IVP). Now you might ask, is the converse true? It turns out that the answer is ‘No’. Here is a counter-example: deﬁne f (x) = sin(1/x) for x ̸= 0 and f (0) = 0. 3 We can show that f is not continuous at 0. But does f have IVP? Look at the graph above. Take any interval around 0, say[−ε, ε]. Since f oscillates completely (from −1 to 1) inﬁnitely often, we can show that f attains all the values in [−1, 1]. Thus, the above function f has IVP, although it it not continuous at 0. Let us now solve a problem making use of the intermediate value property. Problem. Suppose f is a function with f (0) = f (1). If f has IVP, then show that there exists c ∈ (0, 1) such that f (c + 1/2) = f (c). Proof. Consider the function g(x) = f (x + 1/2) − f (x), 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2. Clearly g is continuous. Observe that g(0) = f (1/2) − f (0) and g(1/2) = f (1) − f (1/2) = f (0) − f (1/2). If g(0) or g(1/2) is zero, then the result follows. Else, g(0) and g(1) have opposite signs which implies that there exists c ∈ (0, 1/2) such that g(c) = 0 =⇒ f (c + 1/2) = f (c). □ Problem. Let f : [0, 1] → [0, 1] be continuous. Show that f has a ﬁxed point in [0, 1]; that is, there exists x0 ∈ [0, 1] such that f (x0) = x0. Proof. Consider g(x) = f (x) − x. Since 0 ≤ f (x) ≤ 1 for every x ∈ [0, 1], we have g(0) ≥ 0 and g(1) ≤ 0. If g(0) or g(1) equals zero then we are through. Else, we have g(0) > 0 > g(1) and g is continuous on [0, 1], so there exists x0 ∈ (0, 1) such that g(x0) = 0. □ Problem. Let P (x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients and suppose that the degree of P (x) is odd. Show that the equation P (x) = 0 must have at least one real root. Proof. Suppose P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, (an ̸= 0). We can assume w.l.o.g that an = 1. Now, it is easy to see that lim x→∞ P (x) xn = 1 = lim x→−∞ P (x) xn . Since n is odd, we can say that P (x) must be positive for some suﬃciently large positive x and P (x) must be negative for some suﬃciently large negative x. Thus, we get a < b such that P (a) < 0 < P (b). Since P (x) is continuous, there exists c between a, b such that P (c) = 0. □ There are plenty of such problems, some are given as exercises at the end of this note. Next we shall see another important result that holds for continuous functions. 4 Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is continuous. Can we say that f must be monotone? The answer is clearly ‘No’. Consider another situation: suppose f : [a, b] → R is continuous and one-one. Can we now conclude that f must be monotone? This can be understood better by drawing some pictures, trying to make f continuous and one-one but not monotonic. If you try this yourself, you will get a feeling of why the next theorem holds. Theorem. Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is continuous and one-one. Then f must be strictly monotone. Proof. Fix any c < d < e in the interval [a, b]. We shall show that either f (c) < f (d) < f (e) or f (c) > f (d) > f (e) must hold. Let us assume to the contrary that none of them holds. Then we have four other possibilities: (i) f (c) < f (e) < f (d), (ii) f (e) < f (c) < f (d), (iii) f (d) < f (e) < f (c), and (iv) f (d) < f (c) < f (e). If f (c) < f (e) < f (d) (i.e. (i) holds), then IVP tells us that there exists e ′ ∈ (c, d) such that f (e ′) = f (e). But e′ ̸= e because e ′ < d < e. This contradicts that f is one-one. In a similar spirit, if f (e) < f (c) < f (d) (i.e. (ii) holds), then there exists c′ ∈ (d, e) such that f (c′) = f (c). But c′ ̸= c because c < d < c′. This contradicts that f is one-one. The other two cases are left for the reader. Having shown the above fact, we are ready to prove that f is monotone. Take any x < y in [a, b]. First consider the points a ≤ x < y. The above fact tells us that either f (a) ≤ f (x) < f (y) or f (a) ≥ f (x) > f (y) holds. Next, consider the points x < y ≤ b. We get that either f (x) < f (y) ≤ f (b) or f (x) > f (y) ≥ f (b) holds. Combining these two, we can say that either f (a) ≤ f (x) < f (y) ≤ f (b) or f (a) ≥ f (x) > f (y) ≥ f (b) must hold. Therefore, if f (a) < f (b), then we can say that x < y =⇒ f (x) < f (y) for every x, y ∈ [a, b]; and if f (a) > f (b), then x < y =⇒ f (x) > f (y) for every x, y ∈ [a, b]. This completes the proof. □ 5 The last theorem is found to be very useful while solving problems. Two such problems are given below, and many other are included as exercises in the end. Problem. Find all functions f : R → R which satisﬁes |f (x) − f (y)| = 3|x − y| for every x, y ∈ R. Proof. It is easy to show that f is continuous and one-one. Using this, we can conclude that f must be strictly monotone (see exercise 16 below). This means that either f is strictly increasing, or strictly decreasing. Assume that f is strictly increasing. Then for any x, y we have f (x) > f (y) ⇐⇒ x > y. Hence from the given equation, we deduce that f (x) − f (y) = 3(x − y) =⇒ f (x) − 3x = f (y) − 3y for every x, y ∈ R. Set y = 0 to get f (x) = 3x + c for every x ∈ R where c = f (0). For the case where f is strictly decreasing, we can show that f (x) = −3x + c for all x ∈ R. These are the only possibilities for f that satisﬁes the given equation. □ Problem. Suppose f : R → R is continuous and satisﬁes f n(x) = (−x) for every x ∈ R. Here f n denotes f composed with itself n times, e.g. f 2(x) = f (f (x)). Prove that n must be odd and ﬁnd all such functions f (x). Proof. First note that f is one-one. Since f is continuous, f must be monotone. If f is increasing, then x > y =⇒ f (x) > f (y) =⇒ f 2(x) > f 2(y) =⇒ · · · =⇒ f n(x) > f n(y) =⇒ −x > −y which is a contradiction. Therefore f must be decreasing. Next, if n is even (say n = 2k), then we get a similar contradiction: x > y =⇒ f (x) < f (y) =⇒ f 2(x) > f 2(y) =⇒ f 3(x) < f 3(y) =⇒ · · · =⇒ f 2k(x) > f 2k(y) =⇒ −x > −y (contradiction). Therefore, n must be odd. Observe another fact that f (−x) = f (f n(x)) = f n(f (x)) = −f (x) for every x ∈ R. In other words, f is an odd function. To sum up, we have shown that (i) f is decreasing, (ii) f is odd, (iii) n is odd. We claim that f (x) = −x. To prove our claim, ﬁx any x ∈ R. If f (x) > −x, then f 2(x) < f (−x) = −f (x) < x =⇒ f 3(x) > f (x) > −x =⇒ f 4(x) < f (−x) < x and so on. Eventually we arrive at f n(x) > −x =⇒ −x > −x which is a contradiction. Similar contradiction arises if f (x) < −x. Hence we conclude that f (x) = −x for every x ∈ R. □ 6 Exercises/Problems 1. Let f : I → R be a continuous function.
