More precisely, the area concerns structures of integers (or similar sets), with some number theoretic properties, which can be studied mainly by combinatorial means, rather than, for example, by algebraic methods. This area really only truly emerged throughout the 20th century, but has become extremely popular in the last four decades or so. In recent years, more and more mathematical olympiad style problems related to the area have also appeared. In this set of notes, we shall consider many of the most well-known theorems in combinatorial number theory, and show some applications along the way. These notes can be considered as a continuation of the set titled “Combinatorics”, and any undeﬁned graph theoretic terms here can be found in the preceding notes. 1. Ramsey’s Theorem Revisited In Section 2.5 of the notes titled “Combinatorics”, we introduced the notion of Ramsey Theory. In this section, we consider some further results in this topic. We recall that the most basic version of Ramsey’s Theorem is the following. Theorem 1 (Ramsey’s Theorem, 1930) Let m1, m2 ≥ 2 be integers. Then, there exists an integer N = N (m1, m2) such that, for all n ≥ N , whenever the edges of the complete graph Kn is coloured with two colours, there exists monochromatic Km1 in the ﬁrst colour, or a monochromatic Km2 in the second colour. The proof of Theorem 1 was left as an exercise in the preceding notes. There are many extensions to Theorem 1. To help us to describe these results, we make the following deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 1 (a) For n ∈ N, let [n] = {1, 2, . . . , n}. (b) For a set X and t ∈ N, let X (t) = {A ⊂ X : |A| = t}. That is, X (t) is the family which consists of all subsets of X with size t. Note that [n](2) can trivially be identiﬁed with the complete graph Kn on n vertices: the members of [n](2) are identiﬁed with the edges of Kn. Our ﬁrst extension of Theorem 1 is to consider using k colours, for any positive integer k. Theorem 2 (Ramsey’s Theorem, 1930) Let k ≥ 1 and m1, . . . , mk ≥ 2 be integers. Then, there exists an integer N = N (m1, . . . , mk) such that, for all n ≥ N , whenever [n](2) is coloured with colours 1, . . . , k, there exist 1 ≤ i ≤ k and a set M ⊂ [n] with |M | = mi such that all members of the set M (2) have colour i. 1 In other words, in graph theoretic terms, whenever the edges of Kn are coloured with colours 1, . . . , k, with n suﬃciently large, we have either a Km1 in colour 1, or a Km2 in colour 2, or . . . , or a Kmk in colour k. Proof of Theorem 2. We refer the k colours used as colour 1, colour 2, . . . , and colour k, and think of the elements of [n] (2) as the edges of the complete graph Kn on n vertices. We use induction on k. The case k = 1 is trivial, and the case k = 2 is Theorem 1. Now, let k ≥ 3, and suppose that the result holds for k − 1. Then there exists an integer N ′ = N ′(m2, m3, . . . , mk) such that whenever n ≥ N ′ and the edges of Kn are coloured with colours 2, . . . , k, we have a Kmi in colour i for some 2 ≤ i ≤ k. Now, there exists an integer N = N (m1, N ′) such that, whenever n ≥ N and the edges of Kn are coloured with colours 1, . . . , k, then either there exists a Km1 in colour 1, or a KN ′ using only colours 2, . . . , k, and hence containing a Kmi in colour i for some 2 ≤ i ≤ k. Hence this value of N works for the k colours, and the result follows by induction. □ Deﬁnition 2 The least integer N = N (m1, . . . , mk) for which Theorem 2 holds is the Ramsey number of Km1, . . . , Kmk, and is denoted by R(m1, . . . , mk). If m1 = · · · = mk = m, then we may write the Ramsey number as Rk(m). We have already seen that very few exact values of the Ramsey numbers are actually known. To date, for two colours, these are R(2, m) = m for any m ≥ 2, R(3, 3) = 6, R(3, 4) = 9, R(3, 5) = 14, R(3, 6) = 18, R(3, 7) = 23, R(3, 8) = 28, R(3, 9) = 36, R(4, 4) = 18, and R(4, 5) = 25. For more than two colours, the only non-trivial (with ki ≥ 3 for all i) known Ramsey number is R(3, 3, 3) = R3(3) = 17. Our next result is an inﬁnite version of Theorem 2, as follows. Theorem 3 (Ramsey’s Theorem, Inﬁnite Version, 1930) Let k ∈ N. Then, whenever N(2) is coloured with k colours, there exists an inﬁnite set M ⊂ N such that M (2) is monochromatic. Proof. As in the proof of Theorem 2, we refer the k colours used as colour 1, colour 2, . . . , and colour k, and think of the elements of N (2) as the edges of the inﬁnite complete graph on N. Take a1 ∈ N. Since we have used ﬁnitely many colours to colour N(2), there exists an inﬁnite set S1 ⊂ N such that all edges from a1 to S1 have the same colour, say colour c1 ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Next, take a2 ∈ S1. Then as before, there exists an inﬁnite set S2 ⊂ S1 such that all edges from a2 to S2 have the same colour, say colour c2 ∈ {1, . . . , k}. Repeating this inductively, we obtain a sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . in N and a sequence of colours c1, c2, c3, . . . such that if i < j, then the edge aiaj has colour ci. But then, we have ci1 = ci2 = ci3 = · · · for some inﬁnite subsequence i1, i2, i3, . . . . Hence, the inﬁnite set M = {ai1, ai2, ai3, . . . } is such that M (2) is monochromatic, as required. □ Example 1 (a) Suppose that we use two colours to colour N (2) such that {x, y} is red if x + y is even, and blue otherwise. Then taking M to be the set of even integers, or the set of odd integers, we have M (2) is an inﬁnite monochromatic set. 2 (b) Now, suppose that we use two colours to colour N(2) such that {x, y} is red if x + y has an even number of distinct prime divisors, and blue otherwise. Then Theorem 3 says that we can ﬁnd an inﬁnite set M such that M (2) is a monochromatic set. In other words, there exists an inﬁnite set M = {x1, x2, x3, . . . } such that for all i < j, we have either xi + xj has an even number of distinct prime divisors, or an odd number of distinct prime divisors. However, no actual example of such an inﬁnite set is known! Although Theorems 2 and 3 are extremely useful and the colourings can be viewed quite easily, namely, we are colouring the edges of a complete graph on ﬁnitely many vertices, or on N, the theorems can be extended. It turns out that the number ‘2’ plays no signiﬁcant role in the theorems. We may extend the theorems by considering colourings of subsets with size t. Theorem 4 (Ramsey’s Theorem for t-sets, 1930) Let k, t ≥ 1 and m1, . . . , mk ≥ t be integers. Then, there exists an integer N = N (t, m1, . . . , mk) such that, for all n ≥ N , whenever [n] (t) is coloured with colours 1, . . . , k, there exist 1 ≤ i ≤ k and a set M ⊂ [n] with |M | = mi such that all members of the set M (t) have colour i. Theorem 5 (Ramsey’s Theorem for t-sets, Inﬁnite Version, 1930) Let k, t ∈ N. Then, whenever N (t) is coloured with k colours, there exists an inﬁnite set M ⊂ N such that M (t) is monochromatic. Theorems 4 and 5 can be proved by induction on t. See Exercises 1 and 2 in Section 4. 2. Monochromatic Sets in Nr and Rr In this section, we want to consider ﬁnding monochromatic structures in X r, for some r ∈ N, where X = N or X = R, when the members of X r are coloured. Deﬁnition 3 Let m ∈ N. An arithmetic progression of length m is a sequence of the form a, a + d, a + 2d, . . . , a + (m − 1)d, and an inﬁnite arithmetic progression is an inﬁnite sequence of the form a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . , where in both cases, we have a, d ∈ R. The numbers a and d are the ﬁrst term and the common diﬀerence of the arithmetic progression. Throughout, we always assume that the common diﬀerence of an arithmetic progression is positive. The ﬁrst of our results is van der Waerden’s Theorem, which states that we can ﬁnd monochromatic arithmetic progressions of any given ﬁnite length when enough initial members of N are coloured. Theorem 6 (van der Waerden’s Theorem, 1927) Let m, k ∈ N. Then, there exists an integer N = N (m, k) such that for all n ≥ N , whenever [n] is coloured with k colours, there exists a monochromatic arithmetic progression in [n] of length m. 3 Proof. We use induction on m. The theorem holds for m = 1. Now, let m ≥ 2, and suppose that the theorem holds for m − 1. The idea of the proof goes as follows. Provided that n is suﬃciently large, then for any 1 ≤ s ≤ k, we show that we can either ﬁnd a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m in [n], or we can ﬁnd s monochromatic arithmetic progressions in [n], with distinct colours, with each having length m − 1, and such that the mth term of all of them is the same integer f . For the latter case, we call such a collection of arithmetic progressions colour-focussed, and the integer f the focus of the arithmetic progressions. Then we are clearly done, because by taking s = k, then no matter what the colour of f is, we will always get a monochromatic arithmetic progression with length m in [2n]. More precisely, we are done once we have proved the following claim. Claim. For all 1 ≤ s ≤ k, there exists t = t(m, s, k) such that, whenever [t] is k-coloured, either there exists a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m in [t], or there exist s colour-focussed arithmetic progressions of length m − 1 in [t]. Theorem 6 then follows by taking s = k and N = 2t. We shall prove the claim by induction on s. For s = 1, by the induction hypothesis for m, there exists N ′ = N ′(m−1, k) such that, if [N ′] is k-coloured, then there is a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m − 1 in [N ′]. Hence, we may take t = N ′ for s = 1. Now, let s ≥ 2, and suppose that t ′ = t ′(m, s − 1, k) is suitable for s − 1. Also by the induction hypothesis for m, there exists N ′′ = N ′′(m − 1, k2t′) such that, if [N ′′] is k2t′-coloured, then there is a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m − 1 in [N ′′]. We show that t = 2t ′N ′′ is suitable for s. Take a k-colouring of [t]. We are done if [t] contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m, so assume otherwise. Then, we divide [t] up into N ′′ blocks of length 2t ′, say B1, B2, . . . , BN ′′, where Bi = {2t ′(i − 1) + 1, . . . , 2t ′i} for every 1 ≤ i ≤ N ′′. Since there are k2t′ ways to colour each block, by the deﬁnition of N ′′, there are blocks Bp, Bp+q, Bp+2q, . . . , Bp+(m−2)q which are identically coloured, for some p, q ≥ 1. For the block Bp, since it has length 2t ′, by deﬁnition of t ′, there are s−1 colour-focussed arithmetic progressions of length m − 1 which, together with their focus f , all lie in Bp. Let the arithmetic progressions be A1, . . . , As−1, where Aj = {aj, aj + dj, aj + 2dj, . . . , aj + (m − 2)dj} for 1 ≤ j ≤ s − 1. Note that f = aj + (m − 1)dj for every j, and has a diﬀerent colour from the colours of A1, . . . , As−1. Now for each j, consider A ′ j = {aj, aj + (dj + 2t ′q), aj + 2(dj + 2t ′q), . . . , aj + (m − 2)(dj + 2t ′q)}. That is, for each j, A ′ j is formed by considering the copies of Aj in each of Bp, Bp+q, Bp+2q, . . . , Bp+(m−2)q, and then taking the ﬁrst term of the ﬁrst copy, the second term of the second copy, . . . , and the (m − 1)th term of the (m − 1)th copy. Then, A ′ 1, . . . , A′ s−1 are colour-focussed at f + 2t ′q(m − 1), since f + 2t′q(m − 1) = 4 aj + (m − 1)(dj + 2t ′q) for every j. But, A′ s = {f, f + 2t ′q, f + 2(2t ′q), . . . , f + (m − 2)(2t ′q)} is a monochromatic arithmetic progression (consisting of the copies of f in Bp, Bp+q, Bp+2q, . . . , Bp+(m−2)q), and has a diﬀerent colour from A ′ 1, . . . , A′ s−1. Hence, A ′ 1, . . . , A′ s are s colour-focused arithmetic progressions, with focus f + 2t ′q(m − 1). The claim follows by induction on s, and Theorem 6 is proved. □ Deﬁnition 4 The least integer N = N (m, k) for which Theorem 6 holds is denoted by W (m, k). These are the van der Waerden numbers. Similar to the Ramsey numbers, very few exact values of W (m, k) are known. Trivially, we have W (m, 1) = m and W (2, k) = k + 1. For the other values of m and k, it is known that W (3, 2) = 9, W (4, 2) = 35, W (5, 2) = 178, W (6, 2) = 1132, W (3, 3) = 27 and W (4, 3) = 76. The exact value of W (6, 2) was determined by Kouril and Paul in 2007. We have the following stronger version of van der Waerden’s Theorem, which states that not only can we ﬁnd arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions when enough initial members of N are coloured, but the common diﬀerence of the arithmetic progression also uses the same colour. Theorem 7 (Strengthened van der Waerden’s Theorem) Let m, k ∈ N. Then, there exists an integer N = N (m, k) such that for all n ≥ N , whenever [n] is coloured with k colours, there exists an arithmetic progression of length m such that all of its terms, along with its common diﬀerence, are in [n] and have the same colour. That is, there exist a, d ∈ N such that a, a + d, a + 2d, . . . , a + (m − 1)d and d are all in [n] and have the same colour. Theorem 7 can be proved by induction on k. See Exercise 6 in Section 4. We have the following corollary by taking m = 2. Corollary 8 (Schur’s Theorem, 1916) Let k ∈ N. Then, there exists an integer N = N (k) such that for all n ≥ N , whenever [n] is coloured with k colours, there exist x, y, z ∈ [n], all with the same colour, such that x + y = z. □ Alternatively, Corollary 8 can be proved by Ramsey’s Theorem. Second proof of Corollary 8. We show that N = Rk(3) will work for the result. Let n ≥ N = Rk(3). Then given a k-colouring c : [n] → {1, . . . , k}, deﬁne the k-colouring c′ : [n] (2) → {1, . . . , k} by c′(ab) = c(b − a), for a < b. By Theorem 2 with m1 = · · · = mk = 3, there exist u, v, w ∈ [n] with u < v < w and c′(uv) = c′(vw) = c′(uw). So, c(v − u) = c(w − v) = c(w − u) and (v − u) + (w − v) = w − u, and hence we can take x = v − u, y = w − v and z = w − u. □ Our next result is the Hales-Jewett Theorem, which considers colourings of a much more abstract structure: the lattice [ℓ] r for some ℓ, r ∈ N. Recall that [ℓ]r 5 consists of all ordered r-tuples (i.e., vectors) x = (x1, . . . , xr), where each entry xi is in [ℓ] = {1, . . . , ℓ}. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ r, xi is the ith coordinate of x. We also say that r is the dimension of [ℓ] r. Then, roughly speaking, the theorem says that if the dimension r is suﬃciently large, whenever [ℓ]r is coloured with k colours, we can ﬁnd a monochromatic ‘line’ of ℓ points in [ℓ] r. We will see the importance of this result, since for example, its proof is a generalisation of the proof of van der Waerden’s Theorem. Before we state and prove the result, we need to deﬁne exactly what the term ‘line’ means. Deﬁnition 5 Let ℓ, r ∈ N. A combinatorial line, or simply a line in [ℓ] r, is a set L ⊂ [ℓ] r such that, for some non-empty set I = {i1, . . . , it} ⊂ [ℓ] and some aj ∈ [ℓ] for each j ̸∈ I, we have L = {x ∈ [ℓ]r : xj = aj for j ̸∈ I, and xi1 = · · · = xit}. For ℓ ≥ 2, the set I is the set of active coordinates of L, and the aj, j ̸∈ I, are the inactive coordinates of L. Let L− and L+ denote the points of L where L− i = 1 and L + i = ℓ for any i ∈ I. L− and L+ are the ‘end-points’ of L: L− is the ﬁrst point and L+ is the last point of L. Note that we have |L| = ℓ. In other words, L is a ‘line’ of ℓ points in [ℓ]r where certain coordinates, not indexed by I, are some ﬁxed numbers in [ℓ] (these coordinates are ‘inactive’), while the other coordinates, indexed by I, each range together from 1 up to ℓ (the ‘active’ coordinates). There must be at least one active coordinate. Example 2 In [3]2, examples of lines are L = {(1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 3)}, I = {1}; L = {(2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3)}, I = {2}; L = {(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 3)}, I = {1, 2}. Note that {(1, 3), (2, 2), (3, 1)} is not a line (even though it appears like one when drawn!). In [5]3, examples of lines are L = {(4, 1, 1), (4, 2, 1), (4, 3, 1), (4, 4, 1), (4, 5, 1)}, I = {2}; L = {(1, 5, 1), (2, 5, 2), (3, 5, 3), (4, 5, 4), (5, 5, 5)}, I = {1, 3}; L = {(1, 1, 1), (2, 2, 2), (3, 3, 3), (4, 4, 4), (5, 5, 5)}, I = {1, 2, 3}. In each case, L− and L + are the ﬁrst and the last element in the corresponding list for L. We can now state and prove the Hales-Jewett Theorem. 6 Theorem 9 (Hales-Jewett Theorem, 1963) Let ℓ, k ∈ N. Then, there exists an integer N = N (ℓ, k) such that for all r ≥ N , whenever [ℓ] r is coloured with k colours, there exists a monochromatic combinatorial line in [ℓ]r. An interesting consequence of the Hales-Jewett Theorem is that, if the game of noughts and crosses with ‘ℓ-in-a-row’ is played by any ﬁnite number of players, then the game must end with a winner if it is played in a high enough dimension. Proof of Theorem 9. The proof is generally quite similar to that of Theorem 6. Given a colouring of [ℓ] r, we say that the lines L1, . . . , Ls have focus f ∈ [ℓ]r if L+ i = f for every i. L1, . . . , Ls are colour-focussed (at f ) if in addition, each Li \\ {L+ i } is monochromatic, and Li \\ {L+ i } and Lj \\ {L+ j } have diﬀerent colours for all i ̸= j. We use induction on ℓ. The theorem holds for ℓ = 1. Now let ℓ ≥ 2 and suppose that the theorem holds for ℓ − 1, with any number of colours. Claim. For all 1 ≤ s ≤ k, there exists r = r(ℓ, s, k) such that, whenever [ℓ]r is k-coloured, then either there exists a monochromatic line in [ℓ] r, or there exist s colour-focussed lines in [ℓ] r. We are then clearly done once we have proved the claim, because by taking s = k, we either have a monochromatic line, or k colour-focussed lines, which also gives us a monochromatic line, no matter what colour the focus of the k lines has. To prove the claim, we use induction on s. For s = 1, by the induction hypothesis on ℓ, there exists N ′ = N ′(ℓ − 1, k) such that, if [ℓ − 1] N ′ is k-coloured, then there is a monochromatic line in [ℓ − 1] N ′. The claim then clearly holds for s = 1 when [ℓ] N ′ is k-coloured, and hence we may take r = N ′. Now, let s ≥ 2, and suppose that r′ = r′(ℓ, s − 1, k) is suitable for s − 1. Also by the induction hypothesis for ℓ, there exists N ′′ = N ′′(ℓ − 1, kℓr′ ) such that, if [ℓ − 1] N ′′ is kℓr′ -coloured, then there is a monochromatic line in [ℓ − 1] N ′′. We show that r = r′ + N ′′ is suitable for s. Take a k-colouring of [ℓ]r = [ℓ] r′+N ′′. We are done if [ℓ] r contains a monochromatic line, so assume otherwise. We consider [ℓ] r as [ℓ] r = [ℓ]r′+N ′′ = [ℓ]r′ ×[ℓ]N ′′. This means that we can think of [ℓ] r as [ℓ]N ′′, with each point of [ℓ]N ′′ replaced by a copy of [ℓ]r′. Indeed, we may write each point (vector) v ∈ [ℓ] r as v = (v′, v′′), where v′ ∈ [ℓ]r′ and v′′ ∈ [ℓ] N ′′, so that v′′ indicates the position of the copy of [ℓ]r′ in [ℓ]N ′′, and v′ consists of the coordinates of v within the copy of [ℓ] r′. Now, since there are kℓr′ ways to colour a copy of [ℓ]r′, we can think of the whole structure [ℓ] r as a kℓr′ -coloured [ℓ]N ′′, with each of the kℓr′ colours corresponding to a k-coloured conﬁguration of [ℓ]r′. By the deﬁnition of N ′′, we have ℓ − 1 identically coloured copies of [ℓ]r′ in [ℓ] r which, when they are identiﬁed with their corresponding points in [ℓ]N ′′, the points become L \\ {L +}, for some line L in [ℓ] N ′′. Let I be the set of active coordinates of L. Also, by the deﬁnition of r′, either there is a monochromatic line in each of the ℓ − 1 identically coloured copies of [ℓ]r′, or there are s − 1 colour-focussed lines within each copy. If the former, then let L′ be the monochromatic line within the copy of [ℓ] r′ corresponding to L−, with active 7 coordinates I ′. But then, the line in [ℓ] r, with active coordinates I ∪ I ′, and whose ﬁrst and last points are (L′−, L −) and (L′+, L +), is monochromatic, a contradiction. Hence, the latter assertion holds. Let L1, . . . , Ls−1 be the colour-focussed lines in the copy of [ℓ] r′ corresponding to L−, say with active coordinates I1, . . . , Is−1, and focus f in the same copy of [ℓ]r′ (i.e., f = L + 1 = · · · = L+ s−1). Note that f has a diﬀerent colour from L1, . . . , Ls−1. Now for each 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1, consider the line L ′ i in [ℓ] r with ﬁrst point (L− i , L −), last point (L + i , L +) = (f, L+), and active coordinates I ∪ Ii. Then, the L ′ i are colour-focussed at (f, L+). Moreover, the line L′ s in [ℓ]r, with ﬁrst and last points (f, L −) and (f, L+), and active coordinates I, is such that L′ s \\ {L ′+ s } is monochromatic, with a diﬀerent colour from each L′ i \\ {L ′− i }, 1 ≤ i ≤ s − 1. Hence, L ′ 1, . . . , L′ s is a set of s colour-focussed lines in [ℓ]r, with focus (f, L +). The claim follows by induction on s, and Theorem 9 follows. □ Deﬁnition 6 The least integer N = N (ℓ, k) for which Theorem 9 holds is denoted by HJ(ℓ, k). These are the Hales-Jewett numbers. As we have remarked earlier, we may deduce van der Waerden’s Theorem from the Hales-Jewett Theorem. Proof of Theorem 6, using Theorem 9. Given m and k, we claim that N = m · HJ(m, k) will work. Let n ≥ N . Given a k-colouring c : [n] → {1, . . . , k}, deﬁne the k-colouring c′ : [m]n′ → {1, . . . , k} by c′((x1, . . . , xn′)) = c(x1 + · · · + xn′), where n′ = HJ(m, k). By Theorem 9, [m]n′ contains a monochromatic line L in the colouring c ′. The line L corresponds to a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length m in [n], in the colouring c, where each term is the sum of the coordinates of a point of L (the ﬁrst term being the sum of the coordinates of L−), and the common diﬀerence is the size of the set of active coordinates of L. □ Another application of the Hales-Jewett Theorem is that we can use it to prove Gallai’s Theorem, which is a very useful result itself and immediately implies van der Waerden’s Theorem. Before we state and prove Gallai’s Theorem, we need a deﬁnition. Deﬁnition 7 Let X = N or R, and S ⊂ X r for some r ∈ N. A homothetic copy of S is a set S′ ⊂ X r of the form S′ = aS + b = {av + b : v ∈ S}, for some a ∈ X with a ̸= 0, and b ∈ X r. Theorem 10 (Gallai’s Theorem, 1943) Let X = N or R, r, k ∈ N, and let S ⊂ X r be a ﬁnite set. Then, whenever X r is coloured with k colours, there exists a monochromatic, homothetic copy of S in X r. 8 Gallai’s Theorem is sometimes known as Gr¨unwald’s Theorem, or the Gallai-Witt Theorem. We see that Gallai’s Theorem is a generalisation of van der Waerden’s Theorem, by taking X = N, r = 1 and S = {1, . . . , m}, where m is the length of the monochromatic arithmetic progression that we wish to ﬁnd in van der Waerden’s Theorem. Proof of Theorem 10. Let S = {s(1), . . . , s(m)} for some m ∈ N, and n = HJ(m, k). Given a k-colouring c : X r → {1, . . . , k}, deﬁne the k-colouring c′ : [m] n → {1, . . . , k} by c′(x) = c(s(x1) + · · · + s(xn)). By Theorem 9, [m] n contains a monochromatic line L in the colouring c′. It is easy to see that the line L corresponds to a monochromatic, homothetic copy of S in X r, with respect to the k-colouring c. Indeed, if I is the set of active coordinates of L, and aj ∈ [m], j ̸∈ I are the inactive coordinates of L, then with respect to the colouring c, the set { |I|s(1) + ∑ j̸∈I s(aj), |I|s(2) + ∑ j̸∈I s(aj), . . . , |I|s(m) + ∑ j̸∈I s(aj) } is a monochromatic, homothetic copy of S in X r. □ Example 3 To demonstrate the usefulness of Gallai’s Theorem and van der Waerden’s Theorem, let us see an application to an olympiad problem which appeared very recently. The set of real numbers is split into two subsets which do not intersect. Prove that for each pair (m, n) of positive integers, there are real numbers x < y < z all in the same subset such that m(z − y) = n(y − x). (British Mathematical Olympiad 2011/12, Round 2, Question 3) We can quite easily solve this problem by using Gallai’s Theorem, or indeed, by using van der Waerden’s Theorem. However, it would be a bit more diﬃcult without the knowledge of either theorem. To solve the problem, observe that it suﬃces to prove the version with the word ‘real’ replaced by ‘natural’. Then, we may obviously think of the problem as taking a 2-colouring of N. By Gallai’s Theorem with X = N, r = 1, k = 2, and S = {1, m + 1, m + n + 1}, there is a colour class containing a homothetic copy of S; that is, a set of the form {a + b, a(m + 1) + b, a(m + n + 1) + b} for some integers a and b with a ≥ 1. We are done with x = a + b, y = a(m + 1) + b and z = a(m + n + 1) + b, since then we have m(z − y) = amn and n(y − x) = amn. Alternatively, using van der Waerden’s Theorem, there is a colour class containing an arithmetic progression of length m + n + 1, say with ﬁrst term a ∈ N and common diﬀerence d ∈ N. Then the terms a, a + md and a + (m + n)d all belong to this arithmetic progression. Hence, taking x = a, y = a+md and z = a+(m+n)d gives m(z − y) = dmn and n(y − x) = dmn. 9 3. Density Theorems In this short section, we shall present some rather advanced results, which were proved more recently than all the results that we have seen so far. We shall only state these results, since the proofs involved are highly advanced and are beyond our scope here. These results may also be less useful for mathematical olympiads, since one would not expect the necessity to apply such high-powered results to solve an olympiad style problem. Nevertheless, the statements of the results are relatively simple, and hence it is certainly not harmful to learn these beautiful results and also see some exciting mathematical history. We begin by observing that if the positive integers N are coloured with k colours, then roughly speaking, some colour class must contain at least a proportion of 1 k of the positive integers. In other words, the ‘density’ of one of the colour classes in N is at least 1 k . To proceed, we must deﬁne more precisely what the word ‘density’ means. Deﬁnition 8 Let A ⊂ N. The upper density of A in N is deﬁned by d(A) = lim sup N →∞ |A ∩ {1, 2, . . . , N }| N . [For a sequence of real numbers (xn) ∞ n=1, its limit superior is deﬁned by lim sup n→∞ xn = lim n→∞ ( sup m≥n xm). Roughly speaking, if the sequence (xn) ∞ n=1 does not converge, then it will have several ‘limiting values’ as n → ∞. The limit superior is the supremum of these limiting values.] In this direction, the great mathematicians Erd˝os and Tur´an conjectured in 1936 a much stronger assertion than van der Waerden’s Theorem, which says that: Every subset of N with positive upper density contains an arithmetic progression of any given length. This of course implies van der Waerden’s Theorem, since whenever the positive integers are coloured with k colours, then some colour class has upper density at least 1 k > 0, and hence contains an arithmetic progression of any given length. The ﬁrst major result related to the conjecture appeared in 1953, when Roth proved the case for 3-term arithmetic progressions. Later, in 1969, Szemer´edi proved the case for 4-term arithmetic progressions. Finally, in 1975, Szemer´edi settled the conjecture, using some intriguing combinatorial arguments. This beautiful result is now named after him. Theorem 11 (Szemer´edi’s Theorem, 1975) Let m ∈ N. Then any set A ⊂ N with positive upper density contains an arithmetic progression of length m. 10 However, the research into the Erd˝os and Tur´an’s problem did not end there. Only two years after Szemer´edi’s result was announced, F¨urstenberg, in 1977, used methods in ergodic theory (a rather advanced branch of mathematics) to give another elegant proof of the result. Not only did F¨urstenberg’s result revitalised ergodic theory, but also, the methods involved led to many subsequent generalisations of Szemer´edi’s Theorem. For example, about a year later in 1978, F¨urstenberg and Katznelson proved a multi-dimensional version of Szemer´edi’s Theorem. In 1996, Bergelson and Leibman proved a ‘polynomial version’ which is also a multi-dimensional result. The 1-dimensional case is as follows. Theorem 12 (Bergelson and Leibman, 1996) Let m ∈ N, and A ⊂ N be a set with positive upper density. Let p1(x), . . . , pm(x) be polynomials with rational coeﬃcients such that for 1 ≤ j ≤ m, we have pj(0) = 0 and pj(z) ∈ Z for every integer z. Then for every v1, . . . , vm ∈ N, there exists integers n ̸= 0 and u such that u + pj(n)vj ∈ A for each j. For example, setting pj(x) = jx2 and v1 = · · · = vm = 1 implies that, every subset of N with positive upper density contains an arithmetic progression of any given ﬁnite length, whose common diﬀerence is a perfect square. Another proof of Szemer´edi’s Theorem was given by Gowers in 2001, using ideas from Fourier analysis and combinatorics. Finally, another famous and related conjecture of Erd˝os, also proposed in 1936, is the following. Conjecture 13 (Erd˝os, 1936) Let A ⊂ N be a set of positive integers such that ∑ a∈A 1 a = ∞. Then for any m ∈ N, A contains an arithmetic progression of length m. Conjecture 13 is still open, even for the case m = 3. If the conjecture holds, then using the well-known fact that the sum of the reciprocals of the prime numbers is divergent, we obtain the result that the sequence of prime numbers contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. This latter assertion itself was also a long- standing conjecture, and was settled by Green and Tao in 2004. Theorem 14 (Green-Tao Theorem, 2004) Let m ∈ N. Then the set of prime numbers contains an arithmetic progression of length m. Note that Szemer´edi’s Theorem does not imply the Green-Tao Theorem, since by the Prime Number Theorem, the number of prime numbers not exceeding n is asymptotically equal to n ln n, which implies that the set of prime numbers has upper density of zero in N. As of 2010, the longest arithmetic progression of primes where the terms are actually known has 26 terms. 11 4. Problems We divide the problems into two parts. The ﬁrst set consists of some exercises, which include the completion the missing proofs in the notes. The second set consists of the olympiad style problems. 4.1 Exercises 1. Prove Theorem 4 as follows. • Firstly, consider the case k = 2. Prove this case by using induction on t as follows. The claim holds for t = 1 (trivial), so assume that t ≥ 2 and the claim holds for t − 1. We want to ﬁnd N = N (t, m1, m2) which works for the claim. To prove this we use induction on m1 + m2. Explain why we can ﬁnd a suitable N when m1 = t, and for m2 = t. Now, let m1, m2 ≥ t + 1, and assume that we can ﬁnd suitable N1 = N1(t, m1 − 1, m2) and N2 = N2(t, m1, m2 − 1). By the induction hypothesis on t, we can ﬁnd N3 = N3(t − 1, N1(t, m1 − 1, m2), N2(t, m1, m2 − 1)) for which Theorem 4 is true. Show that we can then take N = N (t, m1, m2) = N3 + 1, hence completing the proof. • Then, mimic the argument in the proof of Theorem 2 to deduce the result for any k ≥ 1. 2. Prove Theorem 5 by using induction on t. [Hint: If t ≥ 2 and the theorem holds for t − 1, then given a k-colouring of N (t), take a1 ∈ N and deﬁne the k-colouring c′ on (N \\ {a1}) (t−1) by c′(F ) = c(F ∪ {a1}). Then, mimic the idea of the proof of Theorem 3.] 3. Prove that W (3, 2) = 9. 4. Show that van der Waerden’s Theorem does not hold for inﬁnite arithmetic progressions when N is k-coloured, where k ≥ 2. That is, for any k ≥ 2, give an example of a k-colouring of N such that, there do not exist a, d ∈ N where a, a + d, a + 2d, a + 3d, . . . is monochromatic. 5. Prove the version of van der Waerden’s Theorem for geometric progressions. That is, prove that: Given m, k ∈ N, there exists an integer N = N (m, k) such that for all n ≥ N , whenever [n] is coloured with k colours, there exists a geometric progression of length m. [A geometric progression of length m is a sequence of the form a, ar, ar2, . . . , arm−1 for some a, r ∈ R. Here, we assume that a, r ̸= 0.] 6. Prove Theorem 7 by using induction on k. [Hint: For k ≥ 2, show that, if N works for the theorem for k − 1, then W (N m + 1, k) works for k.] 12 7. How many combinatorial lines are there in [ℓ] r? 8. Prove that HJ(2, k) = k for all k ∈ N. 4.2. Olympiad Style Problems Here are some olympiad style problems. Some of these problems can be solved with the help of a theorem in the notes, while others can be classed within the combinatorial number theory area. 1.
