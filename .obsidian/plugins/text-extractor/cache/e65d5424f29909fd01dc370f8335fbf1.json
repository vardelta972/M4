Then there exists an integer N such that if the edges of a complete graph on N vertices are colored in k colors, there exists a complete subgraph of n vertices all of whose edges are colored in the same color. { Tur\u0013an's theorem: Let G be a graph on n vertices which contains no complete subgraph of k vertices. Then G has at most as many edges as G0, where G0 is the complete (k \u0000 1)-partite graph whose part sizes sum to n with no two di\u000bering by more than one. In particular G has at most k \u0000 2 3. (Russia '04) Each lattice point in the plane is colored in one of three colors, with each color used at least once. Show that there exists a right triangle whose vertices all have di\u000berent colors. 4. Determine all values of r for which the points inside a circle of radius r can be colored in two colors such that every pair of points at distance 1 have di\u000berent colors. 5. (MOP '97) The points on the sides of a right isosceles triangle with hypotenuse p 10. (APMO '99) Let S be a set of 2n + 1 points in the plane such that no three are collinear and no four concyclic. A circle will be called good if it has 3 points of S on its circumference, n \u0000 1 points of S in its interior and n \u0000 1 points of S in its exterior. Prove that the number of good circles has the same parity as n. 11. (IMO '00 SL) Let n \u0015 4 be a \fxed positive integer. Let S = fP1; P2; : : : ; Png be a set of n points in the plane such that no three are collinear and no four concyclic. Let at, 1 \u0014 t \u0014 n, denote the number of unordered triples fi; j; kg such that the circumcircle of PiPjPk contains Pt, and let m(S) = a1 + a2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + an: Prove that there exists a positive integer f (n), depending only on n, such that the points of S are the vertices of a convex polygon if and only if m(S) = f (n). 12. (IMO '91 SL) Let S be a set of n \u0015 3 points in the plane with no three collinear. Show that there exists a set T of at most 2n \u0000 5 points such that every triangle determined by three points of S contains a point in T . 13. (IMO '02) Let n be an integer with n \u0015 3. Let \u00001, \u00002, . . . , \u0000n be unit circles in the plane, with centers O1, O2, . . . , On respectively. If no line meets more than two of the circles, prove that X 1\u0014i<j\u0014n 1 8. (IMO '03 SL) Let D1, D2, . . . , Dn be closed discs in the plane. Suppose that every point in the plane is contained in at most 2003 of these discs. Prove that there exists a disc which intersects at most 14020 other discs. 5 Constraints 1. (a) Let S be a set of n \u0015 3 points in the plane such that the distance between any two points is at least 1. Show that there are at most 3n \u0000 6 pairs of points at distance exactly one. (b) Let S be a set of n points in the plane of diameter 1 (the distance between any two points of S is at most 1). Find the maximum possible number of pairs of points of S at distance 1.
