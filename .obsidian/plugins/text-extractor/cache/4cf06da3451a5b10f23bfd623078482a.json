We will look at some typical examples. The solutions of these problems provide us the basic ideas to attack similar problems. The following are some interesting examples. Example 1. (2001 USA Math Olympiad) Each point in the plane is assigned a real number such that, for any triangle, the number at the center of its inscribed circle is equal to the arithmetic mean of the three numbers at its vertices. Prove that all points in the plane are assigned the same number. Solution. Let A, B be arbitrary distinct points and consider a regular hexagon ABCDEF in the plane. Let lines CD and EF intersect at G. Let L be the line through G perpendicular to line DE. L A B C DE F G Observe that ∆CEG and ∆DFG are symmetric with respect to L and hence they have the same incenter. So c+e+g = d+f+g. Also, ∆ACE and ∆BDF are symmetric with respect to L and have the same incenter. So a+c+e=b+d+f. Subtracting these two equations, we see a=b. Comments: This outstanding elegant solution was due to Michael Hamburg, who was given a handsome cash prize as a Clay Math Institute award by the USAMO Committee. Example 2. (1987 IMO Shortlisted Problem) In space, is there an infinite set M of points such that the intersection of M with every plane is nonempty and finite? Solution. Yes, there is such a set M. For example, let M = {(t 5, t 3, t) : t ∊ }. Then, for every plane with equation Ax + By + Cz + D = 0, the intersection points are found by solving At 5 + Bt 3 + Ct + D = 0, which has at least one solution (since A or B or C is nonzero) and at most five solutions (since the degree is at most five). Example 3. (1963 Beijing Mathematics Competition) There are 2n + 3 (n ≥ 1) given points on a plane such that no three of them are collinear and no four of them are concyclic. Is it always possible to draw a circle through three of them so that half of the other 2n points are inside and half are outside the circle? Solution. Yes, it is always possible. Take the convex hull of these points, i.e. the smallest convex set containing them. The boundary is a polygon with vertices from the given points. Let AB be a side of the polygon. Since no three are collinear, no other given points are on AB. By convexity, the other points C1, C2, ⋯, C2n+1 are on the same side of line AB. Since no four are collinear, angles ACiB are all distinct, say ∠AC1B < ∠AC2B < ⋯ <∠AC2n+1B. Then C1, C2, ⋯, Cn are inside the circle through A, B and Cn+1 and Cn+2, Cn+3, ⋯, C2n+1 are outside. Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 13, No. 1, Feb.-Apr. 08 Page 2 Example 4. (1941 Moscow Math. Olympiad) On a plane are given n points such that every three of them is inside some circle of radius 1. Prove that all these points are inside some circle of radius 1. Solution. For every three of the n given points, consider the triangle they formed. If the triangle is an acute triangle, then draw their circumcircle, otherwise take the longest side and draw the circle having that side as the diameter. By the given condition, all these circles have radius less than 1. Let S be one of these circles with minimum radius, say S arose from considering points A, B, C. Assume one of the given points D is not inside S. If ∆ABC is acute, then D is on the same side as one of A,B,C with respect to the line through the other two points, say D and A are on the same side of line BC. Then the circle drawn for B,C,D would be their circumcircle and would have a radius greater than the radius of S, a contradiction. If ∆ABC is not acute and S is the circle with diameter AB, then the circle drawn for A, B, D would have AB as a chord and not as a diameter, which implies that circle has a radius greater than the radius of S, a contradiction. Therefore, all n points are inside or on S. Since the radius of S was less than 1, we can take the circle of radius 1 at the same center as S to contain all n points. In the next example, we will consider a problem in space and the solution will involve a basic fact from solid geometry. Namely, A B C D about vertex A of a tetrahedron ABCD, we have ∠BAC ≤ ∠BAD +∠DAC ≤ 360°. Nowadays, very little solid geometry is taught in school. So let’s recall Euclid’s proofs in Book XI, Problems 20 and 21 of his Elements. A B C D E Z X W Y For the left inequality, we may assume that ∠BAC is the largest of the three angles about vertex A. Let E be on side BC so that ∠BAD=∠BAE. Let X, Y, Z be on rays AB, AC, AD respectively, and AX=AY =AZ. Then ∆AXZ≅∆AXY and we have XZ=XY. Let line XY intersect line AC at W. Since XZ + ZW > XW, cancelling XZ = XY from both sides, we have ZW > YW. Comparing triangles WAZ and WAY, we have WA=WA, AZ=AY, so ZW > YW implies ∠ZAW >∠YAW. Then ∠BAC =∠XAY+∠YAW < ∠XAZ+∠ZAW = ∠BAD+∠DAC. For the right inequality, by the left inequality, we have ∠DBC ≤ ∠DBA +∠ABC, ∠BCD ≤ ∠BCA +∠ACD, ∠CDB ≤ ∠CDA +∠ADB. Adding them, we get 180° is less than or equal to the sum of the six angles on the right. Now the sum of these six angles and the three angles about A is 3×180°. So the sum of the three angles about A is less than or equal to 360°. Example 5. (1969 All Soviet Math. Olympiad) There are n given points in space with no three collinear. For every three of them, they form a triangle having an angle greater than 120°. Prove that there is a way to order the points as A1, A2, …, An such that whenever 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ n, we have ∠AiAjAk > 120°. Solution. Take two furthest points among these n points and call them A1 and An. For every two points X, Y among the other n−2 points, since A1An is the longest side in both ∆A1XAn and ∆A1YAn, we have ∠XA1An < 60° and ∠YA1An < 60°. About vertex A1 of the tetrahedron A1AnXY, we have ∠XA1Y ≤∠XA1An+∠YA1An < 60°+60°= 120°. Similarly, ∠XAnY < 120°. Also, A1X≠A1Y (since otherwise, the two equal angles in ∆XA1Y cannot be greater than 90° and so only ∠XA1Y can be greater than 120°, which will contradict the inequality above). Now order the points by its distance to A1 so that A1A2<A1A3<⋯<A1An. For 1< j < k ≤ n, taking X=Aj and Y=Ak in the inequality above, we get ∠AjA1Ak < 120°. Since A1Ak > A1Aj, so in ⊿A1AjAk, ∠A1AjAk >120°. For 1 < i < j < k ≤ n, we have ∠A1AiAj >120° and ∠A1AiAk >120° by the last paragraph. Then, about vertex Ai of the tetrahedron AiAjAkA1, we have ∠AjAiAk < 120°. Next since A1Ak > A1Aj > A1Ai, about vertex Ak of the tetrahedron AkAjAiA1, we have ∠AiAkAj ≤∠AiAkA1+∠AjAkA1 < 60°+60°= 120°. Hence, in ∆AiAjAk, we have ∠AiAjAk > 120°. Example 6. (1994 All Russian Math. Olympiad) There are k points, 2 ≤ k ≤ 50, inside a convex 100-sided polygon. Prove that we can choose at most 2k vertices from this 100-sided polygon so that the k points are inside the polygon with the chosen points as vertices. Solution. Let M = A1A2⋯An be the boundary of the convex hull of the k points. Hence, n ≤ k. Let O be a point inside M. From i=1 to n, let ray OAi intersect the 100-sided polygon at Bi. Let M’ be the boundary of the convex hull of B1, B2, ⋯, Bn. For every point P on or inside M, the line OP intersects M at two sides, say AiAi+1 and AjAj+1. By the definition of the points Bi’s, we see the line OP intersects BiBi+1 and BjBj+1, say at points S and T respectively. Since Bi, Bi+1, Bj and Bj+1 are in M’, so S, T are in M’. Then O and P are in M’. Thus M’ contains M. Let M’ = C1C2⋯Cm. Then m ≤ n ≤ k. Observe that all Ci’s are on the 100- sided polygon. Now each Ci is a vertex or between two consecutive vertices of the 100-sided polygon. Let G be the set of all these vertices. Then G has at most 2k points and the polygon with vertices from G contains the k points.

Let n > 1 be an integer. From a n×n square, one 1×1 corner square is removed. Determine (with proof) the least positive integer k such that the remaining areas can be partitioned into k triangles with equal areas. (Source 1992 Shanghai Math Contest) Problem 297.

Prove that if a convex polygon lies in the interior of another convex polygon, then the perimeter of the inner polygon is less than the perimeter of the outer polygon. Solution. Jeff CHEN (Virginia, USA), HO Kin Fai (HKUST, Math Year 3) and Fai YUNG. Ai+1 Ai Bi Bi+1 We will define a sequence of convex polygons P0, P1, …, Pn−1. Let the outer convex polygon be P0 and the inner convex polygon be A1A2…An. For i = 1 to n−1, let the line AiAi+1 intersect Pi−1 at Bi, Bi+1. The line AiAi+1 divides Pi−1 into two parts with one part enclosing A1A2…An. Let Pi be the polygon formed by putting the segment BiBi+1 together with the part of Pi−1 enclosing A1A2…An. Note Pn−1 is A1A2…An. Finally, the perimeter of Pi is less than the perimeter of Pi−1 because the length of BiBi+1, being the shortest distance between Bi and Bi+1, is less than the length of the part of Pi−1 removed to form Pi.

SIMON (Santiago, Chile). There is a nonnegative integer a such that a2 < Sn ≤ (a+1) 2. We have Sn = kn + kn−1 + ⋯ + k1 < kn + (kn −2) +⋯+ (kn −2n+2) = n(kn−n+1).

Problem 293. Let CH be the altitude of triangle ABC with ∠ACB = 90°. The bisector of ∠BAC intersects CH, CB at P, M respectively. The bisector of ∠ABC intersects CH, CA at Q, N respectively. Prove that the line passing through the midpoints of PM and QN is parallel to line AB. (Source: 52nd Belorussian Math. Olympiad) Solution. Jeff CHEN (Virginia, USA) and CHEUNG Wang Chi (Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, England) and Salem MALIKIĆ (Sarajevo College, 4th Grade, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina). A B C H M N Q P E F X Y Let E, F be the midpoints of QN, PM respectively. Let X, Y be the intersection of CE, CF with AB respectively. Now ∠CMP = 90° −∠CAM = 90° − ∠BAM = ∠APH =∠CPM. So CM=CP. Then CF⊥AF. Since AF bisects ∠CAY, by ASA, ∆CAF ≅ ∆YAF. So CF=FY. Similarly, CE=EX. By the midpoint theorem, we have EF parallel to line XY, which is the same as line AB.

For three nonnegative real numbers x, y, z satisfying the condition xy+yz+zx = 3, prove that .63 222 ≥+++ xyzzyx Solution. Jeff CHEN (Virginia, USA), CHEUNG Wang Chi (Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, England), Ovidiu FURDUI (Cimpia - Turzii, Cluj, Romania), MA Ka Hei (Wah Yan College, Kowloon) and Salem MALIKIĆ (Sarajevo College, 4th Grade, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina). Let p = x+y+z, q = xy+yz+zx and r = xyz. Now Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 13, No. 1, Feb.-Apr. 08 Page 4 p2 − 9 = x 2 + y 2 + z2 − xy − yz − zx ,0 2 )()()( 222 ≥ −+−+− = xzzyyx So p ≥ 3. By Schur’s inequality (see Math Excalibur, vol. 10, no. 5, p. 2, column 2), 12p= 4pq ≤ p3+9r. Since p2 = x 2+y 2+z2+2(xy+yz+zx) = x 2+y 2+z2+6, we get 3xyz = 3r ≥ 9r/p ≥ 12 − p2 = 6 − (x 2 + y 2 + z2). Problem 295. There are 2n distinct points in space, where n ≥ 2. No four of them are on the same plane. If n2 + 1 pairs of them are connected by line segments, then prove that there are at least n distinct triangles formed. (Source: 1989 Chinese IMO team training problem) Solution. Jeff CHEN (Virginia, USA) and CHEUNG Wang Chi (Magdalene College, University of Cambridge, England). We prove by induction on n. For n=2, say the points are A,B,C,D. For five segments connecting them, only one pair of them is not connected, say they are A and B. Then triangles ACD and BCD are formed. Suppose the case n=k is true. Consider the case n=k+1. We first claim there is at least one triangle. Suppose AB is one such connected segment. Let α, β be the number of segments connecting A, B to the other 2n−2=2k points respectively. If α+β > 2k+1, then A, B are both connected to one of the other 2k points, hence a triangle is formed. If α+β ≤ 2k, then the other 2k points have at least (k+1)2 + 1 − (2k+1) = k 2 + 1 segments connecting them. By the case n=k, there is a triangle in these 2k points. So the claim is established. Now take one such triangle, say ABC. Let α, β, γ be the number of segments connecting A, B, C to the other 2k−1 points respectively. If α+β+γ ≥ 3k−1, then let D1, D2, …, Dm (m ≤ 2k−1) be all the points among the other 2k−1 points connecting to at least one of A or B or C. The number of segments to Di from A or B or C is ni = 1 or 2 or 3. Checking each of these three cases, we see there are at least ni−1 triangles having Di as a vertex and the two other vertices from A, B, C. So there are ∑ = ≥−−≥− m i i kmkn 1 13)1( triangles, each having one Di vertex, plus triangle ABC, resulting in at least k+1 triangles. If α+β+γ ≤ 3k−2, then the sum of α+β, γ+α, β+γ is at most 6k−4. Hence the least of them cannot be 2k−1 or more, say α+β ≤ 2k−2. Then removing A and B and all segments connected to at least one of them, we have at least (k+1)2+1−(2k+1)=k 2+1 segments left for the remaining 2k points. By the case n=k, we have k triangles. These plus triangle ABC result in at least k+1 triangles. The induction is complete. Commended solvers: Raúl A. SIMON (Santiago, Chile) and Simon YAU Chi-Keung (City University of Hong Kong). Olympiad Corner (continued from page 1) Problem 4. Consider the function f:ℕ0→ℕ0, where ℕ0 is the set of all non-negative integers, defined by the following conditions: (i) f(0) = 0, (ii) f(2n) = 2f(n) and (iii) f(2n+1) = n+2f(n) for all n ≥ 0. (a) Determine the three sets L:={ n | f(n) < f(n+1)}, E:={ n | f(n) = f(n+1)}, and G:={n | f(n) > f(n+1)}. (b) For each k ≥ 0, find a formula for ak:= max{ f(n) | 0 ≤ n ≤ 2k} in terms of k. Problem 5. Let a, b, c be integers satisfying 0 < a < c−1 and 1 < b < c. For each k, 0 ≤ k ≤ a, let rk, 0 ≤ rk < c, be the remainder of kb when dived by c. Prove that the two sets {r0, r1, r2, …, ra} and {0, 1, 2, …, a} are different. Point Set Combinatorics (continued from page 2) Example 7. (1987 Chinese IMO Team Selection Test) There are 2n distinct points in space, where n ≥ 2. No four of them are on the same plane. If n2 + 1 pairs of them are connected by line segments, then prove that there are two triangles sharing a common side. Solution. We prove by induction on n. For n=2, say the points are A,B,C,D. For five segments connecting them, only one pair of them is not connected, say they are A and B. Then triangles ACD and BCD are formed and the side CD is common to them. Suppose the case n=k is true. Consider the case n=k+1. Suppose AB is one such connected segment. Let α, β be the number of segments connecting A, B to the other 2n − 2 = 2k points respectively. Case 1. If α+β ≥ 2k+2, then there are points C, D among the other 2k points such that AC, BC, AD, BD are connected. Then triangles ABC and ABD are formed and the side AB is common to them. Case 2. If α+β ≤ 2k, then removing A, B and all segments connecting to at least one of them, there would still be at least (k+1) 2 +1 − (2k+1) = k 2+1 segments left for the remaining 2k points. By the case n = k, there would exist two triangles sharing a common side among them. Case 3. Assume cases 1 and 2 do not occur for all the connected segments. Then take any connected segment AB and we have α+β = 2k+1. There would then be a point C among the other 2k points such that triangle ABC is formed. Let γ be the number of segments connecting C to the other 2k−1 points respectively. Since cases 1 and 2 do not occur, we have β + γ = 2k+1 and γ +α = 2k+1, too. However, this would lead to (α + β) + (β + γ) + (γ +α) = 6k + 3, which is contradictory as the left side is even and the right side is odd. One cannot help to notice the similarity between the last example and problem 295 in the problem corner. Naturally this raise the question: when n is large, again if n2 + 1 pairs of the points are connected by line segments, would we be able to get more pairs of triangles sharing common sides? Any information or contribution for this question from the readers will be appreciated.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
