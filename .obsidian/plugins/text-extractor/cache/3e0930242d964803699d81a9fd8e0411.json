Email me at vy- wang (at) mit.edu for errors/comments/suggestions or to discuss anything, e.g. where to look for more of these kinds of problems or topics.) Recommendation: Work on the topic/problems you think would help you the most.1Of course, if you don’t feel like doing geometry that’s ﬁne; there’s an algebra class tomorrow anyways. Also, while it’s important to be able to ﬁnd certain ideas on your own, I encourage you to occasionally work in small groups, both in and out of class; I think you can gain a surprising amount of intuition just by talking to others. This might be easier to coordinate out of class, especially for the harder problems. 1 Algebra/polynomials, mostly with number theory 1. (Finite ﬁelds, concrete/elementary perspective 2) Let f be a monic irreducible degree d ≥ 1 polynomial modulo p (i.e. in Fp[x]), for some prime p. (a) Show that f (x) | g(x) pd − g(x) in Fp[x] for any g ∈ Fp[x]. (b) Show that x pr − x | g(x) pr − g(x) for any g ∈ Fp[x] and positive integer r. (c) For positive integers r, show that f (x) | xpr − x modulo p if and only if d | r. (d) f (x) | g(x) p − g(x) in Fp[x] for some g ∈ Fp[x] if and only if g(x) (mod f (x)) is a constant. (e) Show that f (t) − ∏d−1 k=0(t − xpk ) ∈ (Fp[x])[t] (i.e. a polynomial in t with coeﬃcients in Fp[x]) is the zero polynomial (in t) modulo f (x), in the sense that its coeﬃcients in t are all divisible by f (x) modulo p (in Fp[x]). (f) What do these mean, abstractly? (Don’t worry if you haven’t seen this before; you can probably ﬁnd this interpretation in any standard abstract algebra book.) (g) (ELMO Shortlist 2013, W.) We deﬁne the Fibonacci sequence {Fn}n≥0 by F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and for n ≥ 2, Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2; we deﬁne the Stirling number of the second kind S(n, k) as the number of ways to partition a set of n ≥ 1 distinguishable elements into k ≥ 1 indistinguishable nonempty subsets. For every positive integer n, let tn = ∑n k=1 S(n, k)Fk. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime. Prove that tn+p2p−1 ≡ tn (mod p) for all n ≥ 1. (h) (Putnam 2011) Let p be an odd prime. Show that ∑p−1 k=0 k!xk ∈ Fp[x] has at most (p − 1)/2 roots (modulo p). 1I remember last year I felt like I wasn’t getting anything out of around half of the classes. It’s a pity if you’re not learning at least one really new/interesting thing every day. 2This is only one of many approaches to ﬁnite ﬁelds. Another common route is to consider the splitting ﬁeld of xp r − x (basically [up to isomorphism] the smallest ﬁeld where it fully factors, and we can use our intuition from complex polynomials and FTA), which behaves nicely by the Frobenius endomorphism: (x + y)pr = xp r + yp r . (In the approach above Frobenius doesn’t have as central a role.) 1 Victor Wang MOP experiment (condensed version of analysis and algebra/polynomials/NT) (i) (Polya, PFTB) Suppose that (an)n≥1 is a linear recurrence sequence of integers such that n divides an for all positive integers n. Prove that (an/n) is also a linear recurrence sequence. 2. (Putnam 1956 B7?) The nonconstant polynomials P (z) and Q(z) with complex coeﬃcients have the same set of numbers for their zeros but possibly diﬀerent multiplicities. The same is true of the polynomials P (z) + 1 and Q(z) + 1. Prove that P (z) = Q(z). 3. (I wish I knew more about valuations) (a) (Classical?) Let n be a positive integer and a a complex number. If nak is an algebraic integer for all integers k ≥ 0, show that a is an algebraic integer itself. (b) (MIT Problem-Solving Seminar) Let f (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · ∈ Z[[x]] be a formal power series with a0 ̸= 0. Suppose that f ′(x)f (x) −1 ∈ Z[[x]]. Prove or disprove that a0 | an for all n ≥ 0. (c) What’s the relation between (a) and (b)? 4. (More practical “valuations”, but take this with a grain of salt since I don’t fully know what I’m talking about) (a) Let ζ = e2πi/p for some prime p. From (1 − ζ)(1 − ζ 2) · · · (1 − ζ p−1) = p, what can you say about (1−ζ) p−1 p as an algebraic number? (Something similar works for prime powers, but not for other numbers.) (b) (2012-2013 Winter OMO, W.) ω is a primitive 2013th root of unity. Find the number of ordered pairs of integers (a, b) with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2013 such that (1+ω+···+ωa)(1+ω+···+ωb) 3 is an algebraic integer. (c) (St. Petersburg 2003, PFTB). Let p be a prime and let n ≥ p and a1, a2, . . . , an be integers. Deﬁne f0 = 1 and fk the number of subsets B ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} having k elements and such that p divides ∑ i∈B ai. Show that f0 − f1 + f2 − · · · + (−1)nfn is a multiple of p. (d) (China 2011) Show that for all positive integers r, v2 (∑n k=−n ( 2n n+k)k2r) ≥ v2((2n)!). (e) (W., adapted from Gabriel Dospinescu, PFTB, 2010 MR U160) Let p be a prime and let n, s be positive integers. Prove that vp (∑ p|k,0≤k≤n(−1)kks(n k)) ≥ vp(n!). (f) (Gabriel Dospinescu, PFTB) Let p > 2 be a prime number and let m and n be multiples of p, with n odd. For any function f : {1, 2, . . . , m} → {1, 2, . . . , n} satisfying ∑m k=1 f (k) ≡ 0 (mod p), consider the product ∏m k=1 f (k). Prove that the sum of these products is divisible by ( n p )m. (Yes, we can strengthen it easily.) 5. (I wish I knew more commutative algebra/algebraic geometry) (a) Prove that C[x, y] has unique factorization into irreducible (two-variable complex) polynomials (up to constant). (It suﬃces to show every irreducible polynomial is prime, i.e. if some nonconstant p is irreducible and p | ab, then p | a or p | b.) (b) (Ineﬀective B´ezout’s theorem) Prove that two relatively prime polynomials f, g ∈ C[x, y] share ﬁnitely many common zeros in the complex plane. (c) i. (Artin’s Algebra) Let x(t), y(t) be complex polynomials, not both constant. Show that there exists a polynomial m ∈ C[x, y] such that for f ∈ C[x, y], we have m | f if and only if f (x(t), y(t)) = 0 for all t ∈ C. ii. The following can be done in more than one order: (i) Prove that m is irreducible in C[x, y]. (ii) Prove that m is unique up to a constant factor. (iii) For a point (a, b) ∈ C2, prove that m(a, b) = 0 if and only if there exists t ∈ C such that (x(t), y(t)) = (a, b). 2 Victor Wang MOP experiment (condensed version of analysis and algebra/polynomials/NT) 6. (a) (Putnam 2013 B6) Let p be an odd prime number such that p ≡ 2 (mod 3). Deﬁne a permutation π of the residue classes modulo p by π(x) ≡ x3 (mod p). Show that π is an even permutation if and only if p ≡ 3 (mod 4). (b) (2013-2013 Winter OMO, W.) Find the remainder when ∏100 i=0(1 − i 2 + i 4) is divided by 101. (c) (Noga Alon, Jean Bourgain; TST 2014) For a prime p, a subset S of residues modulo p is called a sum-free multiplicative subgroup of Fp if (i) there is a nonzero residue α modulo p such that S = { 1, α1, α2, . . . } (all considered mod p), and (ii) there are no a, b, c ∈ S (not necessarily distinct) such that a + b ≡ c (mod p). Prove that for every integer N , there is a prime p and a sum-free multiplicative subgroup S of Fp such that |S| ≥ N . (d) The TST problem, but with (ii) replaced by (ii’) 0 /∈ a1S + a2S + · · · + akS, for ﬁxed integers ai with nonzero sum. (In (ii) these integers are +1, +1, −1.) (e) (PFTB, AMM 10748) Let p, q be prime numbers and let r be a positive integer such that q | p − 1, q ∤ r, and p > rq−1. Let a1, . . . , ar be integers such that a (p−1)/q 1 + · · · + a (p−1)/q r is a multiple of p. Prove that at least one of the ai’s is a multiple of p. 7. (a) (ELMO 2012, Bobby Shen) A diabolical combination lock has n dials (each with c possible states), where n, c > 1. The dials are initially set to states d1, d2, . . . , dn, where 0 ≤ di ≤ c − 1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Unfortunately, the actual states of the dials (the di’s) are concealed, and the initial settings of the dials are also unknown. On a given turn, one may advance each dial by an integer amount ci (0 ≤ ci ≤ c − 1), so that every dial is now in a state d ′ i ≡ di + ci (mod c) with 0 ≤ d′ i ≤ c − 1. After each turn, the lock opens if and only if all of the dials are set to the zero state; otherwise, the lock selects a random integer k and cyclically shifts the di’s by k (so that for every i, di is replaced by di−k, where indices are taken modulo n). Show that the lock can always be opened, regardless of the choices of the initial conﬁguration and the choices of k (which may vary from turn to turn), if and only if n and c are powers of the same prime. (b) (Q[x] representations of n-sequences (mod m), W.) Let n, m > 1 be positive integers. We say a sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ) n is satisﬁed by the integer-valued polynomial f ∈ Q[x] if f (x) ≡ ai (mod m) whenever x ≡ i (mod n). (i) Show that n and m are powers of the same prime if and only if every sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ)n is satisﬁed by some polynomial f (x). (ii) If n = p i and m = p j for a prime p and two positive integers i, j, ﬁnd (in terms of p, i, j) the smallest positive integer M such that every sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ)n is satisﬁed by a polynomial f (x) of degree at most M . 2 Analytic-ﬂavored stuﬀ 1. Let’s pretend this is analytic number theory. (a) (2013-2014 Spring OMO, W.) Warm-up. Classify pairs (m, n) of integers such that x 3 + y3 = m + 3nxy has inﬁnitely many integer solutions (x, y). (b) (Sierpinski, PFTB) Prove that for all N there exists a k such that more than N prime numbers can be written in the form f (T ) + k for some integer T , where f ∈ Z[x] is a nonconstant monic polynomial. (c) (China 2012) Given an integer n ≥ 4. S = {1, 2, . . . , n}. A, B are two subsets of S such that ab + 1 is a perfect square for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B. Prove that min{|A|, |B|} ≤ log2 n. (d) (Russia 2002) Show that the numerator of the reduced fraction form of Hn = 1/1 + 1/2 + · · · + 1/n is inﬁnitely often not a prime power. 3 Victor Wang MOP experiment (condensed version of analysis and algebra/polynomials/NT) 2. (MOP 2007?) {an} ∞ n=1 is a sequence satisfying 0 < an ≤ an+1 + an2 for all natural numbers n. Is∑∞ n=1 an necessarily divergent? 3. Suppose f (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ C[x] has roots z1, . . . , zn ∈ C (not necessarily distinct). (a) (Mahler measure bound) Prove that ∏n k=1 max(1, |zk|) ≤ √ 1 + |an−1|2 + · · · + |a0|2. (b) (China TST 2003) Suppose f (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ C[x] has roots z1, . . . , zn ∈ C. If ∑n−1 k=0 |ak| 2 ≤ 1, show that ∑n k=1|zk| 2 ≤ n. (c) (MOP 2011) Prove that 1 n ∑n k=1|zk| 2 < 1 + max1≤k≤n|an−k| 2. 4. (Iterated stuﬀs) (a) (Math Prize 2012) Deﬁne L(x) = x − x 2 2 for every real number x. Prove that limn→∞ nL n(17/n) exists, and compute its value explicitly. (b) (Putnam 2012) Suppose that a0 = 1 and that an+1 = an + e−an for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Does an − ln n have a ﬁnite limit as n → ∞? (c) (Putnam 2006) Let k > 1 be an integer. Suppose a0 > 0 and deﬁne an+1 = an + a −1/k n for n ≥ 0. Evaluate limn→∞ a k+1 n /nk. 5. (Real roots and interlacing, HroK’s blog 3) The intermediate value theorem and Rolle’s theorem are ubiquitous principles in the analysis of real roots of continuous and diﬀerentiable functions, respectively. As you are likely familiar with the most standard uses of these theorems, we brieﬂy discuss the phe- nomenon of interlacing functions f, g with alternating real roots. (For a much more uniﬁed coverage, see Steve Fisk’s paper Polynomials, roots, and interlacing.) In particular, we look at polynomial recurrences, which provide some of the most natural examples of interlacing. (a) Let’s ﬁrst give an example: The nth Hermite polynomial Hn(x) = (−1)nex2 dn dxn e−x2 has all real roots (by induction one easily veriﬁes that Hn is a polynomial of degree n). Indeed, we induct to show that for every n ≥ 1, hn(x) = d n dxn e−x2 has exactly n roots, where the base case is obvious. But if for some n > 1 we assume that hn−1(x) has n − 1 real roots a1 < · · · < an−1, then noting that ±∞ are also roots and hn = d dx hn−1, we’re done by Rolle’s theorem. Obseve that hn, hn−1 interlace, i.e. the roots of hn−1 lie in between those of hn. Of course, there are several variations on the same idea. For example, if we have a recurrence like pn(x) = xpn−1(x) + pn−2(x) and we know that pn−1, pn−2 interlace, then under some mild conditions we can show via the IVT that pn, pn−1 and pn, pn−2 also interlace (of course, we need pn, pn−1, pn−2 to have degrees within one of each other). This is in essence the idea behind, for instance, Sturm’s theorem. Now for some problems, (very) roughly arranged in diﬃculty order! (b) (Steve Fisk) Suppose {ai}, {bi}, {ci} are sequences of reals where all ai, ci are positive and the bi are unrestricted. Deﬁne a sequence of polynomials recursively by p−1 = 0, p0 = 1, and pi = (aix + bi)pi−1 − cipi−2 for i > 1. Show that pn(x) has all real roots for every positive integer n. (c) Prove Sturm’s theorem. (d) (ELMO Shortlist 2012, David Yang) Prove that any polynomial of the form 1+anx n +an+1xn+1 + · · ·+akxk (k ≥ n) has at least n−2 non-real roots (counting multiplicity), where the ai (n ≤ i ≤ k) are real and ak ̸= 0. (e) Prove Newton’s inequalities. 3If you’re interested in contributing to this excellent blog, ask me for the password. 4 Victor Wang MOP experiment (condensed version of analysis and algebra/polynomials/NT) (f) (Descartes’ rule of signs) For a polynomial p ∈ R[x], let z(p) denote the number of positive zeros and v(p) the number of sign changes. (i) Show that 2 | z(p) − v(p). (ii) Prove that z(p) ≤ v(p) by writing p = (x − r)q for some positive real root r of p(x) and inducting on deg p. (iii) Prove that z(p) ≤ v(p) by considering the derivative p ′(x) (assuming WLOG that p(0) ̸= 0) and inducting on deg p. (g) (Classical) Show that out of all monic polynomials of a ﬁxed degree n, Tn(x)/2 n−1 attains the smallest maximum absolute value on the interval [−1, 1], where Tn(x) denotes the nth Chebyshev polynomial of the ﬁrst kind. (h) (MOP 1999) Given n points on the unit circle such that the product of the distances from any point on the circle to the given points does not exceed 2, prove that the points must be vertices of a regular n-gon. (i) (MOP 2001) Let P (x) be a real-valued polynomial with P (n) = P (0). Show that there exist at least n distinct (unordered) pairs of distinct real numbers {x, y} such that x − y ∈ Z and P (x) = P (y). Does this necessarily hold if we allow P to be any continuous function? (j) (USAMO 2002) Prove that any monic polynomial of degree n with real coeﬃcients is the average of two monic polynomials of degree n with n real roots. (k) (MOP 2007) Let a be a real number. Prove that every nonreal root of f (x) = x2n + ax2n−1 + · · · + ax + 1 lies on the unit circle and f has at most 2 real roots. (l) (ELMO Shortlist 2011, Evan O’Dorney) If a + b + c = a n + bn + c n = 0 for some positive integer n and complex a, b, c, show that two of a, b, c have the same magnitude. (m) (“Enzo”, MathOverﬂow) For n ≥ 1, let Pn(x) = xn+1 [ ∂2n+1 ∂z2n+1 sinh(z) cosh(z) − 1 + x ] z=0 . Prove that Pn(x) is a polynomial of degree n with every root real and strictly greater than 2. 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
