First we introduce the notion of adèles AQ and idèles A× Q over Q. Then we will discuss p-adic numbers for arbitrary number ﬁelds K, and use these to deﬁne the adèles AK and idèles A× K of a number ﬁeld K. One deﬁnes the quotient group A× K/K× to be the idèle class group of K. Our goal will be to show that this is essentially the ideal class group of K, and then use this to describe some of the main results of class ﬁeld theory. 8.1 AQ The adèles of Q are the ring AQ = ￿ (α2, α3, α5,. .. ; α∞) ∈ ￿ p Qp × R : αp ∈ Zp for a.a. p ￿ . Here “for a.a. (almost all)” p means for all but ﬁnitely many primes p. Exercise 8.1. With addition and multiplication deﬁned component-wise, show AQ is a ring. Note that AQ puts together the information one gets from all the completions of Q,but the whole direct product ￿ Qp × R is too large to work with by itself, so we only consider sequences where almost all terms are p-adic integers. This is analogous to an inﬁnite direct sum of vector spaces Vi. Speciﬁcally, ￿∞ i=1 Vi = {(vi) ∈ ￿ Vi : vi =0 for a.a. i}. For instance if each Vi = R, then a basis for ￿ Vi is {ei} where ei =(0,. .., 0, 1, 0,. ..) is the vector with a 1 in the i-th coordinate and 0’s elsewhere. If one removes the “for almost all i” condition, then (1, 1, 1,. ..)= e1 + e2 + e3 + ·· · would be in the direct sum, but this is not a ﬁnite linear combination of basis elements. Let us simplify now our notation slightly. We call a nontrivial absolute value on Q a place of Q. Hence the places of Q are |· |v where v is either a prime p or v = ∞. The places v = p are called ﬁnite places, and the place v = ∞ is called the real place or inﬁnite place.† Let Qv denote the completion of Q w.r.t. |· |v,so Qp still denotes Qp and now Q∞ denotes R. Let Zv denote the set {xv ∈ Qv : |xv|v ≤ 1},so that Zv = Zp if v = p and Z∞ =[−1, 1].While Zp is the completion of Z in each Qp, Z∞ admittedly has little to do with Z. Nevertheless this notation is convenient. We also remark that Zv is compact inside each Qv. In fact when v< ∞, i.e., v = p, Zv is open in Qv. Now we can denote the adèles as AQ = ￿ (αv) ∈ ￿ Qv : αv ∈ Zv for a.a. v￿ . While the condition αv ∈ Zv for a.a. v may at ﬁrst glance look stronger than the condition αp ∈ Zp for a.a. p because v = ∞ is allowed, thinking about it for a second shows they are equivalent. (Think about it for a second: α ∈ AQ means the local components αv can lie outside of Zv only for v in some ﬁnite set S of places (S of course depends on α— it is like the “support” of an element †It is standard to call places primes and still use the letter p,since they correspond to the usual primes and inﬁnity. Then the ordinary primes are called ﬁnite primes, and denoted by p< ∞,and the inﬁnite place is called the inﬁnite prime p = ∞. 103 y in the inﬁnite direct sum R∞ = ￿∞ i=1 R, which is the set of i for which the i-th component of y is nonzero. We can always add the place ∞ to S if it is not included, and S will still be ﬁnite, meaning we have the condition αv can lie outside of Zv for v ∈ S ∪ {∞}.) The following examples will tell us a little bit about AQ. Example 8.1.1. Let x = a b ∈ Q with a, b ∈ Z.Let α =(x, x, x, . . .).Note that 1 b ∈ Zp for any p s.t. p ￿ b.Hence x = a b ∈ Zp for any p s.t. p ￿ b,i.e., x = αv ∈ Zv for almost all v.Thus α ∈ AQ. Hence we have an (injective) ring homomorphism from Q → AQ given by x ￿→ (x, x, x, . . .). So the additive identity of AQ is (0, 0, 0,. ..) and the multiplicative identity of AQ is 1=(1, 1, 1,. ..). We will typically identify elements of Q with their image in AQ under this map. Example 8.1.2. Let α =(1, 0, 0, 0,. ..), β =(0, 1, 1, 1,. ..).Since each component αv, βv ∈ Zv for all v,we have α, β ∈ AQ.Then αβ =(0, 0, 0,. ..)= 0 ∈ AQ.In other words, α and β are zero divisors in AQ,so AQ is not an integral domain. Proposition 8.1.3. For α =(αv) ∈ AQ,let |α| = ￿v |αv|v.Then |·| : AQ → R satisﬁes (i) |α| ≥ 0 (ii) |αβ| = |α||β| Proof. First note that |α| is well deﬁned: since α =(αv) ∈ AQ satisﬁes αv ∈ Zv for almost all v, we have |αv|v ≤ 1 for almost all v, and therefore the inﬁnite product |α| = ￿v |α|v converges. It is clear that |α| ≥ 0. Further (ii) follows immediately because it does for each |α|v. Example 8.1.4. Taking α =(1, 0, 0, 0,. ..) from the previous example, we see |α| = |1|2 ￿v￿=2 |0|v = 0,so |· | can be zero on nonzero elements. Therefore, |· | cannot technically be an absolute value. Of course, our earlier deﬁnition of absolute values was only for integral domains because any mul- tiplicative homomorphism |·| : R → R for a non-integral domain must be 0 on some zero divisors. (αβ =0 implies |α||β| = |αβ| =0 so either |α| or |β| is 0.) However we can even ﬁnd α ∈ AQ which is not a zero divisor such that |α| =0.Namely consider α =(αv) where αp = p and α∞ =1.Each component αv ∈ Zv so α ∈ AQ,but α = ￿ p |p|p ·|1|∞ = ￿ p 1 p =0. In fact, another crucial property of absolute values fails also, namely the triangle inequality. Exercise 8.2. Find α, β ∈ AQ such that |α + β| > |α| + |β|. Example 8.1.5. Let x ∈ Q and α =(x, x, x, . . .).If x =0,then |α| =0.Otherwise |α| =1 by Exercise 6.11. The fact that AQ is not an integral domain makes it a little hard to work with, but the idèles A× Q = {α ∈ AQ : α invertible}, namely the multiplicative subgroup of AQ, become a nice space to work with. Proposition 8.1.6. The idèle group A× Q = {(αv) ∈ ￿v Q× v : αv ∈ Z× v for a.a. v} . 104 Note that technically we did not deﬁne Z× v for v = ∞, but as above including or removing a single place v = ∞ from a “for all but ﬁnitely many” condition does not change anything. However, if one wishes, one can set Z× v = {αv ∈ Q× v : |αv|v =1} so Zv = Zp for v = p and Zv = {−1, 1} for v = ∞. Proof. Let α =(αv) ∈ A× Q. It is clear that αv ∈ Q× v for all v, otherwise some component will be zero. Let β =(βv)= α−1 ∈ AQ. Since βv ∈ Zv and αv ∈ Zv for almost all v, there is a ﬁnite set S of places v such that αv, βv ∈ Zv for all v ￿∈ S. Then αβ =(1, 1, 1,. ..) means αvβv =1 for all v,so αv, βv ∈ Z× v for all v ￿∈ S, i.e., αv ∈ Z× v for a.a. v. This proves ⊆. ⊇ is straightforward—see the next exercise. Exercise 8.3. Let α =(αv) ∈ AQ such that αv ￿=0 for all v and αv ∈ Zv for almost all v.Show there is a β ∈ AQ such that αβ =1= (1, 1, 1,. ..). One can use the topologies on Qv and Q× v to deﬁne topologies on the additive group of adèles and multiplicative group of idèles, to make them both into topological groups. (We already deﬁned the topology on Qv in terms of a basis of neighborhoods. One can do the same thing for Q× v , or just give Q× v the subspace topology from Q× v ⊆ Qv. Both methods give the same topology.) To deﬁne a topology on a group, it suﬃces to specify a basis of open neighborhoods of the identity. A basis of open neighborhoods of 0 in AQ is given by a collection of sets of the form ￿ v∈S Uv ￿ v￿∈S Zv ⊆ AQ where S is a ﬁnite set of places containing ∞ and for each v ∈ S, Uv is an open neighborhood of 0 in Qv. Note the requirement that ∞∈ S is because Z∞ =[−1, 1] is a closed set in Q∞ = R,so we do not want v = ∞ occurring in the product on the right. Similarly, a basis of open neighborhoods of 1 in A× Q is given by a collections of sets of the form ￿ v∈S Uv ￿ v￿∈S Z × v ⊆ AQ where S is a ﬁnite set of places containing ∞ and for each v ∈ S, Uv is an open neighborhood of 1 in Q× v . We remark that one can also form a topology of AQ by taking the product topology on ￿ Qv, and put the subspace topology on AQ. This is diﬀerent than the topology we described above, and this topology induced by the product topology is too strong for our purposes. Similar remarks are true for the topology on A× Q. Further, the topology on A× Q is not the subspace topology induced from the inclusion A× Q ⊆ AQ, as the open sets in the subspace topology will be too large. For example, Exercise 8.4. Consider the open set U = R × ￿p Zp ⊆ AQ.This is an open neighborhood of 1 in AQ.Show the restriction U ∩A× Q contains but does not equal the open neighborhood V = R× ×￿p Z× p of 1 in A× Q. A similar, but slightly more technical, argument shows that if V = ￿v∈S Uv ￿v￿∈S Z× v is an open neighborhood of 1 in AQ (where as usual S is a ﬁnite set of places), then there is no open neighborhood U of 1 in AQ whose restriction to A× Q will be contained in V . 105 Proposition 8.1.7. AQ and A× Q are locally compact. Furthermore, (i) a subset U of AQ is relatively compact if and only if U ⊆ ￿v Kv where each Kv is compact in Qv and Kv = Zv for almost all v;and (ii) a subset U of A× Q is relatively compact if and only if U ⊆ ￿v Kv where each Kv is compact in Q× v and Kv = Z× v for almost all v. (Recall a set is called relatively compact if its closure is compact.) Proposition 8.1.8. Q and Q× are discrete subgroups of AQ and A× Q. Proposition 8.1.9. AQ/Q is compact with the quotient topology, and AQ/Q ￿ lim ←− n Z/nZ = {(a1,a2,a3,a4,. ..): an ∈ Z/nZ,an ≡ am mod m if m|n} . Hence, just like Zp =lim ←− Z/pnZ, we can view AQ/Q as a projective limit, i.e., as a way of putting together, all the Z/nZ’s in a compatible way. See [Ramakrishnan–Valenza] for proofs. 8.2 p-adic ﬁelds There are several ways to treat the theory of p-adic ﬁelds, just like there are several ways to treat the theory of p-adic numbers. One common way of deﬁning them is as ﬁnite extensions of Qp. However, I will opt for a concrete approach via completions w.r.t. absolute values, as it is in my mind more natural. Let K be a number ﬁeld and p a prime ideal of K. In the case K = Q and p =(p), one deﬁnes the p-adic absolute value by |x|p = p−m where x = pm a b and a, b are relatively prime to p.If x = pma ∈ Z, another way to say this is that |x|p = p−m where m is the highest power of p that divides x, i.e., m is the unique integer such that pm =(p) m ⊇ (x) ￿⊆ pm+1 =(p) m+1. In fact, using fractional ideals, we can say the same thing even if x ￿∈ Z. Speciﬁcally, we have a ﬁltration of Q: ·· · ⊇ p−2 ⊇ p−1 ⊇ p0 = Z ⊇ p1 ⊇ p2 ⊇ · · · We deﬁne ordp(x) to be the largest m such that x (or (x) if you prefer) is contained in pm =(p)m, and then set |x|p = p−ordp(x). Now we return to the general case. Deﬁnition 8.2.1. Let K be a number ﬁeld and p be a prime ideal of K.For x ∈ K, deﬁne the p-adic valuation ordp(x) to be the largest integer m such that x ∈ pm.Then the p-adic absolute value on K is given by |x|p = N (p)−ordp (x). Exercise 8.5. Let p be a prime ideal of K lying above a prime p of Q.Then for x ∈ Q ⊆ K,show |x|p = |x| f p where f = f (p|p) is the inertial degree of p above p. As in the case K = Q, these give, up to equivalence, all non-archimedean absolute values on K. The archimedean values are slightly more complicated then the case of Q, and they are essentially parametrized by Gal(K/Q). This is because if we want to restrict the usual absolute value on R or 106 C to K, it depends upon the embedding of K into R or C, and the embeddings of K into C was precisely our deﬁnition for the Galois group Gal(K/Q). Let {σ1,. .. σr} denote the set of real embeddings of K and {τ1, τ 1,. .., τs, τ s} denote the set of complex embeddings of K. Then we deﬁne the archimedean absolute values |x|σi = |σi(x)|R and |x|τj = |τj(x)|C where |· |R is the usual absolute value on R and |z|C = zz is the square of the usual absolute value on C. It is immediate from the deﬁnition of equivalence that ￿ ￿ cdot|C is equivalent to the usual absolute value on C, but it is preferable for us to take this normalization, as |z|C is more like a norm than ￿ |·|C. In particular it maps Z[i] into Z. For instance |1+ i|C =(1 + i)(1 − i)=2,but if we use the usual absolute value, then |1+ i| = √2. Example 8.2.2. Let K = Q( √3).Then Gal(K/Q)= {σ1, σ2} where σ1( √3) = √3 and σ2( √3) = − √3.Then |1+ √3|σ1 = |1+ √3|R ￿= |1 − √3|R = |1+ √3|σ2. Example 8.2.3. Let K = Q( √−3).Then Gal(K/Q)= {τ, τ } where τ ( √−3) = i √3.Then |1+ √−3|τ = |1+ i √3|C = |1 − i √3|C = |1+ √−3|τ . In general, no absolute values corresponding to two diﬀerent σi’s or τj’s will be equivalent, but we will always have |·|τj = |·|τ j since |z|C = |z|C. Theorem 8.2.4. The places (equivalence classes of non-trivial absolute values) on K are precisely given by (i) v = p where p is a prime ideal of K (non-archimedean places) (ii) v = σi where σi is a real embedding of K (real places) (iii) v = τj where τj runs over the set of complex embedding of K,up to complex conjugation (complex places). Deﬁnition 8.2.5. For a place v of K,let Kv denote the completion of K with respect to |·|v.Let OKv = {x ∈ Kv : |x|v ≤ 1} and O× Kv = {x ∈ Kv : |x|v =1}. If v = p is a non-archimedean place, we call Kv the p-adic numbers and OKv the p-adic integers over K. If K = Q and p =(p) this coincides with our previous deﬁnitions. Most of the results on p-adic numbers over Q extend to p-adic numbers over K, but due to time constraints we will not explain these in detail except where we need to. A similar remark is true for the theory of adèles and idèles, which we can now deﬁne. Deﬁnition 8.2.6. The adèles of K are AK = {α =(αv): αv ∈ Kv for all v, αv ∈ Zv for a.a. v} ⊂ ￿ v Kv. Similarly, the idèles of K are A× K = ￿α =(αv): αv ∈ K× v for all v, αv ∈ Z × v for a.a. v￿ ⊂ ￿ v K× v . In both statements, v runs over the set of places of K. 107 As with Q, K and K× embed diagonally into AK and A× K, and in this way we will regard K and K× as additive and multiplicative subgroups of AK and A× K. One deﬁnes the absolute value on AK or A× K by |α| = |α|AK | = ￿ v |αv|v where α =(αv) ∈ AK. We will usually simply denote the absolute value on AK by |·|, but sometimes we will use |·|AK for clarity. Deﬁnition 8.2.7. The idèle class group of K is CK = A× K/K×. While AK/K is compact, it is not the case that A× K/K× is, owing to the fact that the open sets of A× K are much smaller than the open sets of AK (see above remarks about the diﬀerence between the topologies on AQ and A× Q). However one can prove the following. Theorem 8.2.8. Let A1 K ⊂ A× K be the subgroup of idèles of K having absolute value 1.Then K× ⊆ A1 K and the norm 1 idèle class group C1 K = A1 K/K× is compact. Recall in the case K = Q, you proved in Exercise 6.11 that the adèlic absolute value |(x, x, x, . . .)|AQ = 1 for x ∈ Q×. A similar argument shows that |x|AK = |(x, x, x, . . .)|AK =1 for any x ∈ K×, which means K× ⊆ A1 K. Deﬁnition 8.2.9. The ∞-idèles are deﬁned to be A× K,∞ = ￿(αv) ∈ A× K : αv ∈ O× Kv for all v< ∞ ￿ ⊆ A× K Exercise 8.6. Check A× K,∞ is a subgroup of A× K.Show its intersection with the subgroup K×,i.e. A× K,∞ ∩ K×,is thegroupofunits O× K (regarded as a subgroup of A× K). Theorem 8.2.10. The map A× K → ClK α =(αv) ￿→ ￿ pordp (αp ) is a surjective homomorphism with kernel K× · A× K,∞. In particular, this deﬁnes an isomorphism CK/A× K,∞ ￿ ClK of the idèle class group mod the ∞-idèles with Dedekind’s ideal class group. Proof. Note that if αp ∈ O× Kp , then ordp(αp)=0 so pordp (αp ) = (1) = OK. Since α ∈ A× K means αp ∈ O× Kp for all but ﬁnitely many p, the product in the deﬁnition of the homomorphism is in fact a ﬁnite product so the deﬁnition makes sense. It is then obvious it is a homomorphism. Exercise 8.7. (i) Show for A× K,∞ is in the kernel of the above map into ClK (ii) Show K× is kernel of the above map into ClK.(Hint: show if x ∈ O× K,then the ideal (x)= xOK = ￿ pordp (x).) 108 It is not much more diﬃcult to show that these subgroups give the whole kernel. To complete the proof, one needs to show the above map is surjective. Let I be an arbitrary ideal in ClK, and write the prime ideal factorization as I = ￿p∈S pep where S is some ﬁnite set of primes. Then we can construct an idèle α =(αv) where αv =1 if v ￿∈ S and αp = ￿ep p . Here ￿p is a uniformizer of OKp , i.e., ordp(￿p)=1. To see that such a ￿p always exists, just take ￿p ∈ OK such that ￿p ∈ p but ￿p ￿∈ p2. This leads us to a topological proof of Corollary 8.2.11. The ideal class group ClK is ﬁnite. Proof. We consider the above map restricted to A1 K. It is easy to see that this is still surjective—in our construction of α above, we were free to do what we want at the inﬁnite places so we can ensure |α| =1. Hence we have an isomorphism C1 K/A1 K,∞ ￿ ClK where A1 K,∞ = A× K,∞ ∩ A× K. However C1 K is compact, and A1 K,∞ is an open subset. Hence the quotient ClK is both compact and discrete, whence ﬁnite. 8.3 Elements of class ﬁeld theory Class ﬁeld theory is regarded as the crowning acheivement of algebraic number theory, just as quadratic reciprocity was the crowning achievement of elementary number theory. Class ﬁeld theory is often described as a characterization of the abelian extensions of a number ﬁeld, but its explicit forms generalize quadratic and higher reciprocity laws. What do we mean by higher reciprocity laws? Well the most basic way of thinking about quadratic reciprocity is a way to tell if something is a square mod p. Cubic reciprocity is a way to tell if something is a cube mod p, and similarly there are notions of biquadratic (4th power) and higher reciprocity laws. Looked at from the point of view of rings of integers, quadratic reciprocity tells us about the way primes split in quadratic extensions. So you might guess cubic reciprocity should tell us about the way primes split in (normal) cubic extensions, and so on. In general, Artin reciprocity (a more explicit form class ﬁeld theory) tells us how primes split in abelian extensions. Even to state the main theorems of class ﬁeld theory is not so simple, and we still need to make some more deﬁnitions. Let L/K be an extension of number ﬁelds. Let P be a prime ideal of L lying above p,a prime ideal of K. The decomposition group of L/K at P is G(P|p)= {σ ∈ Gal(L/K): σ(P)= P} . Recall that Gal(L/K) acts on the primes of L above p,so the G(P|p) is just the stabilizer of P. Each element of G(P|p) extends to an automorphism of the completion LP which is trivial on Kp. One can deﬁne Galois groups for extensions of local ﬁelds (LP/Kp is a ﬁnite extension of degree f (P|p))and show Gal(LP/Kp) ￿ G(P|p). As in the case of number ﬁelds one can deﬁne a norm from LP to Kp given by NP|p(x)= NLP /Kp (x)= ￿ σ∈Gal(LP /Kp ) σ(x). 109 One can also do something similar for the archimedean, or inﬁnite, places. In particular, if v is an inﬁnite place of L (i.e., an element of Gal(/Q), up to complex conjugation) and w is an inﬁnite place of K (i.e., an element of Gal(K/Q) up to complex conjugation), we write v|w if the embedding v : L ￿→ C restricted to K gives the embedding w : K ￿→ C (up to complex conjugation). If v|w, then Nv|w(z)= z if Lv = Kw = R or C,and Nv|w(z)= zz if Lv = C and Kw = R. Using this, one can deﬁne a norm from A× L to A× K given by NL/K((αv)v)=( ￿ v|w Nv|w(αv))w Exercise 8.8. Let x ∈ L× and regard x =(x, x, x, . . .) ∈ A× L .Show the idèlic norm NL/K(x) lies in K× ⊆ A× K. For a number ﬁeld K, let K denote its algebraic closure, and for a group G let Gab denote is abelianization (quotient via the commutator subgroup). Note that Gal(K/K)ab “contains” the Ga- lois group of any abelian extension L/K as a quotient. In fact, there is a maximal abelian extension Kab of K inside K (inﬁnite degree of course), and we will have Gal(Kab/K) = Gal(K/K)ab. The extension Kab contains all ﬁnite abelian extensions of K. Now we can at least state some of the “non-explicit” assertions of class ﬁeld theory: Theorem 8.3.1. Let K be a number ﬁeld. There is a homomorphism, called the Artin map, θK : CK → Gal(Kab/K) such that (i) For every ﬁnite abelian extension L/K,let θL/K denote the composition of θL/K : CK θK→ Gal(Kab/K) → Gal(L/K) Then ker θL/K = NL/K(CL),whichyields an isomorphism CK/(NL/KCL)= A× K/(K× · NL/K(A× L )) ￿ Gal(L/K) (ii) Given any open subgroup of N of CK of ﬁnite index, there is a ﬁnite abelian extension L of K with N =ker θL/K.Hence CK/N ￿ Gal(L/K). There are also some functoriality results which say how the Artin maps θK and θL are related for an extension L/K, but we will pass over these now. Let ζn = e2πi/n. Corollary 8.3.2. (Kronecker–Weber) Every abelian extension of Q is contained in Q(ζn) for some n. An equivalent way to state this is that the maximal abelian extension Qab of Q in Q is the compositum of the extensions Q(ζn) for all n. The basic idea of the proof is the following. Class ﬁeld theory says the abelian extensions of Q correspond to the open subgroups of the idèle class group CQ. To understand what these are, we want to determine the structure of A× Q. Speciﬁcally, one can show A× Q ￿ Q × × R>0 × ˆZ × 110 where ˆZ× =lim ←− (Z/nZ)× = ￿p Z× p . Consequently CQ ￿ R>0 × ˆZ ×. Hence if U is an open subgroup of CQ with ﬁnite index, then U must be of the form U ￿ R>0 × U ￿ where U ￿ is an open subgroup of ﬁnite index in Z×. (Since there are no nontrivial open subgroups of ﬁnite index in R>0.) Then one uses a basis of neighborhoods for 1 in ˆZ× to show that U must contain NK/Q(CK) where K is some Q(ζn). Consequently the extension corresponding to U must contain K. (The functor from open subgroups of CK to abelian extensions of K is contravariant (i.e., inclusion-reversing), just like the functor from subgroups of the absolute Galois group of K to extensions of K.) The above theorem of class ﬁeld theory was established by Takagi, but the existence of a ho- momorphism θK was given abstractly. It was Artin who was able to give it in an explicit fashion, which we now brieﬂy describe. Let L/K be a Galois extension of number ﬁelds, p aprimeof K and P aprimeof L lying above p. Let f = f (p|p) where p is the prime of Q lying under p, so the residue ﬁeld OK/p has order q = pf . The Frobenius map Frq : x ￿→ xq generates the Galois group Gal((OL/P)/(OK/p)). The decomposition group maps to Gal((OL/P)/(OK/p)) via φ : G(P|p) → Gal((OL/P)/(OK/p)) by σ ￿→ (aP ￿→ σ(a)P). This is an isomorphism if P|p is unramiﬁed, and in this case and we let the Frobenius element φP|p of Gal(P|p) ⊆ Gal(L/K) be the inverse image φP|p = φ−1(Frq) of Frq in Gal(P|p). Exercise 8.9. Let L/K be a Galois extension of number ﬁelds. Let P and P￿ be primes of L lying above p.Show the decomposition groups G(P|p) and G(P￿|p) are conjugate in Gal(L/K). We regard each Frobenius element φP|p ∈ Gal(P|p) as an element of Gal(L/K). The above exercise implies for two primes P and P￿ of L above p, the Frobenius elements φP|p and φP￿|p are conjugate in Gal(L/K). If L/K is abelian, then the conjugacy classes of Gal(L/K) are just single elements and the Frobenius φP|p ∈ Gal(L/K) does not depend upon the choice of prime P above p. Hence in this case we deﬁne the Frobenius at p to be φp = ￿L/K p ￿ := φP|p ∈ Gal(L/K) where P is a prime of L above p. The symbol ￿L/K p ￿ is called the Artin symbol. One can similarly deﬁne the Artin symbol ￿L/K v ￿ for any place v of K, which will be some element of Gal(L/K). See [Neukirch] for the complete details. Theorem 8.3.3. (Artin) Let L/K be a ﬁnite abelian extension of number ﬁelds. Let ￿p be a uniformizer for OKp ,i.e.,an element of OKp such that ordp(￿p)= 1.Let xp =(αv) ∈ A× K be the idèle such that αv = ￿p for v = p and αv =1 otherwise. 111 We may take Artin map θK above such that θL/K(xp)= φp = ￿L/K p ￿ for all primes p of K which are unramiﬁed in L/K. The Artin symbol can be used to describe n-th power reciprocity laws. In order to make sense of this, we should deﬁne n-th power residue symbols ￿a p￿ n. This should be 1 if a is an n-th power mod p. But if this is going to be multiplicative, it can’t simply be −1 if a is not an n-th power mod p (think about the case n =3). What we need is ￿a p￿ n should give a group homomorphism into the n-th roots of unity, such that the kernel is precisely the set of n-th powers mod p. In fact because of this, it won’t make sense to deﬁne n-th power residue symbols over Q (or Z), but only over number ﬁelds which contain the n-th roots of unity. Let µn denote the n-th roots of unity. Deﬁnition 8.3.4. Let K be a number ﬁeld containing µn and v be a place of K.The n-th Hilbert symbol ￿−, − v ￿ n : K× v × K× v → µn is given by ￿Kv( n√b)/Kv v ￿ n√b = φv( n√b)= ￿a, b v ￿ n n√b. In other words, the Frobenius φv = ￿Kv( n√b)/Kv v ￿ is an element of Gal(Kv( n√b)/Kv). But the conjugates of n√b in Kv( n√b)/Kv are just n√b times the n-th roots of unity. Hence φv( n√b) is some n-th root of unity times n√b, and we let the n-th Hilbert symbol ￿a,b v ￿ n be that root of unity. Theorem 8.3.5. Let K be a number ﬁeld containing µn and v be a place of K.For a, b ∈ K×,we have ￿ v ￿a, b v ￿ n =1. Proof. We have ￿ v ￿a, b v ￿ n n√b = ￿ v ￿Kv( n√b)/Kv v ￿ n√b = ￿ v θK( n√b)/K(a) n√b. However, any element of K× is in the kernel of the Artin map θK( n√b)/K, so the above must equal n√b and the asserted product formula follows. Deﬁnition 8.3.6. Let a ∈ K× where µn ⊆ K.For p aprimeof K, we deﬁne the n-th power residue symbol to be ￿a p ￿ n = ￿a, ￿p p ￿ n where ￿p is a uniformizer for Kp.If b ∈ K×,weset ￿a b ￿ n = ￿ pi￿n ￿ a pi ￿ei n , where (b)= ￿ pei i ideal of K. 112 It is not too hard to check that ￿a p ￿ n =1 ⇐⇒ a ≡ x n mod p and more generally ￿a p ￿ n ≡ a N (p)−1 n mod p. Theorem 8.3.7. (n-th power reciprocity) Suppose µn ⊆ K×.If a, b ∈ K×,then ￿a b ￿ n = ￿b a ￿ n ￿ v|n∞ ￿a, b v ￿ n. This follows simply from the above product formula (the previous theorem). See [Neukirch]. In particular, if a and b are prime elements of OK (i.e., they generate prime ideals of OK), and￿v|n∞ ￿a,b v ￿ n =1, then a is an n-th power mod b if and only if b is an n-th power mod a. Corollary 8.3.8. (Quadratic Reciprocity) Let K = Q and n =2.Let a, b be odd coprime integers. Then ￿a b ￿ 2 ￿b a ￿ 2 =(−1) a−1 2 b−1 2 (−1) sgn(a)−1 2 sgn(b)−1 2 , and ￿−1 b ￿ 2 =(−1) b−1 2 , ￿2 b ￿ 2 =(−1) b2−1 8 . Corollary 8.3.9. (Cubic Reciprocity) Let K = Q(ζ3) and n =3.Suppose p, q are primes (i.e., they generate prime ideals) in OK such that p, q ≡ ±1 mod 3.(If (α) is prime in OK which does not lie above 3,then it has 6 associates, 2 of which are ≡ ±1 mod 3.) Then if p and q lie above diﬀerent primes of Q,wehave ￿p q ￿ 3 = ￿q p ￿ 3. Hence class ﬁeld theory generalizes quadratic and higher reciprocity laws. 8.4 Non-abelian class ﬁeld theory The n-th power reciprocity law says that if p and q are prime elements of K ⊃ µn, then we can determine whether p is an n-th power mod q based on whether or not q is an n-th power mod p.In particular, we have ￿p q ￿ n = ￿q p ￿ n if the product ￿v|n∞ ￿p,q v ￿ n =1. The proof of this reciprocity law is essentially to look at the Artin map θL/K : CK → Gal(L/K) for the extension L/K where L = K( n√a). Since this applies only to abelian extensions, we see the need for the requirement that µn ⊆ K from the point of view of class ﬁeld theory. Speciﬁcally, 113 assuming none of the n-roots of xn − a lie in K, the extension K( n√a)/K is abelian (in fact cyclic of degree n)ifandonlyif µn ⊂ K. Hence if one wanted to extend the n-th power reciprocity law to Q,one would want some sort of non-abelian version of class ﬁeld theory. In fact, one might guess a reciprocity law roughly of the following form: Let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial over Z.If p and q are odd primes not dividing n,then onecan determinewhen f (x) ≡ p is solvable mod q in terms of when f (x) ≡ q is solvable mod p. Indeed this is essentially what n-th power reciprocity says in the case f (x)= xn. Though it seems likely that a “non-abelian reciprocity law” will be more complicated than this. To put the notion of reciprocity in a little more imprecise way, recall that x2 ≡ q mod p has a solution, i.e., x2 − q has a root mod p,if and only if p is split in Q( √q).Similarly if p and q are primes in K, then xn ≡ q mod p has a solution if and only if xn − q has a root mod p, which means p is split in K( n√q).If K( n√q)/K is Galois, i.e., if µn ⊂ K, we can in fact say xn ≡ q mod p if and only if p splits completely in K( n√q)/K. Hence we may think of n-th power reciprocity as a description of which primes split in K( n√q)/K. Class ﬁeld theory can then be thought of as a description of which primes split in an abelian extension L/K. Thus non-abelian class ﬁeld theory, or a non-abelian reciprocity law, should be a description of which primes split in a non-abelian extension L/K. Before we think about what the statement of non-abelian class ﬁeld theory should look like in general, we sketch out an example. Example 8.4.1. (Koike, 1985) Let f (x) be an irreducible polynomial of degree 3 over Q,and let K be the splitting ﬁeld of f (x).Assume Gal(K/Q) ￿ S3 and K contains an imaginary quadratic extension. One can to associate to f (x) the elliptic curve E : y2 = f (x) as well as a corresponding modular form F : H = {z ∈ C : Im(z) > 0} → C F (τ )= ∞￿ n=1 ane 2πinτ , where the an’s are certain Fourier coeﬃcients which determine the function F (τ ). Let np be the number of solutions #E(Fp) to y2 ≡ f (x) mod p.Then the precise correspondence between E and F is that ap = p +1 − np. One version of a non-abelian reciprocity law in this case say that, apart from p lying in a ﬁnite set of primes, p splits completely in K ⇐⇒ ap =2. Hence we can describe the set of primes which split completely in K in terms of either (i) arithmetic data associated to an elliptic curve, or (ii) arithmetic data associated to a modular form. 114 Langlands’ conjecture In order to think about how one might set up a general non-abelian class ﬁeld theory, let’s go back to understanding what (abelian) class ﬁeld theory says. Class ﬁeld theory says there is an isomorphism between the idèle class group CK ￿ AK/K× and Gal(Kab/K), which satisﬁes certain properties. In particular, we have an isomorphism CK/NL/KCL ￿ Gal(L/K) for any ﬁnite abelian extension L/K. If one wants to extend this to non-abelian extensions L/K, we need a “non-abelian class group” G(K) such that we have something like G(K) ￿ Gal(K/K) such that for any ﬁnite extension L/K, we have G(K)/NL/K(G(L)) ￿ Gal(L/K), where NL/K(G(L)) is a certain normal subgroup of G(K) associated to the “non-abelian class group” G(L) of L. It is not clear at present exactly how such a “non-abelian class group” should be constructed, however there are very speciﬁc conjectures if we put things in terms of group representations and L-functions. If G is a locally compact abelian group, we can consider the set of characters, ˆG, consisting of continuous homomorphisms G → S1. The set ˆG is naturally made into a locally compact abelian group, called the dual group of G. Since ˆG ￿ G (in a canonical way), exhibiting an isomorphism CK ￿ Gal(Kab/K) is the same as exhibiting an isomorphism ￿CK ￿ ￿Gal(Kab/K) In fact, if ω is an idèle class character (or Hecke character), i.e., a character of CK,the continuity condition means ω is trivial on some open subgroup N of ﬁnite index, so that ω factors through CK/N , i.e., ω : CK/N → C×. Similarly if χ is a character of Gal(Kab/K), χ factors through a ﬁnite extension χ : Gal(L/K) → C×. Then class ﬁeld theory, in terms of group characters, says that the Hecke characters are in 1 − 1 correspondence with the characters of Gal(Kab/K): ￿ω : CK/N → C×￿ 1−1 ←→ ￿χ : Gal(L/K) → C×￿ . Of course, this correspondence should be such that N =ker θL/K = NL/K(CL). Moreover, since any character (1-dimensional representation) of the absolute Galois group Gal(K/K) must factor through Gal(Kab/K) (in fact a ﬁnite abelian extension Gal(L/K)), we may state this correspon- dence simply as {Hecke characters ω of CK} 1−1 ←→ ￿1-dimensional representations χ of Gal(K/K) ￿ . Now the natural guess for a “higher dimensional,” or non-abelian analogue of this would be to get a correspondence with n-dimensional representations of Gal(K/K) for any n.(Again, by continuity, any given representation will factor through a ﬁnite extension Gal(L/K). Moreover, if n> 1 and the representation is irreducible, then L/K will not be abelian.) The question is, what group should we pick on the left? This was an insight of Langlands (building on the work of many before him). Note that we can view the idèle class group as CK = A× K/K× =GL1(K)\\GL1(AK). 115 (Read the latter as GL1(AK) mod GL1(K). We typically write the mod on the left as above however—we also sometimes write K×\\A× K. Of course in this case our groups our abelian, so it doesn’t matter which side we mod out on, but it will for the non-abelian groups below. The reason for putting mod on the left is because we sometimes want to mod out by another subgroup on the right—of course which goes on the left and which on the right is just a matter of convention.) Conjecture 8.4.2. (Langlands) There is a 1 − 1 correspondence {automorphic representations π of GLn(K)\\GLn(AK)} 1−1 ￿￿￿ ←− ￿n-dimensional representations ρ of Gal(K/K) ￿ . Roughly, an automorphic representation of a locally compact group G is a irreducible rep- resentation of G on L2(G). The diagonal subgroup GLn(K) ⊂ GLn(AK) is not normal (for n> 1), so the quotient GLn(K)\\GLn(AK) is not actually a group. Hence this requires some explanation. First note if G is a ﬁnite group, L2(G) is just the C-vector space of C-valued functions on G.We can take for a basis {eg}g∈G where eg is the characteristic function of g in G. Hence L2(G) ￿ C[G], the group algebra, and we know C[G] decomposes as a direct sum of the irreducible representations of G. When G is not ﬁnite, things are more complicated, but in any event G acts on the space L2(G) by right multiplication, i.e., g : f (x) → f (xg) for any f ∈ L2(G). In fact if G =GLn(AK), G acts on L2(GLn(K)\\GLn(AK)) in the same way. This representation, the right regular representation on L2(GLn(K)\\GLn(AK)), decomposes into irreducible constituents. What we mean by an auto- morphic representation of GLn(AK) (or GLn(K)\\GLn(AK)) is one of these irreducible constituents. The term automorphic means that the representation is realized on a space of automorphic forms, which are functions on GLn(AK) invariant under GLn(K). Langlands’ conjecture states that to each n-dimensional Galois representation ρ : Gal(K/K) → GLn(C), there is associated (in a way we shall describe below) an automorphic representation π = π(ρ) of GLn(AK). However in general there will be more automorphic representations than n-dimensional Galois representations, i.e., not every automorphic representation will correspond to a Galois representation. This is indicated by the dashed arrow going from left to right in the conjecture above. However in the case n =1, the left hand side is just the set of Hecke characters of CK, and there is an honest 1 − 1 correspondence between these two sets of representations in this case, which is precisely class ﬁeld theory. This conjecture of Langlands suggests that the conjectural group G(K) should contain in some way each GLn(K)\\GLn(AK), so that the representations of G(K) correspond to all Galois repre- sentations. However this situation is even more ambiguous than the state of Langlands’ conjecutre above, and in any case understanding the conjecture above would be extraordinary progress to developing a non-abelian class ﬁeld theory. For these reasons, we will spend the rest of our time trying to explain what the above conjecture means. L-functions To describe the conjecture of Langlands above∗, one needs to specify exactly how the represen- tations should correspond. The answer comes via the construction of L-functions associated to each representations. Let’s ﬁrst see what happens in the case n =1. ∗This conjecture is also called the strong Artin conjecture or the modularity conjecture.Indeed Langlands made a series of far-reaching related conjectures, so if one just says “Langlands conjecture,” it is not always clear which one is being referred to. 116 Suppose χ is a 1-dimensional representation of Gal(K/K). Then χ factors through a ﬁnite abelian extension χ : Gal(L/K) → C× =GL1(C). If p is a prime of K, recall we have a Frobenius element φp ∈ G(P|p) ⊆ Gal(L/K) where P is a prime of L above p. Then we deﬁne the L-function associated to χ to be L(s, χ)= ￿ p unram 1 1 − χ(φp)N (p)−s . One can regard this as a generalization of the Dirichlet L-series, as specializing to the case K = Q and L = Q(ζm) gives the Dirichlet L-functions mod m. On the other hand, if ω is a Hecke character ω : CK = K×\\A× K → C×, we can view ω as a character of A× K which is trivial on K×. This gives a character ωv : K× v → C× for any place v of K simply by restricting to the v-component of A× K. Speciﬁcally ωv(xv)= ω(1,. .., 1,xv, 1 .. .) where the xv occurs in the v-th place. Then one can think of ω = ￿v ωv. When v = p,we say ωp is unramiﬁed if ωp is trivial on O× Kp . Then one can deﬁne the Hecke L-function L(s, ω)= ￿ ωp unram 1 1 − ωp(￿p)N (p)−s , where ￿p is a uniformizer for OKp . We say the Galois character χ and the Hecke character ω correspond if L(s, χ)= L(s, ω), i.e. if χ(φp)= ωp(￿p) for each unramiﬁed p. This is the L-function interpretation of class ﬁeld theory. This explicit correspondence of L-functions is amounts the explicit description of the Artin map. Now we can deﬁne L-functions for higher-dimensional representations. Let ρ : Gal(K/K) → GLn(C) be an n-dimensional Galois representation. Continuity of ρ means there is a ﬁnite extension L/K such that ρ restricted to the subgroup Gal(K/L) is trivial, i.e., ρ factors through ρ : Gal(L/K) → GLn(C). For any prime p of K and P of L with P|p, we have a surjective homomorphism G(P|p) → Gal((OL/P)/(OK/p)). Recall the group on the left, the decomposition group of P|p, is just the subgroup of Gal(L/K) which stablizes P. If the inertial degree f (P|p)=1, in particular if p is unramiﬁed in L/K, then this 117 map is an isomorphism and the group on the right is generated by Frq : x → xq where q = N (p).In this case, the Frobenius element φP|p ∈ G(P|p) ⊆ Gal(L/K). Since all the primes of L lying above p are conjugate in Gal(L/K), all the elements φP|p are conjugate as P ranges over the primes above p. We let the Frobenius φp = φP|p for some P, so this is well-deﬁned up to conjugacy. Of course if L/K is abelian, each element is its own conjugacy class, and φp is well-deﬁned as an element of Gal(L/K). Since almost all primes p of K are unramiﬁed, we can deﬁne the (partial) Artin L-function by L(s, ρ)= ￿ p unram 1 det(In − ρ(φp)N (p)−s) . Note even though φp is only well deﬁned up to conjugacy in Gal(L/K),the quantity det(In − ρ(φp)N (p)−s) is well deﬁned because the determinant is invariant under conjugation. We say this is apartial L-function because the full or completed Artin L-function is actually deﬁned as a product of terms over all places v (including the archimedean ones), but the partial and the full L-function only diﬀer by a product of ﬁnitely many terms (which are well understood). For simplicity we will not deﬁne the full L-function, but just mention that at unramiﬁed primes p, one needs to take into account the kernel of the map G(P|p) → Gal((OL/P)/(OK/p)), called the inertial subgroup of G(P|p). Let π be an automorphic representation of GLn(AK) ⊂ ￿v GLn(Kv). Then π = ⊗πv where each πv is a representation of GLn(Kv).For v = p,we say πp is unramiﬁed if πp restricted to the subgroup GLn(OKp ) is trivial. At such a place, πv is induced from n 1-dimensional representations ω1,. .., ωn placed on the diagonal subgroup of GLn(Kv). Set A(πv) = diag(ω1(￿p),. .., ωn(￿p)). Then we deﬁne the (partial) automorphic L-function L(s, π)= ￿ πp unram 1 det(In − A(πp)N (p)−s) . Now we can restate Langlands’ conjecture above in more precise terms Conjecture 8.4.3. (Langlands) There is a 1 − 1 correspondence {automorphic representations π of GLn(AK)} 1−1 ￿￿￿ ←− ￿n-dimensional representations ρ of Gal(K/K) ￿ such that L(s, π)= L(s, ρ), i.e., for almost all primes p of K,wehave det(In − A(πp)N (p) −s)= det(In − ρ(φp)N (p) −s). (If the local factors—called local L-factors or local L-functions—agree for L(s, π) and L(s, ρ) for almost all places, one can show that the local factors (in the completed L-functions) will all be the same.) The ﬁrst application of Langlands program (this program of attaching automorphic representa- tions to Galois representations, which has grown into a much more general setting than what we have presented) is to the following. 118 Conjecture 8.4.4. (Artin) Let ρ : Gal(K/K) be an irreducible nontrivial Galois representation. Then L(s, ρ) is entire. If ρ is trivial, then L(s, ρ)= ζK(s), the Dedekind zeta function of K,has a pole at s =1.If ρ is not trivial, Artin conjectures L(s, ρ) is entire, i.e., it has no poles. (The L-function as deﬁned, converges for Re(s) large, but is known to have meromorphic continuation to the whole complex plane.) If ρ is 1-dimensional, then this is known because ρ = χ corresponds to a Hecke character ω, and the Hecke L-functions L(s, ω) for nontrivial ω are known to be entire. It is also easy to see that if ρ is induced from a 1-dimensional representation χ, then L(s, ρ)= L(s, χ) so L(s, ρ) is entire. Not much was known about Artin’s conjecture for higher dimensional representations. However, it is known that if π is a cuspidal automorphic representation, then L(s, π) is entire, so if ρ ↔ π, then L(s, ρ) is also entire. (Any automorphic representation corresponding to a nontrivial irreducible Galois representation will be cuspidal.) Hence Langlands conjecture implies Artin’s conjecture, wherefore the above conjecture of Langlands is sometimes called the strong Artin conjecture. (In fact, the strong Artin conjecture and the Artin conjecture are known to be equivalent in the case of 2 or 3 dimensional representations. It is not clear if they should be equivalent in higher dimensions.) The ﬁrst success of Langlands program is the following result. Theorem 8.4.5. (Langlands, Tunnell) Suppose ρ : Gal(L/K) → GL2(C) is an irreducible 2- dimensional representation. If the image of ρ is solvable (a solvable subgroup of GL2(C)), then ρ ↔ π for some cuspidal automorphic representation π of GL2(AK). This gave new instances of Artin’s conjecture. We remark that Artin’s conjecture, together with the Grand Riemann Hypothesis (the analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis for more general L-functions), yields estimates for the error term in the prime number theorem. However, there is a much more famous consequence of this theorem of Langlands and Tunnell— Fermat’s last theorem. Very roughly, Frey, Ribet and Serre showed that Fermat’s last theorem follows from the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture, which says that to each elliptic curve over Q,there is an associated modular form, in the sense that their associated L-functions are equal. To prove Taniyama–Shimura, one associates to an elliptic curve E a family of p-adic Galois representations ρp : Gal(Q/Q) → GL2(Qp). This much is not diﬃcult. Wiles essentially showed that one can further associate to E a 2-dimensional complex Galois representation ρ : Gal(Q/Q) → GL2(C), where ρ has solvable image. Then Langlands–Tunnell applies, and ρ (and hence the elliptic curve E) corresponds to an automorphic representation π of GL2(AQ). This representation π is naturally associated to some modular form f , and this gave Taniyama–Shimura (for semistable curves, which was enough for Fermat’s last theorem—the general case was ﬁnished later), and hence Fermat’s last theorem. 119","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
