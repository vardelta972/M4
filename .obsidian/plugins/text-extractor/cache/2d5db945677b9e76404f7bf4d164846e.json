(For this inequality, the point O can lie on a side of ABC, so long as it is not actually one of the vertices.) Then AO + OC < AB + BC. Proof: Let P be the intersection of AO with BC. C B A P O Twice applying the Triangle Inequality gives AO + OC < AO + OP + P C = AP + P C < AB + BP + P C = AB + AC. Example 1. Let O be a point inside a triangle ABC. Show that p < AO + BO + CO < 2p, where p is the semiperimeter (that is, half the perimeter) of ABC. Solution. The left inequality follows from three applications of the Triangle Inequality. Indeed, we have AB < OA + OB, BC < OB + OC, CA < OC + OA. Adding all these together, we get 2p < 2(AO + BO + CO) as required. C B A O For the right inequality we need Tool 6. We get: OA + OB < CA + CB, OB + OC < AB + AC, OC + OA < BC + BA. Adding them all together gives 2(AO + BO + CO) < 4p. The next tool is used when a certain inequality must be proved for all values a, b, and c, which are known to be the lengths of the sides of a triangle. This tool allows us to replace a, b, and c, which are not arbitrary, by arbitrary positive x, y, and z. Tool 7. Numbers a, b and c are the lengths of the sides of a triangle if and only if there exist positive numbers x, y, and z such that a = x + y, b = y + z and c = z + x. Proof. If a, b and c are the sides of a triangle, then let x = a + c − b D A B C Then we can obtain a new pairing conﬁguration by instead connecting A with D and C with B. By Tool 5, the the sum of the n connecting segments in the new pairing is less than that in the pairing we started with. We repeat this process as long as we can. Since the sum of the conﬁguration’s n connecting segments decreases at each step, we never return to a conﬁguration we have encountered previously in the process. So, since the number of possible conﬁguration is n!, which is ﬁnite, this process must terminate. This happens only when we reach a pairing in which no two segments intersect. Here’s a shorter and less constructive version of the same argument. Consider a conﬁguration with minimal total combined length of segments. Such a minimal conﬁguration exists, because we have only a ﬁnite number of possibilities – the minimal conﬁguration might not be unique, but that does not matter. If two segments of this conﬁguration were to intersect, then we could swap endpoints as before to obtain a new conﬁguration with smaller total combined segment length, a contradiction. So no two segments in a minimal conﬁguration can intersect. Solution. For this sort of problem Tool 7 is just magic. Let us use it again. Indeed, substituting a = x + y, b = y + z and c = z + x we will have a new inequality 2(x + y) 2z + 2(y + z) 2x + 2(z + x) 2y ≤ 3(x + y)(y + z)(z + x), which has to be proved for x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0, z ≥ 0. This is a great improvement, since these constraints on indeterminates are much easier to handle. Actually at this stage we can forget the original geometric context, and approach this as usual for inequalities. Simplifying, we get x 2y + y2z + z2x + xy2 + yz2 + zx 2 ≥ 6xyz; this splits into the three inequalities (x 2 + y2)z ≥ 2xyz, (y2 + z2)x ≥ 2xyz, and (z2 + x 2)y ≥ 2xyz, which all follow from AM-GM. Summing these n − 1 inequalities, we obtain A1A2 Comment 1: The argument does not demand that the given points lie in a plane. Nothing changes if they are in three-dimensional space. Comment 2: It follows from the above solution that arbitrary distinct points M, A1, A2, . . . , An satisfy the inequality A1A2 13. A broken line of length L lies inside a square of sidelength 1. The positive number ǫ satisﬁes: for each point X inside the square, there is some point on the broken line whose distance from X is less than ǫ. Prove that L ≥ 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
