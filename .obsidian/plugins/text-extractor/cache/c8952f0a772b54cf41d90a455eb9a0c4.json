Is X 2 +4X + 3 reducible? What about X 2 +3X + 4? 2. Show that X 3 − 5X + 14 is irreducible. What about X 3 − 51X + 14? 3. Show that X 4 +1 is irreducible. Is X 4 +4 reducible? 4. Show that X 5 +6X 4 +6X 3 + 24X + 72 is irreducible. 2 Take a look at the roots! 1. Is the polynomial X 18 − 18 irreducible? What about X 18 − 36? And X 18 − 72? 2. Let a, n be integer numbers, n ≥ 1, and let p be a prime number, p> |a| + 1. Show that the polynomial X n + aX + p is irreducible. 3. Let n ≥ 2 be an odd integer, and let p be a prime number. Assume that all the roots of the polynomial X n + an−1X n−1 + ·· · + a1X + p2 have the same absolute value. Show that the polynomial g(X)= f (X 2)is irreducible. Theorem 2.1. (Perron’s criterion) Let f = X n + a1X n−1 + ·· · + an be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. If |a1| > 1+ |a2| + ·· · + |an|, then f is irreducible. Quick question: is the polynomial X n +5X n−1 +3 reducible? 3 What if our polynomials take lots of small values? 1. Show that if a1, ·· · ,an are distinct integers, then the polynomial (X − a1) ·· · (X − an) − 1 is irreducible. 1 2. Show that if a1, ·· · ,an are distinct integers, then the polynomial (X − a1) 2 ·· · (X − an) 2 +1 is irreducible. 3. Let g be a polynomial of degree k with integer coeﬃcients, and let d1, ·· · ,dk be distinct integers. Show that |g(di)| ≥ k! 2k for at least one value of i ∈ {1, ·· · ,k}. (You’ll need this result for the next problem) 4. (Polya) Let f be a polynomial of degree n with integer coeﬃcients, and set m = ￿(n + 1)/2￿. Suppose there exist n distinct integer numbers a1, ·· · ,an which are not roots of f , for which f (ai) < m! 2m . Prove that f is irreducible. 4 Reducing mod p...starting to feel the heat? Theorem 4.1. (Eisenstein’s criterion) Let p be a prime number, and f = anX n+·· ·+a1X +a0 a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Assume that • p ￿ an • p|an−1, p|an−2, ·· · , p|a1, p|a0. • p2 ￿ a0. Then f is irreducible. 1. Show that if p is a prime number and q is not divisible by p,then X n − pq is irreducible. (Can you do this without Eisentein’s criterion?) 2. Let p be a prime number. Show that X p−1 + X p−2 + ·· · + X +1 is irreducible. 3. Show that the polynomial (X 2 + X) 2n +1 is irreducible. 4. Let p be a prime number, and a an integer not divisible by p. Show that the polynomial X p − X + a is irreducible over the integers (by showing the stronger statement that it is irreducible over Z/(p)[X]. 5. Show that X 4 +1 is irreducible in Z[X], but reducible in Z/(p)[X] for every prime number p. 6. Is the polynomial X n +5X n−1 + 3 reducible? (have you seen this before?) 5 Enter the Heroes: Newton Polygons Theorem 5.1. (Dumas) The Newton polygon of a product of polynomials is the union of the Newton polygons of the factors. 1. Let’s try this again: show that X 5 +6X 4 +6X 3 + 24X + 72 is irreducible. Maybe try something easier before: is X 5 +2X 3 +2X +4 irreducible? 2. Is the polynomial X n +5X n−1 + 3 reducible? (I thought we’ve answered this already...) 3. Let n ≥ 2 be an odd integer, and let p be a prime number. Assume that all the roots of the polynomial X n + an−1X n−1 + ·· · + a1X + p2 have the same absolute value. Show that the polynomial g(X)= f (X 2)is irreducible. (am I repeating myself?) 4. Show that the polynomial X n n! + X n−1 (n − 1)! + ·· · + X 1! +1 is irreducible. (For those of you who know about power series, the above polynomials form, as n ranges over the natural numbers, the truncations of the power series expansion of eX .) 6 The Masterpiece We’ll try to put together (some of) the techniques we’ve learnt so far to prove the irreducibility of an interesting collection of polynomials. Consider the polynomials fn = (X + 1)n − X n − 1 X , for n ≥ 1. We will show that f2p is irreducible whenever p is a prime number. Note that the problem of establishing the irreducibility of fn is NOT solved for arbitrary n, so if you wanna get rich...spiritually...you should give it a try! Here are the steps for the irreducibility of f2p: (a) Explain why if α is a root of fn,then sois 1/α. (b) From here on, we assume that n =2p with p a prime number. Consider the Newton polygon of fn with respect to the prime number p. Show that fn is either irreducible, or it can be written as a product of two irreducible polynomials of degree (p − 1), fn = g · h. (c) Without loss of generality, assume that g and h have positive leading coeﬃcients. If we let gcd(g) and gcd(h) be the greatest common divisors of the coeﬃcients of the two polynomials (also known as the contents of the polynomials), show that gcd(g) =gcd(h) = 1. Show that, under our assumption, the constant terms in g, h are positive. (d) Show that if α is a root of g,then 1/α is NOT a root of g. (e) Prove that g is the reciprocal of h,i.e. g(X)= X n−1h(1/X). (f) Show that the situation in (e) cannot occur, and conclude that fn is irreducible (when n =2p).","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
