Let it intersect the line CB at D. Prove that CI is perpendicular to AD and prove that ID = √ b(b − a) where BC = a and CA = b. Solution: First observe that ADBI is a cyclic quadrilateral since ∠AID = ∠ABD = 90◦. Hence ∠ADI = ∠ABI = 45◦. Hence ∠DAI = 45 ◦. But we also have ∠ADB = ∠ADI + ∠IDB = 45 ◦ + ∠IAB = ∠DAI + ∠IAC = ∠DAC. Therefore CDA is an isosceles triangle with CD = CA. Since CI bisects ∠C it follows that CI ⊥ AD. This shows that DB = CA − CB = b − a. Therefore AD2 = c 2 + (b − a)2 = c 2 + b 2 + a 2 − 2ba = 2b(b − a). But then 2ID2 = AD2 = 2b(b − a) and this gives ID = √ b(b − a). 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a 1 + a + b 1 + b + c 1 + c = 1. Prove that abc ≤ 1/8. Solution: This is equivalent to ∑ a(1 + b)(1 + c) = (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c). This simpliﬁes to ab + bc + ca + 2abc = 1 Using AM-GM inequality, we have 1 = ab + bc + ca + 2abc ≥ 4(ab · bc · ca · 2abc)1/4. Simpliﬁcaton gives abc ≤ 1 8 . 3. For any natural number n, expressed in base 10, let S(n) denote the sum of all digits of n. Find all natural numbers n such that n = 2S(n)2. Solution: We use the fact that 9 divides n−S(n) for every natural number n. Hence S(n)(2S(n)−1) is divisible by 9. Since S(n) and 2S(n) − 1 are relatively prime, it follows that 9 divides either S(n) or 2S(n) − 1, but not both. We also observe that the number of digits of n cannot exceed 4. If n has k digits, then n ≥ 10k−1 and 2S(n)2 ≤ 2 × (9k) 2 = 162k2. If k ≥ 6, we see that 2S(n)2 ≤ 162k2 < 54k2 < 10k−1 ≤ n. If k = 5, we have 2S(n)2 ≤ 162 × 25 = 4150 < 10 4 ≤ n. Therefore n ≤ 4 and S(n) ≤ 36. If 9|S(n), then S(n) = 9, 18, 27, 36. We see that 2S(n) 2 is respectively equal to 162, 648, 1458, 2592. Only 162 and 648 satisfy n = 2S(n) 2. If 9|(2S(n) − 1), then 2S(n) = 9k + 1. Only k = 1, 3, 5, 7 give integer values for S(n). In these cases 2S(n) 2 = 50, 392, 1058, 2048. Here again 50 and 392 give n = 2S(n)2. Thus the only natural numbers wth the property n = 2S(n)2 are 50, 162, 392, 648. 4. Find the number of all 6-digit natural numbers having exactly three odd digits and three even digits. Solution: First we choose 3 places for even digits. This can be done in (6 3 ) = 20 ways. Observe that the other places for odd digits get automatically ﬁxed. There are 5 even digits and 5 odd digits. Any of these can occur in their proper places. Hence there are 5 6 ways of selecting 3 even and 3 odd digits for a particular selection of place for even digits. Hence we get 20 × 56 such numbers. But this includes all those numbers having the ﬁrst digit equal to 0. Since we are looking for 6-digit numbers, these numbers have to be removed from our counting. If we ﬁx 0 as the ﬁrst digit, we have, 2 places for even numbers and 3 places for odd numbers. We can choose 2 places for even numbers in (5 2) = 10 ways. As earlier, for any such choice of places for even digits, we can choose even digits in 5 2 ways and odd digits in 5 3 ways. Hence the number of ways of choosing 3 even and 3 odd digits with 0 as the ﬁrst digit is 10 × 55. Therfore the number of 6-digit numbers with 3 even digits and 3 odd digits is 20 × 5 6 − 10 × 5 5 = 10 × 55(10 − 1) = 281250. 5. Let ABC be a triangle with centroid G. Let the circumcircles of △AGB and △AGC intersect the line BC in X and Y respectively, which are distinct from B, C. Prove that G is the centroid of △AXY . Solution: Let D be the midpoint of AB. Ob- serve that DX · DB = DG · DA = DY · DC. But DB = DC. Hence DX = DY . This means that D is the midpoint of XY as well. Hence AD is also a median of △AXY . Now we know that AG : GD = 2 : 1. If G ′ is the median of △AXY , then G ′ must lie on AD and AG ′ : G′D = 2 : 1. We conclude that G = G ′. 6. Let ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers in an arithmetic progression. Prove that there is an inﬁnite subsequence of the given sequence whose terms are in a geometric progression. Solution: Let ⟨a1, a2, . . . , an+1 . . .⟩ = ⟨a, a + d, . . . , a + nd, . . .⟩ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers in arithmetic progression. Here a and d are both positive integers. Consider the following subsequence: ⟨a, a(1 + d), a(1 + d)2, . . . , a(1 + d) n, . . .⟩. This is a geometric progression. Here a > 0 and the common ratio 1 + d > 1. Hence the sequence is strictly increasing. The ﬁrst term is a which is in the given AP. The second term is a(1+d) = a+ad which is the (a + 1)-th term of the AP. In general, we see that a(1 + d) n = a + d ((n 1 )a + ( n 2 )ad + · · · + (n n )ad n−1) . 2 Here the coeﬃcient of d in the braces is also a positive integer. Hence a(1 + d) n is also a term of the given AP. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
