DON’t FORGET TO PLUG IN YOUR SOLUTION TO SEE IF IT WORKS! 2. Know the Basics Get to know the functional relationships satisﬁed by the usual suspects such as linear functions, trigonometric functions, log- arithms, powers, etc. Don’t forget reciprocals and functions of the form 1/(x + a). 3. Small Values Try solving for a few values such as f (0), f (1), f (−1) and so on. If you can ﬁnd enough of these you may be able to recognize the form of the function. 4. Special Solutions Try plugging in a few simple functions such as linear functions or polynomials and solving for the coeﬃcients. 5. General Behaviour Try to gain further insight about the general be- haviour of the function: (a) Is it strictly positive, strictly negative, or does it have zeros for certain values of x? (b) Is the function surjective, injective, or bijective? (c) Is the function monotone (increasing or decreasing)? (d) What happens for very small or very large values of x? Is the function unbounded? 6. Linearize Watch out for the opportunity to linearize the equation. 7. Composites If the equation involves f [α(x)], investigate the splinter αn(x). If αm(x) = x for some m, it may be possible to solve for f (x) by applying the equation m times. 8. Recurrence Relations Sequences and recurrence relations may be help- ful in solving functional equations involving expressions of the form f (f (x)). 9. Periodicity Watch out for periodic functions, i.e., those for whch f (x + a) = f (x) for some positive a. A statement of periodicity is itself a func- tional equation, and can sometimes be derived from the given functional equation. 10. Domains Watch out for multiplicative or additive functions deﬁned on the natural numbers. These functions do not generally behave the same way as multiplicative or additive functions of real numbers. 11. DON’T FORGET TO PLUG IN YOUR SOLUTION TO SEE IF IT WORKS! 1 2 Functions on the integers Notation We will write N for the positive integers, N0 = N ∪ {0}, the nonneg- ative integers, and Z for the set of all integers. Useful properties of the positive integers: 1. each of its subsets is bounded below and has a smallest element; 2. every positive integer has a unique decomposition as a product of powers of primes; 3. induction. These properties imply that functions deﬁned on the positive integers satisfy certain properties that do not apply to their real counterparts. Result If f, g: N → N satisfy f (n) ≥ g(n) for all n and moreover, f is sur- jective and g is bijective, then f = g. Proof Assume that f ̸= g, then there is a smallest value of n0 such that f (n0) > g(n0). Let M = g(n0), then A = {k|g(k) ≤ M } has exactly M el- ements since g is bijective. On the other hand, consider B = {k|f (k) ≤ M }. Since f (n0) > g(n0), it follows that n0 ̸∈ B. Also, since f (n) ≥ g(n) for all n, it follows that B ⊂ A. So B has at least one element less than A. Hence the values of f do not exhaust all numbers less than M + 1, which contradicts the surjectivity of f . We conclude that f = g. Problem 1. Find all functions f : N0 → N0 with the property that for all n ≥ 0, f (n) ≥ n + (−1) n. 2.1 Induction Functions deﬁned on the positive integers can be considered as sequences and induction is often a very useful tool. Also, plugging in small values and ﬁnding patterns works very well for this type of functions. Problem 2 Find all functions f : N → N satisfying f (1) = 1 and f (m + n) = f (m) + f (n) + mn for all m, n ∈ N. Problem 3 Find al functions f : N → N with the property that f (f (m) + f (n)) = m + n, for all m and n. Problem 4 Find all pairs of functions f, g: N0 → N0 satisfying f (n) + f (n + g(n)) = f (n + 1). 2 2.2 Domain and Range We saw already that knowing that a function is surjective can be very helpful. Here is an example that shows that determining the range of a function can also give new insight: Example Find all functions f : N0 → N0 such that f (m + f (n)) = f (f (m)) + f (n) for all m, n ≥ 0. Solution First look for easy special cases: f = 0 is a solution. In the rest of this solution we will assume that f is not identically 0. Plug in small values: for m = n = 0 we obtain f (f (0)) = f (f (0)) + f (0), so f (0) = 0 for any solution. Setting only m = 0 (or only n = 0), we ﬁnd that f (f (n)) = f (n) for all n ≥ 0. This is a situation where it is helpful to ﬁnd out what the range T of the function is. By our last observation we have that T = {n|n = f (n)}. Is T closed under addition or subtraction? Suppose that m, n ∈ T . Then f (m+n) = f (m + f (n)) = f (f (m)) + f (n) = f (m) + f (n) = m + n, so m + n ∈ T . Also, if n > m, then n = f (n) = f (m+n−m) = f (f (m)+n−m) = f (f (n−m))+f (m) = f (n − m) + m, so f (n − m) = n − m and n − m ∈ T . It is now a standard result that T consists of all multiples of its smallest positive element, say a. We conclude from this that f (n) is a multiple of a for all n ≥ 0. Write f (n) = kn · a, and consider k1, . . . , ka−1. Any postive integer m can be written as m = qa + r where 0 ≤ r < a, which can be used as follows f (m) = f (qa + r) = f (r + f (qa)) = f (f (r)) + f (qa) = kr · a + qa = (kr + q)a. Finally we need to check whether functions of this form satisfy the equation: Let m = qa + r and n = sa + t, with 0 ≤ r, t < a. Then f (m + f (n)) = f (qa + r + sa + kta) = qa + sa + kta + kra = f (qa + kra) + f (sa + t) = f (f (m)) + f (n). Hence the desired functions are f = 0 and all functions of the form described above. Problem 5 Let f : N → N be such that f (n + 1) > f (f (n)) for all n ∈ N. Prove that f (n) = n for all n ∈ N. Problem 6 Find all functions f : N → N with the property that for all n ∈ N, 1 f (1)f (2) + 1 f (2)f (3) + · · · + 1 f (n)f (n + 1) = f (f (n)) f (n + 1) . 3 3 Iterative Roots and Composition of Functions Let h(x) be a given function. Any solution to the equation f (f (x)) = h(x) is called an iterative square root of the function h(x). Analogously, a solution to the equation f n(x) = h(x) is an iterative n-th root of h(x). In the particular case where h(x) = x, this is called the Babbage equation. A solution of the Babbage equation with n = 2 is called an involution. Involutions are far from unique. Some examples are f (x) = −x, but also f (x) = a − x for any real number a, and in general, any function of the form f (x) = g−1(−g(x)), will be an involution. 3.1 Injectivity and Surjectivity Iterative roots f (x) as above inherit many properties from the function h(x). For example, if h is injective, so is f , and if h is surjective, so is f . Note that if the functions are assumed to be continous, injectivity implies strict monotonic- ity. These properties can sometimes be used to prove that a function does not have an iterative root. Proposition Let h be a one-to-one function. 1. Suppose that n is even and that there exists a pair of real numbers x < y such that h(x) > h(y). Then there is no continuous iterative nth root of h. 2. Suppose that n is odd, and that f is a continuous iterative nth root of h. Then h is continuous and strictly increasing or strictly decreasing as f is strictly increasing or strictly decreasing respectively. Proof Left to the reader. Problem 7 Prove that there exists no function f : N → N such that f (f (n)) = n + 1987 for all n ∈ N. Problem 8 Establish necessary and suﬃcient conditions on the constant k for the existence of a continuous real-valued function f (x) satisfying f (f (x)) = kx 9 for all real x. 4 3.2 Construction of Iterative Roots One way to construct iterative roots for a function h(x) is as follows. If the Abel equation g(h(x)) = g(x) + 1 has a one-to-one solution g(x), deﬁne f (x) = g−1 (g(x) + 1 n ) . It can be checked that f (x) is an iterative nth root of h(x). Another way to ﬁnd iterative roots is as follows. If g(x) is a one-to-one solution to the equation g(h(x)) = sg(x) for some s ̸= 1, then f (x) = g−1 (s 1/ng(x) ) is an iterative nth root of h(x). A completely diﬀerent approach to solving such equations is to apply f to both sides of the equation. For example the equation f n(x) = h(x) can be transformed into f (h(x)) = f (f n(x)) = f n(f (x) = h(f (x)). However, this is a place where one has to be very careful. If the original sys- tem had a solution, so will the new system. However, the converse is certainly not true, and it is very important to plug in your solution to see whether it works! Problem 9 Find all integer valued functions f (n) taking values in the integers satisfying the equation f (f (n)) = n + 1. This method can also be applied to the composition of two or more diﬀerent functions. For example, if we have the simultaneous equations f (g(x) = h1(x) and g(f (x)) = h2(x) where h1 and h2 are given, and f and g are unknown, we can apply g to the ﬁrst equation to obtain g(h1(x)) = g(f (g(x))) = h1(f (x)). Problem 10 Do there exist functions f : R → R and g: R → R such that f (g(x)) = x 2 and g(f (x)) = x 3 for all x ∈ R? Problem 11 Determine whether there exists a function f : N → N such that f (f (n)) = n2 − 19n + 99, for all positive integers n. 5 3.3 Recurrence Relations If the function h(x) is expressed in terms of f (x), it can be helpful to construct a recurrence relation: a0 = x and an = f (an−1) and use the functional equation to express an in terms of the preceding terms. Problem 12 Prove that there exists a unique function f deﬁned on the positive reals such that f (f (x)) = 6x − f (x) and f (x) > 0 for all positive x. 4 Linearization Sometimes functional equations involving f (x n) or (f (x)) n can be turned into linear functional equations with the use of logarithms and exponentials in the appropriate places. Example Find a solution to the equation f (x 2) − f (x) = 1, for x > 1. Solution Let F (x) = f (a x) for some a > 0, or equivalently, F (loga x) = f (x). Then for x > 0 the function satisﬁes F (2x) − F (x) = 1 for all x > 0. This equation reminds us of the properties of a logarithm. The solution of this second equation is F (x) = log2(x). So f (x) = log2loga(x) satisﬁes the ﬁrst equations for all a > 0. Example Find a solution to the equation f (x + 1) = (f (x)) 2. Solution Assume that f (x) ̸= 0 for all x. In order for the equation to be true for all x we have that f (x) > 0 for all x. So we can make the equation linear by setting F (x) = loga f (x) with a > 0. The equation for F (x) becomes F (x + 1) = 2F (x), which has F (x) = 2 x as a solution. So a solution to the original equation is f (x) = a a x. Problem 13 Do there exist functions f : R → R and f : R → R such that f (g(x)) = x 2 and g(f (x)) = x 4 for all x ∈ R? 6 5 Nested Radicals Problem 14 Calculate √ 1 + 2 √ 1 + 3√ 1 + 4√· · ·.
