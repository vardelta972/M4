Let c1 be a given positive integer, and let t1 = 1 c 1. For a positive integer n, let tn+1 = tn if tn = 1. Otherwise, let cn+1 be the least integer such that cn+1 > cn and tn+1 = tn + 1 cn+1 ≤ 1.

Let S be the set of all polygonal areas in the plane. Prove that there is a function f : S → (0, 1) which satisﬁes f (S1 ∪ S2) = f (S1) + f (S2) for any S1, S2 ∈ S which have common points only on their borders. 18.
