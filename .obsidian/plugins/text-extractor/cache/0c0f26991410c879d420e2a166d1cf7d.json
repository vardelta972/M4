Email me at vy- wang (at) mit.edu for errors/comments/suggestions or to discuss anything, e.g. where to look for more of these kinds of problems or topics.) (Note that most of the problems have URL links/sources, but some are missing. If you ﬁnd/create threads/papers I’m missing, please let me know and I’ll add the links.) Recommendation: Work on the topic/problems you think would help you the most.1Of course, if you don’t feel like doing geometry that’s ﬁne; there’s an algebra class tomorrow anyways. Also, while it’s important to be able to ﬁnd certain ideas on your own, I encourage you to occasionally work in small groups, both in and out of class; I think you can gain a surprising amount of intuition just by talking to others. This might be easier to coordinate out of class, especially for the harder problems. 1 Algebra/polynomials, mostly with number theory 1. (Finite ﬁelds, concrete/elementary perspective 2) Let f be a monic irreducible degree d ≥ 1 polynomial modulo p (i.e. in Fp[x]), for some prime p. (a) Show that f (x) | g(x) pd − g(x) in Fp[x] for any g ∈ Fp[x]. (b) Show that x pr − x | g(x) pr − g(x) for any g ∈ Fp[x] and positive integer r. (c) For positive integers r, show that f (x) | xpr − x modulo p if and only if d | r. (d) f (x) | g(x) p − g(x) in Fp[x] for some g ∈ Fp[x] if and only if g(x) (mod f (x)) is a constant. (e) Show that f (t) − ∏d−1 k=0(t − xpk ) ∈ (Fp[x])[t] (i.e. a polynomial in t with coeﬃcients in Fp[x]) is the zero polynomial (in t) modulo f (x), in the sense that its coeﬃcients in t are all divisible by f (x) modulo p (in Fp[x]). (f) What do these mean, abstractly? (Don’t worry if you haven’t seen this before; you can probably ﬁnd this interpretation in any standard abstract algebra book.) (g) (ELMO Shortlist 2013, W.) We deﬁne the Fibonacci sequence {Fn}n≥0 by F0 = 0, F1 = 1, and for n ≥ 2, Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2; we deﬁne the Stirling number of the second kind S(n, k) as the number of ways to partition a set of n ≥ 1 distinguishable elements into k ≥ 1 indistinguishable nonempty subsets. For every positive integer n, let tn = ∑n k=1 S(n, k)Fk. Let p ≥ 7 be a prime. Prove that tn+p2p−1 ≡ tn (mod p) for all n ≥ 1. (h) (Putnam 2011) Let p be an odd prime. Show that ∑p−1 k=0 k!xk ∈ Fp[x] has at most (p − 1)/2 roots (modulo p). 1I remember last year I felt like I wasn’t getting anything out of around half of the classes. It’s a pity if you’re not learning at least one really new/interesting thing every day. 2This is only one of many approaches to ﬁnite ﬁelds. Another common route is to consider the splitting ﬁeld of xp r − x (basically [up to isomorphism] the smallest ﬁeld where it fully factors, and we can use our intuition from complex polynomials and FTA), which behaves nicely by the Frobenius endomorphism: (x + y)pr = xp r + yp r . (In the approach above Frobenius doesn’t have as central a role.) 1 Victor Wang MOP experiment (i) (Polya, PFTB) Suppose that (an)n≥1 is a linear recurrence sequence of integers such that n divides an for all positive integers n. Prove that (an/n) is also a linear recurrence sequence. 2. Are these related? (a) (Putnam 1983 B6) Let ω be a complex (2 n + 1)th root of unity. Prove that there always exist polynomials p(x), q(x) with integer coeﬃcients such that p(ω) 2 + q(ω) 2 = −1. (b) (TSTST 2014; polynomial analog of Thue’s lemma on a ≡ ±cb (mod m)) Let F be a ﬁeld 3, M ∈ F [x] a nonzero polynomial of degree d ≥ 0, and C ∈ F [x] a polynomial relatively prime to M . Prove that there exist A, B ∈ F [x] of degree at most d 2 such that A(x)−C(x)B(x) M (x) ∈ F [x]. 3. (Putnam 1956 B7?) The nonconstant polynomials P (z) and Q(z) with complex coeﬃcients have the same set of numbers for their zeros but possibly diﬀerent multiplicities. The same is true of the polynomials P (z) + 1 and Q(z) + 1. Prove that P (z) = Q(z). 4. (I wish I knew more about valuations) (a) (Classical?) Let n be a positive integer and a a complex number. If nak is an algebraic integer for all integers k ≥ 0, show that a is an algebraic integer itself. (b) (MIT Problem-Solving Seminar) Let f (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · ∈ Z[[x]] be a formal power series with a0 ̸= 0. Suppose that f ′(x)f (x)−1 ∈ Z[[x]]. Prove or disprove that a0 | an for all n ≥ 0. (c) What’s the relation between (a) and (b)? 5. (W.) Let ω = e2πi/5 and p > 5 be a prime. Show that 1 + ωp (1 + ω)p + (1 + ω) p 1 + ωp is an integer congruent to 2 (mod p 2). 6. (More practical “valuations”, but take this with a grain of salt since I don’t fully know what I’m talking about) (a) Let ζ = e2πi/p for some prime p. From (1 − ζ)(1 − ζ 2) · · · (1 − ζ p−1) = p, what can you say about (1−ζ) p−1 p as an algebraic number? (Something similar works for prime powers, but not for other numbers.) (b) (2012-2013 Winter OMO, W.) ω is a primitive 2013th root of unity. Find the number of ordered pairs of integers (a, b) with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2013 such that (1+ω+···+ωa)(1+ω+···+ωb) 3 is an algebraic integer. (c) (1996 ISL) Let n be an even positive integer. In terms of n, determine the set of positive integers k such that k = f (x)(x + 1)n + g(x)(xn + 1) for some polynomials f, g ∈ Z[x]. (d) (St. Petersburg 2003, PFTB). Let p be a prime and let n ≥ p and a1, a2, . . . , an be integers. Deﬁne f0 = 1 and fk the number of subsets B ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} having k elements and such that p divides ∑ i∈B ai. Show that f0 − f1 + f2 − · · · + (−1)nfn is a multiple of p. (e) (China 2011) Show that for all positive integers r, v2 (∑n k=−n ( 2n n+k)k2r) ≥ v2((2n)!). (f) (W., adapted from Gabriel Dospinescu, PFTB, 2010 MR U160) Let p be a prime and let n, s be positive integers. Prove that vp (∑ p|k,0≤k≤n(−1)kks(n k)) ≥ vp(n!). (g) (Gabriel Dospinescu, PFTB) Let p > 2 be a prime number and let m and n be multiples of p, with n odd. For any function f : {1, 2, . . . , m} → {1, 2, . . . , n} satisfying ∑m k=1 f (k) ≡ 0 (mod p), consider the product ∏m k=1 f (k). Prove that the sum of these products is divisible by ( n p )m. (Yes, we can strengthen it easily.) 3We don’t lose any substance by specifying F = R. 2 Victor Wang MOP experiment 7. (PFTB-style polynomial algebra/NT; I wish I knew more commutative algebra/algebraic geometry) (a) (ELMO 2013, Andre Arslan) For what polynomials P (n) with integer coeﬃcients can a positive integer be assigned to every lattice point in R3 so that for every integer n ≥ 1, the sum of the n3 integers assigned to any n × n × n grid of lattice points is divisible by P (n)? (b) (ELMO Shortlist 2012, David Yang) Prove that if m, n are relatively prime positive integers, x m − yn is irreducible in the complex numbers. (A polynomial P (x, y) is irreducible if there do not exist nonconstant polynomials f (x, y) and g(x, y) such that P (x, y) = f (x, y)g(x, y) for all x, y.) (c) (ELMO 2012; related to Newton polygons; two-variable case of Eherenfeucht criterion) Let f, g be polynomials with complex coeﬃcients such that gcd(deg f, deg g) = 1. Suppose that there exist polynomials P (x, y) and Q(x, y) with complex coeﬃcients such that f (x) + g(y) = P (x, y)Q(x, y). Show that one of P and Q must be constant. (d) Prove that C[x, y] has unique factorization into irreducible (two-variable complex) polynomials (up to constant). (It suﬃces to show every irreducible polynomial is prime, i.e. if some nonconstant p is irreducible and p | ab, then p | a or p | b.) (e) (Rookie Team Contest/ELMO Shortlist 2014, Yang Liu; AM-GM polynomial irreducibility) Find all positive integers n ≥ 2 for which the n-variable polynomial xn 1 + xn 2 + · · · + x n n − nx1x2 · · · xn is reducible over the complex numbers (formally, in C[x1, x2, . . . , xn]). (f) (Ineﬀective B´ezout’s theorem) Prove that two relatively prime polynomials f, g ∈ C[x, y] share ﬁnitely many common zeros in the complex plane. (g) i. (Artin’s Algebra) Let x(t), y(t) be complex polynomials, not both constant. Show that there exists a polynomial m ∈ C[x, y] such that for f ∈ C[x, y], we have m | f if and only if f (x(t), y(t)) = 0 for all t ∈ C. ii. The following can be done in more than one order: (i) Prove that m is irreducible in C[x, y]. (ii) Prove that m is unique up to a constant factor. (iii) For a point (a, b) ∈ C2, prove that m(a, b) = 0 if and only if there exists t ∈ C such that (x(t), y(t)) = (a, b). 8. (a) (Putnam 2012 B6) Let p be an odd prime number such that p ≡ 2 (mod 3). Deﬁne a permutation π of the residue classes modulo p by π(x) ≡ x3 (mod p). Show that π is an even permutation if and only if p ≡ 3 (mod 4). (b) (2013-2013 Winter OMO, W.) Find the remainder when ∏100 i=0(1 − i 2 + i4) is divided by 101. (c) (Noga Alon, Jean Bourgain; TST 2014) For a prime p, a subset S of residues modulo p is called a sum-free multiplicative subgroup of Fp if (i) there is a nonzero residue α modulo p such that S = { 1, α1, α2, . . . } (all considered mod p), and (ii) there are no a, b, c ∈ S (not necessarily distinct) such that a + b ≡ c (mod p). Prove that for every integer N , there is a prime p and a sum-free multiplicative subgroup S of Fp such that |S| ≥ N . (d) The TST problem, but with (ii) replaced by (ii’) 0 /∈ a1S + a2S + · · · + akS, for ﬁxed integers ai with nonzero sum. (In (ii) these integers are +1, +1, −1.) (e) (PFTB, AMM 10748) Let p, q be prime numbers and let r be a positive integer such that q | p − 1, q ∤ r, and p > rq−1. Let a1, . . . , ar be integers such that a (p−1)/q 1 + · · · + a (p−1)/q r is a multiple of p. Prove that at least one of the ai’s is a multiple of p. 9. (a) (ELMO 2012, Bobby Shen) A diabolical combination lock has n dials (each with c possible states), where n, c > 1. The dials are initially set to states d1, d2, . . . , dn, where 0 ≤ di ≤ c − 1 for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Unfortunately, the actual states of the dials (the di’s) are concealed, and the initial settings of the dials are also unknown. On a given turn, one may advance each dial by an integer 3 Victor Wang MOP experiment amount ci (0 ≤ ci ≤ c − 1), so that every dial is now in a state d ′ i ≡ di + ci (mod c) with 0 ≤ d′ i ≤ c − 1. After each turn, the lock opens if and only if all of the dials are set to the zero state; otherwise, the lock selects a random integer k and cyclically shifts the di’s by k (so that for every i, di is replaced by di−k, where indices are taken modulo n). Show that the lock can always be opened, regardless of the choices of the initial conﬁguration and the choices of k (which may vary from turn to turn), if and only if n and c are powers of the same prime. (b) (Q[x] representations of n-sequences (mod m), W.) Let n, m > 1 be positive integers. We say a sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ)n is satisﬁed by the integer-valued polynomial f ∈ Q[x] if f (x) ≡ ai (mod m) whenever x ≡ i (mod n). (i) Show that n and m are powers of the same prime if and only if every sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ) n is satisﬁed by some polynomial f (x). (ii) If n = pi and m = pj for a prime p and two positive integers i, j, ﬁnd (in terms of p, i, j) the smallest positive integer M such that every sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ) n is satisﬁed by a polynomial f (x) of degree at most M . 2 Analytic-ﬂavored stuﬀ 1.

Prove that each integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of pairwise distinct beautiful numbers. (f) (heard from Lawrence Sun, who heard from Victor Reis?) Suppose we have a polynomial f with integer coeﬃcients such that f (p) is a square for all primes p. Does it follow that f is the square of some polynomial? (g) (TST Proposal, Gabriel Carroll) (a, Gabriel Carroll) Find all functions f : N → Z such that f (m) − f (n) | m 2 − n2 for all positive integers m, n.

Prove that there exists a polynomial g ∈ Q[x] such that f (g(x)) = f (x) k for all real x. (b, I’m pretty sure this works/is a direct generalization but haven’t checked too carefully, W.)

Is∑∞ n=1 an necessarily divergent? 5 Victor Wang MOP experiment 10. (Continuous interpolation/extension: constraint on rationals, discussed at MOP 2014. The reason for having (a) is that there’s at least one nice explicit construction that fails badly for (b).) (a) (Linus Hamilton) Prove that there exists a continuous function f : R → R with f (0) /∈ Z such that for any nonzero rational q = a/b ̸= 0 in reduced form, f (q) is a multiple of 1/b. (b) For any nonzero rational q = a/b ̸= 0 in reduced form, let Sq be a doubly-inﬁnite set of reals with gaps at most 1/b.

(RMM 2012, Ben Elliott; also in combinatorics) Each positive integer is coloured red or blue. A function f from the set of positive integers to itself has the following two properties: (a) if x ≤ y, then f (x) ≤ f (y); and (b) if x, y and z are (not necessarily distinct) positive integers of the same colour and x + y = z, then f (x) + f (y) = f (z). Prove that there exists a positive number a such that f (x) ≤ ax for all positive integers x. 16.

(ELMO Shortlist 2012, David Yang; also in geometry) We have a compact set in Rn. (For our purposes, just take compact to mean “closed and bounded”; closed basically means “contains the boundary.”) We consider the set of directions (formally, unit vectors in the plane). Such a direction is called good if there is exactly one point in the set that is furthest along that direction. (For example, a northernmost point.) (a) Prove that there exists a good direction.

(Real roots and interlacing, HroK’s blog4) The intermediate value theorem and Rolle’s theorem are ubiquitous principles in the analysis of real roots of continuous and diﬀerentiable functions, respectively. As you are likely familiar with the most standard uses of these theorems, we brieﬂy discuss the phe- nomenon of interlacing functions f, g with alternating real roots. (For a much more uniﬁed coverage, see Steve Fisk’s paper Polynomials, roots, and interlacing.) In particular, we look at polynomial recurrences, which provide some of the most natural examples of interlacing. (a) Let’s ﬁrst give an example: The nth Hermite polynomial Hn(x) = (−1)nex2 dn dxn e−x2 has all real roots (by induction one easily veriﬁes that Hn is a polynomial of degree n). Indeed, we induct to show that for every n ≥ 1, hn(x) = d n dxn e−x2 has exactly n roots, where the base case is obvious. But if for some n > 1 we assume that hn−1(x) has n − 1 real roots a1 < · · · < an−1, then noting that ±∞ are also roots and hn = d dx hn−1, we’re done by Rolle’s theorem. Obseve that hn, hn−1 interlace, i.e. the roots of hn−1 lie in between those of hn. Of course, there are several variations on the same idea. For example, if we have a recurrence like pn(x) = xpn−1(x) + pn−2(x) and we know that pn−1, pn−2 interlace, then under some mild conditions we can show via the IVT that pn, pn−1 and pn, pn−2 also interlace (of course, we need pn, pn−1, pn−2 to have degrees within one of each other). This is in essence the idea behind, for instance, Sturm’s theorem. Now for some problems, (very) roughly arranged in diﬃculty order!

Alice and Bob play the following game, taking alternating turns, with Alice playing ﬁrst. The playing area consists of n spaces, arranged in a line. Initially all spaces are empty. At each turn, a player either (a) places a stone in an empty space, or (b) removes a stone from a nonempty space s, places a stone in the nearest empty space to the left of s (if such a space exists), and places a stone in the nearest empty space to the right of s (if such a space exists). Furthermore, a move is permitted only if the resulting position has not occurred previously in the game. A player loses if he or she is unable to move. Assuming that both players play optimally throughout the game, what moves may Alice make on her ﬁrst turn? 10. Some graph theory.

All they have to light the plane are k lighthouses that run on cooking oil where k ≥ 1 is a positive integer. They can be kept going indeﬁnitely, the Mopoks love their french fries, but each lighthouse can only illuminate a sector of 360/k degrees. The lamp of each lighthouse can be rotated but it must be ﬁxed before the light is turned on. Can the lights be rotated so that the whole plane is covered? (The lighthouses positions are given, you don’t get to choose where to put them.) (Assuming that k is even makes the problem a bit easier.) 14","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
