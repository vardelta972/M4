Diophantine analysis can get very complicated 1, so we will restrict ourselves to the most common elementary techniques in this handout. 1 Prime Factorization Observing the exponents in the prime factorization of a number can yield much useful information. The following examples illustrate this: Example 1.1. Find the number of triples of integers (x, y, z) such that xyz = 720. Solution. The prime factorization of 720 is 2 4 · 3 2 · 5. If we look only at the prime factors of x, y, z, we see that the exponents of 2 in the factorizations of x, y, z must sum to 4, the exponents of 3 must sum to 2, and the exponents of 5 must sum to 0. The number of possible triples (a, b, c) that correspond to the exponents of 2 in the prime factorizations of x, y, z is simply the number of number of nonnegative solutions to a + b + c = 4, which is 15. Similarly, we ﬁnd that the number of triples corresponding to the exponent of 3 is 6, and the number of triples corresponding to the exponent of 5 is 3. Because the exponents of 2, 3, and 5 are all independent of one another, the number of pairs (x, y, z) is simply 15 · 6 · 3 = 270. Example 1.2. (Four numbers theorem) If ab = cd for positive integers a, b, c, d, show that there exist positive integers x, y, z, w such that a = xy, b = zw, c = xz, and d = yw, where gcd(y, z) = 1. Solution. As before, it’s enough to just consider the exponents of primes individually. For a ﬁxed prime p, we have vp(a) + vp(b) = vp(c) + vp(d), and we need to ﬁnd x, y, z, w such that vp(x) + vp(y) = vp(a), vp(z) + vp(w) = vp(b), vp(x) + vp(z) = vp(c), and vp(y) + vp(w) = vp(d), where min(vp(y), vp(z)) = 0. Now it’s just a simple system of equations; see if you can ﬁnish the argument. There’s also another perspective to this problem. Rewrite the equation as a/c = d/b = y/z, where gcd(y, z) = 1 gives us the fraction a/c = d/b in reduced form. Then because its in reduced form, (a, c) = (xy, xz) for some x (when we reduce a fraction, we take out the common divisors of the numerator and denominator). Similarly, (d, b) = (wy, wz) for some integer w. Example 1.3. If two numbers a and b are relatively prime, and ab is a perfect kth power, then a and b are both perfect kth powes. Solution. A number is a kth power if and only if each exponent in its prime factorization is divisible by k. If the prime factors of a are entirely distinct from the prime factors of b, and the exponents of each of the prime factors of ab are multiples of k, then the exponents of each of the prime factors of both a and b must be multiples of k as well; thus, a and b are both perfect squares. 1One well-known example is Fermat’s Last Theorem, which states that an + bn = cn has no solutions in positive integers a, b, c for all integers n > 2. Although Pierre de Fermat claimed to have “discovered a truly marvelous proof of this, which, however, the margin is not large enough to contain,” proof eluded the best of mathematicians for over three centuries until 1994, when the British mathematician Andrew Wiles ﬁnally prevailed using the advanced machinery of elliptic curves and modular forms. 1 Victor Wang Diophantine Equations CMT: 2011-2012 The following is an example of how the above can be applied: Example 1.4. Solve y2 = x3 − x over the integers. Solution. Factor x3 − x as x(x2 − 1). Because x and x2 − 1 are relatively prime integers that multiply to a square, they must both be squares. Thus, x2 − 1 must be a square, say, x2 − 1 = z2. Then (x − z)(x + z) = 1, which can only happen when x = ±1 and y = 0. 2 Modular arithmetic Sometimes, it’s diﬃcult to analyze an equation just by algebraic manipulation, and we may need an extra boost. In these cases, it’s often helpful to take it mod something, reducing our analysis down to a ﬁnite number of possibilities, so sometimes, when only a few cases are possible, we can get a lot of information (e.g. if we take an both sides of an equation modulo m, we may be able to place important restrictions on the variables modulo m). Example 2.1. Solve x2 + y2 = 1003 over the positive integers. Solution. Taking this equation mod 4, we have x2 + y2 ≡ 3 (mod 4). Since x 2 and y2 must be congruent to either 0 or 1 mod 4, their sum must be congruent to either 0, 1, or 2 mod 4. In particular, it cannot be congruent to 3 mod 4, so the equation has no solutions. Here, we had squares (mod 4) (i.e. quadratic residues). In general, if you have squares, you should consider modulo powers of 2 or primes, because there are relatively few quadratic residues and thus there are fewer possibilities and more restrictions (e.g. only 2 possibilities modulo 4). For other dth powers in general, it turns out that primes p congruent to 1 (mod d) work well. For instance, the only cubic residues modulo 7 are 0, 1, −1. Keep in mind that sometimes (especially parity) mods will be only a small part of the problem, but they can still make a big diﬀerence. Example 2.2. Do there exist integers x1, x2, . . . , x2011 such that x7 1 + x7 2 + · · · + x7 2011 = 123 x1 + x2 + · · · + x2011 = 321 Solution. There do not exist such integers. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that a solution exists. By Fermat’s little theorem, x7 i ≡ xi (mod 7). Thus, we have 321 = x1 + x2 + · · · + x2011 ≡ x7 1 + x 7 2 + · · · + x7 2011 = 123 (mod 7), which is false. 3 Algebraic Manipulation Many times, Diophantine equations can be solved or simpliﬁed signiﬁcantly through the use of algebraic manipulation. Example 3.1. Suppose that a ≡ 1 (mod p). Show that ap ≡ 1 (mod p2). Solution. Let a = pk + 1. Then by the binomial theorem, a p − 1 = (1 + pk)p − 1 = (p 1 )pk + (p 2 )p 2k2 + · · · ≡ (p 1 )pk = p 2k ≡ 0 (mod p2), as desired. Example 3.2. Find all pairs of integers (x, y) with 0 < x < y and xy = yx. 2 Victor Wang Diophantine Equations CMT: 2011-2012 Solution. There exists a solution to this using just number theory. We will not give it. Instead, we will use calculus. Rearrange this to x 1 x = y 1 y . Let f (x) = x 1 x . We have f ′(x) = −x 1 x −2(ln x − 1). Thus, f (x) is decreasing for x > e and increasing for x < e. Thus, if f (x) = f (y) and x ̸= y, we must have x < e < y. This means that x = 1 or x = 2. Consider the equation as xy = yx again. If x = 1, we must have y = 1 as well, which contradicts x < 1. Thus, we need x = 2, so 2y = y2. We can show by induction that 2 y > y2 for y > 4, so either y = 3 or y = 4. The solution y = 3 fails, so we must have y = 4. Thus, our only solution is (2, 4). Example 3.3. Solve y2 = x2 + y3x − 1 over the positive integers. Solution. This is a simple instance where the quadratic formula is the way to go, because it forces powerful restrictions upon us. Fix y. Then we have a quadratic equation x 2 + y3z − (1 + y2) = 0. We need the discriminant to be a perfect square, or else by the quadratic formula, x is irrational. So ∆x = (y3) 2 − 4(1)(−1 − y2) = y6 + 4y2 + 4 = t 2 for some positive integer t. Once again, we use the discreteness of the integers: it’s obvious that t > y3. But we’re working with integers, so this means that t ≥ y3 + 1, so y6 + 4y2 + 4 = t 2 ≥ (y3 + 1)2 = y6 + 2y3 + 1. Clearly, this inequality cannot hold for large y, because once we subtract y6 from both sides, the RHS is cubic in y and the LHS is quadratic in y. In fact, it holds only for y = 1 and y = 2 (prove this yourself!). If y = 1, then we get x2 + x − 2 = 0, and y = 2, then we get x2 + 8x − 5 = 0. Only x2 + x − 2 has integer roots, so our only solution is (1, 1). 4 Pythagorean Triples A Pythagoran triple is a triple of positive integers (a, b, c) such that a 2 + b2 = c2. For example, (3,4,5), (6,8,10), (5,12,13), and (8,15,17) are Pythagorean triples. The Pythagorean triples can be classiﬁed as follows: Theorem 4.1. Suppose (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple. Then (a, b, c) = (k · 2mn, k(m 2 − n2), k(m 2 + n2)) or (k(m2 − n 2), k · 2mn, k(m2 + n 2)) for some positive integer k and some relatively prime integers m, n. Solution. If a, b, c share a common factor d > 1, then if (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, (a/d, b/d, c/d) is also a Pythagorean triple. Thus, we can assume that gcd(a, b, c) = 1. Taking the equation mod 4, we now see that c has to be odd, and exactly one of a, b has to be even. Without loss of generality, let a be even. We will show that (a, b, c) = (2mn, m 2 − n2, m 2 + n2) for some relatively prime integers (m, n), which will complete the proof of this problem. Let a = 2a0. Rearrange a 2 + b2 = c2 as 4a 2 0 = c2 − b 2 = (c − b)(c + b). If a prime p divides both c − b and c + b, it must divide (c − b) + (c + b) = 2c and (c + b) − (c − b) = 2b. If p divides b and c, p divides a2 = c 2 − b 2 as well, meaning gcd(a, b, c) > 1, a contradiction. Thus, we would need p = 2. Since c and b are both odd, c − a and c + b are both even. Thus, (c − b)/2 and (c + b)/2 are coprime. Since a 2 0 − ((c − b)/2)((c + b)/2), (c − b)/2 and (c + b)/2 must both themselves be squares. Thus, c + b = 2m2 and c − b = 2n2 for some integers m, n. Solving, we have c = m2 + n 2, b = m 2 − n2, and a = 2a0 = 2mn, as desired. 5 Inﬁnite Descent The method of inﬁnite descent is essentially an extremal argument: given a solution (sometimes we take it to be minimal), we try to reduce it to either restrict the possible minimal solutions or show that there are no (nontrivial) solutions in the ﬁrst place. 3 Victor Wang Diophantine Equations CMT: 2011-2012 Example 5.1. Show that √2 is irrational. Solution. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that a/b = √2 for some positive integers a, b with a + b as small as possible. Then a 2 = 2b2, so by Euclid’s lemma 2 | a. But then letting c = a/2, we have 2c 2 = b 2, so b/c = √2, contradicting the minimality of a + b (since c + b < a + b). A special type of inﬁnite descent is known as Vieta jumping, or root ﬂipping, where we use in particular the fact that for a quadratic with integer coeﬃcients, either both roots are integers or both roots are not integers (i.e. if one root is an integer, the other must be as well). Example 5.2. (IMO 1988.6) Let a, b be positive integers such that ab+1 | a 2+b 2. Prove that (a 2+b2)/(ab+1) is a perfect square. Solution. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists k > 0 not a perfect square such that (a 2 + b2)/(ab + 1) = k; WLOG take a + b to be minimal among all such pairs (a, b). Suppose WLOG that a ≥ b > 0. Then a 2 − (kb)a + (b2 − k) = 0. By Vieta’s formulas, the product of the roots of the quadratic x2 −(kb)x+(b2 −k) = 0 are a and a ′ with a ′ = kb−a ∈ Z and a ′ = (b2 −k)/a < a. If a ′ > 0, then a ′ +b < a+b contradicts minimality, so a ′ ≤ 0. But k is not a perfect square, so aa ′ = b 2 −k ̸= 0 =⇒ a ′ < 0 =⇒ a ′b < 0, so 0 < a ′2 + b 2 = k(a ′b + 1) ≤ 0, which is absurd. 6 Linear Diophantines A linear Diophantine equation is of the form a1x1 + · · · + anxn = b for some integers a1, . . . , an, b, where WLOG the ai’s are all nonzero (or else we can just take the zeros out). Bzout’s identity (and its generalizations) show that solutions (x1, . . . , xn) exist to such a system if and only if gcd(a1, . . . , an) | b. (See if you can prove this using induction on n ≥ 1.) A simple implication of this is the Frobenius coin problem: for all suﬃciently large integers b > N divisible by gcd(a1, . . . , an), there exist nonnegative integers (x1, . . . , xn) that solve the equation. Example 6.1. (Chicken McNugget theorem) Let a, b be relatively prime positive integers. Then for every integer m, exactly one of m and ab − a − b − m is representable as a nonnegative linear combination of a and b. As a corollary, we have that ab − a − b is the largest unrepresentable number (since 0 is obviously representable). Solution. Hint: show that they are not both representable, but they are also not both unrepresentable. Use the fact that ax + by = a(x − tb) + b(x + ta). 7 Problems These are roughly ordered by diﬃculty (very roughly at the end).
