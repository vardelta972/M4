Speaking with the author's words: \" Myriads of inequalities and inequality techniques appear nowadays in books and contests. Trying to learn all of them by heart is hopeless and useless. Alternatively, this books objective is to help you understand how inequalities work and how you can set up your own techniques on the spot, not just remember the ones you already learned. To get such a pragmatic mastery of inequalities, you surely need a comprehensive knowledge of basic inequalities at first. The goal of the first part of the book (chapters 1-8) is to lay down the foundations you will need in the second part (chapter g), where solving problems will give you some practice. It is important to try and solve the problems by yourself as hard as you can, since only practice will develop your understanding, especially the problems in the second part. On that note, this books objective is not to present beautiful solutions to the problems, but to present such a variety of problems and techniques that will give you the best kind of practice.\" It is true that there are very many books on inequalities and you have all the right to be bored and tired of them. But we tell you that this is not the case with this one. Just read the proof of Nesbitt's Inequality in the very beginning of the material, and you will understand exactly what we mean. Now that you read it you should trust us that you will find III this book new and beautiful proofs for old inequalities and this alone can be a good reason to read it, or even just to take a quick look at it. You will find a first chapter dedicated to the classical inequalities: from AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwartz inequalities to the use of derivatives, to Chebyshev'S and rearrangements' inequalities, you will find here the most important and beautiful stuff related to these classical topics. And then you have spectacular topics: you have symmetric inequalities, and inequalities with 5 6 Preface - convex functions and even a less known method of balancing coefficients. And the author would add \" You may think they are too simple to have a serious review. However, I emphasize that this review is essential in any inequalities book. Why? Because they make at least half of what you need to know in the realm of inequalities. Furthermore, really understanding them at a deep level is not easy at all. Again, this is the goal of the .. first part of the book, and it is the foremost goal of this book.\" Every topic is described through various and numerous examples taken from many sources, especially from math contests around the world, from recent contests and ~ recent books, or from (more or less) specialized sites on the Internet, which makes the book very lively and interesting to read for those who are involved in such activities, students and teachers from all over the world . The author seems to be very interested in creating new inequalities: this may be seen in the whole presentation of the material, but mostly in the special chapter 2 (dedicated to this topic), or, again, in the end of the book. Every step in every proof is explained in such a manner that it seems very natural to think of; this also comes from the author's longing for. a deep understanding of inequalities, longing that he passes on to the reader. Many exercises are left for those who are interested and, as a real professional solver, the author always advises us to try to find our own solution first, and only then rearl his one. We will finish this introduction with the words of the author: \"Don't let the problems overwhelm you, though they are quite impressive prob- lems, study applications of the first five basic inequalities mentioned above, plus the Abel formula, symmetric inequalities and the derivative method. Now relax with the AM-GM inequality - the foundational brick of inequalities.\" Mircea Lascu, Marian Tetiva Acknow ledgernents Let me first present my most faithful gratefulness to my professors from the Viet- namese National University of Science, Nguyen Duy Tien, Pham Van Hung and Nguyen Vu Long, who encouraged me throughout the time I have been writing my book and proofread it from the first version to the last one. In addition, my integral heartfelt thanks are sent to all my best friends who did their best on the book, and gave me many nice and beautiful inequalities along with their intelligent solutions.

I thank Vasile Cirtoaje, Michael Rozenberg, Gabriel Dospinescu and. Mircea Lascu, well-known inequality solvers, who gave me a lot of inspiration on inequalities. They all helped improved the structure and flavor of the book, and made it become more colorful and diversified . Also, many inequalities are collected from the famous forum of mathematics www.mathlinks.ro. I want to send my best thanks to the authors of the collected problems in the book and all other Mathlinks members who always inspired me in creating and solving other problems through their clever ideas. Many of the inequal- ities are collected from various Olympiad sources (mathematics contests all over the world) and the following mathematics magazines • The Vietnamese mathematics and Youth Maga;zines (MYM). 7 8 Acknowledgements - • The Crux Mathematicorum (Crux). Above all, let me express my deepest thanks to Pachitariu Marius who helped me editing the book concerning both the language and also the mathematical exprima- tions. In the end I would like to thank to my wonderful mother, father and sister for your kindest help. You always encouraged me, gave me the strength, and went with me closely to the last day I finished writing the book. Thanks to my friend Ha Viet Phuong, Nguyen Thanh Huyen, Duong Thi Thuong, Ngo Minh Thanh, and also my mother, who helped me a lot to check the English and other spelling mistake. The book is dedicated to all of you.

For all positive real numbers aI, a2, ... , an, the following inequality holds Equality occurs if and only if al = a2 = ... = an· PROOF. The inequality is clearly true for n = 2. If it is true for n numbers, it will be true for 2n numbers because Thus the inequality is true for every number n that is an exponent of 2. Suppose that the inequality is true for n numbers. We then choose s an = -- ; s = al + a2 + ... + an-l n-1 According to the inductive hypothesis, we get s Vala2 .. ~an-l . s s + -- ~ n n :::} S ~ (n - 1) n-~ala2 ... an-l. n-1 n-1 Therefore if the inequality is true for n numbers, it will be true for n - 1 numbers . By induction (Cauchy induction), the inequality is true for every natural number n. Equality occurs if and only if al = a2 = ... = an. v 15 16 Chapter 1. The basic Inequalities - As a matter of fact, the AM-GM inequality is the most famous and wide-applied theorem. It is also indispensable in proving inequalities. Consider its strong applica- tions through the following famous inequalities. Proposition 1 (Nesbitt's inequality). (a). Prove that for all non-negative real num- bers a, b, c, abc 3 --+--+-->-. b+c c+a a+b - 2 (b). Prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c, d, abc d -- + -- + -- + -- > 2. b+c c+d d+a a+b- PROOF. (a) . Consider the following expressions abc S=--+--+--- b+c c+a a+b' b c a M=--+--+-- . b+c c+a a+b' cab N=--+--+-- . b+c c+a a+b' We have of course M + N = 3.

Consider the following expressions abc d S=--+--+--+-- . b+c c+d d+a a+b' b c d a M=--+--+--+-- . b+c c+d d+a a+b' c dab N=--+--+--+-_· b+c c+d d+a a+b' We have M + N = 4. According to AM-GM, we get M+S a+b b+c c+d d+a = b+c + c+d + d+a + a+b 24; N+S_a+c b+d a+c b+d -b+c+c+d+d+a+a+b a+c a+c b+d b+d =b+c+a+d+c+d+a+b > 4(a + c) + 4(b + d) = 4 . -a+b+c+d a+b+c+d ' 1.0. AM-GM inequality • Therefore M + N + 2S 2: 8, and S 2: 2. The equality holds if a a = e, b = d = 0 or a = e = 0, b = d. v 17 b e = d or Proposition 2 (Weighted AM-GM inequality). Suppose that aI, a2, ... , an are positive real numbers. If n non-negative real numbers Xl, X2, ... , Xn have sum 1 then SOLUTION. The proof of this inequality is entirely similar to the one for the classical AM-GM inequality. However, in the case n = 2, we need a more detailed proof (because the inequality is posed for real exponents). We have to prove that if X, y 2: 0, X + y = 1 and a, b > 0 then The most simple way to solve this one is to consider it for rational numbers x, y, m then take a limit. Certainly, if x, yare rational numbers : X = and y = m+n n (m, n EN), the problem is true according to AM-GM inequality m+n' If x, yare real numbers, there exist two sequences of rational numbers (rn)n~o and (sn)n~O for which rn --+ X, Sn --+ y, rn + Sn = 1. Certainly or Taking the limit when n --+ +00, we have ax + by 2: aX bY. v The AM-GM inequality is very simple; however, it plays a major part in many in- equalities in Mathematics Contests. Some examples follow to help you get acquainted with this important inequality_ Example 1.1.1. Let a, b, e be positive real numbers with sum 3. Prove that Va + Vb + Vc 2: ab + be + ca. 18 Chapter 1.

Certainly, the problem follows the inequality x y Z x+y+z -+-+->-~- y Z x - {jxyz ' which is true by AM-GM because 19 3 (~ + ~ + .:.) = (2X + ~) + (2Y + .:.) + (2Z +~) > ~ + ~ + ~. y z x y z z x x y - ~xyz ~xyz <)xyz V Example 1.1.4. Let a, b, e, d be positive real numbers. Prove that 16(abe + bed + eda + dab) ~ (a + b + e + d)4. SOLUTION. Applying AM-GM for two numbers, we obtain 16(abe + bed + eda + dab) = 16ab(e + d) + 16ed(a + b) ~ 4(a + b)2(e+ d) + 4(e+ d)2(a + b) = 4( a + b + e + d) (a + b) ( e + d) ~ (a + b + e + d)3. The equality holds for a = b = e = d. V Example 1.1.5. Suppose that a, b, e are three side-lengths of a triangle with perimeter 3.

Comment. 1. By a similar approach, we can prove the similar inequality for five numbers.

I conjectured the following inequality * Let a}, a2, ... , an be positive real numbers. Prove or disprove that Example 1.1.16. Determine the least M for which the inequality holds for all real numbers a, band c. (IMO 2006, A3) SOLUTION. Denote x = a - b, y = b - c, z = c - a and s = a + b + c. Rewrite the inequality in the following form in which s, x, y, z are arbitrary real numbers with x -I- y + z = o. 26 Chapter 1. The basic Inequalities - The fact that s is an independent variable suggests constructing a relationship between xyz and x 2 + y2 + z2 at first. There are two numbers, say x and y, with the same sign. Assume that x, y ~ 0 (the case x, y ~ 0 is proved similarly). By AM-GM, we have (x + y)3 Isxyzl = Isxy(x + y)1 ~ lsi' 4 (1) with equality for x = y. Let t = x + y. Applying AM-GM again, we get and therefore 4J2lslt3~ (s2+~t2)2 ~(s2+x2+y2+z2)2 (2) Combining (1) and (2), we conclude 1 Isxyzl < __ (s2 + x2 + y2 + z2)2. - 16J2 gJ2 gJ2 . This implies that M ~ 32' To show that M = 32 18 the best constant, we need to find (s, x, y, z), or in other words, (a, b, c), for which equality holds. A simple calculation gives (a, b, c) = (1 - Jz, 1, 1 + ~). V' The most important principle when we use AM-GM is to choose the suitable coefficients such that equality can happen. For instance, in example 1.1.2, using AM- GM inequality in the following form is a common mistake (because the equality can not hold) x 3 (1 + y)(l + z) + (y + 1) + (z + 1) ~ 3x. It's hard to give a fixed form of AM-GM for every problem. You depend on your own intuition but it's also helpful to look for the equality case. For example, in the above problem, guessing that the equality holds for x = y = z = 1, we will choose the coefficient ~ in order to make the terms equal x 3 Y + 1 ;+1 3x (1 + y)(l + z) + -8- + -8- ~ 4' For problems where the equality holds for variables that are equal to each other, it seems quite easy to make couples before we use AM-GM. For non-symmetric 1.0. AM-GM inequality 27 problems, this method sometimes requires a bit of flexibility (see agam examples 1.1.13,1.1.14 and 1.1.16). Sometimes you need to make a system of equations and solve it in order to find when equality Uolds (this method, called \"balancing coefficients\", will be discussed in part 6). 1.2 The Cauchy Reverse Technique In the following section, we will connect AM-GM to a particular technique, called the Cauchy reverse technique. The unexpected simplicity but great effectiveness are special advantages of this technique. Warm up with the following example. Example 1.2.1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers with sum 3. Prove that abc 3 --+ + >-1+b2 1+c2 1+a 2 -2' (Bulgaria TST 2003) SOLUTION. In fact, it's impossible to use AM-GM for the denominators because the sign will be reversed abc <!:.. .!!..- ~ > ~ ?I 1 + b2 + 1 + c2 + 1 + a2 - 2b + 2c + 2a - 2 .. However, we can use the same application in another appearance a ab2 ab2 ab -- =a--- >a-- =a--. 1 + b2 1 + b2 - 2b 2 The inequality becomes \"\" _a_ > \"\" a - ~ \"\" ab > ~ L.t 1 + b2 - L.t 2 L.t - 2' eye eye eye since 3 (2: ab) ~ (1: a) 2 = 9. This ends the proof. Equality holds for a = b = c = 1. Comment. A similar method proves the following result * Suppose that a, b, c, d are four positive real numbers with sum 4. Prove that a _b_ c d >2 1 + b2 + 1 + c2 + 1 + d2 + 1 + a2 - • V' This solution seems to be magic: two apparently similar approachs of applying AM-GM bring about two different solutions; one is incorrect but one is correct, 28 Chapter 1. The basic Inequalities - So, where does this magic occur? Amazingly enough, it all comes from a simple representation of a fraction as a difference a ab2 ---a--- 1 + b2 - 1 + b2 ' With the minus sign before the new fraction 1 ~2b2' we can use AM-GM inequal- ity in the denominator 1 + b2 freely but we get the correct sign. This is the key feature of this impressive technique: you change a singular expression into a difference of two expressions, then estimate the second expression of this difference, which has a minus sign.

We have The equality holds if and only if (al,a2, ... ,an) and (blo b2, ...• bn) are proportional (there is a real number k for which ai = kbi for all i E {1,2, ... ,n}). PROOF. I will give popular solutions to this theorem. First solution. (using quadratic form) Consider the following function which is rewritten as Since f(x) 2: 0 \\:Ix E~, we must have !::.., SO or The equality holds if the equation f(x) = 0 has at least one root, or in other words (al,a2, ... ,a n) and (bl .b2, ... ,bn ) are proportional. • 33 34 Chapter 2. The basic Inequalities - Second solution. (using an identity) The following identity is called Cauchy- Schwarz expansion.

(using AM-GM) This proof is used to prove HOlder inequality as well. Notice that, according to AM-GM inequality, we have a 2 b2 ~ __ ~~t~ __ ~+ l at + a~ + ... + a~ bt + b~ + ... + b~ > 21a ibil - J(ai +a~ + ... + a~)(b~ + b~ + ... + b~) Let i run from 1 to n and sum up all of these estimations. We get the conclusion. Which is basic inequality? The common answer is AM-GM. But what is the most original of the basic inequalities? I incline to answer Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Why? Because Cauchy-Schwartz is so effective in proving symmetric inequalities, especially inequalities in three variables. It often provides pretty solutions as well. The following corollaries can contribute to the many applications it has. Corollary 1. (Schwarz inequality). For any two sequences of real numbers (aI,a2, ... ,an) and (b 1 ,b2, ... ,bn ), (bi > 0 Vi E {1,2, ... ,n}), we have a~ a~ a~ > (al + a2 + ... + an)2 -b +-b +\"'+--b - b..J.. b' 1 2 n 1 +\"tI2 + ... + n SOLUTION. This result is directly obtained from Cauchy-Schwarz. Corollary 2. For every two sequences of real numbers (al, a2, ... , an) and (bl ,b2, ... ,bn), we always have PROOF. By a simple induction, it suffices to prove the problem in the case n = 2. In this case, the inequality becomes 2.0. Cauchy-Schwarz and Holder inequalities 35 Squaring and reducing similar term, it simply becomes Cauchy-Schwarz Certainly, the equality occurs iff (ab a2, ... , an) and (b1 , b2, ... , bn ) are proportional. v Corollary 3. For any sequence of real numbers al,a2, ... ,an we have • PROOF. Use Cauchy-Schwarz for the following sequences of n terms v If applying AM-GM inequality is reduced to gathering equal terms, (in the analysis of the equality case) the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is somewhat more flexible and generous. The following problems are essential and necessary because they include a lot of different ways of applying Cauchy-Schwarz accurately and effectively. Example 2.1.1. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers. Prove that a2 - be b2 - ca c2 - ab 2a2 + b2 + c2 + 2b2 + c2 + a2 + 2c2 + a2 + b2 2:: o. (Pham Kim Hung) SOLUTION.

Like with the AM-GM inequality, there is no fixed way of applying the Cauchy- Schwarz inequality. It depends on the kind of problem and on how flexible you are in using this inequality. A consistent application of Cauchy-Schwarz, the Holder inequality is, in fact, a typical extension. Although Holder is somehow neglected in the world of inequalities, almost disregarded in comparison with AM-GM or Cauchy-Schwarz, this book will emphasize this inequality's importance. I place Holder inequality in a subsection of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality because it is a natural generalization of cauchy-Schwarz and its application is not so different than Cauchy-Schwarz inequality's application. 2.2 Holder Inequality Theorem 3 (Holder inequality). for m sequences of positive real numbers Equality occurs if and only if these m sequences are pairwise proportional. Cauchy- Schwarz ineq'uality is a direct corollary of Holder inequality for m = 2. Corollary 1. Let a, b, c, x, y, z, t, u, v be positive real numbers. We always have 2.0. Cauchy-Schwarz and Holder inequalities 47 PROOF. This is a direct corollary of Holder inequality for m = n = 3. I choose this particular case of Holder for a detailed proof because it exemplifies the proof of the general Holder inequality. According to AM-GM, we deduce that That means Corollary 2. Let aI, a2, ... , an be positive real numbers. Prove that PROOF. Applying AM-GM, we have These two inequalities, added up, give the desired result . Why do we sometimes neglect Holder inequality? Despite its strong application, its sophisticated expression (with m sequences, each of which has n terms), makes it confusing th(> first time we try using it. If you are still hesitating, the book will try to convince you that Holder is really effective and easy to use. Don't be afraid of familiarize yourself with it! Generally, a lot of difficult problems turn into very simple ones just after a deft application of Holder inequality . • Example 2.2.1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers.

Equality holds for a = b = c = 1 for both parts. The third one is not true. Indeed, we only need to choose a -+ 0 and b = c -+ +00, or namely, a = 10- 4 , b = c = 100. Example 2.2.3. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers.

EqUality holds for a = b = c. Notice that this problem is still true for every rational number k (k 2: 1), and therefore it's still true for every real number k (k ~ 1). Example 2.2.4.

V • If an inequality can be solved by Holder inequality, it can be solved by AM-GM inequality, too. Why? Because the proof of HOlder inequality only uses AM-GM. For instance, in example 2.2.1, we can use AM-GM directly in the following way Let M = a + b + c. According to AM-GM, we have a a a(b2 + 8ac) 3a Jb 2 + 8ac + Jb 2 + 8ac + (a + b + c)3 ~ a + b + c' Our work on the LHS is to build up two other similar inequalities then sum up all of them. But what is the difference between AM-GM and Cauchy-Schwarz and Holder? Although both Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and HOlder inequality can be proved by AM-GM, they have a great advantage in application. They make a long and com- plicate solution through AM-GM, shorter and more intuitive. Let's see the following example to clarify this advantage. 52 Chapter 2. The basic Inequalities - Example 2.2.10. Suppose that a, b, c are positive real numbers satisfying the condi- tion 3 max(a2 , b2, c2) ~ 2(a2 + b2 + ~). Prove that a + b + c > V3. J2fi2 + 2c2 - a 2 J2c2 + 2a2 - b2 J2a 2 + 2fi2 - c2 SOLUTION. By Holder, we deduce that (z= J2b2 + ~C2 _ a2) (z= J2b 2 + ~C2 _ a 2 ) (z= a(2b2 + 2c 2 - a 2 )) ~ (a+b+c)3. eye eye eye I t remains to prove that (a + b + c)3 ~ 3 z= a(2b2 + 2c2 - a2). eye Rewrite this one in the following form 3 (abc- TI(a - b+ C)) + 2 (z=a 3 - 3abc) ~ 0, ~e ~e which is obvious (for a quick proof that the first term is bigger than 0, replace a-b+c = x, etc). Equality holds for a = b = c. How can this problem be solved by AM-GM? Of course, it is a bit more difficult. Let's see that ~ a ~ a ~ 3V3a(2b 2 + 2i2 - a 2 ) > L J2b2 + 2c2 _ a2 + L J2b2 + 2c2 _ a2 + L (a + b + c)3 eye eye eye > 3~ J3a = 3J3. - La+b+c eye To use AM-GM now, we must be aware of multiplying 3V3 to the fraction a(2b2 + 2c2 - a2) in order to have a (a + b + c)3 a 3J3a(2b2 + 2~ - a2) (a+b+c)3 in case a = b = c. Why are Holder and Cauchy-Schwarz more advantageous? Because, in stead of being conditioned by an \"equal property\" like AM-GM is, Holder and Cauchy-Schwarz are conditioned by \"proportional property\". This feature makes Holder and Cauchy-Schwarz easier to use in a lot of situations. Furthermore, HOlder is very effective in proving problems which involve roots (helps us get rid of the square root easily, for example) . • Chapter 3 Chebyshev Inequality 3.1 Chebyshev Inequality and Applications Theorem 4 (Chebyshev inequality). Suppose (al,a2, ... ,a n ) and (b l ,b2, ... ,bn ) are two increasing sequences of real numbers, then PROOF. By directly expanding, we have n = L (ai - aj)(bi - bj ) ~ o. i,j=l Comment. By the same proof, we also conclude that if the sequence (all a2, ... , an) is increasing but the sequence (bl , b2, ... , bn ) is decreasing, then 1 albl + a2b2 + ... + anbn ~ -(al + a2 + ... + an)(b l + b2 + ... + bn ). n For symmetric problems, we can rearrange the order of variables so that the con- dition of Chebyshev inequality is satisfied. Generally, solutions by Chebyshev in- equality are more concise those that by other basic inequalities. Let's consider the following simple example Example 3.1.1. Let al,a2, ... ,an be positive real numbers with sum n. Prove that 53 54 Chapter 3. The basic Inequalities - SOLUTION. To solve this problem by AM-GM, we must go through two steps: first, n n 11 prove n L a~+l + n ~ (n + 1) L ai, and then prove L ai ~ n. To solve it by i=l i=l i=l Cauchy-Schwarz, we must use an inductive approach eventually. However, this problem follows from Chebyshev inequality immediately with the notice that the sequences (all a2, ... , an) and (ai\\ a2\\ ... , a~) can be rearranged so that they are in- creasing at once. Now we continue with some applications of Chebyshev inequality. Example 3.1.2. Let a, b, c, d be positive real numbers such that a2 + b 2 + c 2 + d2 = 4. Prove the following inequality a2 b 2 c2 d 2 4 -::--~ + + + > -. b+c+d c+d+a d+a+b a+b+c - 3 SOLUTION. Notice that if (a, b, c, d) is arranged in an increasing order then 1 > 1 > 1 > 1 b+c+d - c+d+a - d+a+b - a+b+c' Therefore, by Chebyshev inequality, we have That implies Example 3.1.3.

Equality holds for a = b = c = 1. v In the following pages, we will discuss a special method of applying Chebyshev that is very effective and widely used. This technique is generally called\" Chebyshev associate technique\". 3.2 The Chebyshev Associate Technique Let's analyze the following inequality Example 3.2.1. Suppose a, b, c, d are positive real numbers such that Prove the inequality (Pharo Kim Hung) SOLUTION. A cursory look at this inequality will leave you hesitating. The relationship between the variables a, b, c, d appears to be obscure and very hard to transform; moreover, the problem involves square roots. How can use handle this situation? Surprisingly enough, a simple way of applying Chebyshev can draw the enigmatic curtain. Let's discover the method! By hypothesis, we have Rewrite the inequality to the following form ( ) a2 - 1 ~ 2a - va2 + 3 ~ 0 {::? ~ > 0 L L 2a + va 2+3- . eye eye How to continue? The idea is to apply Chebyshev inequality for these sequences: ( 1 1 1 1) (a 2 -1, b 2 -1, c2 -1, d 2 -1); 2a + va2 + 3 ' 2b + Vb2 + 3 ' 2c + V c2 + 3 ' 2d + V d2 + 3 . However, it's a futile idea because·the first sequence is increasing but the second se- quence is decreasing, and therefore the sign becomes reversed if we apply Chebyshev. 58 Chapter 3. The basic Inequalities - Hope is not lost! Noticing that L (a 2 - 1) = 0, we will transform the inequality to eye a the form a2 -1 a ~. >0. L a 2a + J a2 + 3 - eye a Suppose a > b > c> d . With the identity ----;:.::;;===:: - - - 2a + J a2 + 3 that ( a2 - 1 b 2 - 1 c2 - 1 d 2 - 1 ) a ' b ' c 'd ' and 1 --r===, we we see 2+ Jl+ ~ are two increasing sequences. So, according to Chebyshev inequality, we conclude This ends the proof. Equality holds for a = b = c = d = 1. What is the key feature of this simple solution? It is the step of dividing both numerators and denominators of fractions by suitable coefficients in order to fit the condition in Chebyshev inequality and bond it with the hypothesis. According to this solution, we can build a general approach as follow * Suppose that we need to prove the inequality (represented as a sum of fractions) Xl + X2 + ... + Xn > 0 YI Y2 Yn - in which Xl, X2, ... , Xn are real numbers and Yl, Y2, .. . , Yn are positive real numbers . • Generally, every inequality can be transformed into this form if a certain fraction has a negative denominator, we will multiply both its numerator and denominator by -1. Then 'We w'lll find a new sequence of positive real numhers (aI, a2, ... , an) such that the seq'uence is increasing hut the sequence , 3.1. Chebyshev inequality and Applications 59 is decreasing. After applying Chebyshev inequality 11 X. 1 ( ) (1) L-2>- L a .x · L - i=l Yi - n eye l l eye aiYi ' • it will remain to prove that i=l Why is this approach advantageous? Because it get rid of fractions in the inequal- ity. Even a suitable choice that makes alxl + a2X2 + ... + anXn = 0 can help finish the proof immediately. In fact, many problems can be solved in this simple way. Right now, let's go further with the following examples: Example 3.2.2. Suppose a, b, e are positive real numbers with sum 3. Prove that 111 ....,,---- + + < 1. e2 + a + b a2 + b + e b2 + a + e - SOLUTION.

It's obviously true because ab ~ ~(a + b)2 ~ ~ < 3. Equality holds for a = b = e = 1. V Example 3.2.3. Let a, b, e be positive real numbers and 0 ~ k ~ 2.

Although this problem can be solved in the same way as example 2.1.1 is solved, we can use Chebyshev inequality to give a simpler solution. Notice that if a ~ b then for all positive real e, we have (a 2 - be)(b + e) ~ (b2 - ca)(e + a), and (b2 + e2 + ka 2 ) (b + e) - (e2 + a 2 + kb2) (e + a) = (b - a) (L a 2 - (k - 1) L be) ~ O. eye eye 60 Chapter 3.

Why does the Chebyshev associate technique stand out from other ways of ap- plying Chebyshev? Perhaps its wide application is the reason. Do you think this new and surprising? Surely not. In fact, this approach is natural. I believe that you have already used it but haven't given it a common name yet. From now, on instead of thinking intuitively and accidentaly, you will use Chebyshev associate technique intentionally_ Sometimes the work of multiplying numerators and denominators by suitable coefficients is quite conspicious, such as in the problems above, but sometimes it's not . Figuring out the good coefficients requires a lot of effort and therefore the \"intention\" to find them becomes important. Let's examine this matter through the following instances Example 3.2.7. Suppose that a, b, c are positive real numbers with sum 3. Prove that 1 1 1 3 -g---a-b + 9 - be + 9 - ea ~ S· • I I I . , I I I 3.1. Chebyshev inequality and Applications 63 SOLUTION.

We will rewrite the inequality to 1 L ax (1- x) . a (9 _ x) > O. eye x The numbers (ax,ay,a z ) must fulfill two conditions: first, among two sequences (a x(1- x), ay(1 - y), a z (1 - z)) and (ax (9 - x), a y (9 - y), a z (9 - z)), one is increas- ing and another is decreasing (1); second, L ax (1- x) ~ 0 (2). eye Let's do some tests. vVe first choose ax = 1 + x,a y = 1 + y,a z = 1 + z. In this case, condition (1) is satisfied but condition (2) is false because eye vVe then choose ax = 8 +x, a y = 8 +y, a z = 8 +z. This time, condition (2) is satisfied (you can check it easily) but condition (1) is not always true. Fortunately, everything is fine if we choose ax = 6 + x, a y = 6 + y, a z = 6 + z. In this case, it's obvious that if x ~ y ~ z then ax (l-x) ~ ay(l-y) ~ az{l-z) and a x(9-x) :::; a y(9-y) :::; a z (9-z).

Chapter 4 Inequalities with Convex Functions The convex function is an important concept and plays an important role in many fields of Mathematics. Although convex functions always pertain to advanced theo- ries, this book will try to give you the most fundamental knowledge of this kind of functions so that it can be easily understood by a high-school student and it can be used in inequalities. This section includes two smaller parts: Jensen inequality and inequalities with bounded variables. 4.1 Convex functions and Jensen inequality Definition 1. Suppose that f is a one-variable function defined on [a, b) C lR. f is called a convex function on [a, bj if and only if for all x, y E [a, bj and for all 0 < t ~ 1, we have tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y) ~ f (tx + (1 - t)y). Theorem 5. If f(x) is a real function defined on [a, b] C Ire and fl/(x) > 0 't/x E [a, b] then f(x) is a convex function on la, b]. PROOF. We will prove that for all x, y E [a, bj and for all 0 ~ t ~ 1 tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y) ~ f (tx + (1- t)y) . Indeed, suppose that t and yare constant. Denote g(x) = tf(x) + (1 - t)f(y) - f (tx + (1 - t)y) . • 67 68 Chapter 4. The basic Inequalities - By differentiating, g'(x) = tf'(x) - tf'(tx + (1 - t)y). Notice that f\" (x) ~ 0 for all x E [a, b], thus f' (x) is an increasing function on [a, b] . This gives that g'(x) 20 if x ~ y and g'(x) S 0 if x S y. That means g(x) 2 g(y) = o. Theorem 6 (Jensen inequality). Suppose that f is a convex function on la, b] C JR. For all xI, X2, ... , Xn E [a, b], we have () () f() ( XI+X2+ ... +xn) f Xl + f X2 + ... + Xn 2 nf n . If you've never read any material regarding convex functions, or if you've never seen the definition of a convex function, the following lemma seems to be very useful and practical (although it can be obtained directly from Jensen inequality) Lemma 1. Suppose that a real function f : [a, b] ---+ R satisfies the condition ( x+y) f(x) + fey) 22f -2- 't/x,y E [a,b]' then for all Xl, x2, ... , xn E [a, b], the following inequality holds () f( ·) () f(XI+X2+ ... +xn) f Xl + X2 + ... + f Xn 2 n n . PROOF. vVe use Cauchy induction to solve this lemma. By hypothesis, the inequality holds for n = 2, therefore it holds for every number n that is a power of 2. It's enough to prove that if the inequality holds for n = k + ~(k E N, k 22) then it will hold for n = k. Indeed, suppose that it's true for n = k + 1. Denote x = Xl + X2 + ... + Xk and ' X take Xk+1 = k' By the inductive hypothesis, we have f (xd + f (X2) + ... + f (Xk) + f Cf) 2 (k + 1) f ( ~ : ~) = (k + 1) f (~) . That finishes the proof. The result above can can directly infered from Jensen inequality because accord- ing to the definition, every convex function f satisfies (t = 1/2) f(x) + fey) 2 2f (x; Y) . 4.0. Inequalities with Convex functions 69 Obviously, if we change the condition f(x) + f(y) ~ 2f (X; Y) \"Ix, Y E [a, b) to f (x) + f (y) :::; 2f ( x ; y) \"Ix, y E [a, b), then the sign of the inequality is reversed f( ) f() f() ( XI+X2+ ... +xn) Xl + X2 + ... + Xn:::; n f n . Lemma 2. Suppose that the real !unction f : [a, b) ---t ~+ satisfies the condition f(x) + f(y) ~ 2f(.JXY) \"Ix, y E [a, b], then for all XI, X2, ... , Xn E la, b], the following inequality holds The proof of this lemma is completely similar to that of lemma 1 and therefore it won't be shown here. Notice that this lemma is quite widely applied and it is related to the AM-GM inequality of course. Theorem 1 CWeighted Jensen inequality). Suppose that f(x) is a real function de- fined on [a, b) c ~ and XI, X2, ... , Xn are real numbers on [a, b). For all non-negative real numbers aI, a2, ... , an which sum up to I, the following inequality holds Jensen inequality is a particular case of this theorem for al = a2 = ... = an = lin. Let's consider a more elementary version of this theorem as fo11ow Lemma 3. Let aI, a2, ... , an be non-negative real numbers with sum 1 and Xl, X2, ... , Xn be real numbers in [a, b). Let f(x) be a real function defined on [a, b). The inequality is true for every positive integer n and for every real numbers Xi, ai, i = 1,2,· .. ,n if and only if it's true in the case n = 2. To prove lemma 3 as well as the weighted Jensen inequality, we use the same method as in the proof of lemma 1. The great advantage of lemma 1, 2 and 3 is that is allows one to use the convex-function method even if one knows nothing about the convexity of a function. Following is an obvious corollary 70 Chapter 4. The basic Inequalities - Corollary 3. a, The conclusion in lemma 1 is still true if we change the expression of the arithmetic mean by any other average form of Xl,X2, ... ,Xft; for example, geometric mean or harmonic mean, etc. b, If the sign of the inequality for two numbers is reversed, the sign of the inequality for n nnmbers is reversed, too. Jensen is a classical inequality. In the next chapters, we will continue discussing this inequality in relationship with Karamata inequality, a stronger result. Now let's continue with some applications of Jensen inequality. Example 4.1.1. Suppose that Xli X2, ... , Xn are positive real numbers and Xli X2, ... , Xn ~ 1. Prove that 1 lIn --+ + ... + < . 1 + Xl 1 + X2 1 + Xn - 1 + ylXlX2\".Xn (1M 0 Shortlist) SOLUTION. According to lema 2, it's enough to prove that 1 1 2 -----=- + < 'Va b> 1. 1 + a 2 1 + b2 - 1 + ab ,- We can reduce this inequality to (a - b)2(1 - ab) ~ 0, which is obvious. Example 4.1.2. Let all a2, ... , an be real numbers lying in (1/2,lJ. Prove that ala2···an > (1 - al)(l - a2) ... (1 - an) (al + a2 + ... + an)n - (n - al - an - .. - an)n SOLUTION. The inequality is equivalent to Notice that the function J(x) = Inx -In(l - x), has the second derivative J\"(} -1 1 X = --;'i + (1 _ x)2 ~ 0 (x E (1/2,1]). Therefore J is a convex function. By Jensen inequality, we have the desired result. 4.0. Inequalities with Convex functions 71 In comparison with other basic inequalities such as AM-GM Cauchy-Schwarz or Chebyshev apparently, Jensen inequality is restricted to a separate world. Jensen inequality is so rarely used because people always think that it is not strong enough for difficult problems. However, there is an undiscoved field of inequalities where Jensen inequality becomes very effective and always gives us unexpected so- lutions. Example 4.1.3. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers. Prove that abc -;=~~ + + > 1. Ja 2 + 8bc Jb 2 + 8ac Je2 + 8ab - (IMO 2001, A2) SOLUTION. Although this problem has been solved using HOlder, a proof by Jensen's inequality is very nice, too. WLOG, we may assume that a + b + e = 1 normalize. Because f(x) = Jx is a convex function, we obtain from Jensen's inequality that: a· f(a 2 + 8be) + b· f(b 2 + 8ea) + e· f(e 2 + 8ab) 2 f(M) in which M = L a(a 2 + 8bc) = 24abe+ L a3. It remains to prove that f(M) 2 1 or eye eye !vI ~ 1 or 24abe+ 2: a3 ~ (La) 3 {=> L e(a - b)2 2 o. eye eye This last inequality is obvious. Equality holds for a = b = e. Example 4.1.4. Let a, b, e, d be positive numbers with sum 4. Prove that SOLUTION. Denote f(x) = (1 , then f is a convex function if x > O.

Inequalities with Convex functions 73 SOLUTION. We may assume that a + b + c = 1. Because f(x) function, according to Jensen inequality, we have Jx is a convex where M = a(4b2 + bc+ 4C) +b(4c2 + ca + 4a2) + c(4a2 + ab+4b2) = 4 L ab(a+ b) + 3abc. eye It suffices to prove that f(M) 2 1 or M ~ 1.

It remains to prove '\" 9a(a+b+c) <1 L (4a + 4b + c)( 4a + 4c + b) - eye 74 Chapter 4.

Inequalities with Convex functions If b ~ 1 then a + b ~ 1 + .J2 and (a + 1)(b + 1) ~ 2 (1 + Vi) . It implies 9 Sa - Sb = 2(a + b) - 3 - (a + 1)(b + 1) ~ O. 75 Certainly Sb - Se ~ 0, so we conclude that Sa ~ Sb ~ Se. By Chebyshev inequality, we obtain If b 2 1 then we also have Sa - Se ~ 0 and Sb - Se ~ 0 (because c ~ 1). It implies eye Equality holds for a = b = c = 1. In fact, the weighted Jensen inequality has, to some extent, much secrets. It's still rarely used nowadays but once used, it always shows a wonderful solution. Problems and solutions above, hopefully, convey to you a certain way of using this special approach; it should be contemplated more by yourself. • In the following pages, we will discuss a new way of applying convex functions to inequalities. We will use convex functions to handle inequalities whose variables are restricted in a fixed range [a, b]. 4.2 Convex Functions and Inequalities with Vari- ables Restricted to an Interval In some inequalities, variables are restricted to a certain interval. For this kind of problems, Jensen inequality appears to be especially strong and useful because it helps determine if the variables are equal to the boundaries or not, for the minimum of an expression to be obtained. Example 4.2.1. Suppose that a, b, c are positive real numbers belonging to [1,2]. Prove that (MYM 2001) 76 Chapter 4. The basic Inequalities - SOLUTION. Let's first give an elementary solution to this simple problem. Since a, b, c E [1,2]' if a 2 b 2 c then a3 + 2 < 5a ~ (a - 2)( a2 + 2a - 1) ~ 0 (1) 5a+b3~5ab+I ~(b-l)(b2+b+I-5a)~O (2) 5ab + c3 ~ 5abc + 1 ~ (c - 1) (c2 + c + 1 - 5ab) ~ 0 (3) The above estimations are correct because b 2 + b + 1 < a 2 + a + 1 < 2a + a + 1 < 5a, - - - c 2 + c + 1 ~ a2 + a + 1 ~ 5a ~ 5ab. Summing up the results (1), (2) and (3), we get the result . Equality holds if a = 2, b = c = 1 and permutations. Example 4.2.2. Suppose that a, b, c are positive real numbers belonging to [1,2]. Prove that (1 1 1) (a + b + c) - + - + - <10. abc (Olympiad 30-4, Vietnam) SOLUTION. The inequality can be rewritten as abc b c a - + - + - + - + - + - < 7. b c a a b c- WLOG, we may assume that a 2 b 2 c, then (a - b)(a - c) 2 0 { a a b -+1>-+- =} c -b c c c b -+1>-+- a - b a' which implies that abc b a c - + - + - + - < - + - + 2. b c b a-c a We conclude abc b c a (a C) (a - 2c)(2a - c) =?-+-+-+-+-+-<2+2 -+- =7- <7 b c a abc - c a ac- because 2c ~ a 2 c. Equality holds for (a, b, c) = (2,2,1) or (2,1,1) or permutations. Comment. Here is the general problem. Its solution is completely similar to that of . the previous problem. 4.0. Inequalities with Convex functions 77 * Suppose that p < q are positive constants and all a2, ... , an E [p, q]. Prove that where kn = n 2 if n is even and n 2 -1 if n is odd. The key feature of the previous solution is the intermediate estimation (estimate that if a 2: b 2: c then (b-a)(b-c) :S 0). Because they are so elementary and simple, a high-school student can comprehend them easily. But what happens to the following inequality? Can the previous method be used? Let's see. Example 4.2.3. Let Xl! X2, ... , X2005 be real numbers belonging to [-1,1]. Find the minimum value for the following expression SOLUTION. Because this inequality is cyclic, not symmetric, we can not order variables as. If we rely on the relation (Xi - l)(xi + 1) :S 0, we won't succeed either. By intuition, we feel that the expression will attain its maximum if in the sequence (Xl. X2, ... , X2005), 1 and -1 alternate. In this case P = 1 . (-1) + (-1) . 1 + ... + (-1) . 1 + 1 . 1 = -2003. An accurate proof of this conjecture is not so obvious. Although the following solution is simple, it's really hard if you don't have some knowledge of convex functions is never generated in your mind. First, we notice that if X E [p, qj then each linear function f(x) = ax + b or quadratic function f(x) = x2 + ax + b has the following important property max f(x) = max{f(p), f(q)}. xElp,q] A linear function satisfies another condition min f(x) = min{f(p).J(q)}. xElp,ql Notice that P = P(Xl) is a linear function of Xl, therefore, according to properties of linear functions, P can attain the minimum if only if Xl E {-I, I}. Similarly, for the other variables, we deduce that P attains the minimum if and only if Xk E { -1, I} for • 78 Chapter 4. The basic Inequalities - each k = 1,2, ... , 2005. In this case, we will prove that P ~ -2003. Indeed, there must be at least one index k (k E N.l :::; k :::; 2005) for which XkXk+l ~ O. That implies n XkXk+l = 1 and therefore L XiXi+l ~ -2003. k=l Comment. By a similar approach, we can solve a lot of inequalities of this kind such as * Let XI. X2, ... , Xn be real numbers belonging to [-1,1]. Find the minimum value of * Let Xl, X2, ... , Xn be real numbers belonging to [0, 1]. Prove that For what kind of functions does this approach hold? Of course, linear function is an example, but there are not all. The following lemma helps, determine a large class of such functions. Lemma 4. Suppose that F(XI, X2, ... , Xn) is a real function defined on [a, b] x [a, b] x ... x [a, b] c IR n (a < b) such that for all k E {I, 2, ... ,n}, if we fix 71. - 1 variables Xj(j \"# k) then F(XI, X2, ... , Xn) = f(Xk) is a convex functi.on of Xk. F attains its minimum at the point (0:1. 0:2, ... , O:n) if and only if D:.i E {a, b} Vi E {I, 2, ... ,n}. SOLUTION. In fact, we only need to prove that if f(x) is a real convex function defined on [a, b] then for all X E la, b], we have f(x) :::; max{f(a), f(b)}. Indeed, since {ta + (1 - t)blt E [0, I]) = ra, b], for alJ X E [a, b], there exists a number t E [0,1] such that X = ta + (1- t)b. According to the definition of a convex function, we deduce that f(x) :::; tf(a) + (1- t)f(b) :::; max{f(a),f(b)}. With this lemma, iIi problems like example 4.2.3., we only need to check the convexity / concavity of a multi-variable function as a one-variable function of Xk, (k = 1,2, ... ,71.). Here is an example. 4.0. Inequalities with Convex functions 79 Example 4.2.4. Given positive real numbers Xl, X2, ... , Xn E [a, b], find the maximum value of (Mathematics and Youth Magazine) SOLUTION. Denote the above expression by F. Notice that F, represented as a func- tion of Xl (we have already fixed other variables), is equal to f(x.) = (n - l)x;- 2 (t, Xi) Xl + C in which c is a constant. Clearly;- f is a convex function (J\"(X) = 2(n - 1) 2 0). According to the above lemma, we conclude that F attains the maximum value if and only if Xi E {a,b} for all i E {l,2, ... ,n}. Suppose that k numbers Xi are equal to a and (n - k) numbers Xi are equal to b. In this case, we have F = n (t,x;) -(t, Xi) , = nka'+n(n-k)b'-(ka+(n-k)b)' = k(n-k)(a-b)'. We conclude that { m 2 (a - bf if n = 2m, mEN, max(F) = m(m + l)(a - b)2 if n = 2m + 1, mEN. Example 4.2.5. Let n EN. Find the minimum value of the following expression f(x) = 11 + xl + 12 + xl + ... + In + xl, (x E JR). SOLUTION. Denote I] = [-1, +(0), In + l = (-00, -n] and h = [-k, -k + 1] for each n n n(n - 1) k E {2,3, ... ,n}. Ifx E h then f(x) = i~l(l +x) 2 i~l(i -1) = 2 = f(-l). If 11 n n(n -1) x E In then f(x) = i~I(-l- x) ~ i~(-i + n) = 2 = f(-n). Suppose x E h with 1 < k < n + 1, then k-l n f(x) = - L(i + x) + L(i + x) i=l i=k is a linear function of x, therefore min f(x) = min{f( -k),f( -k + 1)}. xE!,. 80 l:hapter 4. The basic Inequalities - This result, combined with the previous results, implies that min f(x) = min{f(-l), f( -2), ... , f( -n)}. XEIR After a simple calculation, we have 1 f(-k) = (1 + 2 + ... + (k -1)) + (1 + 2 + ... + (n - k)) = Z(k 2 + (n - k)2 + n), which implies that . . k 2 + (n - k)2 + n {m(m + 1) if n = 2m (m EN). nun f(x) = nun = XER l~k~n 2 (m+1? ifn=2m+1 (mEN). Why does this approach make a great advantage? It helps us find the solutions immediately. It takes no time to try intermediate estimations, because everything we need to do is check the boundary values. Sometimes, variables may be restricted not only in a certain interval but also by a mutual relationship. In this case, the following result is significant Lemma 5. Suppose that f(x) is a real convex function defined on [a, bJ E IR and Xl, X2, ... , Xn E [a, bJ such that Xl + X2 + ... + Xn = S = constant (na ::; s ::; nb). Consider the following expression F attains the maximum value if and only if at least n - 1 elements of the sequence (Xl, X2, .. , xn) are equal to a or b. SOLUTION. Notice that this lemma can be obtained directly from its case n = 2. In fact, it's sufficient to prove that : if X, Y E [a, b1 and 2a ::; X + y = s ::; 2b then { f(a) + f(s - a) if s < a + b. f~)+f~)::; - feb) + f(s - b) if s 2 a + b. Indeed, suppose that s ::; a + b, then s - a ::; b. Because X E [a, s - a], there exists a number t E ro, 11 for which X = ta + (1 - t)(s - a). That gives y = (1 - t)a + t(s - a) . By the definition of a convex function, we have f(x) :S tf(a) + (1 - t)f(s - a) and fey) ::; (1- t)f(a) + tf(s - a). Adding up these results, we conclude f(x) + fey) ::; f(a) + f(s - a). 4.0. Inequalities with Convex functions 81 In the case s ~ a + b, the lerruna is proved similarly. v Now look at some familiar problems that turn out to be simple by this theorem. Example 4.2.6. Let aI, a2, ... , an be positive real numbers belonging to [0,2J such that al + a2 + ... + an = n. Find the maximum value of SOLUTION. Applying the above lerruna to the convex function f(x) = x 2 , we get that S attains the maximum if and only if k numbers are equal to 2 and n - k - 1 numbers are equal to o. In this case, we have S = 4k + (n - 2k)2. Because aI, a2, ... , an E [0,2], we must have 0 ::; n - 2k ::; 2. If n = 2m (m E N) then n - 2k E {O, 2}. That implies max S = 4m = 2n. If n = 2m + 1 (m E N) then n - 2k = 1. That implies max S = 4m + 1 = 2n + 1. v Example 4 .2.1. Suppose that a, b, c E [0,2] and a + b + c = 5. Prove that ·SOLUTION. Suppose that a ::; b ::; c. According to lemma 5, we deduce that a2 +b2 +c2 attains the maximum if and only if a = 0 or b = c = 2. The first case a = 0 is rejected because so, 4 ~ b + c = 5 is a contradiction. In the second case, we have a = 1 and therefore max{a2 + b 2 + c2} = 12 + 22 + 22 = 9. v Example 4.2.S. Let aI, a2, ... , a2007 be real numbers in (-1, 1] such that al + a2 + ... + a2007 = O. Prove that a~ + a~ + ... + a~007 ::; 2006. SOLUTION. Applying lemma 5, we deduce that the expression a~ + a~ + ... + a~007 attains the maximum if and only if k numbers equal 1 and n - k - 1 numbers equal • -1. k must be 1003 and the last number must be 0, so we deduce that a~ + a~ + ... + a~007 ::; 2006. v 82 Chapter 4. The basic Inequalities - Example 4.2.9. Let XbX2, ... ,Xn be real numbers in the interval [-1,1] such that x~ + x~ + ... + x~ = O. Find the maximum value of Xl + X2 + ... + Xn · (Tran N am Dung) SOLUTION. We denote ai = x~ for all i E {I, 2, ... , n}, then al + a2 + ... + an = O. Notice that the function f(x) = Vx is concav(' if x ~ 0 and convex if X ~ O. It's easy to get (as in lemma 5) { f (-1) + f (x + y + 1) if x, y E [-1, 0]. l(x)+/(Y)~ 2/(x~y) ifx,YE[O,l[. (1) Now suppose that there are two numbers x, y of the xi's such that x < 0 < y then { f ( -1) + f (x + y + 1), if x + y ~ O. f(x) + f(y) ~ f(O)+f(x+y), ifx+y~O. (2) According to (1), we deduce that if al,a2, ... ,ak are all non-positive terms of the sequence (ai, a2, ... , an), then ~f(a,) ~ (k -1)/(1) + 1 (t,a, + k -1) , which implies that we can change k - 1 non-positive numbers to -1 to make the sum k L f(ai) bigger. Moreover, if ak+l,ak+2, ... ,an are non-negative then i=l That means we can replace all non-negative numbers with their arithmetic mean n to make L f(ai) bigger. However, we can make only k - 1 non-positive numbers i=k+l equa1 to -1; there is always one non-positive nUJillber left. Suppose that this number n is ak. Because L ai = 0, there is one non-negative number, sayan . According to (2), i=l because ak ~ 0 ~ an, we can replace (ak,a n ) with (-l,ak + an + 1) if ak + an ~ 0 (ak +an + 1 ~ 0) and with (0, ak +an ) if ak +a ll ~ O. After this step, the new sequence has all k non-negative elements equal to -1. Therefore t, f(a,) ~ g(k) = kf(-l) + (n - k)f (n: k) = {/k(n - k)'- k. 4.0.

The strength of Abel formula is shown in inequalities with sequences, where other methods fail. Abel formula is also significant in the proof of a very important inequality that will be discussed now, rearrangement inequality . .. 5.2 Rearrangelnent Inequality Theorem 9 (Rearrangement Inequality). Let (al.a2, ... ,an ) and (bl,b2, ... ,bn ) be two increasing sequences of real numbers. Suppose that (il. i 2 .... , in) is an arbitrary per- mutation of (1, 2, ... , n), then If the sequence (aI, a2, ... , an) is increasing but the sequence (bl , b2, ... , bn ) is decreasing then the sign of the above inequalit·y is reversed. PROOF. Notice that al $ a2 $ ... $ an and bl $ b2 $ ... $ bn , so according to Abel formula, n n n L akbk - L akbik = L ak(bk - bik ) k=l k=l k=l = (al - a2)(bl - bil) + (a2 - ab)(bl + b2 - bil - bi2 ) + ... (an-l -an) (~bk -~b'.) +an (~bk -~b'.) ~ 0, If k because for 8.11 k E {l, 2, ... , n}, we have L bj $ L bi;- j=l j=l The theorem is proved similarly in the case with (all a2, ... , an) increasing but (bl. b2 , ... , bn ) is decreasing. In practice, Rearrangement inequality is strong. It can help prove AM-GM inequality in a single way. Example 5.2.1. Let aI, a2,'\" an be positive real numbers. Prove that Xl SOLUTION. WLOG, assume that ala2 ... an = 1 (normalization). Let al = -,a2 = X2 X2 Xn-l Xn Th bl b -, ... ,an-l = --, XI,X2, ... ,Xn > 0, then an = -. e pro em ecomes X3 Xn Xl Xl X2 Xn-l Xn > - + - + ... +--+- _ n. X2 X3 Xn Xl 92 Chapter 5. The basic Inequalities- Notice that if the sequence (Xl, X2, ••• , xn) is increasing then the sequence (:1 ' :2' ... , x1n) is decreasing. By Rearrangement inequality, we conclude that For cyclic inequalities, Rearrangement inequality seems to be very effective. Sometimes it's not easy to realize the use of Rearrangement inequality because it is hidden after the normal order of variables is changed into chaos. Being aware of Rearrangement inequality in a problem requires a bit more intuitive ability then for other inequalities. The following problems will, hopefully, enhance that ability. Example 5.2.2. Suppose that a, b, e are the side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that (lMO 1984, A3) SOLUTION. Because a, b, e are the side-lengths of a triangle, a 2: b implies a2 + be 2: b 2 + ca. By this property, we deduce that if a 2: b 2: e then a2 + be 2: b2 + ca 2: e2 +ab; 1 1 1 also, - $ -b $ -.

Applying Rearrangement inequality for the sequences (a 2 , b2 , e2 ) and 111 (-b -, --, --b) (if a 2: b 2: c, then these are both increasing), we get that +c c+a a+ which implies that 5.0.

(L_a )2 a+e eye and therefore (because P ? Q) we have P ? L _a_. The proof is finished and the eyca+c equality occurs if and only if a = b = e. Comment. This inequality can be proved by another nice approach. Indeed, notice that for all positive real numbers a, b, e > 0, we have abe (a - b)2 (a - e)(b - e) -+-+--3= + . b e a ab ae WLOG, assume that c = min(a, b, c). Rewrite the inequality to .. -- a-b + -- a-e b-e >0 [1 1] 2 [1 1] ab (a+e)(b+c) ( ) ac (a+c)(a+b) ( )( )- which is obvious because e = min(a, b, e). Example 5.2.5.

A simple calculation reveals l = -1 + VI + 8k, and therefore the 4 final result k(x2 + y2) + Z2 ~ -1 + ~1 + 8k. Comment. The following more general problem can be solved by the same method. * Suppose that x, y, z are positive real numbers verifying xy + yz + zx = 1 and k,l are two positive real constants. The minimum value of the expression is 2to, where to is the unique positive real root of the equation 2t3 + (k + l + l)t - kl = O. By the same method, we will solve some other problems regarding intermediate variables. Example 6.1.2. Let x, y, z, t be real numbers satisfying xy + yz + zt + tx = 1. Find the minimum of the expression SOLUTION. We choose a positive number l < 5 and apply AM-GM inequality lx2 + 2y2 ~ 2V2lxy, 2y2 + lz2 ~ 2V2lyz, (5 -l)z2 + 1/2t2 ~ J2(5 - l)zt, 1/2t2 + (5 -l)x 2 ~ J2(5 -l)tx. Summing up these results, we conclude that 5x2 + 4y2 + 5z 2 + t2 ~ 2V2l(xy + tz) + J2(5 -l)(zt + tx). The condition xy + yz + zt + tx = 1 suggests us to choose a number l (0 :S l :S 5) such that 2V2l = J2(5 -l). A simple calculation yields l = I, thus, the minimum of 5x2 + 4y2 + 5z2 + t2 is 2../2. Comment. The following general problem can be solved by the same method • 100 Chapter 6. The basic Inequalities - * Let x, y, z, t be arbitrary real numbers. Prove that Example 6.1.3. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers with sum 3. Find the minimum of the expression x 2 + y2 + z3. (Pham Kim Hung) SOLUTION. Let a and b be positive real numbers. By AM-GM inequality, we have y2 +a 2 ~ 2ay, z3 + b3 + b3 ~ 3b2 z. Combining these results yields that x 2 +y2 +z3 +2(a2 +b3 ) ~ 2a(x+y) +3b2z, with equality for x = y = a and z = b. In this case, we could have 2a+b = x+y+z = 3 (*). Moreover, in order for 2a(x + y) + 3b2z to be represented as x + y + z, we must have 2a = 3b 2 (**) . According to (*) and (**), we easily find out b = -1 + v'37 a = 3 - b = 19 - v'37 6' 2 12' therefore the minimum of x 2 + y2 + z3 is 6a - (2a 2 + b3 ) where a, b are determined as above. The proof is completed. • Generally, to handle difficult problems by this method, we need to construct a lot of equations then solve them. This work (solving systems of equations) can be complicated but unavoidable. The following example presents such a severe trial. Example 6.1.4. Let a, b, c be three positive constants and x, y, z three positive vari- ables such that ax + by + cz = xy z. Prove that if there exists a unique positive number d such that 2 1 1 1 d=a+d+b+d+c+d' then the minimum of x + y + z is Jd(d + a)(d + b)(d + c). (Nguyen Quoc Khanh, VMEO 2006) 6.0. The method of balancing coefficients 101 SOLUTION. To avoid the complicated condition ax + by + cz = xyz, we will find the minimum of the following homogeneous expression (ax + by + cz)(x + y + z)2 xyz Certainly, if the minimum of the above expression is equal to C then the minimum value of x + y + z is equal to C, too. Assume that m, n, P, mI, nl, PI are arbitrary positive real numbers such that m + n + P = amI + bn l + CPI = 1. By the weighted AM-GM inequality, we have ax -I- by + cz = amI (~) + bnI (.JL) + CPI (~) ~ xa: y:: z:: ' mi nl PI m~ lni lpl I xaml+2mybnl+2nZ2PI +2p ~ (ax+by+cZ)(X+y+Z)2 ~ 2m 2n 2p ami bn l CPI' m n P m i n 1 PI with equality for ~ = J!.. = .:., ~ = .JL = ~. Moreover, we also need the condition m n P mi nl PI 2m 2n 2p am! + 2m = bnI + 2n = CPI + 2p = 1. Denote k = - = - = -, then mi ni PI These conditions combined yield that Because d is unique, we must have k = d . After a simple calculation, we get that and the conclusion follows. Comment. This inequality is generalized from the following problem in the Vietnam TST 2001 proposed by 'fran Nam Dung * Let a, b, C be positive real numbers such that 12 ~ 21ab + 2bc + 8ca. Prove that 1 2 3 15 -+-+- >-. abc - 2 v 102 Chapter 6. The basic Inequalities - • In some situations, solving systems of equations to find intermediate variables is not at all real computing. Sometimes it completely depends on your own intuition, because solving these equations to find roots can be impossible. But you can guess these roots! That's what I want emphasize in the next example. Example 6.1.5. Let Xl. X2 • ...• Xn be positive real numbers. Prove that SOLUTION. Suppose that a 1. a2 • ...• an are positive real numbers.

Therefore. for all k> 1, we have For k = 1. we also have 1 1 I aIr! = 12 + 22 + ... + n 2 ~ 2 ~ e. Chapter 6 The Method of Balanced Coefficients In many problems, grouping terms in order to use classical inequalities is not easy, especially for non-symmetric inequalities. In these cases, the coefficients of similar terms are normally not equal to each other and therefore we not only have to use basic inequalities properly but als~ have to case take care of the equality so that this case is maintained throughout the solution. How should use deal with this matter? Generally, we need to use additional variables then solve the equations to find out the original variables in the end. This method is called the method of balanced coefficients. In order to see this important method at work, let's start with the following simple example Example 6.0.S. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers and xy +yz + zx = 1. Prove that SOLUTION. Let's first see a nice, short and a bit magic solution, before we give a general and natural solution. By AM-GM inequality, we deduce that 2x2 + 2y2 ~ 4xy, 8x2 + lj2z2 ~ 4xz and 8y2 + lj2z2 ~ 4yz. Adding up these inequalities, we have lOx2 + lOy2 + z2 ~ 4(xy + yz + zx) = 4. 97 98 Equality holds for x=y 4x = z 4y = z Chapter 6. The basic l1)equalities - { X = y = 1/3 z = 4/3. This solution really needs to be examined. Some questions are posed: why could we separate 10 = 2 + 8? Is it lucky and accidental? Is it obvious? If we separate 10 in other ways, such that 10 = 3 + 7 or 10 = 4 + 6, do we go get the same final result? In fact, every other separation is not effective and the separation 10 = 2 + 8 is not lucky. Not surprisingly, we have already used the method of balanced coefficients, which is hidden in this apparently obvious solution. Let's continue with two major means of applying this method: balancing coefficients by AM-GM inequality and balancing coefficients by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. 6.1 Balancing coefficients by AM-GM inequality No matter how familiar you are with balancing coefficients, non-symmetric inequalities with a chaotic of coefficients always cause a lot of difficulties. Therefore, using this method deftly can help you avoid a lot 0 computations. The following general proof will explain how we got the solution in example 6.0.8. Example 6.1.1. Let k be a positive real number. Find the minimum of where x, y, z are three positive real numbers such that xy + yz + zx = 1. SOLUTION. We separate k = 1 + (k - l) (with the condition a :::; 1 :::; k) and apply AM-GM inequality in the following form lx2 + ly2 ~ 2lxy (k -l)x 2 + 1/2z2 ~ J2(k -l)xz (k _l)y2 + 1/2z2 ~ J2(k -l)yz. These results, combined, yield that 6.0. The method of balancing coefficients 103 6.2 Balancing coefficients by Cauchy-Schwarz and Holder inequalities A great difference between Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, Holder inequality and AM-GM inequality is the case when equality holds. This feature also leads to differ- ent ways to balance coefficients in these inequalities. Let's contemplate the following examples to get an overview. Example 6.2.1. Suppose that x, y, z are thr-ee positive real numbers verifying x + y + z = 3. Find the minimum of the expression SOLUTION. Let a, b, c be three positive real numbers such that a+b+c = 3. According to Holder inequality, we obtain We will choose a, b, c such that a 3 = 2b3 = 3c 3 = k3, and if then 4 4 .,,4 > k 12 (X + y + Z)4 _ (3k3 )4 X + 2y + 3... - (a4 + 2b4 + 3& )3 - (a4 + 2b4 + 3&)3 (**) . . x y z The equahty m (*) happens when - = -b = -. Because x + y + z = a + b + c = 3, we a c get a = x b = y c = z. We find that k = 3 and a = k b = .ifj.k c = lf3k. , , 1+.ifj.+~\" The minimum of X4 + 2y4 + 3z4 is given by (**). Comment. The following general problem can be solved by the same method * Suppose that Xl, X2, ... , xn are positive real numbers with sum nand aI, a2, ... , an are positive real constants. For each positive integer m, find the minimum of By Holder inequality, we find that the minimum of this expression is na m - 1 where • n a = 1 I 1 m Val + m ifti2 + ... + m Val Example 6.2.2. Let al,a2, ... ,an be positive real numbers. Prove that 104 Chapter 6. The basic Inequalities - SOLUTION. Let Xl, X2, ... , Xn be positive real numbers (we will determine them at the end).

The proof is completed. Example 6.2.3. Let Xl! X2, ... , Xn be positive real numbers. Prove that SOLUTION. Let a:l,a:2, ... ,a:n be positive real numbers.

So t = 2 and we conclude that 2n+I 4sin 2(2:+1) Chapter 7 Derivative and Applications We will discuss now one of the most important concepts of Mathematics. Just by realizing the great impact of derivatives on the development of Mathematics, you will understand how widely and deeply derivatives are affecting the world of inequalities nowadays. Therefore it's necessary for you to comprehend this concept and master it as one expert. 7.1 Derivative of one-variable functions The principal objective of derivatives is to help examine one-variable functions. To find maximum or minimum of a 4function which has only one variable, derivatives seems to be infallible work. That's the reason we believe that every inequality in one variable is either solved by derivatives or impossible to be solved. The application of derivatives to one-variable functions is not restricted one- variable inequalities. III fact, can help you to solve many n-variable inequalities as you will see in the following pages. Example 7.1.1. Find the minimum value of xx, if x is a positive real number. SOLUTION. Consider the function f(x) = XX = ex1nx . Its derivative is f'(x) eX1nX(lnx + 1). Clearly, f'(x) = 0 ¢:} lnx = -1 ¢:} x = lie . In (0, ~], f(x) is strictly decreasing and in [~, +00 ) I f(x) is strictly increasing. That means minf(x) = f (~) =~. xER e e .. 107 108 Chapter 7. The basic Inequalities - Example 7.1.2.

The following general problem can be solved in a similar fashion * Let al,a2, ... ,an be positive real numbers with sum 1. Prove that for all real numbers s ~ t ~ 0, we have ( ) s ( )B ( )B ( )t ( )t ( )t al a2 a al a2 a + + ... + n > + + ... + n 1 - al 1 - a2 1 - an - 1 - al 1 - a2 1 - an Example 7.1.3.

Consider the function I(x) = (x - a)(x - b)(x - e)(x - d) = X4 - Ax 3 + Bx 2 - Cx + D where A = La, B = Lab, C = Labe, D = abed. Bym Bym Bym Since the equation I(x) = a has 4 positive real roots, we infer that (by Rolle the- orem) the equation f'(x) = a has 3 positive real roots, too. Denote these roots m, n,p (m, n,p > 0), then !,(x) = 4(x- m)(x-n)(x- p) = 4x 3 -4(m+n + p)x2 +4(mn+ np+ pm)x -4mnp . • 7.0. Derivative and Applications 109 Notice that we also have f'(x) = 4x 3 - 3Ax2 + 2Bx - C, so B = 2(mn + np + pm) and C = 4mnp. By AM-GM inequality, we conclude that I¥ = Jmn+7+ pm ~ ?!mnp= ~. Comment. Suppose that Xl, X2, ... , Xn are positive real numbers and d l , d2, ... , dn are the polynomials defined as With the same method, we can prove the following results * (Newton inequality). For all positive real numbers Xli X2, ... , Xn * (Maclaurin inequality). For all positive real numbers Xl, X2, ... , Xn Example 7.1.4. Prove that 0 ~ a ~ 1 ~ b ~ 3 ~ e :::; 4 if a, b, e are real numbers satisfying the conditions a:::; b ~ e, a + b + e = 6, ab + be + ea = 9. (British MO) SOLUTION. Denote p = abc and consider the function / (x) = (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) = x3 - 6x2 + 9x - p. We have f'(x) = 3x2-12x+9 = 3(x-1)(x-3) . Therefore /'(x) = 0 or X = 1 Vx = 3. Because / (x) has three roots a ~ b ~ e, we infer 1 :::; b:::; 3 , /(1)f(3) :::; O. Note that f(l) = f(4) = 4 - p and f(O) = /(3) = -p, so we have 0 :::; p :::; 4.' That implies f(l) = f(4) 2: 0 and f(O) = f(3) :::; 0, If /(0) = /(3) = 0 then a = 0, b = e = 3 and the desired result is obvious. If f(l) = /(4) = 0 then a = b = 1, e = 4 and the desired result is obvious as well. Otherwise, we must have /(O)f(l) < 0, /(1)f(3)<0, f(3)f(4)<0 and therefore a E (0,1), bE (1,3), e E (3,4). The proof is finished. 110 Chapter 7. The basic Inequalities - 7.2 Derivative of n-Variable Functions If you feel that one variable functions are easy already, if you feel their extremums can always be easily found by derivative, let's take a glimpse at functions of more variables. Although it's much more difficult to find the extremums of functions of n variables, we approach these problems is the same as what we do with one-variable functions. If there are some conditions that restrict variables, try to change and eliminate these conditions and make a new expression where every variable is independent from each other, then find the extremum of this new expression as a one-variable function of each variable. Let's see the following examples to clarify the method . Example 7.2.1. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers. Prove that a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + 3abc ~ ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). SOLUTION. WLOG, assume that a ~ b ~ c. Consider the function of a: / (a) a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + 3abc - ab(a + b) - bc(b + c) - ca(c + a). We have j'(a) = 3a2 + 3bc - 2ab - b2 - 2ac - c2. Notice that /\"(a) = 6a - 2b - 2c ~ 0 and f\"(b) ~ 0, so f'(a) ~ /'(b) = c(b - c) 2:: O. ALgo, J'(x) ~ f'(b) ~ 0, (V)x E (b,a), since f\" is linear, therefore positive on (b,a). That implies J(a) ~ J(b) = c(b - c)2 2:: O. The proof is finished . • Example 7.2.2. Let a, b, c, d be positive real numbers such that 2(ab + bc + ed + da + ac + bd) + abc + bed + eda + dab = 16. Prove the following inequality 2 a + b + c + d ~ \"3 (ab + bc + cd + da + ac + bd). (Vietnam MO 1996) SOLUTION. By a similar reasoning as in example 7.1.3, we deduce that there exist positive real numbers x, y, z for which 4 2: a = \"3 2: x, Lab = 2 2: xy, L abc = 4xy z. sym sym sym syrn sym It remains to prove that if xy + yz + zx + xyz = 4 then x + y + z ~ xy + yz + zx. 7.0. Derivative and Applications 111 Certainly, there exist two numbers, say x and y, both greater than 1 or both smaller than 1. In this case, (x-1)(y-l) 2: 0 => xy+ 1 2: x+y. We denote m = x+y, n = xy 4-n then z = . If m > 4 then x + y + z > 4 > xy + zx + zx and the conclusion m+n - - - 2 follows . Otherwise, m - 1 < n < m < 4 and we need to prove - - 4 - 4-n (4-n)m m+ > +n m+n- m+n ¢} fen) = -n 2 +n(m-l) +m2 - 4m+4 2: o. Notice that f'(n) = -2n + m -1 $ -n + m - 1 $ 0, so fen) is decreasing, therefore fen) 2: f (:2) = (16 - m:~(m - 2)2 2: O. We are done. Equality holds for a = b = c = d = 1 . • Example 7.2.3. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers. Prove that a3 + b 3 + c 3 + 9abc + 4(a + b + c) 2: 8(ab + bc + ca). (Le Trung Kien) SOLUTION. We denote feb) = b 3 + b(4 + 9ac - 8a - 8c) + a 3 + c 3 + 4(a + c) - 8ac. By AM-GM inequality, (a 3 + 4a) + (c3 + 4c) 2: 4a2 + 4c2 2: 8ac, so the problem is proved in case 4+9ac 2: 8(a+c), with equality for a = c = 2, b = 0 and a = b = c = O. Otherwise, let x = a + c, y = ac then, 8x 2: 9y + 4. Notice that J8X- 9y-4 j'(b) = 3b2 - (8x - 9y - 4), so f'(b) = 0 ¢} b = 3 and therefore f(b) ;;0, f ( J8x - ~y - 4) = 3~(8X - 9y - 4)3/2 + x 3 + 4x - 3xy - 8y = g(y). x 2 Because y $ \"4 and y $ 8x-4 9 (that also means x 2: 1 2)' as get Y<min(x2 8X-4) =t. - 4' 9 ley) = 3J3(8x - 9y - 4) - (3x + 8) $ 3J3(8x - 4) - (3x + 8) < o. 112 Chapter 7. The basic Inequalities - 8x-4 Thus g(y) is strictly decreasing and therefore g(y) > g(t). If t = 9 then g(t) = x3 + 4x - 3xt - 8t ~ 0 (or equivalently a3 + c 3 + 4(a + c) - Bac ~ 0). It's enough x2 x to consider the remaining case t = 4 and prove that g(t) ~ O. Denote s = 2' the inequality g ( :2) = g( 82) ~ 0 is equivalent to • h(s) = 2s3 - 8s2 + 8s - 3~(168 - 982 - 4)3/2 ~ O . . /168 - 9s 2 - 4 Because h'(8) = 6s2 - 168 + 8 - (16 - 18s)V 3 ' if h'(8) = 0 for some 8 8 8+ J28 then we must have - < 8 < and 9 - - 9 3(282 - 88 + 4)2 = (9 - 8s)2(168 - 9s 2 - 4) <=> (8 - 1)(189s3 - 49582 + 3728 - 76) = O. Notice that the equation 18983 - 495s2 + 372s - 76 = 0 has exactly one real root in the interval [~, 8 +9,/28], so it's easy to infer that h(s) ~ h(l) = O. Equality holds for a = b = c = 1 or a = b = c = 0 or a = b = 2, c = 0 up to permutation. Example 7.2.4. Suppose n is an integer greater than 2 and that the n positive real numbers xI. X2, ... , Xn satisfy the condition ( 1 1 1) ~ 2 (Xl + X2 + ... + xn) - + - + ... + - :::; (n + v 10 - 3) . Xl X2 Xn Prove that every 3-uple (Xi,Xj,Xk) (1:::; i < j < k:::; n andi,j,k E N) can be the length-sides of a triangle. (Improved IMO 2004, Bl) SOLUTION. It suffices to prove the following result (that directly solves this problem) Suppose that Xl ~ X2 ~ ... 2: Xn > 0 are real numbers verifying Xl > X2 + X3, then (1 1 1) ~ 2 (Xl + x2 + ... + xn) - + - + ... + - > (n + v 10 - 3) . Xl X2 Xn Indeed, we will prove it by induction. For n = 3, the inequality becomes 7.0. Derivative and Applications 113 Let f(xt) = L XI X2(Xl + X2) - 7XIX2X3 then eye J'(xd = 2Xl(X2 + X3) + x~ + x~ -7X2X3 > 2(X2 + X3)2 + x~ + x~ - 7X2X3 > o. This implies that f(xd ~ f(X2 + ·X3) = (X2 + X3)2(X2 - X3) > O. We are done. Now return to the problem of n + 1 variables (with the supposition that it is true for n variables). We need to prove that n n Denote A = L Xi and B = LxiI, then AB > (n + V16 - 3)2 by hypothesis. Let i=l i=l x = Xn+l then AlB > x~ ~ x 2 =* vAIB > x. Denote f( x) = (x + A) (;. + B) = Bx + : + 1 + AB. A We have of course f'ex) = B - \"2 and therefore f'ex) = 0 <=> x = V AlB. Thus x f(x) 2: f (I:) ~ (1 + JAB)' > (n + JW- 2)'. The inductive step is completed and we are done. Example 7.2.5. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that 12 ~ 21ab + 2bc + 8ea. Prove that 1 2 3 15 -+-+- <-. abc - 2 (Tran Nam Dung, Vietnam TST 2001) SOLUTION. Although this problem has been solved in the previous part by balancing coefficients, it's seem to be more intuitive to give a solution by derivatives. Let x = '!,y = -b 2 ,z =~. We will prove an equivalent problem as follows . a c 15 If x, y, z > 0 and 12xyz > 2x + 8y + 21z then P(x, y, z) = x + 2y + 3z ::; 2' Indeed, by hypothesis we have z(12xy-21) ~ 2x + 8y > O. So we infer that 12xy ~ 21, 7 2x + 8y or x > -4 and z ~ 2 2' That means y 1 xy - 1 2x+8y P(x, y, z) ~ x + 2y + 7 = f(x). 4xy- 114 Chapter 7. The basic Inequalities - We have of course f'(x) = 16x2 y2 - 56xy - 32y2 + 35. (4xy -7)2 In the range (2-, +00), the equation f' (x) = 0 has only one root x = Xo = : + 4y • Y V 32y2 + 14 . At x = Xo, f'(x) changes its sign from negative to positive, so f(x) 4y attains the minimum at Xo. It implies 5 f(x) 2: f(xo) = 2xo - 4y ::::} P(x, y, z) 2: f(x) + 2y 2: f(xo) + 2y = g(y) where 9 1 r-----,-- g(y) = 2y + - + -v'32 y2 + 14. 4y 2y A simple calculation will show that g'(y) = 0 <=> (8y2 - 9)V32 y2 + 14 - 28 = O. Denote t = V32y2 + 14, then t > O. The above equation becomes t 3 - 50t -112 = O. This equation has only one positive real root t = 8, or y = Yo = ~, thus g' (~) = O. In the range y > 0, at y = Yo, g'(Y) changes its sign from negative to positive, hence g(y) attains the minimum at Yo. So we conclude that g(yo) = 9 (~) = 1; and 15 5 , 2 then P(x,y,z) 2: g(y) 2: g(yo) = 2' Equality holds for y = 4'x = 3,z = 3\" or 1 4 3 a = -,b = -,c = - . We are done . 3 5 2 Example 7.2.6.

Each problem has its own features. If you can fathom the particular features, you can find particular methods to solve them. For example, you are aware of using balancing coefficients to solve non-cyclic inequalities or using symmetric separation to solve symmetric inequalities. These solutions are, generally, technical and hard to figure out. However, derivatives are different. Although solutions by derivatives are, in fact, coarse and require some long computations, they are very natural. That's the reason why derivatives are so important and indispensable in every part of the field of inequalities and mathematics as well. • • Chapter 8 A note on SYlllllletric inequalities In the beautiful world of inequalities, symmetric inequalities seem to be the most important and most beloved kind. This kind of inequalities also plays a major part in Mathematics Contests allover the world and the overview in this chapter is really necessary. Although there are a lot of interesting stories regarding symmetric inequal- ities that will be unveiled in the following chapters; right now, in these pages, we will review three essential matters: primary symmetric polynomials, normalization skill and symmetric separation. 8.1 Getting started In general, a symmetric inequality of n variables at, a2, ... , an can be rewritten as where for all permutations (il, i2, ... , in) of (1,2, .'\" n). Because of the symmetry, we can rearrange the order of variables (that means we can choose an arbitrary order). Because of the symmetry, we can estimate a mixed expression by smaller expressions of one-variable. 117 118 Chapter 8. The basic Inequalities - Schur inequality is a very important symmetric inequality and it would be a shortcoming if it wasn't discussed now. Theorem 10 (Schur inequality). Suppose that a. b, c are non-negative real numbers, then a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + 3abc 2: ab(a + b) + bc(b + c) + ca(c + a). PROOF. Because of the symmetry, we can assume that a .2: b .2: c.

This inequality is, in fact, equivalent to the following well-known result * Suppose that a, b, c are non-negative real numbers. Prove that (a + b - c) (b + c - a) (c + a - b) ~ abc.

We define their primary symmetric poly- nomials for each k E {I, 2, .... n} as follow in which the sum is taken over all {i lt i 2 , .. . . id C {1,2 .... ,n}. An important and classical result on primary symmetric polynomials is that * Every symmetric polynomial of Xl, X2, ... , Xn can be expressed as a polynomial with variables the primary symmetric polynomials of Xl, X2, ... , Xn . The proof of this theorem won't be showed here and it would better be solved by yourself as an algebraic exercise. According to this theorem, examining symmetric expressions can be turned into examining primary symmetric polynomials. In this part, however, we only concentrate on applying primary symmetric polynomials in proving three-variable inequalities. 8.0. A note one symmetric inequalities 123 Example 8.2.1.

Since f'(q) = 14q - 6p = 14abc - 3(a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) < 0, we deduce that f(q) < f(r). If p ~ 1 then T = 0 and we can conclude that 128 Chapter 8.

This last inequality is true since p < ~. Equality holds for a = b = 1, c = 0 or permutations. • 8.3 Normalization skill An important technique that is frequently used in proving symmetric inequalities is normalization. To understand this technique, we first need to clarify the difference between homogeneous functions and non-homogeneous functions. Definition 2. Suppose that f is a function ofn variables al,a2, ... ,an . We say that f is a homogeneous function if and only if there exist a real number k such that Almost all inequalities we have seen so far are homogeneous. In this case, a con- dition between variables Xl, X2, ... , Xn such as Xl + X2 + ... + Xn = n or XIX2\",Xn = 1 is meaningless (because we can divide (or multiply) each variable by arbitrary real numbers but the result of the problem is not affected). Sometimes, the condition only helps simplify the appearance of the problem, as with the following example Example 8.3.1. Suppose that a, b, c are three real numbers satisfying a2 +b2 +c2 = 3. Prove the following inequality SOLUTION. Certainly, the inequality is non-homogeneous . However, the condition a2 + b 2 + c? = 3 can help change it to homogeneous as Rewrite this inequality to eye eye eye 8.0. A note one symmetric inequalities 129 eye eye eye which is obvious. Equality holds for a = b = e, and then a = b = e = 1. Comment. Consider the general problem as follows * Suppose that al,a2, ... ,an are non-negative real numbers such that at + a~ + + ... + a~ = n. For what value of n then the following inequality holds Only two numbers satisfy this condition: n = 3 and n = 4. If n = 4, the inequality is (after changing aI, a2, a3, a4 to a, b, e, d) 4 L a3(b + e + d) S 3(a2 + b2 + e2 + d2)2 eye eye eye Changing non-homogeneous inequalities to homogeneous inequalities as above seems to be very intuitive. But what about the reverse? Is it unreasonable if we change a homogeneous inequality to a non-homogeneous one? Does it have any meaning? To answer this question, let's see an example Example 8 .3.2. Let a, b, e be noft-negaiive real numbers. Prove that J ab + be + ca 3 (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ---------< . 3 - 8 SOLUTION. WLOG, suppose that ab+bc+ca = 3. By AM-GM inequality, we deduce that a + b + c ;::: 3 and abc S 1. Therefore (a + b) (b + c) ( e + a) = (a + b + c) ( ab + be + ca) - abc = 3 (a + b + c) - abc ;::: 8 J ab + be + ca 1 3 (a + b)(b + c)(e + a) =} < < . 3 - - 8 The proof is completed. Equality holds for a = b = e. Let's review this solution. Its exceptional feature is the step of asswning that ab + be + ca = 3. Why can we do so? In fact, if a = b = e = 0, the inequality 130 Chapter 8. The basic Inequalities - is obvious. Otherwise, let a' = ~, b' = ~, c' = ~ (t > 0). The inequality is true t t t lab + bc+ ca for a, b, c if and only if it's true for a', b', c'. Just choose t = V 3 then a' b' + b' c' + d a' = 3. Because the inequality is true for a', b' , c' (as we proved), it must be true for a, b, c. Let's analyze another fact. What happen if we suppose that a + b + e = 3 or abc = 1 instead of ab + be + ca = 3? However, they do bring us either a much more complicated solution or even nothing. The procedure we used is called normalization. This skill is widely applied for homogeneous inequalities because these inequalities allows us to suppose anything that we need: a+b+c = 3, ab+be+ ca = 3, etc. Sometimes, solutions by normalization are unexpectedly short and nice as in the following examples Example 8.3.3. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers. Prove that (2a+b+c)2 (2b+e+a)2 (2e+a+b)2 8 2a2 + (b + e)2 + 2b2 + (e + a)2 + 2e2 + (a + b)2::; . (USA MO 2003) SOLUTION.

In this part, we will explain how to use \"symmetric separation\", an approach that has been used previously. This approach can help us solve many problems which are represented in the form fndeed, to prove such inequalities, we will find functions g(x) such that f(x) ~ g(x) and Let's consider the following example 8.0.

We predict that such a number k will bring about /'(1) = O. Since ') -8x + 2 J (x ==- (3x 2 + (x _ 1)2)2 k , x -2 we infer k = 3' In this case, J'( ) - -8x+ 2 _ ~ _ 2(x-1)(16x 3 -1) x - 2 +- - 2' (3x2 + (x - -1 )2) 3x 3x (3x2 + (x - 1)2) Unfortunately, the equation J'(x) ,::;; 0 has more than one root, so the inequality J(x) ~ 0 is wrong (in fact, if we let x --+ 0 then J(x) --+ -00). However, from the derivative of J(x), we can at least obtain that J(x) ~ J(1) = 0 for all x E [~, +00 ) . So if all a, b, c belong to [~, +00 ) , we have are 1 (1 2 ) > - - - . In a = 1.

Equality holds for a = b = c = 1. Making up the estimation 1 1 3a2 + (a _ 1) 2 ~ 3 ~ k In a is a technique called \"symmetric separation\". If it's hard to prove L f(x,,) ~ 0, eye we can separate this sum into smaller components f(Xi) ~ g(Xi) then prove that L g(Xi) ~ O. Also, g(x) should be guessed from the data given in the hypothesis: if eye the hypothesis is XIX2\",Xn = 1, we may predict g(x) = klnx (k is a constant); if the hypothesis is Xl +X2 + ... +Xn = n, we may predict g(x) = k(x-l); if the hypothesis is xi + x~ + .. , + x~ = n, we may predict g(x) = k(x 2 - 1), etc. Notice that these predictions must also depend on the case of equality (for example, above predictions of g(x) are based on the case Xl = X2 = .. , = Xn = 1). How do we figure out a valid number k? Suppose that f(x) has derivative and you predict that case Xl = X2 = ... = Xn = 1 makes up the equality then, is given by f'(I) = O. Although in some situations, the inequality f(x) ~ g(x) doesn't hold for all X in the required range, it can hold for a large range of X and the work left may easy, as in example 8.4.1 when we examined case a =:; ~.

Problems and Solutions - (Pham Kim Hung) SOLUTION. First, we notice that the inequality only needs to be considered for a, b, c non-negative. Now, consider the identity x 3 + y3 + z3 _ 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x 2 + y2 -I- z2 - xy - yz - zx) therefore, (x + y + z)(x 3 + y3 + z3 - 3xyz) ~ 0, so we can write eye eye Without loss of generality, assume that a ~ b ~ c. Notice that the inequality is obvious if {f2b2 - ca ~ 0, {f2c2 - ab ~ O. It is also obvious if (2b2 - ca)(2c2 - ab) ~ 0 (due to (*)), so we may assume that 2b2 - ca ~ 0,2c2 - ab ~ O. (ii). The first case. a ~ 2(b + c). We conclude that 2a2 - bc ~ 4(ab - 2c2 + ac - 2b2) :} {!2a 2 - bc ~ -thb2 - ca-{!2c2 - ab :} {!2a 2 - bc + {!2b2 - ca + {!2c2 - ab ~ O. We used the inequality {/4(x + y) ~ ~ + ¢Y. (i). The second case. If a < 2(b + c). WLOG, assume that abc = 1. We have to prove that Denote f(a, b, c) = 2(a2 + b 2 + c 2) - (ab + bc + ca) - 3 {!(2a3 - 1)(1 - 2b3)(1 - 2c3). We clearly have f(a, b, c) ~ f(a, VbC, VbC) since 2(a2 + b 2 + c2 ) - (ab + bc + ca) ~ 2(a2 + 2bc) - (2aJbc + bc) ; and It remains to prove the initial inequality in the case b = c, namely 9.0. Problems and Solutions 187 This inequality is equivalent to 2a 2 + 15b2 ~ gab, which is clearly true due to AM-GM inequality. Equality holds for a = b = e = O. Comment. The following stronger inequality holds . 1 + V513 * Owen real numbers a, b, e, and k = 16 ' then \\!ka 2 - be + \\!kb2 - ca + \\!ke2 - ab ~ O. To prove it, we use the same technique as shown in the above proof. Similarly, we only need to consider the main case a ~ b ~ e, abc = 1, kb3 ~ 1 and ke3 ~ 1. Let I(a, b, c) = k(a 2 + b2 + e2) - (ab + be + ca) - 3\\!(ka 3 - 1)(1 - kb3 )(1 - ke3 ). We are done easily if a ~ k( Vb + JC)2 since, in this case, we have I(a, b, c) > l(a,.JbC, .JbC). It remains to consider the case a ~ k(Vb + JC)2. Denote g(a) = ka2 - be + 4(kb2 + ke2 - ab - ae). We infer that g'(a) = 2ka - 4k(b+ c) ~ 2k2 (Jb + JCf - 4(b+ c) ~ O. Therefore g(a) ~ 9 (k (Jb + JC) 2) . Denote x = Vb, y = JC.

Therefore g( a) = ka 2 - be + 4( kb2 + ke2 - ab - ae) ~ 0 => \\!ka2 - be ~ \\!4(ab+ ae - kb2 - kc2) ~ \\!ab - ke2 + \\!ae - kb2 => {lka2 - be+ {jkb2 - ca + {lke2 - ab ~ 0, ( (8k=::r ) which is the desired result.

Otherwise, if ce ~ 3 then and we are done. Equality holds for a = -1, b = c = 2 up to permutation. (ii). If a ~ 0 : The problem can be rewritten as Since 2abc ~ a 3 + ab2 , we only need to prove 3 + abc ~ ae <=? 3 ~ ac( c - b). a ::; b, hence c ~ J9 - 2a2 , so ac(c - b) ::; ac(c .. a) ~ aV9 - 2a2 ( J9 - 2a 2 - a).

Suppose a, b ~ 0 and a + b = 2t ~ 1 then we have Indeed, WLOG assume that a ~ b. There exists a non-negative real number x with a = t + x, b = t - x.

Problems and Solutions - • This inequality can be rewritten to where Sa, Sb, Se are given by Notice that we will prove (*) for all non-negative real nwnbers a, b, c (we have already dismissed the condition a + b + c = 3). Because all Sa, Sb, Se are linear functions of a, b, c, if we replace a, b, c with a - t, b - t, c - t (t $ min(a, b, c)) then the differences a - b, b - c, c - a are unchanged, the left hand expression of (*) is unchanged but the right hand expression of (*) is decreased. So it suffices to prove the inequality in the case min(a, b, c) = 0 (as we let t = min(a, b, c)) and it becomes which is clearlyAM-GM inequality because 2a + b = 3. Second Solution.

We will prove (1) in order to show (2) and then (3). The proof of (1). Certainly, it suffices to prove the inequality in the case e = min{a,b,e} = 0 (because if we decrease a,b,c by an arbitrary positive real number smaller then e then the right-hand expression of (1) is unchanged, but the left-hand side is decreased) . If e = 0, the condition (1) becomes (3a - b)(a - b)2 + (3b + 2a)b2 + (-a + 2b)a2 ~ 3ab(a - b) <=* 2a3 - 8a2b + 10ab2 + 2b3 ~ 0 <=* h(x) = 2x3 - 8x2 + lOx + 2 ~ 0, a where x = b . Notice that h'(x) = 2(x - 1)(3x - 5), so it's easy to conclude that h(x) ~ f (~) > 5 > o. Therefore (1) is proved. Now let us show that (1) gives (2) . The proof of (2) . Let a = al + t = fl (t), b =\"P>1 + t = h(t), e = el + t = h(t) then (2) is equivalent to f(t) = L (l1JI (t)2 - h(t)2 - 4ft(t)h(t) + 6h(t)2) (a-b)2-8(ft(t)+ h(t)+ h(t))M ~ o. eye According to (1), we can see that f'(t) = 2: (18fl (t)-6h(t)+12h(t))(a-b)2-24M = 6 2:(3a-b+2e)(a-b?-24M ~ 0 eye eye 9.0.

Therefore (2) is proved successfully. The proof of(3). Similarly, according to (2) and using the same reasoning as above, we realize that it suffices to prove (3) in case min{a,b,c} = c = o. In this case, the inequality becomes <=> 4a5 - lOa 4b + 6a 3b 2 + 3a2 b 3 + ab4 + 4b5 2: 0 If 2a 2: 3b then we are done because 4a 5 - lOa4 b + 6a 3b 2 = 2a3 (a - b)(2a - 3b) 2: o.
