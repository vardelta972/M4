Prove that there exist inﬁnitely many n ∈ N such that S(3 n) ≥ S(3 n+1) where S(k) denotes the sum of digits of k. 2. Find all continuous functions f : [0; +∞) → R such that f (0) = 1 and (f (x)) k = f (x√ k) for all k∈N and x≥0 3. Let n ∈ N. A denotes the set of all binary sequences of length n. For a, b ∈ A, we deﬁne a + b as c = (c1, c2, ..., cn) where ci = 0 if ai = bi and ci = 1 if ai ̸= bi. For example if n = 4, a = (1, 0, 0, 1) and b = (1, 1, 0, 1), then a + b = (0, 1, 0, 0). Let f : A → A such that f (ϕ) = ϕ where ϕ=(0, 0, ..., 0). It is found that if the sequences a and b diﬀer in exactly k terms, then the sequences f (a) and f (b) also diﬀer in exactly k terms. Show that for a, b, c ∈ A, a + b + c = ϕ =⇒ f (a) + f (b) + f (c) = ϕ. 4. Let a, b, c ≥ 0 such that a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove that 3 √ a3 + b3 + c3 3 + a + b + c 9 ≥ 4 3 5. Given n ≥ 4, prove that every cyclic quadrilateral can be dissected into n cyclic quadri- laterals. By dissecting a quadrilateral, we mean partitioning a quadrilateral by some line seg- ments. Given below is a dissection of a quadrilateral into 3 quadrilaterals: 6. Every cell in an nxn grid is ﬁlled by some number. It is found that sum of the largest two numbers in each row is a and the sum of largest two numbers in each column is b. Show that a=b. 7. f : R → R is a diﬀerentiable function such that lim x→∞ f (x) is ﬁnite. Is it necessarily true that lim x→∞ f ′(x) = 0? If your answer is yes, give a detailed proof. If your answer is no, provide a counter example and give reason why your example works. 8. Prove that there exists inﬁnitely many pairs (a, b) of integers such that the equation x2020 = ax + b has among its solutions two distinct real numbers whose product is 1. Here are two pictures to boost your conﬁdence:","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
