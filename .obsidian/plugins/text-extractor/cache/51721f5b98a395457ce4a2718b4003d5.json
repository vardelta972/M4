Compute the number of primes less than 1,000,000,000 that have no non-prime subnumbers.

(Eugene Chen) For which positive integer n is the quantity n 3 + 40 n minimized? 3. (Lewis Chen) In chess, there are two types of minor pieces, the bishop and the knight. A bishop may move along a diagonal, as long as there are no pieces obstructing its path. A knight may jump to any lattice square √ 5 away as long as it isn’t occupied. One day, a bishop and a knight were on squares in the same row of an inﬁnite chessboard, when a huge meteor storm occurred, placing a meteor in each square on the chessboard independently and randomly with probability p. Neither the bishop nor the knight were hit, but their movement may have been obstructed by the meteors. The value of p that would make the expected number of valid squares that the bishop can move to and the number of squares that the knight can move to equal can be expressed as a b for relatively prime positive integers a, b. Compute 100a + b. 4. (Lewis Chen) Let S = {(x, y) : x, y ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2012}}. For all points (a, b), let N (a, b) = {(a−1, b), (a+1, b), (a, b−1), (a, b+1)}.

(Aaron Lin) In quadrilateral ABCD, AC = BD and ∡B = 60◦. Denote by M and N the midpoints of AB and CD, respectively. If M N = 12 and the area of quadrilateral ABCD is 420, then compute AC. 8. (Lewis Chen) Bob has invented the Very Normal Coin (VNC). When the VNC is ﬂipped, it shows heads 1 2 of the time and tails 1 2 of the time - unless it has yielded the same result ﬁve times in a row, in which case it is guaranteed to yield the opposite result. For example, if Bob ﬂips ﬁve heads in a row, then the next ﬂip is guaranteed to be tails. Bob ﬂips the VNC an inﬁnite number of times. On the nth ﬂip, Bob bets 2−n dollars that the VNC will show heads (so if the second ﬂip shows heads, Bob wins $0.25, and if the third ﬂip shows tails, Bob loses $0.125). Assume that dollars are inﬁnitely divisible. Given that the ﬁrst ﬂip is heads, the expected number of dollars Bob is expected to win can be expressed as a b for relatively prime positive integers a, b. Compute 100a + b. 9. (Lewis Chen) In how many ways can the following ﬁgure be tiled with 2 × 1 dominos? 10. (Aaron Lin) In cyclic quadrilateral ABXC, ∡XAB = ∡XAC. Denote by I the incenter of △ABC and by D the projection of I on BC. If AI = 25, ID = 7, and BC = 14, then XI can be expressed as a b for relatively prime positive integers a, b. Compute 100a + b. 8 The NIMO Compendium 5. January 2013 5. January 24, 2013 8:00 PM – 8:30 PM ET 1. (Evan Chen) Tim is participating in the following three math contests. On each contest his score is the number of correct answers. • The Local Area Inspirational Math Exam consists of 15 problems. • The Further Away Regional Math League has 10 problems. • The Distance-Optimized Math Open has 50 problems. For every positive integer n, Tim knows the answer to the nth problems on each contest (which are pairwise distinct), if they exist; however, these answers have been randomly permuted so that he does not know which answer corresponds to which contest. Unaware of the shuﬄing, he competes with his modiﬁed answers. Compute the expected value of the sum of his scores on all three contests. 2. (Eugene Chen) The cost of ﬁve water bottles is $13, rounded to the nearest dollar, and the cost of six water bottles is $16, also rounded to the nearest dollar. If all water bottles cost the same integer number of cents, compute the number of possible values for the cost of a water bottle. 3. (Evan Chen) In triangle ABC, AB = 13, BC = 14 and CA = 15. Segment BC is split into n + 1 congruent segments by n points. Among these points are the feet of the altitude, median, and angle bisector from A. Find the smallest possible value of n. 4. (Aaron Lin) The inﬁnite geometric series of positive reals a1, a2, . . . satisﬁes 1 = ∞∑ n=1 an = − 1 2013 + ∞∑ n=1 GM(a1, a2, . . . , an) = 1 N + a1 where GM(x1, x2, . . . , xk) = k√x1x2 · · · xk denotes the geometric mean. Compute N . 5. (Evan Chen) Compute the number of ﬁve-digit positive integers vwxyz for which (10v + w) + (10w + x) + (10x + y) + (10y + z) = 100. 6. (Lewis Chen) Tom has a scientiﬁc calculator. Unfortunately, all keys are broken except for one row: 1, 2, 3, + and -. Tom presses a sequence of 5 random keystrokes; at each stroke, each key is equally likely to be pressed. The calculator then evaluates the entire expression, yielding a result of E. Find the expected value of E. (Note: Negative numbers are permitted, so 13-22 gives E = −9. Any excess operators are parsed as signs, so -2-+3 gives E = −5 and -+-31 gives E = 31. Trailing operators are discarded, so 2++-+ gives E = 2. A string consisting only of operators, such as -++-+, gives E = 0.) 7. (Evan Chen) For each integer k ≥ 2, the decimal expansions of the numbers 1024, 10242, . . . , 1024k are concatenated, in that order, to obtain a number Xk. (For example, X2 = 10241048576.) If Xn 1024n is an odd integer, ﬁnd the smallest possible value of n, where n ≥ 2 is an integer. 8. (Evan Chen) Let AXY ZB be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle with diameter AB.

(Ivan Koswara) Let f be a function from positive integers to positive integers where f (n) = n 2 if n is even and f (n) = 3n + 1 if n is odd. If a is the smallest positive integer satisfying f (f (· · · f | {z } 2013 f ’s (a) · · · )) = 2013, ﬁnd the remainder when a is divided by 1000. 3. (Kevin Sun) Find the integer n ≥ 48 for which the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of n! is exactly n − 48. 4. (Alexander Dai ) While taking the SAT, you become distracted by your own answer sheet. Because you are not bound to the College Board’s limiting rules, you realize that there are actually 32 ways to mark your answer for each question, because you could ﬁght the system and bubble in multiple letters at once: for example, you could mark AB, or AC, or ABD, or even ABCDE, or nothing at all! You begin to wonder how many ways you could mark oﬀ the 10 questions you haven’t yet answered. To increase the challenge, you wonder how many ways you could mark oﬀ the rest of your answer sheet without ever marking the same letter twice in a row. (For example, if ABD is marked for one question, AC cannot be marked for the next one because A would be marked twice in a row.) If the number of ways to do this can be expressed in the form 2mpn, where m, n > 1 are integers and p is a prime, compute 100m + n + p. 5. (Ahaan Rungta) Zang is at the point (3, 3) in the coordinate plane.

(Ivan Koswara) Find the number of positive integers n for which there exists a sequence x1, x2, · · · , xn of integers with the following property: if indices 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n satisfy i + j ≤ n and xi − xj is divisible by 3, then xi+j + xi + xj + 1 is divisible by 3. 9. (Calvin Lee) Let ABCD be a square of side length 6. Points E and F are selected on rays AB and AD such that segments EF and BC intersect at a point L, D lies between A and F , and the area of △AEF is 36.

May 27, 2013 8:00 PM – 8:40 PM ET 1. (Lewis Chen) At ARML, Santa is asked to give rubber duckies to 2013 students, one for each student. The students are conveniently numbered 1, 2, · · · , 2013, and for any integers 1 ≤ m < n ≤ 2013, students m and n are friends if and only if 0 ≤ n − 2m ≤ 1. Santa has only four diﬀerent colors of duckies, but because he wants each student to feel special, he decides to give duckies of diﬀerent colors to any two students who are either friends or who share a common friend. Let N denote the number of ways in which he can select a color for each student. Find the remainder when N is divided by 1000. 2. (Eugene Chen) In △ABC, points E and F lie on AC, AB, respectively.

A point (x, y) in the ﬁrst quadrant lies on a line with intercepts (a, 0) and (0, b), with a, b > 0. Rectangle M has vertices (0, 0), (x, 0), (x, y), and (0, y), while rectangle N has vertices (x, y), (x, b), (a, b), and (a, y). What is the ratio of the area of M to that of N ? (Eugene Chen) Solution. Throughout this solution the area of region ℜ will be denoted by [ℜ]. Let O = (0, 0), A = (a, 0), B = (0, b), C = (a, b), X = (x, 0), Y = (0, y), X ′ = (x, b), Y ′ = (a, y), and Z = (x, y). It follows that [M ] = [OXZY ] = xy. Because △AXZ ∼ △AOB, we know AX XZ = AO OB =⇒ AX y = a b =⇒ AX = ay b and similarly BY = bx a . But AX = ZY ′ and BY = ZX ′ so [N ] = [ZY ′CX ′] = ZX ′ · ZY ′ = ay b · bx a = xy = [M ]. Hence, [M ] [N ] = 1 . 2. Two sequences {ai} and {bi} are deﬁned as follows: {ai} = 0, 3, 8, . . . , n2 − 1, . . . and {bi} = 2, 5, 10, . . . , n2 + 1, . . . . If both sequences are deﬁned with i ranging across the natural numbers, how many numbers belong to both sequences? (Isabella Grabski) Solution. If there are common members of the sequences, there exist natural numbers k and l such that k2 − 1 = l2 + 1. This may be rewritten as k2 − l2 = 2 (k + l)(k − l) = 2. Because k and l are natural numbers, it follows that k + l = 2. But then k − l = 1, yielding k = 3 2 , a contradiction. Hence, no numbers are members of both sequences. 3. Billy and Bobby are located at points A and B, respectively. They each walk directly toward the other point at a constant rate; once the opposite point is reached, they immediately turn around and walk back at the same rate. The ﬁrst time they meet, they are located 3 units from point A; the second time they meet, they are located 10 units from point B. Find all possible values for the distance between A and B. (Isabella Grabski) 42 The NIMO Compendium 1. Winter Olympiad 2011 Solution. Let X be the ﬁrst meeting point and Y the second. Denote the distance AB by x. Billy and Bobby can meet at at most one point before they reach the point they are traveling to. However, the distance between A and B depends on when they reach the opposite end. We proceed with casework. Case 1: Billy and Bobby reach B and A, respectively, before meeting for a second time. In this case, Billy travels AX before meeting for the ﬁrst time while Bobby walks XB. Before they meet for a second time, Billy walks XB + BY and Bobby walks XA + AY in the same time. Because they walk at constant rates, we have: AX XB = XB + BY XA + AY 3 x − 3 = x − 3 + 10 3 + x − 10 Solving this, we ﬁnd x = 0 or x = −1, neither of which can be walking distances in this problem. So there are no solutions in this case. Case 2: Billy reaches point B ﬁrst and meets Bobby at point Y before Bobby reaches A. In a similar fashion, we ﬁnd x = −12 or x = 5. However, −12 is negative, and 5 is less than 10, so neither can be possible total lengths of the path. Case 3: Bobby reaches point A ﬁrst and meets Billy at point Y before Billy reaches B. This yields x = 4 or x = 15. Because 4 < 10, the path cannot be 4 units long. Thus, the only possible length of the path is 15 units. 4. In the following alpha-numeric puzzle, each letter represents a diﬀerent non-zero digit. What are all possible values for b + e + h? a b c d e f + g h i 1 6 6 5 (Eugene Chen) Solution. We can rewrite the equation as 100(a + d + g) + 10(b + e + h) + (c + f + i) = 1665. Because 100(a + d + g) and 10(b + e + h) have units digit 0, it follows that c + f + i has units digit 5. But c + f + i ≥ 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 > 5, c + f + i ≤ 7 + 8 + 9 = 24 < 25, so c + f + i = 15. We can again rewrite the equation as 100(a + d + g) + 10(b + e + h) = 1650 10(a + d + g) + (b + e + h) = 165. Because 10(a + d + g) has units digit 0, it follows that b + e + h has units digit 5. By the same logic as above, we obtain b + e + h = 15. It remains to show that b + e + h = 15 is achievable. But this may be achieved by setting a = 1, b = 2, c = 4, d = 5, e = 6, f = 3, g = 9, h = 7, i = 8. Hence, the only possible value for b + e + h is 15 . 43 The NIMO Compendium 1. Winter Olympiad 2011 5. We have eight light bulbs, placed on the eight lattice points in space that are √3 units away from the origin. Each light bulb can either be turned on or oﬀ. These lightbulbs are unstable, however. If two light bulbs that are at most 2 units apart are both on simultaneously, they both explode. Given that no explosions take place, how many possible conﬁgurations of on/oﬀ light bulbs exist? (Lewis Chen) Solution. The lightbulbs are located at the points (±1, ±1, ±1) which determine a cube. Note that a conﬁguration will explode only if both lightbulbs on an edge are simultaneously on. We proceed by casework on the number of lightbulbs on. If 0 lightbulbs are on then there is only 1 conﬁguration of the lightbulbs, which indeed satisﬁes the conditions of the problem. If 1 lightbulb is on, then there are 8 conﬁgurations of the lightbulbs, all of which satisfy the conditions of the problem. If 2 lightbulbs are on, then there are ( 8 2 ) = 28 conﬁgurations of the lightbulbs. How- ever, if both endpoints of an edge are lit then the conﬁguration is not satisfactory so there are 28 − 12 = 16 solutions for this case. To count the number of conﬁgurations where 3 lightbulbs are on, ﬁrst choose a lightbulb to be lit. Notice that if the opposite lightbulb is lit, then no more can be lit; hence, the opposite lightbulb is not lit. Additionally, no lightbulbs that share an edge with the original lightbulb can be lit. So there are 3 lightbulbs left to choose from, and each choice of 2 from these 3 satisﬁes the conditions, for ( 3 2 ) = 3 solutions. But the original lightbulb can be chosen in 8 ways, and each case is counted three times (once for each lightbulb as the starting point), so the number of conﬁgurations from this case is 3 · 8 3 = 8. We count the ways for four lightbulbs to be on in the same way as the previous case. After choosing a starting lightbulb, there is ( 3 3 ) = 1 way to light the rest, for a total of 1 · 8 4 = 2 conﬁgurations. In total, there are 1 + 8 + 16 + 8 + 2 = 35 conﬁgurations. 6. Circle ⊙O with diameter AB has chord CD drawn such that AB is perpendicular to CD at P . Another circle ⊙A is drawn, sharing chord CD. A point Q on minor arc CD of ⊙A is chosen so that ∡AQP + ∡QP B = 60◦. Line l is tangent to ⊙A through Q and a point X on l is chosen such that P X = BX. If P Q = 13 and BQ = 35, ﬁnd QX. (Aaron Lin) Solution. Note that △ACB is a right triangle, so CP is the geometric mean of BP and AP . Thus, by the Pythagorean Theorem, AC2 = CP 2 + AP 2 = (AP · BP ) + AP 2 = AP (BP + AP ) = AP · AB. Because AC = AQ it follows that AQ2 = AP · AB. Thus, AQ is tangent to the circum- circle of △BQP . Since line l is perpendicular to AQ through Q, l must pass through the 44 The NIMO Compendium 1. Winter Olympiad 2011 circumcenter of △BQP . Hence, X, which is equidistant from points B and P , must be the circumcenter of △BQP . Furthermore, the equation AP 2 = AP · AB implies that △AP Q ∼ △AQB, so ∠AQP ∼= ∠ABQ ∼= ∠P BQ. Thus, m∠AQP + m∠BP Q = m∠P BQ + m∠BP Q = 60◦, so m∠BQP = 120◦. From the Law of Cosines it follows that BP = 43. By the Law of Sines, QX = BP 2 sin ∠BQP = 43 √3 Hence QX = 43 √3 3 . A B C D P Q X 13 35 7. The number (2 + 296)! has 293 trailing zeroes when expressed in base B. a) Find the minimum possible B. b) Find the maximum possible B. c) Find the total number of possible B. (Lewis Chen) Solution. Deﬁnition: The method of ﬁnding the number of trailing zeroes of N ! in prime base p is as follows: ⌊ N p ⌋ +     ⌊ N p ⌋ p     +         ⌊ ⌊ N p ⌋ p ⌋ p         + . . . . Lemma. 3a divides (2 + 2a)! if and only if 2 + 2a = 3m + 3n for some integer m, n. Proof: Note that a ≤ ∞∑ i=1 ⌊ 2a + 2 3i ⌋ < ∞∑ i=1 2a + 2 3i = a + 1. 45 The NIMO Compendium 1. Winter Olympiad 2011 Thus, ∞∑ i=1 { 2a + 2 3i } = 1. Write 2a + 2 = ∞∑ k=0 dk3k, dk ∈ {0, 1, 2} so ∞∑ i=1 { ∑∞ k=0 dk3k 3i } = ∞∑ i=1 ∑i−1 k=0 dk3k 3i = 1 or ∞∑ k=0 ∞∑ i=k+1 dk3k 3i = ∞∑ k=0 dk 2 = 1. Thus, 2a + 2 = 3m + 3n, as desired. In base 2, (2 + 296)!, when written in base 2, has exactly (1 + 295 + 294 + 293 + · · · + 22 + 21 + 20) = 2 96 trailing zeroes. Hence, when written in base 28 = 256, there are exactly 296 8 = 293 zeroes. In base p ≥ 11, there are: ⌊ 2 + 296 p ⌋ +     ⌊ 2+296 p ⌋ p     + · · · ≤ (2 + 296) ( 1 11 + 1 112 + 1 113 + . . . ) = (2 + 296) ( 1 10 ) < 2 93 trailing zeroes. Hence, the maximum possible prime divisor of the base is 7. In base 7, there are ⌊ 2 + 296 7 ⌋ +     ⌊ 2+296 7 ⌋ 7     + · · · ≤ (2 + 296) ( 1 7 + 1 72 + 1 73 + . . . ) ≤ (2 + 296) ( 1 6 ) < 2 94, so the maximum prime power of 7 is 1. To prove that this is indeed the maximum, notice that ⌊ 2 + 296 7 ⌋ +     ⌊ 2+296 7 ⌋ 7     +         ⌊ ⌊ 2+296 7 ⌋ 7 ⌋ 7         + · · · > ⌊ 2 + 296 7 ⌋ > 2 + 296 7 − 1 > 296 8 = 2 93. Similarly, the maximum prime power of 5 is 1. The prime power of 3 can be 3. To see that it cannot be 4, note that: 2 + 296 ≡ 3 (mod 9). From the lemma, 2 + 296 = 3a + 3b ≡ 3 (mod 9), so exactly one of a, b equals 3. But then 296 − 1 = 3a, but 23 − 1 = 7 divides 296 − 1, a contradiction. Hence, the maximum prime power of 3 is 3. In base B = pe1 1 p e2 2 . . . p ek k , note that (2 + 296)! has exactly min        |||| ||||         1 ei ⌊ 2 + 296 pi ⌋ +     ⌊ 2+296 pi ⌋ pi     +         ⌊ ⌊ 2+296 pi ⌋ pi ⌋ pi         + . . .          ||||‖ ||||  | | | |  46 The NIMO Compendium 1.

We can then choose a nonnegative integer at most the maximum for each of the other prime bases. It follows that the answers are: a) 28 = 256 b) 28 · 33 · 51 · 71 = 241920 c) (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 16 8. Deﬁne f (x) to be the nearest integer to x, with the greater integer chosen if two integers are tied for being the nearest. For example, f (2.3) = 2, f (2.5) = 3, and f (2.7) = 3. Deﬁne [A] to be the area of region A. Deﬁne region Rn, for each positive integer n, to be the region on the Cartesian plane which satisﬁes the inequality f (|x|) + f (|y|) < n. We pick an arbitrary point O on the perimeter of Rn, and mark every two units around the perimeter with another point. Region SnO is deﬁned by connecting these points in order. a) Prove that the perimeter of Rn is always congruent to 4 (mod 8). b) Prove that [SnO] is constant for any O. c) Prove that [Rn] + [SnO] = (2n − 1)2. (Lewis Chen) Solution. By graphing out the given function in the problem, the function traces out a polygon composed of the union of all unit squares with centers of at most n − 1 rectilinear distance from the origin. In particular, it creates a polygon with all sides of length 1, at right angles with each other and to the coordinate axes, as shown: and so on. a) Taking the projection to either the x-axis or y-axis, we get a length of 2n − 1. Since all sides are orthogonal to the coordinate axes, every length contributes either 0 or 1 to this amount. Since we can take the projection to the left, right, top, or bottom, the perimeter is (1)(4)(2n − 1) + 8n − 4 ≡ 4 (mod 8). b) Since all sides are at either right angles or reﬂex right angles to each other, the sides alternate from parallel to perpendicular to the x-axis. Therefore, by marking every two units around, we select every other side, so we pick either all the parallel or all the perpendicular sides. Note that if we rotate the diagram by 90 degrees around the origin, we map the parallel sides to the perpendicular sides, so we may assume WLOG that point O lies on a segment parallel to the x-axis. Above the line y = 0, it forms an isosceles right triangle with height of n − 1 to the hypotenuse; similarly, below the line y = 0 it forms a right triangle with height of n − 1. Joining the two forms a parallelogram with a constant base and constant height, so the area [SnO] is invariant. c) We compute the area of Rn ﬁrst: a straightforward computation yields [Rn] = 2(n − 1)2 + 2(n − 1) = 2n2 − 2n. Additionally, [SnO] = n2 + (n − 1)2 = 2n2 − 2n + 1, so [Rn] + [SnO] = 4n2 − 4n + 1 = (2n − 1)2, as claimed. 47 The NIMO Compendium 2. Winter Olympiad 2012 2. Winter Olympiad 2012 January 2012 1. In a 10 by 10 grid of dots, what is the maximum number of lines that can be drawn connecting two dots on the grid so that no two lines are parallel? (Aaron Lin) Solution. We are looking for the total number of distinct slopes of the lines connecting two points on the grid. This is equal to twice the number of positive slopes, plus two (to account for vertical and horizontal lines). Because slope is equal to ∆y ∆x , all positive slopes can be written in the form a b for 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 9. Each ordered pair (a, b) produces a distinct slope unless gcd(a, b) > 1. By listing, we ﬁnd that there are 55 distinct positive slopes. Thus, there are a total of 2(55)+2 = 112 diﬀerent slopes, and thus a maximum of 112 non-parallel lines can be drawn. 2. If r1, r2, and r3 are the solutions to the equation x3 − 5x2 + 6x − 1 = 0, then what is the value of r2 1 + r2 2 + r3 2? (Eugene Chen) Solution. By Vieta’s Formulas, r1+r2+r3 = 5 and r1r2+r2r3+r3r1 = 6. Thus, r2 1+r2 2+r2 3 = (r1 + r2 + r3)2 − 2(r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1) = 52 − 2(6) = 13 . 3. The expression ◦1 ◦ 2 ◦ 3 ◦ · · · ◦ 2012 is written on a blackboard. Catherine places a + sign or a − sign into each blank. She then evaluates the expression, and ﬁnds the remainder when it is divided by 2012. How many possible values are there for this remainder? (Aaron Lin) Solution. Regardless of sign, each odd number contributes an odd amount to the sum and each even number contributes an even amount to the sum. Because there are 1006 odd numbers, the expression must evaluate to an even number, so all odd remainders cannot be achieved. Now, we show that each even number can be achieved. For all 1 ≤ i ≤ 1006, take the sum 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + (i − 1) − i + (i + 1) + · · · + 2012. This sum is equal to 2012·2013 2 − 2i ≡ 1006 − 2i (mod 2012). But 503 − i takes all values from 1 to 1006 modulo 1006 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 1006, so 1006 − 2i takes on all even values modulo 2012. Hence, all even remainders can be achieved, so the answer is 1006 . 4. Parallel lines ℓ1 and ℓ2 are drawn in a plane. Points A1, A2, . . . , An are chosen on ℓ1, and points B1, B2, . . . , Bn+1 are chosen on ℓ2. All segments AiBj are drawn, such that 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ n + 1. Let the number of total intersections between these segments (not including endpoints) be denoted by Q. Given that no three segments are concurrent, besides at endpoints, prove that Q is divisible by 3. (Lewis Chen) Solution. Each set of four points AaAbBcBd deﬁnes exactly one intersection point, and each intersection point is deﬁned by a set of four points AaAbBcBd. Thus, there are (n 2)(n+1 2 ) total intersections between these segments. This is equal to (n−1)n2(n+1) 4 . Because n − 1, n, n + 1 are three consecutive integers, one of them must be divisible by 3. It follows that Q = (n−1)n2(n+1) 4 is divisible by 3. 48 The NIMO Compendium 2. Winter Olympiad 2012 5. In convex hexagon ABCDEF , ∠A ∼= ∠B, ∠C ∼= ∠D, and ∠E ∼= ∠F . Prove that the perpendicular bisectors of AB, CD, and EF pass through a common point. (Lewis Chen) Solution. Assume AF , BC, and DE are pairwise nonparallel. Denote the intersection of ←→ AF and ←→ BC by X, the intersection of ←→ BC and ←→ DE by Y , and the intersection of ←→ DE and ←→ AF by Z. Because ∠A ∼= ∠B, it follows that ∠XAB ∼= ∠XBA and thus △XAB is isosceles. Then, the perpendicular bisector of AB is the angle bisector of ∠AXB = ∠ZXY . Similarly, the perpendicular bisectors of CD and EF are the angle bisectors of ∠XY Z and ∠Y ZX, respectively. The angle bisectors of ∠ZXY , ∠XY Z, and ∠Y ZX are concurrent at the incen- ter of △XY Z, so the perpendicular bisectors of AB, CD, and EF are concurrent in this case. If two of the sides are parallel, then assume, without loss of generality, that AF ∥ BC. Deﬁne Y and Z as they were deﬁned in the previous part. Because AZ ∥ BY , quadrilateral ABY Z is a trapezoid. Again, the perpendicular bisectors of CD and EF are the angle bisectors of ∠BY Z and ∠Y ZA, respectively. Denote by P the midpoint of Y Z and by Q the intersection of the angle bisectors of ∠BY Z and ∠Y ZA. Now, because m∠AZY + m∠BY Z = 180◦, we have m∠QZY + m∠QY Z = 90◦, from which ∠Y QZ is right. It follows that Q lies on the circle with diameter Y Z, so P Y = P Z = P Q. Thus, ∠P QY ∼= ∠QY P , and because Y Q bisects ∠BY Z, we have ∠P QY ∼= ∠BY Q. Hence, P Q ∥ BY . Because P is the midpoint of Y Z, P Q must be the midline of trapezoid ABY Z. But the perpendicular bisector of AB is also the midline of trapezoid ABY Z, so Q lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB as desired. 6. The positive numbers a, b, c satisfy 4abc(a+b+c) = (a+b)2(a+c)2. Prove that a(a+b+c) = bc. (Aaron Lin) Solution. Let x = a(a + b + c) and y = bc. Then, x + y = (a + b)(a + c). The given equation implies: 4xy = (x + y)2 x2 − 2xy + y2 = 0 (x − y) 2 = 0 x = y. Thus, a(a + b + c) = bc as desired. 7. For how many positive integers n ≤ 500 is n! divisible by 2n−2? (Eugene Chen) Solution. By Legendre’s Theorem, vp(n!) = n−sp(n) p−1 , where p is a prime, vp(n) is the expo- nent of the prime p that divides n, and sp(n) is the sum of the digits of n when written in base p. Choosing p = 2 yields v2(n!) = n − s2(n). The given condition holds iﬀ v2(n!) = n − s2(n) ≥ n − 2, or s2(n) ≤ 2. Thus, the sum of the digits of n in base 2 is 1 or 2. There are 9 positive integers n not greater than 500 such that the sum of the digits in the binary representation of n is 1, and 36 positive integers n not greater than 500 such that the sum of the digits in the binary representation of n is 2. The answer is 9 + 36 = 45 . 49 The NIMO Compendium 2. Winter Olympiad 2012 The answers 44 and 45 were both accepted for this problem, as the case n = 1 can be argued to be either valid or invalid. 8. A convex 2012-gon A1A2A3 . . . A2012 has the property that for every integer 1 ≤ i ≤ 1006, AiAi+1006 partitions the polygon into two congruent regions. Show that for every pair of integers 1 ≤ j < k ≤ 1006, quadrilateral AjAkAj+1006Ak+1006 is a parallelogram. (Lewis Chen) Solution. Lemma. ∠Ai−1AiAi+1 ∼= ∠Ai+1005Ai+1006Ai+1007. Proof. Consider the partition through Ai+503Ai+1509. Regardless of whether the two resul- tant polygons are rotations or reﬂections of each other, ∠Ai−1AiAi+1 and ∠Ai+1005Ai+1006Ai+1007 are opposite Ai+503Ai+1509, because if it is a reﬂection, then ∠Ai−1AiAi+1 ∼= ∠Ai+1007Ai+1006Ai+1005, and if it is a rotation, then ∠Ai−1AiAi+1 ∼= m < Ai+1005Ai+1006Ai+1007. Lemma. AiAi+1 = Ai+1006Ai+1007. Proof. For the sake of contradiction, suppose the contrary; that is, suppose that AiAi+1 ̸= Ai+1006Ai+1007. Then, consider the partitioning line Ai+1Ai+1007. It follows that the two resultant polygons must be reﬂections of each other, because our assumption is contradicted if they are rotations. Thus, AiAi+1 = Ai+1Ai+2, and Ai+1006Ai+1007 = Ai+1007Ai+1008. In particular, Ai+1Ai+2 ̸= Ai+1007Ai+1008. In general, from AkAk+1 ̸= Ak+1006Ak+1007, consider the partitioning line Ak+1Ak+1007 to conclude that AkAk+1 = Ak+1Ak+2, Ak+1006Ak+1007 = Ak+1007Ak+1008, and thus Ak+1Ak+2 ̸= Ak+1007Ak+1008. After repeating this argument 1006 times, we may conclude that AiAi+1 = Ai+1Ai+2 = Ai+2Ai+3 = · · · = Ai+1006A1007, contradicting our assumption. Hence, the initial assumption must be false, and the lemma must be true. Lemma. AiAj = Ai+1006Aj+1006. Proof. Consider the polygons AiAi+1Ai+2 . . . Aj and Ai+1006Ai+1007Ai+1008 . . . Aj+1006. By Lemma 2, they share at least all but one congruent corresponding side length. By Lemma 1, they share all congruent corresponding angles. Hence, they are congruent polygons, so the lemma is true. By Lemma 3, AiAj = Ai+1006Aj+1006 and AjAi+1006 = Aj+1006Ai, so AiAjAi+1006Aj+1006 is a parallelogram, as desired. 50 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 March 2013 1. Find the remainder when 2 + 4 + · · · + 2014 is divided by 1 + 3 + · · · + 2013. Justify your answer. (Evan Chen) Solution. Let A = 2 + 4 + · · · + 2014 and B = 1 + 3 + · · · + 2013. Then A − B = 1 + 1 + · · · + 1| {z } 1007 1′s = 1007. Other solutions may explicitly compute A = 1007 · 1008 and B = 10072 to arrive at the same conclusion. 5 points for any valid method or approach. Decent attempts may earn 2 points. Since B > 1007, the remainder is 1007. 2 points for the numerical answer. Remark. A good solution should make the remark that B > 1007; however, a solution which does not mention this will not be penalized. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 2, 5, 7. 2. Square S has vertices (1, 0), (0, 1), (−1, 0) and (0, −1). Points P and Q are independently se- lected, uniformly at random, from the perimeter of S. Determine, with proof, the probability that the slope of line P Q is positive. (Isabella Grabski) Solution 1. The answer is 1 2 . 1 point for a correct numerical answer. Let A = (1, 0), B = (0, 1), C = (−1, 0) and D = (0, −1). Consider a point P ∈ CD (the other cases are analogous). We claim that even for a ﬁxed P , the probability is 1 2 . 1 point for this claim. Let Px be the point on AD with P Px parallel to the x-axis, and deﬁne Py analogously. Then it is easy to see that the region where Q can lie is precisely the polygonal line PyBAPx. 4 points for deﬁning Px and Py and ﬁnding the locus of Q. Serious but unsuccessful attempts to use points Px and Py will be awarded 1 point. Since PyC = P C = PxA, it easy to see that the desired region is precisely one-half the perimeter of S. Hence the claim holds, and the answer is therefore 1 2 . 1 point for this ﬁnishing touch. 51 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 y x A B C D P Px Py Figure VIII.1.: Desired region for problem 2, highlighted in red. Remark. In grading this approach, we have the rules 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 2. Basically, if the locus Q is not successfully found in this approach, at most 2 points will be given. A score of 4 is strictly possible but seems extremely rare. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Solution 2. We will show the answer is 1 2 . 1 point for the correct numerical answer. Remark that the probability that a line has either undeﬁned or zero slope is 0. Therefore it suﬃces to consider lines with either positive or negative slopes. 1 point for this remark. Notice that by reﬂecting a line P Q over the x-axis we obtain a line P ′Q′ whose slope is the negative of line P Q. We may ignore the cases where the slope is 0 or not deﬁned. Hence, by symmetry, the answer is 1 2 . 5 points for ﬁnishing. Remark. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Note: It’s important to note (although no points will be deducted for failing to do so) that symmetry is very diﬀerent from having a 1−1 correspondence. The real importance is to note that reﬂection preserves the length of segments; it is not suﬃcient to ﬁnd a bijection from lines with positive slope to lines with negative slope, because the sets involved are inﬁnite. 52 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 For the sake of example, consider the problem: x is chosen randomly in the interval [0, 1). What is the probability that x ≤ 1 3 ? It is easy to construct a bijection between [ 0, 1 3 ) and [ 1 3 , 1); namely, x 7→ 2x + 1 3 . But this certainly does not imply the answer is 1 2 ! When we say we pick a point “uniformly and at random from the perimeter of S”, this is equivalent to saying that the probability a point is selected from some interval is proportional to the length of that interval. That’s why the length-preserving property (which may be expressed more perversely as just “symmetry”) plays a crucial role in this problem. 3. Let ABC be a triangle. Prove that there exists a unique point P for which one can ﬁnd points D, E and F such that the quadrilaterals AP BF , BP CD, CP AE, EP F A, F P DB, and DP EC are all parallelograms. (Lewis Chen) A B C P F E D Figure VIII.2.: Parallelograms Solution. We claim that the centroid of △ABC is the unique point with the property. A generous 2 points for this claim. (It may be given implicitly later.) First, suppose P , D, E, F have the desired property. Clearly, CP ∥ BD and F P ∥ P D. This implies that C, P, F are collinear. Similarly, A, P, D and B, P, E are collinear. 2 points for this observation. Now, F P bisects AB because AP BF is a parallelogram. Hence CP is a median of △ABC. Similarly, AP and BP are medians, so P must be the centroid of △ABC. 2 points for this observation. Conversely, if P is the centroid, then select D, E, F to be the reﬂections of P over the midpoints of sides BC, CA, AB; this forces AP BF , BP CD and CP AE to be parallelograms. Then BP ∥ F A and CP ∥ EA, so AF P E is a parallelogram. Similarly, BDP F and CEP D are parallelograms, as desired. 53 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 1 point for this direction. Remark. If a solution begins by assuming P is the centroid, but fails to verify P is unique, it may still earn points for the correct observations. Basically, because both directions are essentially the same in the synthetic solution, a complete proof of one direction earns 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 points. Completing the other direction earns the last point. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 2, 4, 6, 7. Solution 2. The solution is by vectors. Note the W XY Z is a parallelogram if and only if −→ W + −→ Y = −→ X + −→ Z . 1 point for any serious attempt to use vectors/analytic methods. The condition is equivalent to ﬁnding −→ P for which there exists −→ D, −→ E , −→ F such that −→ A + −→ B = −→ P + −→ F −→ B + −→ C = −→ P + −→ D −→ C + −→ A = −→ P + −→ E −→ E + −→ F = −→ P + −→ A −→ F + −→ E = −→ P + −→ B −→ D + −→ D = −→ P + −→ C 1 point for obtaining this system of equations. Adding twice the sum of the ﬁrst three equations with the following three, we obtain that −→ P = −→ A + −→ B + −→ C 3 i.e. P is the centroid of △ABC. 4 points for solving for deriving that P is the centroid (or just showing the explicit form above). It is easy to verify this works. 1 point for this last remark. Remark. It seems diﬃcult to reach later stages of this solution without previous results. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 6, 7. 54 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 4. Let F be the set of all 2013 × 2013 arrays whose entries are 0 and 1. A transformation K : F → F is deﬁned as follows: for each entry aij in an array A ∈ F, let Sij denote the sum of all the entries of A sharing either a row or column (or both) with aij. Then aij is replaced by the remainder when Sij is divided by two. Prove that for any A ∈ F, K(A) = K(K(A)). (Aaron Lin) Solution. We will show the result holds for any n × n grid, where n is odd. 1 point if this claim is made. A correct solution which does not explicitly note this, of course, will not be penalized. Let the entries of A be aij, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n. Let the entries of K(A) be bij, and let the entries of K(K(A)) be cij. By symmetry, it suﬃces to check that c11 = b11. 1 point if this claim is made. Again, a correct solution which does not utilize this will still receive the 1 point. Now, let R = a11 + a12 + · · · + a1n and C = a11 + a21 + · · · + an1. Then, c11 ≡ −b11 + n∑ k=1 bk1 + n∑ k=1 b1k (mod 2) = b11 + n∑ k=2 bk1 + n∑ k=2 b1k = b11 + n∑ k=2  C + n∑ j=2 akj   + n∑ k=2  R + n∑ j=2 ajk   = b11 + n∑ k=2 n∑ j=2 akj + n∑ k=2 n∑ j=2 ajk + (n − 1)C + (n − 1)R = b11 + 2 ∑ 2≤x,y≤n axy + (n − 1)C + (n − 1)R ≡ b11 (mod 2) which implies c11 = b11 as desired. 5 points for this computation. 2 points may be awarded for a decent attempt with double summation. Remark. In grading this approach, we have the following rules in addition: 1 + 1 = 1, 1 + 2 = 2, and 1 + 1 + 2 = 2. Essentially any solution which does not successfully carry out the double summation earns at most 2 points, and any solution which fails to attempt double summation earns at most 1 point. On the other hand, any solution which correctly sums the expression implic- itly earns the remaining points. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 7. 5. In convex hexagon AXBY CZ, sides AX, BY and CZ are parallel to diagonals BC, XC and XY , respectively. Prove that △ABC and △XY Z have the same area. (Evan Chen) 55 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 Solution. Let [P] denote the area of a polygon P. The important claim is that if KL ∥ M N , then [KLM ] = [KLN ]. This is a simple conse- quence of the formula A = 1 2 bh. 1 point for this remark. No points will be deducted if this claim is cited as well-known. Then, we ﬁnd that [ABC] = [XBC] (since AX ∥ BC) = [XY C] (since BY ∥ XC) = [XY Z] (since CZ ∥ XY ) as desired. 6 points for completing the solution. Remark. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 7. 6. A strictly increasing sequence {xi}∞ i=1 of positive integers is said to be [i]large[/i] if, for every real number L, there exists an integer n such that 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn > L. Do there exist large sequences {ai}∞ i=1 and {bi}∞ i=1 such that the sequence {ai + bi}∞ i=1 is not large? (Lewis Chen) Solution. The answer is yes. 1 point for correctly answering yes and some attempt at a con- struction. Solutions which claim no sequences exist earn 0 points. We present one of many possible constructions. The idea is to select ai and bi such that ai + bi = 2i, which will make {ai + bi}∞ i=1 not large. Let the ai and bi alternate in runs, where one sequence increases by one at each step, as shown in the table below. i 1 2 3 4 5 6 · · · 16 17 18 216 − 8 ai 1 2 3 4 19 50 · · · 216 − 24 216 − 23 · · · 217 − 48 · · · bi 1 2 5 12 13 14 · · · 24 216 + 23 · · · 2216−8 − 217 + 48 · · · length 12 length 216 − 24 Table VIII.1.: ai and bi Formally, we deﬁne the sequences by t1 = 2, a1 = b1 = 1, a2 = b2 = 2, and tn+1 = tn + max {atn, btn} an+1 = { an + 1 if ∃k : t2k−1 + 1 ≤ n ≤ t2k 2n+1 − bn otherwise bn+1 = { bn + 1 if ∃k : t2k + 1 ≤ n ≤ t2k+1 2n+1 − an otherwise. 56 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 Note that 1 n + 1 + 1 n + 2 + · · · + 1 2n > 1 2n + · · · + 1 2n| {z } n terms = 1 2 . This construction guarantees that t2k∑ i=t2k−1+1 1 ai > 1 2 . Similar equations hold for bi. Therefore {ai} and {bi} are large. So we’re done. 6 points for a valid construction. Serious but unsuccessful at- tempts with good ideas can earn 1 or 2 points. Essentially correct constructions with minor calculation errors earn 5 points. Remark. In this approach, 1 + 1 = 1 + 2 = 2. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 6, 7. 7. Let a, b, c be positive reals satisfying a3 + b3 + c3 + abc = 4. Prove that (5a2 + bc)2 (a + b)(a + c) + (5b2 + ca)2 (b + c)(b + a) + (5c2 + ab)2 (c + a)(c + b) ≥ (a3 + b3 + c3 + 6)2 a + b + c and determine the cases of equality. (Evan Chen) Solution. The equality cases are a = b = c = 1 and the cyclic permutations of (a, b, c) = ( 2 3√3 , 1 3√3 , 1 3√3 ) . 1 point for stating the correct equality cases (even without proof ). By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, ∑ cyc (5a3 + abc)2 a2(a + b)(a + c) ≥ (∑ cyc 5a3 + abc )2 ∑ cyc a2(a + b)(a + c) = (5a3 + 5b3 + 5c3 + 3abc )2 (a + b + c)(a3 + b3 + c3 + abc) which simpliﬁes to the desired right-hand side. 3 points for solving the inequality. No points are awarded for just mentioning Cauchy. Equality occurs if and only if 5a3 + abc a2(a + b)(a + c) = 5b3 + abc b2(b + c)(b + a) = 5c3 + abc c2(c + a)(c + b) Multiplying by abc(a + b)(b + c)(c + a) we observe this is equivalent to bc(5a 2 + bc)(b + c) = ca(5b 2 + ca)(c + a) = ab(5c 2 + ab)(a + b) 57 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 Let us assume without loss of generality that c ≥ max{a, b}. We now ﬁnd that 0 = b(5a2 + bc)(b + c) − a(5b 2 + ac)(a + c) = 5abc(a − b) + c(b 3 − a 3) + c 2(b 2 − a2) = c(b − a)(−5ab + a 2 + ab + b 2 + c(a + b)) = c(b − a)(a 2 + b 2 + c(a + b) − 4ab) But, a 2 + b 2 + ca + cb − 4ab ≥ 2(a2 + b 2) − 4ab ≥ 0 with equality only when a = b = c. This forces a = b; otherwise the two factors are both nonzero. Now, if we set t = c a = c b we ﬁnd that 0 = t(5 + t)(t + 1) − (5t 2 + 1)(2) = t3 − 4t 2 + 5t − 2 = (t − 2)(t − 1) 2 which gives the equality cases claimed above. 3 points for correctly establishing the equality cases, as above. 2 points can be given if there are minor calculation errors; 1 point for signiﬁcant progress with good ideas (e.g. breaking symmetry). Remark. The real diﬃculty in this problem is not proving the inequality itself but ﬁnding and proving the additional equality cases. A solution which does not note the unusual equality case is therefore worth 0 or 3 points. The possible marks for a solution with the correct equality cases are 1, 4, 5, 6, 7. 8. For a ﬁnite set X deﬁne S(X) = ∑ x∈X x and P (x) = ∏ x∈X x. Let A and B be two ﬁnite sets of positive integers such that |A| = |B|, P (A) = P (B) and S(A) ̸= S(B). Suppose for any n ∈ A ∪ B and prime p dividing n, we have p36 | n and p37 ∤ n. Prove that |S(A) − S(B)| > 1.9 · 10 6. (Evan Chen) Solution. Let A = {a36 1 , a36 2 , · · · , a36 n } and B = { b36 1 , b36 2 , · · · , b36 n }. Notice that a1a2 · · · an = b1b2 · · · bn and the ai, bi are squarefree. The crucial component of the solution is the claim Claim. For any prime p such that p − 1 | 36, we have S(A) ≡ S(B) (mod p). 2 points if this claim is made. Proof. Let Ap = {a ∈ A | p divides a} and deﬁne Bp analogously. The condition that the ai and bi are squarefree, together with P (A) = P (B), imply that |Ap| = |Bp|. 1 point if it is noted that |Ap| = |Bp|, even outside the context of this claim. 58 The NIMO Compendium 3. Winter Olympiad 2013 Now by Fermat’s Little Theorem, we see that a p−1 ≡ { 1 a ̸≡ 0 (mod p) 0 a ≡ 0 (mod p) . So S(A) ≡ n − |Ap| (mod p), S(B) ≡ n − |Bp| (mod p) =⇒ S(A) ≡ S(B) (mod p). ■ 3 points for completing this proof. Now S(A) − S(B) ≡ 0 (mod p) for p ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 19, 37}. Hence, S(A) − S(B) is divisible by 2 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 13 · 19 · 37 = 1919190 > 1.9 · 10 6 which implies the conclusion upon remarking that S(A) − S(B) ̸= 0. 1 point for this ﬁnishing touch. Remark. In this problem, the rule 2 + 1 = 2 applies. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 6, 7. 59 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 January 2014 1. Find, with proof, all real numbers x satisfying x = 2 (2 (2 (2 (2x − 1) − 1) − 1) − 1) − 1. (Evan Chen) Solution 1. Deﬁne f (x) = 2x−1. Because the equation is linear, it has at most one solution. 5 points for this claim. 1 point for trying to consider this function in a nontrivial way. Because 1 is a ﬁxed point (i.e. f (1) = 1), f (f (f (f (f (1))))) = 1 implies x = 1 is a solution, and hence the only one. 2 points for this correct answer. Remark. Here 1 + 2 = 2. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 5, 7. Solution 2. Expanding, the right-hand side is seen to equal 32x − 31. 5 points for expanding correctly. 1 point can be given for a failed attempt at expanding. Setting this equal to x gives 32x − 31, or x = 1. 2 points for this correct answer. Remark. The combination 1 + 2 seems unrealizable. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 7. 2. Determine, with proof, the smallest positive integer c such that for any positive integer n, the decimal representation of the number cn + 2014 has digits all less than 5. (Evan Chen) Solution. The answer is c = 10. 1 point for this answer. First, we will prove c ≥ 10 is necessary to work. For 1 ≤ c ≤ 5, n = 1 gives the numbers 2015, 2016, . . . , 2019, none of which work. On the other hand, for 6 ≤ c ≤ 9, n = 2 gives the numbers 2050, 2063, 2078, 2095, none of which work. 3 points for proving c ≥ 10 is necessary. 60 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 Next, we will prove c = 10 is a working example for all n. When 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, we have 2024, 2114 and 3014. When n ≥ 4, we ﬁnd that 10 n + 2014 = 1 000 . . . 000| {z } n − 4 zeros 2014 which also works. This shows that c = 10 is the answer. 3 points for proving c = 10 works. Deduct 2 points for failing to acknowledge the case 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. Do not award any points for merely claiming c = 10 “clearly works”. Remark. In grading this approach, 1 + 3 = 3, but 1 + 3 + 1 = 5. The combination 3 + 3 = 6 seems very hard to achieve. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 3, 5, 7. Note. In any optimization problem, there are always two parts. The ﬁrst is to establish a bound – in this case, we proved c ≥ 10 by exhausting the smaller cases. The second step is to prove that the bound is tight – in this case, we had to check c = 10 actually worked. We hope this problem was an illustrative/instructive example for what it means to rigorously show a value is minimal or maximal. 3. The numbers 1, 2, . . . , 10 are written on a board. Every minute, one can select three numbers a, b, c on the board, erase them, and write √a2 + b2 + c2 in their place. This process continues until no more numbers can be erased. What is the largest possible number that can remain on the board at this point? (Evan Chen) Solution. The key observation is that the sum of the squares of all numbers is preserved in each step. 3 points for this step. Deduct 2 points if assumptions are made about the order in which the numbers are taken. Because we erase three numbers and replace it with one number in each operation, there will be two positive numbers in the end. The sum of the squares of the 10 original numbers is 12 + 22 + · · · + 102 = 385. Because the minimum possible value for one of the ﬁnal two numbers is 1, the maximum possible value for the other is √385 − 12 = √384 = 8 √ 6. 1 point for noting two numbers remain, and 1 point for noting is at least one. 2 points for the correct ﬁnal answer. 61 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 Remark. In grading this problem, we have three rules in addition. • Many teams do not note the SOS invariant. Apply 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 2 and 1 + 1 = 1. In other words, such solutions earn at most 2. • Some solutions make observations about the sum of squares but do so by making assumptions about what numbers are taking, leading to 1/3 in the ﬁrst part. These solutions earn at most 4 points; we apply 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 to them. Moreover, 1 + 1 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 1. • In rare cases, a solution may note the SOS invariant but fail to yield any ﬁnal answer. I do not recall seeing any such solution, but apply 3+1 = 3+1+1 = 3 here. Graders may be more generous if an incorrect ﬁnal answer was clearly due to a simple arithmetic error. The possible marks for this problem are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 4. Prove that there exist integers a, b, c with 1 ≤ a < b < c ≤ 25 and S(a 6 + 2014) = S(b 6 + 2014) = S(c 6 + 2014) where S(n) denotes the sum of the decimal digits of n. (Evan Chen) Solution. It is not hard to show that 256 + 2014 < 500,000,000 (say by 256 = 6253 < 7003 = 343 · 106). We claim one can select a, b, c not divisible by three. 2 point for claiming this is possible with a, b, c not divisible by three. There are 17 possible choices of a, b, c. Now x6 + 2014 ≡ 8 (mod 9) for each x = a, b, c by Euler’s Theorem. Hence the possible values of S(x6 + 2014) ≡ 8 (mod 9) are {8, 15, . . . , 71} (using the bound above). 2 points for considering modulo 9 and using S(x) ≡ x (mod 9). There are eight such values, hence three of them coincide by Pigeonhole. 3 points for this ﬁnishing remark, along with the bound. 1 point can be awarded for mentioning Pigeonhole. Remark. The 1 point is not additive, so 2 + 1 = 2 and 2 + 2 + 1 = 4. All other marks are additive. The 3 seems hard to obtain without the previous steps. The possible marks for this problem are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 7. Solution 2. There are several other triples which can be explicitly shown to work, for ex- ample (1, 4, 10) and (5, 7, 8). 2 points for stating a triple and 5 points for showing it works. Remark. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 2, 7. 62 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 5. Let ABC be an acute triangle with orthocenter H and let M be the midpoint of BC. (The orthocenter is the point at the intersection of the three altitudes.) Denote by ωB the circle passing through B, H, and M , and denote by ωC the circle passing through C, H, and M . Lines AB and AC meet ωB and ωC again at P and Q, respectively. Rays P H and QH meet ωC and ωB again at R and S, respectively. Show that △BRS and △CRS have the same area. (Aaron Lin) A B C M H P Q R S Figure VIII.3.: The points R, M , S are collinear. Solution. In what follows all angles are directed modulo π. It is easy to see that ∡ABH = ∡HCA (they are 90 − ∠A). Hence ∡P SQ = ∡P SH = ∡P BH = ∡ABH = ∡HCA = ∡HCQ = ∡HRQ = ∡P RQ. Therefore P QRS is cyclic. 2 points for proving this. A claim without proof gets 1 point. Next, we claim M , R, S are collinear. This follows from ∡HM S = ∡HP S = ∡RP S = ∡RQS = ∡RQH = ∡HM R. 3 points for proving this. A claim without proof gets 1 point. Now note that triangles BM R and CM R have the same area, as do BM S and CM S (since M is the midpoint of BC). Hence triangles BRS and CRS have the same area as desired. 2 points for this with all other steps. Remark. In this problem, 1 + 1 = 1, 2 + 1 = 2, but 1 + 3 = 3; i.e. reducing the problem to P QRS cyclic earns three points. Failing to account for con- ﬁguration issues leads to a 1-point deduction on full solutions. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 5, 6 (conﬁguration dependencies), 7. 63 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 6. Let ϕ(k) denote the numbers of positive integers less than or equal to k and relatively prime to k. Prove that for some positive integer n, ϕ(2n − 1) + ϕ(2n + 1) < 1 1000 ϕ(2n). (Evan Chen) Note. This is not the version of the problem that appeared on the contest. The contest version erroneously asks a contestant to prove that ϕ(2n − 1) + ϕ(2n + 1) > 2ϕ(2n). Solution. Let p1, p2, . . . be the sequence of odd prime numbers. It is well known that∏i (1 − p−1 i ) tends to zero. That means we can ﬁnd indices k and ℓ for which ℓ∏ i=k+1 (1 − p−1 i ) < k∏ i=1 (1 − p−1 i ) < ε for any ε > 0. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can ﬁnd several n such that 2n−1 ≡ 0 (mod pi) for each i = 1, 2, . . . , k and 2n + 1 ≡ 0 (mod pi) for each i = k + 1, k + 2, . . . , ℓ, and by Dirichlet’s Theorem, we may select such an n prime (note that n ̸≡ 0 (mod p)i for any of these i). Putting such an n, the right-hand side is merely 1 1000 n while the left is less than (2n − 1) k∏ i=1 (1 − p−1 i ) + (2n + 1) ℓ∏ i=k+1 (1 − p −1 i ) < 4nε which is less than 1 1000 n when ε is suﬃciently small. 7. Let ABC be a triangle and let Q be a point such that AB ⊥ QB and AC ⊥ QC. A circle with center I is inscribed in △ABC, and is tangent to BC, CA and AB at points D, E, and F , respectively. If ray QI intersects EF at P , prove that DP ⊥ EF . (Aaron Lin) Solution. Let ray QP meet the cirumcircle of ABC at X. First, we remark that X is concyclic with quadrilateral AF IE. Indeed, ∠AF I = 90 ◦ = ∠AXQ = ∠AXI. 1 point for this claim. Consider an inversion through the incircle. (It is expected many students will use similar triangles to phrase the following steps instead of inversion. We choose to present the inversive solution because it is more natural.) It sends points A, B, C to A∗, B∗, C∗, the midpoints of EF , F E, and F D. The circumcircle of AF IE is sent to line EF , and consequently because I, P , X are collinear we see that X maps to P . 1 points for attempting to use similarity in this fashion, or invert- ing through the incircle. No points for just mentioning inversion. Because A, B, C, P are concyclic, so are A∗, B∗, C∗ and P . 2 points for this observation, through inversion or otherwise. 64 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 A B C Q I D E F X P A∗ B∗ C∗ Figure VIII.4.: P lies on the nine-point circle of triangle DEF . Now the circumcircle of A∗B∗C∗ is the nine-point circle of △DEF , so DP ⊥ EF as desired. 3 points for ﬁnishing. Remark. In grading this approach, 1 + 1 = 1 and 1 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 2. Basically, incomplete solutions earn at most 2 points. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 2, 7. 8. Deﬁne the function ξ : Z2 → Z by ξ(n, k) = 1 when n ≤ k and ξ(n, k) = −1 when n > k, and construct the polynomial P (x1, . . . , x1000) = 1000∏ n=1 ( 1000∑ k=1 ξ(n, k)xk ) . (a) Determine the coeﬃcient of x1x2 . . . x1000 in P . (b) Show that if x1, x2, . . . , x1000 ∈ {−1, 1} then P (x1, x2, . . . , x1000) = 0. (Evan Chen) Solution. For part (a), the answer is zero. Let S1000 denote the set of permutations on 1000 elements. For a permutation π of η(π) denote the set η(π) = {1 ≤ y ≤ 1000 | y ≥ π−1(y)} . In particular, 1000 ∈ η(π). It is then easy to see that the desired coeﬃcient is just ∑ π∈S1000 ((−1) |η(π)|) . 65 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 Deﬁne Ξ : S1000 → S1000 as follows. If π ∈ S1000 and Ξ(π) = σ, then σ(n) = { 1000 if π(1001 − n) = 1000 1000 − π(1001 − n) otherwise . This is clearly a bijection. Note also that σ(1001 − π−1(y)) = 1000 − y. 1 point for this setup and attempting to construct a bijection. Now observe that for any 1 ≤ y ≤ 999, we have y ∈ η(π) ⇐⇒ y ≥ π−1(y) ⇐⇒ y > π−1(y) − 1 ⇐⇒ 1000 − y > 1001 − π−1(y) = σ−1(1000 − y) ⇐⇒ 1000 − y /∈∈ η(σ) Hence if Ξ(π) = σ, then η(π) ∩ η(σ) = {1000} and η(π) ∪ η(σ) = {1, 2, . . . , 1000}. This now implies the sum is zero, because then |η(π)| and |η(σ)| have opposite parities. 2 points for completing the bijection and ﬁnishing the problem. No partial credit in this part. Remark. No points are awarded for guessing the correct answer or for only bijection terms to permutations. The possible marks for this part are 0, 1, 3. The second part is a consequence of the so-called Discrete Intermediate Value Theorem. Deﬁne Sn = 1 2 1000∑ k=1 ξ(n, k)xk for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 1000, and each is an integer. Observe that |Sn+1 − Sn| = 1. for any n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , 999. On the other hand S1000 = −S0. 1 point for both of these observations. If S0 = S1000 = 0 then the conclusion is clear. Otherwise, there must be some intermediate index k with Sk = 0, ﬁnishing the problem. 3 points for applying discrete IVT successfully to yield the conclu- sion. 1 point can be awarded for mentioning discrete IVT. Remark. Here 1 + 1 = 1. The possible marks for this part are 0, 1, 4. Remark. In grading this problem, a partial mark in one part and a full mark in the other are not additive. The possible marks for this approach are 0, 1, 3, 4, 7. 66 The NIMO Compendium 4. Winter Olympiad 2014 Note. Part (a) actually follows from part (b) using a contradiction of the combinatorial nullstellensatz. Here is an adopted proof. Assume for contradiction that the coeﬃcient in part (a) is actually c ̸= 0, and let P be the polynomial formed by replacing every instance of x2 i with 1 for every value of i. Now, P must have the term cx1x2 . . . x1000, as any reduced terms have degree strictly less than 1000 and so cannot cancel it. The resulting polynomial unfortunately, has degree at most 1 in any xi. A simple induction shows that P must be the zero polynomial, contradicting the fact that c ̸= 0. The conclusion thus follows. Making only minor modiﬁcations to the above proof, one can derive the theorem of Alon. Let f be a polynomial of degree t1 + · · · + tn with coeﬃcients in some ﬁeld F . Suppose S1, S2, . . . , Sn are nonempty subsets of F such that |Si| ≥ ti + 1 for all i. Then there exists s1 ∈ S1, s2 ∈ S2, . . . , sn ∈ Sn for which f (s1, s2, . . . , sn) ̸= 0 as long as the coeﬃcient of xt1 1 xt2 2 . . . xtn n is nonzero. The above deduction is the special case where F = R and S1 = S2 = · · · = S1000 = {−1, 1}. 67","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
