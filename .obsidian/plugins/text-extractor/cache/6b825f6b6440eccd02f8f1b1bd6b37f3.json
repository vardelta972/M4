Before we begin, it’s recommended to the reader to be familiar with the following inequalities: Trivial Inequality, Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean and the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. If the reader is not familiar with these inequalities, it is then advised to read “A Brief Introduction to Inequalites” (Lecture 7) in the OMC archive. 1 The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality (Generalized) Let’s recall the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality: Theorem 1.1 (The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality): Let a1, a2, · · · an, b1, b2, · · · , bn be real numbers, then, (a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a 2 n)(b2 1 + b2 2 + · · · + b2 n) ≥ (a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) 2 with equality if and only if a1 b1 = a2 b2 = · · · = an bn . We note that, in the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality, the left hand side has two products where the terms inside are elevated to the second power. In H¨older’s Inequality, we take that two and generalize it. For example, by H¨older’s Inequality on positive real numbers a1, · · · , an, b1, · · · , bn, c1, · · · , cn, we have, (a3 1 + a3 2 + · · · + a3 n)(b3 1 + b3 2 + · · · + b3 n)(c3 1 + c3 2 + · · · + c3 n) ≥ (a1b1c1 + · · · + anbncn)3 It’s important to note that now, instead of there being two products and the terms inside being elevated to the second power, there are three products and the terms inside are cubed. Similarly, if we were to have four products, then the terms inside would be elevated to the fourth power, and so on. Formally, this inequality is equivalent to, Theorem 1.2 (H¨older’s Inequality): For all aij > 0 where 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n we have, m∏ i=1 ( n∑ j=1 aij ) ≥   n∑ j=1 m v u u √ m∏ i=1 aij   m Note that the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality is H¨older’s Inequality for the case m = 2. Example 1.3: Let a, b and c be positive real numbers. Prove that, (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) ≥ (a + b + c) 3 OMC 2011 H¨older’s Inequality Lecture 14 Proof. By H¨older’s Inequality, we have that, (a3 + 1 + 1)(1 + b3 + 1)(1 + 1 + c3) ≥ ( 3√a3 · 1 · 1 + 3√1 · b3 · 1 + 3√1 · 1 · c3)3 Or, (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) ≥ (a + b + c) 3 And we’re done! Example 1.4: Prove the Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality. Proof. The Arithmetic Mean - Geometric Mean Inequality states that for positive real numbers a1, a2, · · · , an the following inequality holds, a1 + a2 + · · · + an n ≥ n√a1a2a3 · · · an Hence, it is equivalent to proving that, a1 + a2 + · · · + an ≥ n n√a1a2a3 · · · an Or, (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) n ≥ (na1a2 · · · an) n Next we note that, (a1 +a2 +· · ·+an) n = (a1 +a2 +· · ·+an)(a2 +a3 +· · ·+an +a1) · · · (an +a1 +a2 +· · ·+an−1) The result then follows directly by applying H¨older’s Inequality, and so we are done! Example 1.5 (Junior Balkan MO, 2002): Prove that for all positive real numbers a, b, c the following inequality takes place 1 b(a + b) + 1 c(b + c) + 1 a(c + a) ≥ 27 2(a + b + c)2 Proof. This problem is probably one of the best examples of H¨older’s Inequality. It practically has H¨older’s Inequality written all over it. First, we note that 33 = 27, hence we might expect H¨older’s Inequality to be used on the product of three terms. Next we note that, 2(a + b + c) = (a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a) So, by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2(a + b + c) 2, it is equivalent with, ((a + b) + (b + c) + (c + a))(b + c + a) ( 1 b(a + b) + 1 c(b + c) + 1 a(c + a) ) ≥ 27 Which is true by H¨older’s Inequality. Hence the inequality, 1 b(a + b) + 1 c(b + c) + 1 a(c + a) ≥ 27 2(a + b + c)2 is also true, so we are done! 2 OMC 2011 H¨older’s Inequality Lecture 14 Example 1.6: Let a and b be positive real numbers such that a + b = 1. Prove that, 1 a2 + 1 b2 ≥ 8 Proof. First we note that, 1 a2 + 1 b2 = (a + b)(a + b) ( 1 a2 + 1 b2 ) Then, by H¨older’s Inequality, we have, (a + b)(a + b) ( 1 a2 + 1 b2 ) ≥ ( 3 √ a · a a2 + 3 √b · b b2 )3 = 8 Example 1.7: Let a, b and c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 1. Prove that, 4a3 + 9b3 + 36c3 ≥ 1 Proof. Note that, 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 = 1 Then, by applying H¨older’s Inequality, we have, ( 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 ) (1 2 + 1 3 + 1 6 ) (4a3 + 9b3 + 36c3) ≥ (a + b + c) 3 = 1 And we’re done. Example 1.8: Let a, b and c be positive real numbers. Prove that, a + b √a + 2c + b + c √b + 2a + c + a √ c + 2b ≥ 2 √a + b + c Proof. A common strategy used when solving problems that include square roots in the denominator is to square the expression on the left hand side then multiply by what’s inside the square root times the numerator and apply H¨older’s Inequality, like so, ( a + b √a + 2c + b + c √ b + 2a + c + a √c + 2b )2 ( ∑ cyc (a + b)(a + 2c) ) ≥ 8(a + b + c) 3 Next we note that, ∑ cyc (a + b)(a + 2c) = (a + b + c) 2 + 3(ab + bc + ac) Hence, it is suﬃcient to prove that, 8(a + b + c) 3 (a + b + c)2 + 3(ab + bc + ac) ≥ (2√ a + b + c)2 The rest of the proof is left as an exercise to the reader. 3 OMC 2011 H¨older’s Inequality Lecture 14 1.1 Practice Problems 1.
