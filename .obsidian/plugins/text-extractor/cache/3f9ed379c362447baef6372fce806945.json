Explain how to evaluate ∑∞ n=0 P (n) 2n for any polynomial P (n). 2. Let a, b be roots of x4 + x3 − 1 = 0. Show that ab is a root of x6 + x4 + x3 − x2 − 1. 3. Let f be a polynomial. Show that there are only ﬁnitely many numbers a for which f (x) = a has a multiple root. 4. Let ω be a primitive n-th root of unity. Find n−1∑ k=1 1 1 − ωk . 5. Let f by a polynomial of degree less than n − 2. Let p = (t − a1)(t − a2) · · · (t − an). Show that ∑n k=1 f (ak) p′(ak) = 0. Problems 6.

Show that if the integers are partitioned into ﬁnitely many arithmetic sequences, two of these sequences have the same common diﬀerence. 8. A point in the plane with a cartesian coordinate system is called a mixed point if one of its coordinates is rational and the other one is irrational. Find all polynomials with real coeﬃcients such that their graphs do not contain any mixed points. 9. For a polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients, r(2i − 1) (for i = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 512) is the remainder obtained when P (2i − 1) is divided by 1024. The sequence (r(1), r(3), . . . , r(1023)) is called the remainder sequence of P (x). A remainder sequence is called complete if it is a permutation of (1, 3, 5, . . . , 1023). Prove that there are no more than 235 diﬀerent complete remainder sequences. 10. Let m and n be positive integers. The polynomial f (x) = anxn+an−1xn−1+· · ·+a1x+a0 has integer coeﬃcients with gcd(a0, a1, . . . , an, m) = 1 such that m divides f (j) for all integers j. Prove that m divides n!. 11.
