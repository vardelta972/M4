Determine all primes p such that 5 p + 4p4 is a square number. Solution: If 5 p + 4p4 = n2 then 5 p = n 2 − 4p4 = (n − 2p2)(n + 2p2). Since 5 is prime we must have n − 2p2 = 5 a, n + 2p2 = 5 b for integers 0 ≤ a < b such that a + b = p. If a = 0 then n = 2p2 + 1, and 5 p = n + 2p2 = 4p2 + 1 ≡ 1 mod p. This shows that 5 and p are coprime, so by Fermat’s Little Theorem we also have 5 p = 5 · 5 p−1 ≡ 5 mod p. It follows that 4 ≡ 0 mod p, so p must be 2. But 5 2 + 4(24) = 89 is not square, so a = 0 does not give a solution. If a > 0 then 5 divides gcd(n − 2p2, n + 2p2) = gcd(n − 2p2, 4p2), so 5 must divide 4p2. Since p is prime this implies p = 5. Since 5 5 + 4 · 5 4 = 5 4(5 + 4) = 32(5 2)2 this does indeed give a solution. So the only solution is p = 5. 2. For each positive integer a we consider the sequence ⟨an⟩ with a0 = a and an = an−1 +40n!. Prove that every such sequence contains inﬁnitely many numbers that are divisible by 2009. Solution: Since 40 and 2009 are coprime we have 40 k·ϕ(2009) ≡ 1 mod 2009, where ϕ is the Euler totient function (also known as the Euler phi function). For n > ϕ(2009) the exponent n! is a multiple of ϕ(2009), and we therefore have an+1 ≡ an + 1 mod 2009. This means that for n > ϕ(2009) all values modulo 2009 are taken cyclicly and periodically, and all values are obtained inﬁnitely often. In particular, this holds for the value 0. 3. Find all integers k such that for every integer n, the numbers 4n + 1 and kn + 1 are relatively prime. Solution: Since 4n+1 is odd, the identity k −4 = k(4n+1)−4(kn+1) shows that 4n+1 and kn + 1 are relatively prime if k − 4 has no odd divisor p > 1, that is, if k − 4 = ±2 m for some nonnegative integer m. On the other hand, if k − 4 has an odd divisor p > 1, then we can easily ﬁnd a multiple of p of the form 4n + 1 (for example, the number p2, or simply one of the numbers p, 3p). For any number 4n + 1 divisible by p, the above identity implies that p | kn + 1, hence 4n + 1 and kn + 1 are not relatively prime. So the answer is k = 4 ± 2 m, where m = 0, 1, 2, . . .. 1 4. Let n be a positive integer. Prove that if the sum of all of the positive divisors of n is a perfect power of 2, then the number of those divisors is also a perfect power of 2. Solution: If n = pr1 1 pr2 2 · · · prk k , where p1, . . . , pk are distinct primes and ri ≥ 1 for each i, then n has k∏ i=1(ri + 1) divisors and their sum is k∏ i=1(1 + pi + p2 i + · · · + pri i ) (check that when this product is expanded every number of the form ps1 1 ps2 2 · · · psk k with si ≤ ri occurs exactly once). If this is a power of two then each of the factors fi = 1 + pi + p2 i + · · · + pri i must also be a power of two. Since fi > 1, both pi and ri must be odd. We will show that ri = 1 for all i, so that the number of divisors is simply 2 k. Suppose that ri > 1. Then we may factor fi as fi = (1 + pi)(1 + p2 i + p4 i + · · · + pri−1 i ); and since fi has no odd divisor greater than one the even integer ri − 1 (which is assumed to be positive) must be of the form 4k + 2. This implies that we can factor further to get fi = (1 + pi)(1 + p2 i )(1 + p4 i + p8 i + · · · + pri−3 i ). It follows that both 1 + pi and 1 + p2 i are both powers of two. However, this is implies 1 + pi divides 1 + p2 i , which is impossible: 1 + p2 i = (1 + pi)(pi − 1) + 2, and 1 + pi ∤ 2. This completes the proof. Alternate solution: The factorisation procedure above can be continued to get fi = (1 + pi)(1 + p2 i )(1 + p4 i ) · · · (1 + p2ti i ), giving ri = 2ti+1 − 1. This gives a way to complete the problem without arguing that 1 + pi and 1 + p2 i cannot both be powers of two. 5. (a) Show that there are inﬁnitely many pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that k = m + 1 n + n + 1 m (1) is a positive integer. (b) Find all positive integers k such that (1) has a positive integer solution (m, n). Solution: Suppose that m0, n0 and k are positive integers such that k = m0 + 1 n0 + n0 + 1 m0 , 2 and consider the equation k = m + 1 n0 + n0 + 1 m , obtained by ﬁxing n0 and allowing m to vary. This is equivalent to m 2 + (1 − kn0)m + n 2 0 + n0 = 0, a quadratic in m with at least one root m = m0. As such it will typically have a second root m = m ′ 0, and if this is a positive integer we will get a second solution to (1). With any luck we’ll then be able to apply this again to get a third, and so on; so, let’s ﬁnd the second root and see if we can use this technique to generate an inﬁnite sequence of solutions, given one as a starting point. To ﬁnd the second root, observe that if x2 + ax + b = 0 has roots α1, α2, then a = −(α1 + α2), b = α1α2 (simply expand (x − α1)(x − α2) and match co-eﬃcients). So, if we know α1 is root, we obtain the second as α2 = −a − α1 = b/α1. In our case this gives m ′ 0 = kn0 − m0 − 1 = (n2 0 + n0)/m0. The ﬁrst expression for m ′ 0 shows that it’s an integer, and the second that it’s positive; thus, if (m0, n0) satisﬁes the conditions of the problem, so does (m1, n1) = (n0, kn0 − m0 − 1) = (n0, (n 2 0 + n0)/m0), (2) with the same value of k. Suppose now that m0 ≤ n0. Then n1 = n 2 0 + n0 m0 ≥ n0(n0 + 1) n0 = n0 + 1 > m1, so our new solution satisﬁes m0 ≤ n0 = m1 < n1. Our new solution is therefore “larger” than our original one (in the sense that m0 + n0 < m1 + n1), so if the equation has at least one solution for a given value of k, it has inﬁnitely many. To prove part (a) it therefore suﬃces to ﬁnd a single small solution; and since m = n = 1 clearly works (with k = 4) we are done. Applying the transformation (2) to this solution we get the sequence (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 21), . . . To prove part (a) we used (2) to show that, given one solution to the problem, we could always ﬁnd a larger one. To prove part (b) we will use the transformation to create smaller solutions instead. Suppose this time that m0 > n0. Then n1 = n2 0 + n0 m0 < n0(n0 + 1) n0 = n0 + 1, which gives n1 ≤ n0 = m1. So our new solution satisﬁes m0 > n0 = m1 ≥ n1, and is “smaller” in the sense that m1 + n1 < m0 + n0. This gives a descending sequence of positive integer solutions (mi, ni), all with the same value of k, that must terminate after 3 ﬁnitely many steps. Since it can only terminate if mi = ni for some i, if there is a solution for a given value of k, there must be one such that m = n. In this case we have k = 2m + 1 m = 2 + 2 m, so m(k − 2) = 2. Therefore k = 3 (with solutions (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 6), (6, 14), . . . ), or k = 4, as found above. Remark: The technique used here is known as root-ﬂipping or Vieta jumping. 6. (a) Find all primes p for which 7 p−1 − 1 p is a perfect square. (b) Find all primes p for which 11 p−1 − 1 p is a perfect square. Solution: It is easy to check that p = 2 is not a solution to either equation, so we may assume that p is odd. Suppose then that qp−1 − 1 = pn2 for q odd and p an odd prime. Then qp−1 − 1 = (q(p−1)/2 − 1)(q(p−1)/2 + 1) = pn2, and since gcd(q(p−1)/2 − 1, q(p−1)/2 + 1) = 2 we must have either (i) q(p−1)/2 − 1 = 2pa2, q(p−1)/2 + 1 = 2b2, or (ii) q(p−1)/2 − 1 = 2a2, q(p−1)/2 + 1 = 2pb2 for some integers a and b. (a) Let q = 7. In (ii) above we would have −1 ≡ 2a 2 ≡ (3a) 2 mod 7, which is impossible because −1 is not a square mod 7. So we must be in case (i). Since 7 ≡ 1 mod 6 we have 6 | (q(p−1)/2 − 1) = 2pa2, so 3 | pa2. When p = 3 we have (7 2 − 1)/3 = 42, so 3 is a solution. When p ̸= 3 we must have 3 | a2, so 9 | (q(p−1)/2 − 1); and since the order of 7 modulo 9 is 3, we must then have 3 | (p − 1)/2. Let k = (p − 1)/6. Then 2a2 = (7k + 1)(7 2k − 7 k + 1) implies that 7 2k − 7 k + 1 is a perfect square. But this is not possible, because (7k − 1) 2 < 7 2k − 7 k + 1 < (7k)2. We conclude that p = 3 is the only solution. (b) Let q = 11. In (i) above we would have 1 ≡ 2b2 mod 11, which is impossible as 2 is not a square mod 11. So this time we are in case (ii). From 11(p−1)/2 + 1 = 2pb2 we have 11 (p−1)/2 ≡ −1 mod p, so 2a2 = 11 (p−1)/2 − 1 ≡ −2 mod p. Hence a2 ≡ −1 mod p, implying p ≡ 1 mod 4. We can therefore factor to get 2a2 = 11 (p−1)/2 − 1 = (11(p−1)/4 − 1)(11 (p−1)/4 + 1), so either i. 11 (p−1)/4 + 1 = c2, giving 11 (p−1)/4 = (c − 1)(c + 1), which is impossible, since c − 1 and c + 1 can’t both be powers of 11; or ii. 11 (p−1)/4 + 1 = 2d2, which is impossible since 2 is not a square mod 11. 4 We conclude that there is no prime p for which the given quotient is a square. 7. Prove that there exist inﬁnitely many natural numbers n with the following properties: n can be expressed as a sum of two squares, n = a2 + b2, and as a sum of two cubes, n = c3 + d3, but can’t be expressed as a sum n = x6 + y6 of two sixth powers, where a, b, c, d, x, y are natural numbers. Solution: We show that numbers of the form n = 8(s6 + t 6) satisfy the requirements. Clearly, such a number is a sum of cubes; to see that it can be represented as a sum of squares observe that n = 2(2s3)2 + 2(2t 3) 2 = (2s3 − 2t 3) 2 + (2s3 + 2t 3)2. We must now show that such a number cannot be expressed as a sum of sixth powers. Suppose that there is a natural number solution (s, t, u, v) to 8(s6 + t 6) = u6 + v6, and consider one such that the sum s + t + u + v is minimal. Our aim is to ﬁnd a second solution (s′, t ′, u ′, v′) such that s′ + t ′ + u ′ + v′ < s + t + u + v, and we will do this by showing that u and v are even. Clearly, u and v must have the same parity in order for the sum of their cubes to be even. However, if they are both odd then u6 ≡ v6 ≡ 1 mod 4, so u 6 + v6 ̸≡ 0 mod 8, a contradiction. So we must have u = 2x, v = 2y for natural numbers x and y. But then 8(s6 + t 6) = u 6 + v6 = 64(x6 + y6), yielding x6 + y6 = 8(s6 + t6). So (x, y, s, t) is a second solution to the Diophantine equation, and since x + y = (u + v)/2 < u + v, we have x + y + s + t < s + t + u + v. This contradicts our choice of solution (s, t, u, v), so no such solution exists. Alternate solutions. The n = 8(s6 + t 6) rabbit out of a hat in the “oﬃcial” solution above isn’t the only way to solve this problem. Here are some alternate solutions. Multiplying by 64. Suppose that n = a2 + b2 = c3 + d3, but that n cannot be expressed as a sum of two sixth powers. Arguing as above we may show that 64n = (8a)2 + (8b)2 = (4c) 3 + (4d) 3 cannot be expressed as a sum of sixth powers either: Again, if 64n = x6 + y6 then x and y must have the same parity; if they are both odd, then x6 + y6 ≡ 2 mod 4, and if they are both even, then n is a sum of sixth powers. Thus, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a single solution. Ha Young Shin used this approach with the initial solution 637 = 14 2 + 212 = 8 3 + 53. It’s easy to check that this is not a sum of sixth powers, because 2 × 2 6 = 128 < 637 < 729 = 36. Working mod seven. A sixth power is congruent to 0 or 1 mod 7, so a sum of two sixth powers is congruent to 0, 1 or 2 mod 7. Thus, if we can ﬁnd n such that n = a2 + b2 = c3 + d3 and n is not congruent to 0, 1 or 2 mod 7, then n is not a sum of sixth powers. Moreover (7k + 1) 6n is both a sum of squares and a sum of cubes, and is congruent to n mod 7, so it’s not a sum of sixth powers either. Thus, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a single solution satisfying the conditions above. Tom Yan used this approach and found 370 = 73 + 33 = 3 2 + 192 ≡ 6 mod 7 as an initial solution. 5 Manipulating a factorisation. Chiao Lin considered the factorisation c3 + d3 = (c + d)(c2 − cd + d2) = (c + d) ( (c − d)2 + cd) = (c + d)(c − d) 2 + (c + d)cd. If c and d can be chosen such that c + d and cd are both squares then c3 + d3 will be a sum of squares. This can be achieved by letting c = j2(j2 + 1), d = j2 + 1, giving n = (j2 + 1)3(j6 + 1). To complete the problem, we may restrict our attention to j odd. Then n is even, so as above, if n = x6 + y6 then x and y have the same parity. If they are both odd then x6 + y6 ≡ 2 mod 8, and if they are both even then 64 | x6 + y6, so we might hope to show that the highest power of 2 dividing n lies between 2 and 2 6. Indeed, when j = 1 we have n = 16, so j ≡ 1 mod 32 gives n ≡ 16 mod 32 and we are done. (In fact it turns out that (j2 + 1)3(j6 + 1) ≡ 16 mod 32 for all odd j, so we needn’t restrict to j ≡ 1 mod 32.) Exploiting primes. Malcolm Granville found yet another family of solutions. There are inﬁnitely many primes of the form p = 4k + 1 (by Dirichlet’s Theorem, or otherwise), and for such a prime p, theorems about sums of squares tell us that n = 2p3 is a sum of two squares. The factorisation x6 + y6 = (x2 + y2)(x4 − x2y2 + y2) and the inequality x4 − x2y2 + y4 ≥ 1 4(x2 + y2)2 can then be used to show that 2p3 is not a sum of sixth powers. 8. (a) Let b, n > 1 be integers. Suppose that for each k > 1 there exists an integer ak such that b − an k is divisible by k. Prove that b = A n for some integer A. (b) Does the conclusion still hold if we only know that for every prime p there is an integer ap such that b − an p is divisible by p? Solution: Let the prime factorisation of b be b = pα1 1 · · · pαs s , where the pi are distinct primes. Our goal is to show that all the exponents are divisible by n, so that we may set A = pα1/n 1 · · · pαs/n s . To this end, apply the condition with k = b2. The number b − an k is divisible by b2 and hence, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ s, it is divisible by p2αi i > p αi as well. Therefore an k ≡ b ≡ 0 (mod pαi i ), and an k ≡ b ̸≡ 0 (mod pαi+1 i ). This implies that the highest power of pi dividing an k is pαi i . Since a n k is an nth power, this implies that αi is divisible by n, as desired. For the second part, let n = 8 and b = 16. Then x8 − 16 ≡ 0 (mod p) factors as (x2 − 2)(x2 + 2)(x2 − 2x + 2)(x2 + 2x + 2) ≡ 0 (mod p). If −1 is a square mod p then x2 + 2x + 2 = (x + 1)2 + 1 has a solution mod p; and if it is not, then one of x2 ≡ 2 and x2 ≡ −2 must have a solution (using the fact that the 6 Legendre symbol (x/p) is multiplicative — this means that the product of two quadratic non-residues must be a quadratic residue). This shows that the conclusion does not hold under the weaker condition on b. 9. Show that there are inﬁnitely many pairs of distinct primes (p, q) such that p | (2 q−1 − 1) and q | (2p−1 − 1). Solution: We’re looking for pairs of primes (p, q) such that the order of 2 modulo p divides q − 1, and the order of 2 modulo q divides p − 1. To do so, it’s obviously in our interest to choose primes where we have some control over the multiplicative order of 2. Consider a prime p dividing 2k + 1. We have 2 k ≡ −1 mod p, and 22k ≡ (−1) 2 ≡ 1 mod p, so the order of 2 modulo p divides 2k but not k. We can control this completely if we choose k of the form k = 2 n, because then the order of 2 must equal 2n+1; so, if p divides Fn = 2 2n + 1, then 2 has order 2 n+1 modulo p. So, let p be a divisor of Fn, and q a divisor of Fm, with n < m. Then p and q are distinct (otherwise the order of 2 mod p is equal to both 2 n+1 and 2m+1, a contradiction), and in addition we have p | (2 q−1 − 1): certainly 2 n+1 divides 2m+1, and 2 m+1 must divide q − 1, by Fermat’s theorem. So, it remains to show that we can choose m so that 2m+1 divides p − 1. We already have 2 n+1|(p − 1) (again by Fermat’s theorem), so let’s try m = n + 1 — we’ll then by halfway there (so to speak). One way we could show that 2n+2 divides p − 1 is to show that there’s an integer a such that the multiplicative order of a mod p is 2n+2. Now, we already know that 2 has order 2 n+1 mod p, so if we can choose a such that a2 ≡ 2 mod p we’ll be done. It’s known that 2 is a square mod p if and only if p ≡ ±1 mod 8 (this is “Supplement II” to the Law of Quadratic Reciprocity); and since 2n+1 | (p − 1), such an a exists provided we restrict ourselves to n ≥ 2. In summary: if p and q are primes dividing Fn and Fn+1 respectively, with n ≥ 2, then p and q are distinct and satisfy the conditions of the problem. Moreover, the ﬁrst sentence of the second paragraph shows that we get a diﬀerent pair (p, q) for each n. This completes the proof.
