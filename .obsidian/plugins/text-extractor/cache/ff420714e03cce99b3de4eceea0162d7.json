Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABCD be an isosceles trapezium having an incircle; let AB and CD be the parallel sides and let CE be the perpendicular from C on to AB. Prove that CE is equal to the geometric mean of AB and CD. 2. If x and y are positive real numbers, prove that 4x4 + 4y3 + 5x2 + y + 1 ≥ 12xy. 3. Determine all pairs m > n of positive integers such that 1 = gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 2, m + 2) = · · · = gcd(m, 2m − n). 4. What is the minimal area of a right-angled triangle whose inradius is 1 unit? 5. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and let I be its incentre. Let the incircle of triangle ABC touch BC in D. The incircle of the triangle ABD touches AB in E; the incircle of the triangle ACD touches BC in F . Prove that B, E, I, F are concyclic. 6. In the adjacent ﬁgure, can the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, · · · , 18 be placed, one on each line seg- ment, such that the sum of the numbers on the three line segments meeting at each point is di- visible by 3? ———-0000———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
