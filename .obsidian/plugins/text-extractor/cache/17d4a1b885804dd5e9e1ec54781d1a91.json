Applying to this to our present problem, if n is odd then n k is too, so (n k)2 − 1 is divisible by 8. To prove divisibility by 3 we will use the fact that m 2 − 1 is divisible by 3 whenever m itself is not divisible by 3. This follows from Fermat’s Little Theorem, but it can also be proved directly using the factorisation m 2 − 1 = (m − 1)(m + 1). If m is not divisible by 3 then either m − 1 or m + 1 must be divisible by 3 (just consider the remainder when m is divided by 3), so m 2 − 1 will be divisible by 3. Applying this to our present problem, either n or (n k)2 − 1 will be divisible by 3, and in either case the product n(n 2k − 1) has a factor of 3.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
