The inequality was presented along with its algebraic applications. This inequality not only has many applications in algebra but also it has many applications in geometry. We start with a nice proof of this result that appeared in [2]: Proposition 1. For all real numbers a, b, c, x, y, z such that ab + bc + ca ≥ 0 and xy + yz + zx ≥ 0 the following inequality holds (b + c)x + (c + a)y + (a + b)z ≥ 2 √(xy + yz + zx)(ab + bc + ca). Proof. Using Cauchy-Schwarz inequality we get (b + c)x + (c + a)y + (a + b)z = (a + b + c)(x + y + z) − (ax + by + cz) = √ [a2 + b2 + c2 + 2(ab + bc + ca)][x2 + y2 + z2 + 2(xy + yz + zx)] − (ax + by + cz) ≥ 2√ (xy + yz + zx)(ab + bc + ca) + √ (a2 + b2 + c2)(x2 + y2 + z2) − (ax + by + cz) ≥ 2√(xy + yz + zx)(ab + bc + ca). The next inequality can be proved as a corollary: Corollary 1. For all real positive numbers a, b, c, x, y, z the following inequality is true x y + z a + y z + x b + z x + y c ≥ √ 3(ab + bc + ca). Proof. Let us replace in Proposition 1 (x, y, z) with ( x y+z , y z+x , z x+y ) . Note that xy (z + x)(z + y) + yz (x + y)(x + z) + zx (y + z)(y + x) ≥ 3 4 , and the conclusion follows. Mathematical Reflections 3 (2008) 1 Proposition 2. Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC, then P A · P C bc + P C · P A ca + P A · P B ab ≥ 1. where a, b, c are the sides of the triangle. Proof. There are many ways to prove this inequality; we use complex numbers. Let the complex coordinates of A, B, C and P be A(a), B(b), C(c) and P (p), respectively. Using identity (b − c)(p − b)(p − c) + (c − a)(p − c)(p − a) + (a − b)(p − a)(p − b) = (a − b)(b − c)(c − a), we have BC · P B · P C + CA · P C · P A + AB · P A · P B = |(b − c)(p − b)(p − c)| + |(c − a)(p − c)(p − a)| + |(a − b)(p − a)(p − b)| ≥ |(b − c)(p − b)(p − c) + (c − a)(p − c)(p − a) + (a − b)(p − a)(p − b)| = |(a − b)(b − c)(c − a)| = AB · BC · CA. Dividing both sides by AB · BC · CA we get P B · P C bc + P C · P A ca + P A · P B ab ≥ 1. Note that the equality holds if and only if P = H, where H is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. Let us combine the ideas of the ﬁrst two propositions in the following statement: Proposition 3. Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC, and let x, y, z be real numbers such that xy + yz + zx ≥ 0. Then (y + z) P A a + (z + x) P B b + (x + y) P C c ≥ 2√xy + yz + zx. Proof. We apply Proposition 1 for ( P A a , P B b , P C c ) and (x, y, z) to get (y + z) P A a + (z + x) P B b + (x + y) P C c ≥ 2 √ (xy + yz + zx) ( P A · P C bc + P C · P A ca + P A · P B ab ) ≥ 2√xy + yz + zx, as desired. We continue with a few classical problems that can be solved with the help of the established results. Mathematical Reflections 3 (2008) 2 2 Applications Problem 1. Consider triangle ABC and a point P in its plane. Prove that P A a + P B b + P C c ≥ √3. Solution. Plugging x = y = z = 1 in the Proposition 3, we get 2 ( P A a + P B b + P C c ) ≥ 2 √3, and we are done. Problem 2. Consider triangle ABC and a point P in its plane. Prove that a · P A + b · P B + c · P C ≥ 4KABC, where KABC is the area of triangle ABC. Solution. Let a, b, c be the triangle’s sides. Denote x = b2+c2−a2 2 , y = a2+c2−b2 2 , z = a2+b2−c2 2 . Then xy + yz + zx = 2(a2b2 + b2c2 + c2a2) − (a4 + b4 + c4) 4 = 4K2 ABC ≥ 0. Hence using Proposition 3 for these (x, y, z) we get a 2 · P A a + b2 · P B b + c 2 · P C c = a · P A + b · P B + c · P C ≥ 4KABC. Problem 3. Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC. Prove that P A + P B + P C ≥ 6r, where r is the inradius of the incircle of triangle ABC. Solution. Let x = s − a, y = s − b, z = s − c, where a, b, c are the triangle’s sides and s is the semiperimeter. Then using Proposition 3 we get P A + P B + P C ≥ 2√(s − a)(s − b) + (s − b)(s − c) + (s − c)(s − a). Recall that (s − a)(s − b) + (s − b)(s − c) + (s − c)(s − a) = r(4R + r), where R and r are the circumradius and inradius, respectively. Thus we get a much stronger inequality P A + P B + P C ≥ 2√ r(4R + r).
