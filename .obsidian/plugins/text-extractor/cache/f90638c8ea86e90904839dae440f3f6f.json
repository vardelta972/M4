Let a, b, c, d be positive real numbers such that abcd = 1 and a + b + c + d > a b + b c + c d + d a . Prove that a + b + c + d < b a + c b + d c + a d . 2. In an acute triangle ABC, segments BE and CF are altitudes. Two circles passing through the points A and F are tangent to the line BC at the points P and Q so that B lies between C and Q. Prove that the lines P E and QF intersect on the circumcircle of triangle AEF . 3. For every n ∈ N, let d(n) denote the number of (positive) divisors of n. Find all functions f : N → N with the following properties: (a) d(f (x)) = x for all x ∈ N; (b) f (xy) divides (x − 1)yxy−1f (x) for all x, y ∈ N.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
