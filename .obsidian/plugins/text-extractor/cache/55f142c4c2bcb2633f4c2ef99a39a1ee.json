Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect the line CB at D. Prove that CI is perpendicular to AD and prove that ID = √ b(b − a) where BC = a and CA = b. 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a 1 + a + b 1 + b + c 1 + c = 1. Prove that abc ≤ 1/8. 3. For any natural number n, expressed in base 10, let S(n) denote the sum of all digits of n. Find all natural numbers n such that n = 2S(n)2. 4. Find the number of all 6-digit natural numbers having exactly three odd digits and three even digits. 5. Let ABC be a triangle with centroid G. Let the circumcircle of triangle AGB intersect the line BC in X diﬀerent from B; and the circumcircle of triangle AGC intersect the line BC in Y diﬀerent from C. Prove that G is the centroid of triangle AXY . 6. Let ⟨a1, a2, a3, . . .⟩ be a strictly increasing sequence of positive integers in an arithmetic progression. Prove that there is an inﬁnite subsequence of the given sequence whose terms are in a geometric progression. ———-0———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
