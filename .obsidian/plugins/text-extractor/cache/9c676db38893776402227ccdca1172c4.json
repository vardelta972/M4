Let Λ be another circle passing through O and intersecting Γ at points A and B. A diameter CD of Γ intersects Λ at a point P diﬀerent from O. Prove that ∠AP C = ∠BP D . Solution. Suppose that A′ is a point on Λ such that ∠A′P C = ∠BP D. Then the segments OA′ and OB subtends same angle in the respective minor arcs, so OA′ = OB. This shows that A lies on Γ and hence A′ = A. This proves that ∠AP C = ∠BP D. 2. Determine the smallest prime that does not divide any ﬁve-digit number whose digits are in a strictly increasing order. Solution. Note that 12346 is even, 3 and 5 divide 12345, and 7 divides 12348. Consider a 5 digit number n = abcde with 0 < a < b < c < d < e < 10. Let S = (a + c + e) − (b + d). Then S = a + (c − b) + (e − d) > a > 0 and S = e − (d − c) − (b − a) < e ≤ 10, so S is not divisible by 11 and hence n is not divisible by 11. Thus 11 is the smallest prime that does not divide any ﬁve-digit number whose digits are in a strictly increasing order. 3. Given real numbers a, b, c, d, e > 1 prove that a2 c − 1 + b2 d − 1 + c2 e − 1 + d2 a − 1 + e2 b − 1 ≥ 20 . Solution. Note that (a − 2)2 ≥ 0 and hence a2 ≥ 4(a − 1). Since a > 1 we have a2 a − 1 ≥ 4. By applying AM-GM inequality we get a2 c − 1 + b2 d − 1 + c2 e − 1 + d2 a − 1 + e2 b − 1 ≥ 5 5 √ a2b2c2d2e2 (a − 1)(b − 1)(c − 1)(d − 1)(e − 1) ≥ 20 . 4. Let x be a non-zero real number such that x4 + 1 x4 and x5 + 1 x5 are both rational numbers. Prove that x + 1 x is a rational number. Solution. For a natural number k let Tk = xk + 1/xk. Note that T4T2 = T2 + T6 and T8T2 = T10 + T6. Therefore T2(T8 − T4 + 1) = T10. Since T2k = T 2 k + 2 it follows that T8, T10 are rational numbers and hence T2, T6 are also rational numbers. Since T5T1 = T4 + T6 it follows that T1 is a rational number. 5. In a triangle ABC, let H denote its orthocentre. Let P be the reﬂection of A with respect to BC. The circumcircle of triangle ABP intersects the line BH again at Q, and the circumcircle of triangle ACP intersects the line CH again at R. Prove that H is the incentre of triangle P QR. 1 Paper 4 Regional Mathematical Olympiad 2013 December 1, 2013 Solution. Since RACP is a cyclic quadrilateral it follows that ∠RP A = ∠RCA = 90◦ − ∠A. Similarly, from cyclic quadrilateral BAQP we get ∠QP A = 90◦ − ∠A. This shows that P H is the angular bisector of ∠RP Q. We next show that R, A, Q are collinear. For this, note that ∠BP C = ∠A. Since ∠BHC = 180◦ − ∠A it follows that BHCP is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore ∠RAP + ∠QAP = ∠RCP + ∠QBP = 180◦. This proves that R, A, Q are collinear. Now ∠QRC = ∠ARC = ∠AP C = ∠P AC = ∠P RC. This proves that RC is the angular bisector of ∠P RQ and hence H is the incenter of triangle P QR. 6. Suppose that the vertices of a regular polygon of 20 sides are coloured with three colours – red, blue and green – such that there are exactly three red vertices. Prove that there are three vertices A, B, C of the polygon having the same colour such that triangle ABC is isosceles. Solution. Since there are exactly three vertices, among the remaining 17 vertices there are nine of them of the same colour, say blue. We can divide the vertices of the regular 20-gon into four disjoint sets such that each set consists of vertices that form a regular pentagon. Since there are nine blue points, at least one of these sets will have three blue points. Since any three points on a pentagon form an isosceles triangle, the statement follows. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
