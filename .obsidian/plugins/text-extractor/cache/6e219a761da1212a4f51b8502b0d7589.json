Without loss of generality, assume x yz≥≥ . Let 1 3 zk= − . Then 1 0 3 k≤ ≤ . Using the facts that 2 3 x yk+= + and 22 1 23 2 x yk xy +⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ≤= +⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠ , we get () () () 2 2 3 3 31 3 2 12 1 3 33 3 2 23 94 23 1 94 3 1 4 xy xy yz zx xyz z x y z k kk k k +⎛⎞ ++ − ≤ + + −⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ ⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ =− + + +⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ =+ ⎛⎞ ≤+ ⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ ≤ Alternative Solution Note that 5 22 2 22 2 3(1 ) (1 ) (1 ) () ( ) ( ) () ( ) ( ) (1 ) (1 ) (1 ) xy yz zx xyz xy z yz x xz y xyx y yz y z xz z x x yz y x z z yx x xy y z z ++ − = − + − + − = ++ + + + = ++ ++ + =− + − + − Since 22(1 ) (1 2 ) 0 44 xx xx x−− = − − ≤ , we have 2 (1 ) 4 x xx− ≤ .

After some trial, we find that equality holds when the two triangles on the left hand side are similar, i.e. when '' ' x yz x yz = = . This is clearly the equality condition for the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Therefore, we attempt to use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to solve the problem. Now we must express the area of a triangle in terms of its side lengths. Clearly, we should use the Heron’s formula, which states that the area of a triangle with side lengths a, b, c is ()( )( )ss a s b s c− −− , where 2 abc s ++ = . Hence the original inequality becomes 44 4 ()( )( ) '( ' ')( ' ')( ' ') ( ')( ' ')( ' ')( ' ') ss x s y s z s s x s y s z ss ss x x ss y y ss z z −− − + − − − ≤ + +− − +−− +− − with 2 x yz s ++ = and '' ' ' 2 x yz s ++ = .

By the AM-GM inequality, ()()() 1 2 2004 2 3 2004 1 3 2004 1 2 2003 2003 2003 2003 2 3 2004 1 3 2004 1 2 2003 2004 1 2 2004 (1 )(1 ) (1 ) ()( ) ( ) 2003 2003 2003 2003 aa a aa a a a a a a a aa a a a a a a a aa a −− − = + ++ + + + + ++ ≥⋅ ⋅ ⋅ = Hence we have 1 2 2004 2004 1 2 2004 1 (1 )(1 ) (1 ) 2003 aa a aa a ≤ −− − . Furthermore, equality holds when 2004 1 200421 ==== aaa . Therefore, the answer is 2004 1 2003 . 5.

Let x ab c=+ − , y bc a= +− and zc a b= +− . Then the original inequality becomes 22 2 x yy z z x xy z + ++ ++ ≤ + + . By the AM-GM inequality, we have 2 2 24 4 2 4 4 2 xy x y xy xyx yx y x y x y⎛⎞++ + + ++ + == + ≤ + =⎜⎟⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ and hence 22 xy x y+ + ≤ . Similarly, we have 22 yz yz+ + ≤ and 22 zx z x+ + ≤ . Adding these three inequalities, we have 22 2 x yy z z x xy z + ++ ++ ≤ + + , thereby proving the original inequality. Finally, equality in the above application of AM-GM inequality occurs if x y= , i.e. x y= . Similarly we must have yz= and zx= . If x y= , then ab c b c a+ −= + − , hence 22ac= and ac= . Similarly, we must have ab= and bc= . That is, equality holds if and only if abc==. 7. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have ()( ) 2 2 2222 2111 ( )x yz x y z++ + + ≥ + + 8 which gives () 22 23x yz x y z++ ≤ + + . On the other hand, the AM-GM inequality asserts that 2 33( )xyyz zx xyz++ ≥ and 1 22 2 33( ) .x yz xyz++ ≥ Consequently, we have ( ) () ()( ) () ()( ) () () ( ) () 22 2 2 2 222 2 22 2 2 2 2 22 2 22 2 22 2 12 33 3 () () 31 () 31 () 31 3( ) 3( ) 31 33 33 9 xyz x y z x y zxyz x y z x y z xy z xy yz zx x y z xy yz zx xyz x y z xy z xy yz zx xyz xy z xy yz zx xyz xyz xyz ++ + + +++ + + + ≤ ++ + + ++ + + ++ + = ++ + + + = ++ + + + ≤ ⋅ + = + = 8. By the rearrangement inequality, we have ( ) 33 2 2a b a b ab ab a b+ ≥+ = + . Similarly, we have () 33bc bc b c+≥ + and ( ) 33ca ca c a+ ≥+ .

(b) Consider the term with i = 1 and j = 2 in the last two expressions in (a). We have )()( 2 2 2 121 22 2 2 121 xxxxxxxxx n +≥+++ . This equality holds if and only if nxxx === 43 . As the choice of i and j is arbitrary, if any (n – 2) of the ix ’s are zero, then equality in the last inequality holds, and vice versa When (n – 2) of the ix ’s are zero, the inequality is reduced to the case of n = 2. Consider the application of AM-GM inequality in (a). 10 Equality holds if and only if 21 2 2 2 1 2 xxxx =+ , or 0)( 2 21 =− xx , i.e. 21 xx = . Hence equality of the original inequality holds if and only if any (n – 2) of the ix ’s are zero and the remaining two ix ’s are equal (possibly to zero). 11 Inequalities (Unit 3) 1.

Putting this into the original inequality, the original inequality can be simplified as follows: 22 2 44 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 44 4 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 2 22 2 2 2 2 22 2 2 3( )( )( )( ) 22 2 3 ( ) ( ) 22 2 3 2 ( ) 2 ( ) 22 2 3 22 2 a b c abc abc a b c a b c abc a b b c c a b c a a b c abc a b b c c a bc bc a bc b c a a b c ab bc c a ab bc c + + ≥ + + − ++ − + +− ⎡⎤ ⎡ ⎤++ + + + ≥ + − − −⎣⎦ ⎣ ⎦ ⎡ ⎤⎡ ⎤++ + + + ≥ + + − − + −⎣ ⎦⎣ ⎦ ++ + + + ≥ + +[] 24 4 4 44 4 2 22 2 2 244 4 4 4 4 aa b c abc a b b c c a −− − ++ ≥ + + By the AM-GM inequality, we have ()()() 44 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 44 4 4 4 4 22 2 2 2 2 44 4 (22 ) (2 2 ) (2 2 ) 22 2 2 2 2 22 2 44 4 abc a b b c c a ab bc c a ab bc c a ++ = + + + + + ≥⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ =+ + thereby proving the last inequality and hence the original inequality. It is clear in the application of the AM-GM inequality that equality holds if and only if abc==. Alternative Solution Without loss of generality, assume that the angle opposite the side a is acute. Suppose that the altitude from this vertex, whose length we denote by h, is of distances m and n from the remaining 2 vertices, with 22bh m=+ and 22ch n= + . WLOG, assume that m ≥ n. Then a=m+n or m-n. For a=m+n, the original inequality becomes 22 2 2 2 () () ( ) ( ) 4 3 2 mn h m n hm hn + +++ ++ ≥ ⋅ . Rewriting this as a quadratic equality in h, we have 22 23( ) ( ) 0hm n h m mn n−+ + + + ≥ . The discriminant of the quadratic function on the left is 2 22 23( ) 4(1)( ) ( ) 0mn m mn n m n⎡⎤Δ =+ − + + = − − ≤⎣⎦ . Since the coefficient of 2h is positive, this means 22 23( ) ( ) 0hm n h m mn n− ++ + + ≤ for all h, as desired. Equality holds when mn= , which means bc= . By symmetry, we need abc==. For a=m-n, the argument is the same as above, with n replaced by –n. 12 2. Rewrite the given inequality as 22 2 2 cos 60ca b ab= +− ° . Hence we see that a, b, c are the side lengths of a triangle where the angle opposite the side with length c is equal to 60°. In a triangle, a side opposite a larger angle is longer. Since 60° = 180° ÷ 3, one other angle of the triangle must be at least 60° and the remaining angle must be at most 60°. In other words, if we assume (without loss of generality) that ab≥ , then we must have ac≥ and bc≤ . From this, we see that ac− is positive while bc− is negative, so that ( )( ) 0ac b c−− ≤ . 3. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have () ( ) 2BC CA AB BCPD CA PE AB PF BC CA AB PD PE PF ⎛⎞ ++ ⋅ + ⋅ + ⋅ ≥ + +⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . Hence 2()BC CA AB BC CA AB PD PE PF BC PD CA PE AB PF ++ ++ ≥ ⋅ +⋅ + ⋅ . The right hand side of the above inequality is a constant, since the numerator is the square of the perimeter while the denominator is twice the area. Equality holds if and only if :: ( ) : ( ) : ( ) BC CA AB BCPD CA PE AB PF PD PE PF =⋅ ⋅ ⋅ , or PD PE PF== . In other words, the expression in the question is minimum when (and only when) P is the incentre of ΔABC. 4. Let ' AI x AA = , ' BI y BB = and ' CI z CC = . The inequality to be proved is then 18 427 xyz≤≤ .

To prove the left-hand inequality, we first make some additional observation as follows. Let D, E, F be the mid-points of BC, CA, AB respectively. We claim that I lies in ΔDEF. Assuming the claim, we draw a line through I parallel to BC cutting AB at S. Since ΔASI ~ ΔABA’, we have 1 '2 AI AS AF x AA AB AB == > =. Similarly, we have 1 2 y > and 1 2 z > . Now we return to the proof of the claim, namely, that I lies in ΔDEF. Indeed, the angle bisector theorem yields '' AIAB IABA = and ' ' BAAB A CAC = , so that 'BA AB BCAB AC = + and hence 1 ' AI AB AC BC IA BC BC + = >= by the triangle inequality. Hence I is ‘below’ EF in the figure, and the same is true with respect to DF and DE, thereby establishing the claim. Consequently, we may write 1 2 x α=+ , 1 2 y β= + and 1 2 z γ= + for some ,, 0α βγ > . Then we have () () () 11 1 22 2 11 1 84 2 11 84 11 1 84 2 1 4 xyz αβ γ α β γ αβ βγ γα αβγ αβ γ ⎛⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ =+ + +⎜⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ =+ + + + + + + >+ + + ⎛⎞ =+ ⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ = and hence proving the left-hand inequality. A B C I D E F A’ S 14 5. Let AB = BC = CD = a and DE = EF = FA = b. As shown in the figure, construct equilateral triangles ABX and DEY. Since ∠AXB = ∠DYE = 60°, AX = XB = BD = a and DY = YE = EA = b, the two hexagons ABCDEF and AXBDYE are congruent and so CF = XY. Since ∠AXB + ∠AGB = 180° = ∠DHE + ∠DYE, AXBG and DYEH are cyclic quadrilaterals. Hence by the Ptolemy’s theorem, AGXBBGAXXGAB ⋅+⋅=⋅ , which is equivalent to aAGaBGaXG += , or AGBGXG += . Similarly, we have EHDHYH += and hence EFXYYHGHXGHEDHGHGBAG =≥++=++++ . 6. As shown in the figure, extend BC and EF to draw a rectangle PQRS enclosing the hexagon. Since opposite sides of the hexagon are parallel, opposite angles are equal (i.e. ∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E and ∠C = ∠F). Let a, b, c, d, e, f denote the lengths of AB, BC, CD, DE, EF and FA respectively.
