Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABC be a triangle. Let B′ and C ′ denote respectively the reﬂection of B and C in the internal angle bisector of ∠A. Show that the triangles ABC and AB′C ′ have the same incentre. 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Suppose there are real numbers s ̸= t such that P (s) = t and P (t) = s. Prove that b − st is a root of the equation x2 + ax + b − st = 0. 3. Find all integers a, b, c such that a2 = bc + 1, b 2 = ca + 1. 4. Suppose 32 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? 5. Two circles Γ and Σ in the plane intersect at two distinct points A and B, and the centre of Σ lies on Γ. Let points C and D be on Γ and Σ, respectively, such that C, B and D are collinear. Let point E on Σ be such that DE is parallel to AC. Show that AE = AB. 6. Find all real numbers a such that 4 < a < 5 and a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) ———-00———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
