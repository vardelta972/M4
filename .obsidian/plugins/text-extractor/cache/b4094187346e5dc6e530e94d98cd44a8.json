Determine all primes p such that 5p + 4p4 is a square number. 2. For each positive integer a we consider the sequence ⟨an⟩ with a0 = a and an = an−1+40n!. Prove that every such sequence contains inﬁnitely many numbers that are divisible by 2009. 3. Find all integers k such that for every integer n, the numbers 4n + 1 and kn + 1 are relatively prime. 4. Let n be a positive integer. Prove that if the sum of all of the positive divisors of n is a perfect power of 2, then the number of those divisors is also a perfect power of 2. 5. (a) Show that there are inﬁnitely many pairs of positive integers (m, n) such that k = m + 1 n + n + 1 m (1) is a positive integer. (b) Find all positive integers k such that (1) has a positive integer solution (m, n). 6. (a) Find all primes p for which 7 p−1 − 1 p is a perfect square. (b) Find all primes p for which 11 p−1 − 1 p is a perfect square. 7. Prove that there exist inﬁnitely many natural numbers n with the following properties: n can be expressed as a sum of two squares, n = a2 + b2, and as a sum of two cubes, n = c3 + d3, but can’t be expressed as a sum n = x6 + y6 of two sixth powers, where a, b, c, d, x, y are natural numbers. 8. (a) Let b, n > 1 be integers. Suppose that for each k > 1 there exists an integer ak such that b − an k is divisible by k. Prove that b = An for some integer A. (b) Does the conclusion still hold if we only know that for every prime p there is an integer ap such that b − an p is divisible by p? 9. Show that there are inﬁnitely many pairs of distinct primes (p, q) such that p | (2q−1 − 1) and q | (2p−1 − 1). 29th January 2010 www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
