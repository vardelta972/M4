Nonetheless, there is a rather short list of general methods and results that often apply. 1. Calculation and conversion of the problem into a “normal” inequality. The key in using this method is to express the quantities in the problem in terms of variables that will make the inequality nice. Common choices are lengths of sides, trigonometric functions of angles, and areas. Often, the inequality will be intractable with one choice of variables but quite easy with another. In easier problems, the choice of variables is obvious and ex- pressing the inequality in terms of those variables is immediate. In harder problems, you may need to do some geometry or a fair amount of computation to re-express the inequality. The Laws of Sines and Cosines, Angle Bisector theorem, Ceva, trig Ceva, Menelaus, and Stewart’s theorem may come in handy. The distinguishing characteristic of this category of geometric inequalities is that the inequality is ultimately achieved through algebra; all of the previous steps involved equalities. Once the inequality is set up, all of the techniques for solving regular inequalities apply. Some appear much more frequently than others, however. Whereas standard inequalities (especially the harder ones) often require algebra tricks, the list of frequently-used techniques in geometric inequalities is much more mundane. In fact, smoothing and multiplying out are probably the most common. When multiplying out an inequality involving the sides of a triangle, the constraints of the triangle inequality can be removed by using the triangle substitution a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y, where x = s − a, y = s − b, z = s − c. In most cases, however, the inequality will arise from geometry rather than algebra, and the next few methods address this case. 2. Triangle inequality. Although this inequality may seem trivial, its use is surprisingly prevalent—even in some of the hardest problems! Of the problems below, roughly one-fourth involve the triangle inequality. The biggest clue is summed lengths. In geometry problems, the trick is usually to put such pairs of lengths along the same line; in geometric inequalities, moving the lengths to segments that share an endpoint suﬃces. 3. Ptolemy’s inequality. Here, the hints are sums of products or ratios of lengths, the latter of which can be obtained by taking Ptolemy’s inequality and dividing out by some length. Another hint is an equality condition involving concyclic points. As a side note, Ptolemy’s 1 inequality itself can be seen to be equivalent to the triangle inequality upon inversion. (Prove this as an exercise if you aren’t familiar with this fact.) Like the triangle inequality, Ptolemy’s inequality comes in handy surprisingly often. A good example that combines these two methods is the proof that the Fermat point F for which ̸ 2. [S 96] Let ABC be an equilateral triangle and let P be a point in its interior. Let lines AP, BP, CP meet sides BC, CA, AB at points A1, B1, C1, respectively. Prove that A1B1 · B1C1 · C1A1 ≥ A1B · B1C · C1A. 3.

Let AO meet circle BOC again at A ′, and deﬁne B′ and C′ analogously. Prove that OA ′ · OB′ · OC′ ≥ 8R3 and determine when equality holds. 3. [S 02] Let ABC be a triangle for which there exists an interior point F such that ̸ 4. [IMO 96/5] Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon such that AB is parallel to DE, BC is parallel to EF , and CD is parallel to F A. Let RA, RC , RE denote the circumradii of triangles F AB, BCD, DEF , respectively, and let P denote the perimeter of the hexagon. Prove that RA + RC + RE ≥ P Easier Problems 1. Trig Ceva; Jensen. 2.

For the reverse, let DEF be the medial triangle of ABC. Without loss of generality, assume A1 ∈ as z approaches inﬁnity, f (z) approaches (l − k)/(j − i) < 1, so we can choose D at z > l such that f (z) = 1. Then 1/(z −i)+1/(z −l) = 1/(z −j)+1/(z −k), so the images of ω and Γ under inversion by D are concentric. Moreover, since 0 < 1/(z−i) < 1/(z−j) < 1/(z−k) < 1/(z−l), (1/(z − i))(1/(z − l)) < (1/(z − j))(1/(z − k)). This implies that (1/(z−k)−1/(z−j))/(1/(z−l)−1/(z−i)) = (k−j)/(l−i)·(z−i)(z−l)/(z−j)(z−k) > (k−j)/(l−i) = x/r′. In other words, the ratio between the radius of ω and Γ increases after the inversion. Since the circles centered at A ′, B′, and C′ invert to circles orthogonal to the image of Γ and tangent to the image of ω, we have that the ratio after inversion is just 2 − √","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
