This produces the complex projec- tive line, \u0000\u00001. It can be considered to be a projective space represented by a pair of complex coordinates, \u0000x, y\u0000, where scalar (complex) multiples are considered equivalent. Hence, for all points except \u0000, we can normalise the coordinates as \u0000 x y , 1\u0000. We identify these points with points on the ordinary complex plane by letting z \u0000 x y . If y \u0000 0, this results in the point at infinity, \u0000. We consider a line to be a generalised circle passing through \u0000. Two-dimensional inversion Inversion is essentially a reflection in a circle. Points outside the circle are interchanged with points inside the circle in an involution of the plane. \u0000 For a circle * with centre O, we define the inverse point of P to be the point P ' on the line O P (at the same side as P from O) such that O P \u0000 O P ' \u0000 R2, where R is the radius of *.

Möbius transformations We define a Möbius transformation to be a transformation of the form z \u0000 a z\u0000b c z\u0000d , where a, b, c, d \u0000 \u0000. It is also necessary to include the condition that a d \u0000 b c ! 0, to remove degenerate singular non-invertible cases. We can assume without loss of generality, therefore, that a b \u0000 c d \u0000 1. 6. Show that the composition of any two Möbius transformations is another Möbius transformation. 7. Prove that the composition of any inversion followed by any reflection is a Möbius transformation. 8. Show that, for four points w, x, y, z \u0000 \u0000, the value of \u0000w\u0000x\u0000 \u0000y\u0000z\u0000 \u0000x\u0000y\u0000 \u0000z\u0000w\u0000 remains invariant when a Möbius transformation is applied. Indeed, this follows naturally from the fact that Möbius transformations are projective transformations of the complex projective line. Hence, it is possible to find a unique Möbius transformation mapping any three points to any other three points. 9. Demonstrate that generalised circles remain as generalised circles under any Möbius transformation, and thus under inversion. Like all non-trivial rational functions of z, Möbius transformations are conformal maps, which means angles between curves are (in general) preserved. Inversion reverses the direction of directed angles, but preserves the magnitude. This property can be derived from the fact that generalised circles remain as generalised circles. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 10. Suppose P1 P2 P3 P4 is a cyclic quadrilateral. The circle *n passes through Pn and Pn\u00001, with subscripts considered modulo 4. Circles *n and *n\u00001 intersect again at Qn\u00001. Prove that Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 are either concyclic or collinear. [Miquel’s theorem] 11. Let A B C be a triangle with a right-angle at C. Let C N be an altitude. A circle * is tangent to line segments B N, C N and the circumcircle of A B C. If D is where * touches B N, prove that C D bisects angle 2 B C N. [NST2 2011, Question 3] Ivan’s 25 circles Consider a cyclic quadrilateral A B C D with circumcentre O. Let A B intersect C D at P. Similarly, we define Q \u0000 B C \u0000 D A and R \u0000 A C \u0000 B D. 12. Prove that P is the pole of Q R, and hence that O is the orthocentre of P Q R. [Brocard’s theorem] Denote the feet of the altitudes from P, Q and R with X , Y and Z, respectively. Then, we obtain six cyclic quadri- laterals from the fact that O is the orthocentre of P Q R. 13. Prove that inversion about the circumcircle of A B C D interchanges O with \u0000, P with X , Q with Y and R with Z. 14. Hence prove that O A B X are concyclic. By symmetry, this gives us six cyclic quadrilaterals, increasing the total to twelve (excluding A B C D). There are still another twelve circles on the diagram to be found. 15. Show also that B C X R are concyclic. By symmetry, this increases the total of cyclic quadrilaterals to 24 (excluding A B C D). These circles were discovered by Ivan Guo. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 A B C D O P Q RX Y Z As well as inverting about O, one can also invert about P, Q or R to permute the vertices. Harmonic quadrilaterals 16. Let A B C D be a cyclic quadrilateral. Choose a point P on the circumcircle of A B C D and a line \u0000 outside the circle. The line P A meets \u0000 at A1; points B1, C1 and D1 are defined similarly. Show that the cross-ratio \u0000A1, C1; B1, D1\u0000 does not depend on the locations of P and \u0000. \u0000 P A B C D A' B' C' D' If \u0000A1, C1; B1, D1\u0000 = -1, then the cyclic quadrilateral A B C D is known as a harmonic quadrilateral. Harmonic quadrilaterals have many nice properties: 17. Let A B C D be a convex cyclic quadrilateral. Let the tangents to the circumcircle at A and C meet at E; let the tangents to the circumcircle at B and D meet at F. Let the diagonals A C and B D intersect at P. Then show that the following properties are equivalent: \u0000 A B C D is a harmonic quadrilateral; \u0000 A B \u0000 C D \u0000 B C \u0000 D A \u0000 1 2 A C \u0000 B D; \u0000 E, B and D are collinear; \u0000 B, D and K are collinear, where K is the symmedian point of A B C; \u0000 \u0000P, E; B, D\u0000 \u0000 \u00001. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 18. If a quadrilateral A B C D is represented by complex numbers a, b, c and d in the Argand plane, show that it is harmonic if and only if \u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000c \u0000 d\u0000 \u0000 \u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000d \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000 0. 19. Deduce that harmonic quadrilaterals/ranges remain harmonic after inversion. The collinearity of E, B, K and D gives us an elegant construction of the symmedian point: let the tangents to the circumcircle at B and C intersect at A', and define B' and C ' similarly. The symmedian point is then the intersec- tion of A A', B B' and C C '. A1 B1 C1 K A B C Generalised spheres We started by defining Möbius transformations and inversion in the environment of complex numbers. However, complex numbers are restricted to two (real) dimensions, so cannot be used to generalise the ideas to n-dimen- sional space. Instead, we will need to consider this from a more Euclidean perspective. When discussing objects in n-dimensional space, we use the following conventions: \u0000 A n-ball comprises all points in \u0000n within a distance of R from a point O. \u0000 The surface of a n-ball is a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere. \u0000 The set of points in \u0000 n obeying a single linear equation is a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane. \u0000 A generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere can be a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere or a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane. 20. Show that the intersection of two generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres in \u0000n is either empty, a single point, or a generalised \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-sphere lying in a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane of \u0000n. [Intersection of generalised spheres] 21. Let * be a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere and P a point in \u0000n. Lines l1 and l2 pass through P. l1 intersects * at A and B; l2 intersects * at C and D. Prove that P A \u0000 P B \u0000 P C \u0000 P D. [n-dimensional intersecting chords theorem] 22. If a point P \u0000 \u0000n has equal power with respect to non-concentric \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres *1 and *2, then it lies on their radical axis. Show that the radical axis of two identical \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres is a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane. This forms the basis of an ingenious proof by Géza Kós that the radical axis of any two (non-concentric) circles on the plane \u0000 is a line. Firstly, erect two spheres of equal radius, *1 and *2, on the circles. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 The radical axis of the two circles is the intersection of the radical plane of *1 and *2 with the plane \u0000. This construction clearly generalises to two non-concentric \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres in \u0000n, by embedding the situation into \u0000n\u00001 with equiradial n-spheres. n-dimensional inversion We are now in a suitable position to define n-dimensional inversion and investigate its properties. \u0000 Let * be a \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere in \u0000n with centre O and radius R. For any point P \u0000 \u0000n, the inverse point P ' is defined to lie on the line O P at the same side of O such that O P \u0000 O P ' \u0000 R2. [Definition of n-dimensional inversion] 23. Prove that generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres map to generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres under inversion. 24. Draw a generalised \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-sphere on the surface of some generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere in \u0000n. Prove that, after inversion, this will remain a generalised \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-sphere. [Backward compatibility of inversion] The oblique cones in the diagram below intersect both the plane and the sphere in circular cross-sections, as the sphere and plane are inverses with respect to P. This idea of projecting the sphere onto a plane from a point on the sphere is known as stereographic projection. The diagram above enables us to easily define Möbius transformations. Let P be an arbitrary point outside the plane \u0000. An arbitrary Möbius transformation of the plane \u0000 is the composition of: \u0000 A two-dimensional translation and/or homothety of the plane \u0000; \u0000 An inversion about the unit sphere centred on P, transforming \u0000 into a sphere 5 (the Riemann sphere); \u0000 A rotation of the sphere 5 about its centre (P does not move with the sphere); \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 An inversion about the unit sphere centred on P, transforming 5 back into \u0000. There are six degrees of freedom in this transformation, so they must represent all Möbius transformations, and nothing else. This definition of a Möbius transformation clearly generalises to \u0000n (with 1 2 \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000 degrees of freedom), whereas the complex number definition does not. 25. Suppose two smooth curves are drawn in \u0000n, which intersect at a point. Prove that the angle of intersection is preserved (or, more accurately, reversed) after inversion. [Anti-conformal map] Kaleidoscopes You may have encountered kaleidoscopes, where mirrors are used to form lots of repeated copies of a ‘fundamental region’. For example, we can generate patterns with the same symmetries as the hexagonal tiling by using a triangle of mirrors with internal angles of 1 \u0000, 1 \u0000 and 1 \u0000. Mathematicians regard this as a group of symmetries, generated by the three reflections. If we call the reflections %, (, ,, then we have the relations % 2 \u0000 ( 2 \u0000 ,2 \u0000 I, where I is the identity element; a reflection is its own inverse. Our three rotations, % (, ( , and , %, together generate half of the symmetry group, namely the group of direct congruences. We also have \u0000% (\u00002 \u0000 \u0000( ,\u00003 \u0000 \u0000, %\u00006 \u0000 I, as applying a rotation of 2 \u0000 is equivalent to the identity. In Euclidean geometry, the interior angles of a triangle necessarily sum to \u0000. However, if we allow circular arcs instead of straight lines, this condition can be relaxed. For example, we can have a curvilinear triangle with interior angles of 1 2 \u0000, 1 3 \u0000, 1 5 \u0000: Reflection in the circular arc is simply inversion, and reflections in the straight lines are ordinary reflections. In this manner, we generate a spherical reflection group, namely the symmetry group of a dodecahedron. The compositions % (, ( , and , % are no longer necessarily rotations, but are instead Möbius transformations. For this group, \u0000% (\u00002 \u0000 \u0000( ,\u00003 \u0000 \u0000, %\u00005. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 The above picture of icosahedral symmetry may look distorted, not least because we have flattened the Riemann sphere into a plane by stereographic projection. Finally, we can produce hyperbolic tilings by ensuring the interior angles of the fundamental triangle sum to less than \u0000 (by using concave arcs); this visualisation of the hyperbolic plane is known as the Poincaré disc model. We can define ‘distances’ and ‘angles’ in hyperbolic geometry. As hyperbolic space must be invariant under any Möbius transformation mapping the unit circle to itself, distances and angles must also be preserved. We already know that complex (or cyclic) cross-ratio is invariant under Möbius transformations. The (directed) hyperbolic distance between two points, A and B, is given by the logarithm of the cyclic cross-ratio \u0000A, B; X , Y \u0000, where X and Y are the two intersections of the circle A B B' A ' (where ' indicates inversion in the unit circle) with the unit circle. Note that A B B ' A' is orthogonal to the unit circle. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 A B X Y \u0000 The hyperbolic distance between two points is given by A B \u0000 ln\u0000A, B; X , Y \u0000 . [Definition of hyperbolic distance] A hyperbolic line, i.e. the shortest path between two points A and B, is the arc A B of the circle A B B' A'. Hence, the triangle inequality applies: for three points A, B, C, A B \u0000 B C \u0000 A C, with equality if and only if they are collinear and in the correct order. As angles are preserved under Möbius transformations, the angles in the Poincaré disc model are the same as those in the hyperbolic plane. \u0000 The hyperbolic angle between two hyperbolic lines is identical to the ordinary angle between the corresponding circular arcs on the Poincaré disc model. [Definition of hyperbolic angle] With these principles, it is possible to explore the rich world of Bolyai-Lobachevskian geometry. Four of Euclid’s postulates (basic assumptions from which all of geometry can be derived) hold in hyperbolic geometry, whereas the fifth postulate does not. The fifth postulate is equivalent to the interior angles of a triangle summing to \u0000. Steiner’s porism and Soddy’s hexlet We have already encountered Poncelet’s porism, which states that if there is one n-gon inscribed in one ellipse and circumscribed about another, then there are infinitely many. Another example of a porism (a term which people struggle to define) is Steiner’s porism, again named after Jakob Steiner. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 26. Let *1 and *2 be two circles, such that *1 is contained within *2. A set of n \u0000 3 circles \u0000C1, C2, …, Cn\u0000 is known as a Steiner chain of length n if each Ci is tangent externally to Ci\u00001, Ci\u00001 (where subscripts are considered modulo n) and *1, and is tangent internally to *2. Show that if there exists one Steiner chain of length n for two given circles, then there exist infinitely many. [Steiner’s porism] There is an analogous three-dimensional porism, which is less general but more interesting, called Soddy’s hexlet. This also appeared as a Japanese Sangaku problem. 27. Let *1, *2 and *3 be three mutually tangent spheres. A set of n \u0000 3 spheres \u0000S1, S2, …, Sn\u0000 is known as a Soddy chain of length n if each Si is tangent externally to Si\u00001, Si\u00001 (where subscripts are considered modulo n), *1, *2 and *3. Show that infinitely many Soddy chains exist of length 6, and no Soddy chains exist for n ! 6. [Soddy’s hexlet] The six green spheres \u0000S1, …, S6\u0000 are tangent to a quartic doughnut-shaped surface known as a Dupin cyclide, which is an inverted torus. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. Assume, without loss of generality, that O is the origin of the complex plane. Then, we have 0 \u0000 1 0\u0000 \u0000 1 0 \u0000 \u0000. 2. We can compute the linear cross-ratio A P P B \u0000 B P' P' A \u0000 \u0000R\u0000p\u0000 \u0000 R 2 p \u0000R\u0000 \u0000R\u0000p\u0000 \u0000\u0000 R 2 p \u0000R\u0000 \u0000 R 3 p \u0000R p \u0000 R 3 p \u0000R p \u0000 \u00001. 3. This is a trivial corollary of the intersecting chords theorem. 4. P ' Q ' O is similar to Q P O, so we have P' Q' P' O \u0000 P Q Q O . By using the identity P O \u0000 P' O \u0000 R 2, we obtain the desired formula. 5. Let the length of the diagonals be denoted by x. By Ptolemy’s theorem on B C D E, we have 1 \u0000 x \u0000 x2, so x \u0000 \u0000. Note that D' and C are inverse points with respect to the unit circle centred on A. Hence, we obtain B D ' \u0000 B C A B\u0000A C \u0000 1 \u0000 ; B C ' \u0000 B D A B\u0000A D \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1; D' C ' \u0000 C D A C\u0000A D \u0000 1 \u00002 . 6. Möbius transformations are projective transformations of the complex projective line, thus the composition is simply the product of their matrices. 7. Translations composed with rotations and dilations are Möbius transformations, as they have the form z \u0000 a z \u0000 b. Hence, we need only consider the case where the inversion is in the unit circle, and thus has the form z \u0000 1 z\u0000 . Composing this with the general form of an indirect similarity, z \u0000 a z\u0000 \u0000 b, results in the transformation z \u0000 a z \u0000 b, which is clearly a Möbius transformation. 8. Möbius transformations can be regarded as a projective transformations of the complex projective line, so must necessarily preserve complex cross-ratio. 9. The condition for four points to be concyclic or collinear is that the complex cross-ratio, \u0000a\u0000b\u0000 \u0000c\u0000d\u0000 \u0000b\u0000c\u0000 \u0000d\u0000a\u0000 , is real. As it is preserved under Möbius transformations, so must the property that four points are concyclic or collinear. Obviously, a reflection also preserves this property, so inversions (compositions of reflections and Möbius transformations) must also do so. 10. Inverting about P1 reduces the problem to the pivot theorem. 11. By Thales’ theorem, A B is a diameter of the circumcircle, so is orthogonal to it. Invert about C. A ' B' and N ' \u0000' are diameters of the same circle (the inverse of line A B), so A' N ' B' \u0000' forms a rectangle. The inverse of * is tangent to the diagonals and circumcircle of the rectangle A ' N ' B' \u0000 ', so lies on one of the lines of symmetry of the rectangle. The point D ' must thus be the midpoint of the minor arc B' N ', as D lies between B and N in the original diagram. As arcs B' C ' and C ' N ' are congruent, they must subtend equal angles at \u0000 '. As angles are preserved under inversion, we are finished. 12. Let Q R intersect A B and C D at E and F, respectively. From applying a projective transformation to convert A B C D into a square, we can deduce that \u0000P, E; A, B\u0000 and \u0000P, F; C, D\u0000 are harmonic ranges. This is sufficient for Q R to be the polar of P. Hence, O P is perpendicular to Q R. By symmetry, O must be the orthocentre of P Q R. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 13. O is the centre of the circle of inversion, so is exchanged with the point at infinity. X is the intersection of O P with the polar of P, so they must be inverse points. By symmetry, we obtain the other two pairs of inverse points. 14. Inverting about the circle A B C D maps O and X to \u0000 and P, respectively. A B P is a straight line and thus passes through \u0000, so the original four points were concyclic. 15. Note that lines B C, O Y and X R concur at Q. Applying the converse of the radical axis theorem to circles O Y B C and R O X Y , we obtain the concyclicity of X R B C. 16. It obviously does not depend on \u0000, as we can view P as a projector, and moving \u0000 is simply applying one- dimensional projective transformations to the line A ' B' C ' D '. Hence, the cross-ratio is dependent only upon the angles A P B, B P C and C P D. Due to basic circle theorems, these are invariant as P moves on the circumcircle of A B C D. 17. Inversion about P and considering similar triangles derives the first of these results. To show that the collinearity of E, B and D implies that the quadrilateral is harmonic, use the intersecting chords theorem to show that A E D is similar to B E A, and that D E C is similar to C E B. We then have D A \u0000 A B \u0000 D E \u0000 A E \u0000 D E \u0000 C E \u0000 C D \u0000 B C, thus the products of opposite sides are equal. The converse follows trivially. Showing that P is in harmonic range with E, B and D stems from the fact that P lies on A C, which is the polar of E. To demonstrate that K lies on B D, it is sufficient to show that P is the foot of the symmedian from B to A C. This is equivalent to the statement that A P \u0000 A B2 \u0000 C P \u0000 C B2. To prove this, we can exploit similar triangles to show that A P \u0000 A B \u0000 D P\u0000 C D \u0000 \u0000P A\u0000 P C \u0000 A B\u0000\u0000 \u0000B C \u0000 D A \u0000 A B\u0000, whence it follows that A P \u0000 \u0000A B2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000P A \u0000 P C\u0000\u0000 \u0000P B\u0000 B C \u0000 D A\u0000 \u0000 \u0000P A\u0000 P C\u0000\u0000 \u0000P B\u0000 B A\u0000 D C\u0000 \u0000 C P\u0000 \u0000C B2\u0000. This shows that P has the required areal coordinates to be the foot of the symmedian. 18. Consider when the complex cross-ratio \u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000c \u0000 d\u0000\u0000 \u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000d \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000 \u00001. From here, we use polar coordinates, resulting in arg\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000\u0000 arg\u0000c \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 arg\u0000a \u0000 d\u0000 \u0000 arg\u0000c \u0000 d\u0000 and a \u0000 b c \u0000 d \u0000 b \u0000 c d \u0000 a . These are equivalent to 2 A B C \u0000 2 A D C and A B \u0000 C D \u0000 B C \u0000 D A, respectively. Clearly, the first of these is the ‘angles in the same segment’ criterion for concyclicity, and the latter is condition for a cyclic quadrilateral to be harmonic. 19. A composition of an inversion and a reflection is a Möbius transformation, i.e. a map of the form z \u0000 \u0000a z \u0000 b\u0000\u0000 \u0000c z \u0000 d\u0000. This can be regarded as a projective transformation of the complex projective line, so must necessarily preserve complex cross-ratio. 20. For two \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-planes, the intersection is either empty (if they are parallel) or the \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-plane formed by solving their algebraic equations simultaneously. For two \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres, consider all 2-planes passing through both centres. If the circles are disjoint, so are the original spheres. If the circles are tangent, the original spheres share a single point. If the circles intersect in two points, then let the radical axis meet the line of centres at P. Clearly, all intersection points of the original two spheres must lie on the \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane through P perpendicular to the line of centres, and must all be equidistant from P. For the case of one \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere and one \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-plane, we can reflect the sphere in the plane and reduce it to the previous case. 21. Consider the plane containing l1 and l2, and apply the two-dimensional intersecting chords theorem to this configuration. 22. The power of a point is equal to O P 2 \u0000 R 2. When the spheres are of equal radii, the equation for the radical plane becomes O P12 \u0000 O P22, which is the locus of all points equidistant from the centres of the two spheres. This must be the plane of reflective symmetry of the configuration. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 23. Draw the line l through O orthogonal to the generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere, intersecting it at A and B (one of which may be at infinity if the generalised sphere is a plane). Let the inverse points be A ' and B', which also lie on l. Every plane containing l must intersect the generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere in a generalised circle of diameter A B; this inverts to a generalised circle of diameter A ' B' using ordinary two-dimensional inversion. The union of all such generalised circles is the generalised \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-sphere of diameter A' B'. 24. Consider the generalised \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-sphere to be the intersection of two \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-spheres. The result follows from the fact that the intersection is either empty (impossible), a single point (impossible) or a generalised \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000-sphere. 25. We can reduce this to the 3-dimensional problem, as we need only consider the 3-plane containing the tangents to the two curves, l1 and l2, and the centre of inversion, O. Assume they intersect at P with an angle %. After inversion, the plane l1 l2 becomes a generalised 2-sphere, and generalised circles l1 and l2 intersect at P ' with an angle (. If the generalised 2-sphere is a sphere, we invert about the point diametrically opposite to P', preserving P' whilst mapping l1 and l2 back to lines. Clearly, the lines now intersect at an angle \u0000(. This orientation-preserving generalised-circle-preserving map from the Riemann sphere to itself must necessarily be a Möbius transformation, and thus preserve angles. Hence, % \u0000 \u0000(, and we are done. 26. Let the line of centres l intersect *1 at B and C, and *2 at A and D, such that A B C D are in that order along l. Note that the two circles intersect l orthogonally. Let A ' B' and C ' D ' be two unit lengths on the same line l ', and separate them such that \u0000A', D '; B ', C '\u0000 \u0000 \u0000A, D; B, C\u0000. Apply a Möbius transformation to map A to A ', B to B' and C to C '. As the cross-ratios are equal, D must necessarily map to D '. The two circles are now both orthogonal to l ', so the centres both lie on this line. As A' D ' and B ' C ' share a midpoint, the centres must coincide and the circles are concentric. We can now ‘rotate’ the Steiner chain within the annulus by an arbitrary angle, similar to a ball bearing. Applying the inverse Möbius transformation will restore *1 and *2. 27. Invert about the tangency point of *1 and *2, resulting in two parallel planes sandwiching the sphere *3. All spheres tangent to *1 and *2 must have diameter equal to the separation of the planes. Hence, their centres must be coplanar with *3 and have equal radius. Hence, we can consider this to be a two-dimensional problem of packing a closed loop of n circles of unit radius around a circle of unit radius. As the centres of *3, Si and Si\u00001 must form an equilateral triangle, this forces the angles to be \u0000 3 and thus there must be a regular hexagon of six spheres. There are infinitely many orientations in which this can be done. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
