For instance, the sequence HHT HT T T has 4 runs: HH, T, H, T T T respectively. If Ross tells you that he has got 5 heads out of 12 tosses, ﬁnd the probability that there are (a) 6 (b) 7 runs in his outcome. Will you change your answer if I tell you that Ross’s coin is not unbiased? 2. A student is writing a computer program that ﬁnds a root of the equation f (x)= 0 using the recursion x n+1 = x n \u0000 f (x n ),n \u0000 0. Suppose that f (x)= x(x \u0000 1/2)(x \u0000 1) and he starts with some 0 <x 0 < 1. Will this sequence converge? If yes, ﬁnd how the limit depends on x 0 . What will happen if he mistakenly wrote x n+1 = x n + f (x n ) in the program? 3. Let f :[0, 1] ! (0, 1) be a function satisfying Z 1 0 f (x)dx =1. Show that the inte- gral Z 1 0 (x \u0000 a) 2 f (x)dx is minimized when a = Z 1 0 xf (x)dx. Hence or otherwise show that Z 1 0 |x \u0000 µ|f (x)dx  1 2, where µ = Z 1 0 xf (x)dx. 4. A point in the xy-plane is called rational if both the x and y coordinates are ratio- nal numbers. Prove that if the centre of a given circle in the plane is not rational, then there are at most two rational points on the circle. 5. If f :[0, 1] ! [0, 1] is a continuous function, show that the equation 2x \u0000 Z x 0 f (t)dt =1 has exactly one root in [0, 1]. 6. We have two loaded dice, with 1, 2,. .., 6 coming up with various (possibly dif- ferent) probabilities on each. Is it possible that when we roll them both, each of the sums 2, 3,. .., 12 comes up with the same probability?","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
