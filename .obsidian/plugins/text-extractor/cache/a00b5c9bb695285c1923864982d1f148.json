Show that limn→∞ √xn = √ x. 2. Suppose that xn converges to x. Show that sin xn converges to sin x and cos xn converges to cos x. Is it necessary that tan xn converges to tan x? Solution: 1. Since xn ≥ 0 for all n ≥ 1, so we must have x ≥ 0. If x = 0, the result is easy to show (xn < ε 2 =⇒ √xn < ε). Next, assume that x > 0. Fix any ε > 0. Observe that, | √ xn − √x| = |xn − x| √xn + √x ≤ |xn − x| √ x . (∗) Since xn → x, we have an N ∈ N such that |xn − x| < ε √x holds for all n ≥ N . Hence, (∗) implies that | √xn − √x| < ε holds for every n ≥ N. □ 2. We shall use the fact that | sin t| ≤ |t| which holds for all t ∈ R. (It can be proved using a diagram of a unit circle.) Using this, we obtain | sin xn − sin x| = \f \f \f \f2 sin xn − x 2 cos xn + x 2 \f \f \f \f ≤ \f \f \f \f2 sin xn − x 2 \f \f \f \f ≤ |xn − x|. Since |xn − x| < ε holds for all but ﬁnitely many n, we get the same for | sin xn − sin x|. Hence we conclude that sin xn converges to sin x. For cos, we can do as follows: since yn = π 2 − xn converges to y = π 2 − x, we can say that sin yn converges to sin y. This is same as saying that cos xn converges to cos x. Next, for tan, observe that if x ̸= (2k+1) π 2 for k ∈ Z then we get tan xn = sin xn cos xn → sin x cos x = tan x as n → ∞. But if x = (2k + 1) π 2 for some k ∈ Z then it might happen that tan xn does not converge at all. Here is a counter-example: xn = π 2 − 1 n if n is odd and π 2 + 1 n if n is even. Convince yourself that although xn converges to π 2 , tan xn does not converge at all. Suppose xn is a sequence that converges to x (in symbols, xn → x). We have seen earlier that axn + b → ax + b, |xn| → |x|, xk n → xk (k ∈ N), sin xn → sin x, cos xn → cos x, √xn → √x (provided xn ≥ 0), tan xn → tan x (provided cos x ̸= 0). You can also show 1 that for any polynomial P (·), we have P (xn) → P (x). This idea generalizes to the notion of continuity: Deﬁnition. We say that f (x) is continuous at x = a if for every sequence xn (belonging to the domain of f ) that converges to a, it holds that f (xn) converges to f (a). As per our discussion above, it follows that ax + b, |x|, x k (k ∈ N), sin x, cos x are con- tinuous at every a ∈ R, √x is continuous at every a ≥ 0 and tan x is continuous at every a /∈ {(2k + 1) π 2 : k ∈ Z}. Next, we shall see a few properties of continuous functions. Theorem. Suppose that f (x) and g(x) are continuous at x = a. Then, the following functions are also continuous at x = a: f (x) + g(x), f (x) − g(x), cf (x) (where c is a constant), f (x)g(x), |f (x)|, max{f (x), g(x)}, min{f (x), g(x)}. Proof. Take any sequence xn that converges to a. Since f, g are continuous at x = a, we have lim n→∞ f (xn) = f (a), lim n→∞ g(xn) = g(a). Hence we get lim n→∞ f (xn) + g(xn) = f (a) + g(a). This shows that f +g is continuous at x = a. In a similar manner we can show that f −g, cf, f g, |f | are continuous at x = a. Next, let us consider h(x) = max{f (x), g(x)}. Observe that for any y, z ∈ R, we have max{y, z} = y + z + |y − z| 2 . Hence, h(x) = 1 2 (f (x) + g(x) + |f (x) − g(x)| ). Complete the proof yourself. Do the same for min{f (x), g(x)}. □ Note that the last theorem allows us to construct a large class of continuous functions from the elementary ones, e.g. any polynomial, | sin x|, √ 1 − x2, x + cos x x2 + 1 , etc. Next, we shall see another deﬁnition of continuity. Suppose f (x) is continuous at x = a. When we draw the graph of f (x), what do you expect (for the function to be continuous at x = a)? It is expected that as x gets closer and closer to a, f (x) gets closer and closer to f (a). This intuition is formalised in the following deﬁnition: Deﬁnition. We say that f (x) is continuous at x = a if, for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for all x ∈ (a − δ, a + δ) it holds that f (x) ∈ (f (a) − ε, f (a) + ε). In words, it says that f (x) will be suﬃciently close to f (a) if we take x to be suﬃciently close to a. To have f (x) to be at a distance less than ε from f (a), we need x to be at a distance less than δ from a. The deﬁnition says that for every ε > 0, there exists such a δ > 0. 2 One important point to note here is the order of the quantiﬁers ‘for all’ and ‘there exists’. Why does their ordering matter? You should get an answer by observing the following statements: (i) ∀ city C in India, ∃ a 6-digit number n such that n is the pincode of city C. (ii) ∃ a 6-digit number n such that ∀ city C in India, n is the pincode of city C. Can you give a real-life example of continuous function? There are plently of examples, e.g. your age as a function of time, your height as a function of your age (not rounded oﬀ to ‘years’), speed of a car. Can you give a real-life example of a function which is not continuous? One example is the fare of any public transport (bus, metro) as a function of the distance from the place you boarded. (From one stoppage to another it jumps in discrete steps, it does not change continuously.) One question that might come to your mind: how can we have two seemingly diﬀerent deﬁnitions for the same thing (continuity)? We shall address this question shortly; before that let us do a few problems using each of the two approaches: sequential deﬁnition and ε − δ deﬁnition. Problem. Suppose f : R → R is a function that satisﬁes |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ λ|x − y| for all x, y ∈ R. (Here λ > 0 is ﬁxed.) Show that f (x) is continuous (at x = a for every a ∈ R). Proof. Fix any a ∈ R, we shall show that f (x) is continuous at x = a. (i) Using sequential deﬁnition: Take any sequence xn that converges to a. For every ε > 0, there exists N ∈ N such that |xn − a| < ε/λ holds for all n ≥ N. Then for every n ≥ N, we get |f (xn) − f (a)| ≤ λ|xn − x| < ε. □ (ii) Using ε − δ deﬁnition: Fix any ε > 0. We choose δ = ε/λ. Then observe that for every x such that |x−a| < δ, we get |f (x)−f (a)| ≤ λ|x−a| < λδ = ε. (Note, the choice of δ comes from a rough-work, which is just the above chain of inequalities. We had |f (x) − f (a)| < λδ, so we just set that to be equal to ε.) □ Problem. Suppose that f : A → B and g : B → C (so that (g ◦ f )(x) = g(f (x)) is well-deﬁned). If f (x) is continuous at x = a and g(y) is continuous at y = f (a), show that h(x) = g(f (x)) must be continuous at x = a. Proof. (i) Using sequential deﬁnition: Take any sequence xn that converges to a. Since f (x) is continuous at x = a, we deduce that f (xn) converges to f (a). Now, since yn = f (xn) is a sequence that converges to f (a), the continuity of g(y) at y = f (a) yields that g(yn) must 3 converge to g(f (a)). This is same as saying that g(f (xn)) = h(xn) converges to g(f (a)) = h(a). Since this holds for every sequence xn that converges to a, we conclude that h(x) is continuous at x = a. □ (ii) Using ε − δ deﬁnition: Fix any ε > 0. Since g(y) is continuous at y = f (a), there exists a δ > 0 such that for every y ∈ (f (a) − δ, f (a) + δ) we have |g(y) − g(f (a))| < ε, i.e., |y − f (a)| < δ =⇒ |g(y) − g(f (a))| < ε. (⋆) Again, since f (x) is continuous at x = a, we have a δ′ > 0 such that for every x ∈ (a−δ′, a+δ′) we have |f (x) − f (a)| < δ. Combining this with (⋆) we obtain |x − a| < δ′ =⇒ |f (x) − f (a)| < δ =⇒ |g(f (x)) − g(f (a))| < ε. (We used (⋆) for y = f (x).) Thus, we have shown that for every ε > 0 there exists δ′ > 0 such that |g(f (x)) − g(f (a))| < ε holds whenever |x − a| < δ′. □ Problem. Consider the function f (x) = ⌊x⌋ = largest integer less than or equal to x. Show that f (x) is continuous at x = a if and only if a is not an integer. Proof. The case when a /∈ Z, is left as an exercise for the reader. (Hint: show that for any a /∈ Z there exists a δ > 0 such that f is constant in (a − δ, a + δ).) Here we shall address the case when a ∈ Z. We need to show that f (x) is not continuous at x = a. (i) Using sequential deﬁnition: Negation of the sequential deﬁnition is easy: we need to provide a sequence xn such that xn converges to a but f (xn) does not converge to f (a). Here is one such sequence: xn = a − 1 n. Note that f (xn) = a − 1 for all n ≥ 1, but f (a) = a. □ (ii) Using ε − δ deﬁnition: Writing the negation of the ε − δ deﬁnition might be a hurdle for the reader. Let us do it slowly. First we write the deﬁnition for f (x) to be continuous at x = a: ∀ε > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that ∀x ∈ (a − δ, a + δ), it holds that |f (x) − f (a)| < ε. To negate this deﬁnition, start from the left and change each ∀ to ∃ and vice-versa. The correct negation of the above will be: f (x) is not continuous at x = a if ∃ε > 0 such that ∀δ > 0, ∃x ∈ (a − δ, a + δ) for which |f (x) − f (a)| ≥ ε. We set this ‘bad’ ε to be 1 2. Then, for every δ > 0, we have x = a − δ 2 ∈ (a − δ, a + δ) for which |f (x) − f (a)| = |(a − 1) − a| = 1 ≥ ε. □ It is now the perfect time to address the equivalence of the two deﬁnitions of continuity. 4 Problem. Consider the following properties: (1) For every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that |f (x)−f (a)| < ε holds whenever |x−a| < δ. (2) For every sequence xn that converges to a it holds that f (xn) converges to f (a). Show that a function f has property (1) if and only if it has property (2). Proof. First we shall show that (1) ⇒ (2). Suppose a function has property (1). Take any sequence that converges to a. We need to show that f (xn) converges to f (a). Fix any ε > 0. By property (1), there exists δ > 0 such that |f (x) − f (a)| < ε holds whenever |x − a| < δ. Since xn → a, there exists N ∈ N such that |xn − a| < δ holds for every n ≥ N. Then, for every n ≥ N we obtain |f (xn) − f (a)| < ε. This completes the proof. Next we show that (2) ⇒ (1). Suppose a function has property (2). It is actually hard to give a δ > 0 for any ﬁxed ε > 0 where δ has the desired property. So we shall use the method of contradiction. Let, if possible, f be a function with property (2), which does not satisfy (1). The negation of (1) reads: there exists an ε > 0 such that for every δ > 0, there exists an x ∈ (a − δ, a + δ) for which |f (x) − f (a)| ≥ ε. So, for each n ∈ N, we set δ = 1 n to get a ‘bad’ x in (a − 1 n, a + 1 n ), which we call xn. Therefore, xn is a sequence such that xn ∈ (a − 1 n , a + 1 n) and |f (xn) − f (a)| ≥ ε for every n ∈ N. Since a − 1 n < xn < a + 1 n, Sandwich tells us that xn converges to a. But f (xn) being at least ε away from f (a), we see that f (xn) can not converge to f (a). This contradicts the fact that f has property (2) and hence completes the proof. □ Exercises 1. Suppose that f (x) is continuous at x = a. Determine, with proof, a necessary and suﬃcient condition for 1/f (x) to be continuous at x = a. 2. Suppose that f (x) and g(x) are not continuous at x = a. Is it possible that f (x) + g(x) is continuous at x = a? 3. Suppose that f (x) is continuous at x = a, but g(x) is not continuous at x = a. Is it possible that f (x) + g(x) is continuous at x = a? 4.

(b) f (x) is continuous at x = a but g(y) is discontinuous at y = f (a). (c) f (x) is discontinuous at x = a and g(y) is discontinuous at y = f (a). 7. Deﬁne f (x) = sin 1 x if x ̸= 0 and f (0) = 0. Discuss the continuity of f (x). Note: For this problem, sequential approach is more useful than the ε − δ approach. 8. Deﬁne f (x) = x sin 1 x if x ̸= 0 and f (0) = 0. Discuss the continuity of f (x). Note: For this problem, the ε − δ approach is more useful than the sequential approach. 9. Let A = [1, 2) ∪ (2, 3]. Deﬁne a function f : A → R as follows: f (x) = x + 1 if x ∈ [1, 2) and 3 − x if x ∈ (2, 3]. Can you draw the graph of f (x) without lifting the pen? Is the function discontinuous at x = 2? 10. Let A = [1, 2] ∪ (3, 4]. Deﬁne a function f : A → R as follows: f (x) = x + 1 if x ∈ [1, 2] and 3 − x if x ∈ (3, 4]. Can you draw the graph of f (x) without lifting the pen? Determine whether the function is continuous on A or not. 11. Suppose f : R → R satisﬁes f (x + y) = f (x)f (y) for all x, y ∈ R. If f (x) is continuous at x = 0, then show that f (x) is continuous at x = a for every a ∈ R. (Hint: First show that f (0) = 0 or 1. What happens if f (0) = 0? If f (0) ̸= 0, then show that f (x) ̸= 0 for every x ∈ R.) Hints/Answers 1. If f is continuous at x = a and f (a) ̸= 0 then we can show that 1/f is also continuous at x = a. (Note that it is also a necessary condition.) To prove this, you can use the sequential deﬁnition. 2. Yes. Take f (x) = [x] and g(x) = −[x]. Both f and g are discontinuous at any a ∈ Z, but f + g is continuous everywhere. 3. No. Because if h = f + g and f are both continuous at x = a then their diﬀerence h − f must also be continuous at x = a. 4. Yes. Take a = 0 and deﬁne f (x) =    0 if x ̸= 0 1 if x = 0 and g(x) =    1 if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 . 5. Yes. Take a = 0 and deﬁne f (x) = 0 for all x, and g(x) =    1 if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 . 6 6. (a) Yes. Take any function f which is discontinuous at x = a and set g ≡ 0 (i.e. g(x) = 0 for all x). (b) Yes. Take g(x) =    1 if x is rational 0 if x is irrational and f (x) = √ 2 for all x. You can show that g is not continuous anywhere. But, g(f (x)) = 0 for all x, hence g ◦ f is continuous everywhere. (c) Yes. Set a = 0. Take f (x) = g(x) = 1/x for x ̸= 0 and deﬁne f (0) = g(0) = 0. Observe that g(f (x)) = x for all x. 7. When a ̸= 0, its easy to see that f (x) is continuous x = a. We claim that f is discon- tinuous at x = 0. To prove our claim, it suﬃcies to give two sequences xn and yn such that both of them converge to 0, but f (xn) and f (yn) do not converge to the same limit. One possible example is the followng: Take xn = 1 2nπ + π/2 and yn = 1 2nπ − π/2, for all n ≥ 1. 8. When a ̸= 0, its easy to see that f (x) is continuous x = a. We claim that f is continuous at x = 0 as well. Observe that for every x, we have |f (x)−f (0)| = | sin x| ≤ |x| = |x−0|. So, we can take δ = ε to meet the requirement in the ε − δ deﬁnition. 9. It should be clear that f is continuous at x = a for every a ∈ [1, 2) ∪ (2, 3]. Only what can confuse you is the question of continuity at x = 2. However, since f is not deﬁned at x = 2, this question does not arise, because f (2) is not deﬁned!. (This is somewhat controversial. For f to be continuous at x = a, it is universally accepted that x must belong to the domain of f. But for discontinuity, some authors (e.g. Rudin) deﬁne f to be discontinuous at x = a only when a belongs to the domain and f is not continuous at a. I also prefer this deﬁnition and hence say that f is neither continuous nor discontinuous at x = 2.) Note, though the function f is continuous on its entire domain, one cannot draw the graph without lifting the pen. (Who told you that the graph of a continuous function must be drawn without lifting the pen!). 10. The function is continuous on its domain A. As pointed out above, the question of f being continuous at x = a does not arise if a /∈ A. 11. Carry out the steps given in the hint.
