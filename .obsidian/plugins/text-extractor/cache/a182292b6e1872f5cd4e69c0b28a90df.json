Find all functions f : R → R such that for all real numbers x and y, f (xf (y) + x) = xy + f (x). A2. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers. Prove that x x + √(x + y)(x + z) + y y + √(y + z)(y + x) + z z + √(z + x)(z + y) ≤ 1. A3. Let p(x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Does there always exist a positive integer k such that p(x) − k is irreducible? (An integer polynomial is irreducible if it cannot be written as a product of two nonconstant integer polynomials.) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . C1. Let X be a ﬁnite set of positive integers and A a subset of X. Prove that there exists a subset B of X such that A equals the set of elements of X which divide an odd number of elements of B. C2. Let B be a set of more than 2n+1/n distinct points with coordinates of the form (±1, ±1, . . . , ±1) in n-dimensional space with n ≥ 3. Show that there are three distinct points in B which are the vertices of an equilateral triangle. C3. Let S be a set of n points on a plane, no three collinear. A subset of these points is called polite if they are the vertices of a convex polygon with no points of S in the interior. Let ck denote the number of polite sets with k points. Show that the sum n∑ i=3(−1)ici depends only on n and not on the conﬁguration of the points. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
