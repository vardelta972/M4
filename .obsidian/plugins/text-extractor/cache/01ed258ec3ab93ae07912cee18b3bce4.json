Find all polynomials p(x) with real coeﬃcients such that p(a + b − 2c) + p(b + c − 2a) + p(c + a − 2b) = 3p(a − b) + 3p(b − c) + 3p(c − a) for all a, b, c ∈ R. 2. Determine if there exist non-zero real numbers a1, a2, . . . , a10 such that ( a1 + 1 a1 ) · . . . · (a10 + 1 a10 ) = (a1 − 1 a1 ) · . . . · ( a10 − 1 a10 ) . 3. Find all functions f : R → R which satisfy f (x) = max y∈R (2xy − f (y)) for all x ∈ R. Note: In general the expression a = max a∈S g(s) means that a ≥ g(s) for all s ∈ S and furthermore there exists s ∈ S such that a = g(s). 4. Given positive real numbers x, y, z, which satisfy x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xyz = 1, show that 2(x + y + z) ≤ 3. 5. Let f : N → N be a strictly increasing function such that f (f (n)) = 3n, for all n ∈ N. Find f(2011). 6. Find all monic polynomials, P , with real coeﬃcients satisfying the following conditions: (a) P (x + P (x)) = x2 + P (P (x)) for all real x and (b) |P (0)| > 1. 7. Determine all ﬁnite sets A of non-negative real numbers, containing at least four distinct elements, and such that for all distinct a, b, c, d ∈ A, ab + cd ∈ A. 8. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be real numbers with n ≥ 3, satisfying a1 + a2 + . . . + an = 0, and 2ak ≤ ak−1 + ak+1 for k = 2, 3, . . . , n − 1. Determine the smallest possible λ(n) such that for any such sequence and k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, it holds that |ak| ≤ λ(n) · max{|a1|, |an|}. 1 February 12, 2011 www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
