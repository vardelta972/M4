Stronger mixing variables - S.M.V theorem The following result only uses elementary mathematics. Understanding the theorem’s usage and its meaning is more important to you than remembering its detailed proof. Lemma. (General mixing variables lemma). Suppose that (a1, a2, ..., an) is an arbitrary real sequence. Carry out the following transformation consecutively 1. Choosing i, j ∈ {1, 2, ..., n} to be two indices satisfying ai = min(a1, a2, ..., an) , aj = max(a1, a2, ..., an). 2. Replacing ai and aj by ai + aj 2 (but their orders don’t change). After doing inﬁnitely many of the above transformations, each number ai comes to the same limit a = a1 + a2 + ... + an n . Proof. Henceforward, the above transformation is called the ∆ transformation. De- note the ﬁrst sequence as (a 1 1, a1 2, ..., a 1 n). After one transformation, we have a new se- quence, denoted as (a 2 1, a2 2, .., a 2 n). Similarly, from the sequence (a k 1, ak 2, ..., a k n) we have a new one denoted as (a k+1 1 , ak+1 2 , ..., a k+1 n ). Thus, for every integer i = 1, 2, ..., n, we need to prove lim k→∞ a k i = a, a = a1 + a2 + ... + an n . Let mk = min(a k 1, ak 2, ..., a k n) and Mk = max(a k 1, ak 2, ..., a k n). Clearly, the transformations ∆ don’t make the value of Mk increase or the value of mk decrease. Because both mk and Mk are bound, there exist m = lim k→∞ mk , M = lim k→∞ Mk. We must prove that m = M . By contradiction, suppose that M > m. Denote dk = Mk − mk. We make a simple observation Lemma. Suppose that after carrying out some transformations ∆, the sequence (a 1 1, a1 2, ..., a 1 n) turns into the new one (a k 1, ak 2, ..., a k n) satisfying that mk = M1 + m1 2 , then we will have m2 = M1 + m1 2 . Indeed, without loss of generality may assume that M1 = a 1 1 ≥ a 1 2 ≥ ... ≥ a 1 n = m1. Mathematical Reflections 6 (2006) 1 To be more brief, replace ai by a 1 i . If mk = a1 + an 2 and k is the smallest index satisfying that equality then a 2 i ≥ mk ∀i ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}. It follows from {mk} is a non-decreasing sequences. Note that a1 + an 2 is a term of the sequence (a 2 1, a2 2, .., a2 n), so we have done. By the above property, we have a more important result. Denote S = {k : ∃l > k|mk + Mk = 2ml} ⇒ S = {k|mk + Mk = 2mk+1}, P = {k : ∃l > k|mk + Mk = 2Ml} ⇒ P = {k|mk + Mk = 2Mk+1}. If S or P has an inﬁnite number of elements, assume |S| = ∞ then, for each k ∈ S dk+1 = Mk+1 − mk+1 = Mk+1 − mk + Mk 2 ≤ Mk − mk 2 = dk 2 , because (dr) +∞ r=1 is a decreasing sequence. Thus, if |S| = ∞ then lim r→∞ dr = 0 and hence M = m, the conclusion follows. Otherwise, we must have |S|, |P | < +∞. Hence, we can suppose that |S| = |P | = 0 without aﬀecting the result of the problem. Then, for every k > 1 the number a1 + an 2 can’t be the smallest or greatest number in the sequence (a k 1, ak 2, ..., a k n). So we can consider the conﬁned problem with n − 1 numbers when we rejected exactly one number (a1 + an)/2. By a simple induction method, we have the desired result. q From the above lemma, we have the direct result Theorem 1 (Stronger mixing variables - S.M.V. theorem). If f : Rn → R is a continuous, symmetric, under-limitary function satisfying f (a1, a2, ..., an) ≥ f (b1, b2, ..., bn), in which (b1, b2, ..., bn) is a sequence obtained from the sequence (a1, a2, ..., an) by the transformation ∆, then we always have f (a1, a2, ..., an) ≥ f (a, a, ..., a) with a = a1 + a2 + ... + an n . By this theorem, when using the mixing variables method, we only need to choose the smallest and greatest numbers to perform. By using elementary knowledge, the old mixing variables theorem is proved and improved to have a stronger result. So it can be applied freely. Moreover, the transformation ∆ can be diﬀerent. For example, we can change it to √ab, √ a 2 + b2 2 or any arbitrary average form. Depending on the supposition of problem, we can choose a suitable way of mixing variables. 2 2. S.M.V. theorem and some applications If have never tried proving a diﬃcult inequality which involves more than three vari- ables, it’s not easy to understand the importance and signiﬁcance of S.M.V. theorem. The most useful application of S.M.V. theorem is for four-variable inequalities. Most of the four-variable inequalities are solved more easily by this theorem. For example, with a familiar problem in IMO shortlist, and the solution is very brief Problem 1. Suppose that a, b, c, d are non-negative real numbers whose sum is 1. Prove the inequality abc + bcd + cda + dab ≤ 1 27 + 176 27 abcd. (Nguyen Minh Duc, IMO Shortlist 1997) Solution. Now, we’ll consider the most important content of this writing, this is the stronger mixing variables method, or S.M.V. theorem. Without loss of generality, assume that a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ d. Denote f (a, b, c, d) = abc + bcd + cda + dab − 176 27 abcd f (a, b, c, d) = ac(b + d) + bd (a + c − 176 27 ac ) . From the supposition, we refer that a + c ≤ 1 2 (a + b + c + d) = 1 2 , hence 1 a + 1 c ≥ 4 a + c ≥ 8 ≥ 176 27 ⇒ f (a, b, c, d) ≤ f (a, b + d 2 , c, b + d 2 ) . Considering the transformation ∆ for (b, c, d) and as the proved result, we obtain f (a, b, c, d) ≤ f (a, t, t, t) , t = b + c + d 3 . Now, the problems becomes, if a + 3t = 1 then 3at 2 + t3 ≤ 1 27 + 176 27 at 3. But it’s quite simple. Replacing a by 1 − 3t, we have an obviously true inequality (1 − 3t)(4t − 1) 2(11t + 1) ≥ 0. and the conclusion follows immediately. The equality occurs if a = b = c = d = 1 4 or a = b = c = 1 3 , d = 0 up to permutation. q Return to the introduced inequality T urkevici. To my knowledge, all the ways of proving this inequality are complicated or too long. By using S.M.V. theorem in the same manner as in example 3.1.14, it turns out to be very easy. Mathematical Reflections 6 (2006) 3 Problem 2. Prove the below inequality for all positive real numbers a, b, c, d a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 + 2abcd ≥ a 2b2 + b2c 2 + c 2d2 + d2a 2 + a 2c 2 + b2d2. (Turkevici’s Inequality) Solution. Assume a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d. Denote f (a, b, c, d) = a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 + 2abcd − a 2b2 − b2c 2 − c 2d2 − d2a 2 − a 2c 2 − b2d2 = a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 + 2abcd − a 2c 2 − b2d2 − (a 2 + c 2)(b2 + d2). Hence f (a, b, c, d) − f ( √ac, b, √ac, d) = (a 2 − c 2) 2 − (b2 + d2)(a − c) 2 ≥ 0. By S.M.V. theorem with the transformation ∆ of (a, b, c), we only need to prove the inequality when a = b = c = t ≥ d. In this case, the problem becomes 3t4 + d4 + 2t3d ≥ 3t4 + 3t2d2 ⇔ d4 + t3d + t3d ≥ 3t2d2. By AM − GM Inequality, the problem is obviously true. The equality is taken if and only if a = b = c = d or a = b = c, d = 0 or permutations. q Problem 3. Let x, y, z, t be positive numbers satisfying the condition x+y +z +t = 4. Prove that (1 + 3x)(1 + 3y)(1 + 3z)(1 + 3t) ≤ 125 + 131xyzt. (Pham Kim Hung) Solution. It’s easy to check that the equality occurs if x = y = z = t = 1 or x = y = z = 4/3, t = 0. So 131 is the greatest value of k for the following inequality (1 + 3x)(1 + 3y)(1 + 3z)(1 + 3t) ≤ 256 + k(xyzt − 1). Consider the expression f (x, y, z, t) = (1 + 3x)(1 + 3y)(1 + 3z)(1 + 3t) − 131xyzt. Without loss of generality, we may assume x ≥ y ≥ z ≥ t. Hence f (x, y, z, t) − f ( x + z 2 , y, x + z 2 , t) = 9(1 + 3y)(1 + 3t) (xz − (x + z) 2 4 ) − 131yt (xz − (x + z) 2 4 ) . Note that if y + t ≤ 2 then 9(1 + 3y)(1 + 3t) ≥ 131yt ⇔ 9 + 27(y + t) ≥ 50yt. 4 Because y + t ≤ 2, thus yt ≤ 1, Hence 9 + 27(y + t) ≥ 54√yt ≥ 54yt ≥ 50yt which yields that f (x, y, z, t) ≤ f ( x + z 2 , y, x + z 2 , t). By S.M.V theorem, it’s enough to prove the inequality in case x = y = z = a ≥ 1 ≥ t = 4 − 3z and in that case, we obtain (1 + 3a) 3(1 + 3(4 − 3a)) ≤ 125 + 131a 3(4 − 3a). After expending and collecting terms, the above inequality becomes 150a 4 − 416a 3 + 270a 2 + 108a − 112 ≤ 0 ⇔ (a − 1) 2(3a − 4)(50a + 28) ≤ 0, which is clearly true. We have equality if a = 1 or a = 4/3, which is equivalent to the two cases of equality showed at the beginning of solution. q The below problem is full of the color and character of this method. Problem 4. Let a1, a2, ..., an be non-negative real numbers satisfying that a1a2...an = 1. Prove that 1 a1 + 1 a2 + ... + 1 an + 3n a1 + a2 + ... + an ≥ n + 3, for all positive integer n ≥ 4. (Pham Kim Hung) Solution. Without loss of generality, we may assume that a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an. Denote f (a1, a2, ..., an) = 1 a1 + 1 a2 + ... + 1 an + 3n a1 + a2 + ... + an , We will prove that f (a1, a2, ..., an) ≥ f (a1, √a2an, √a2an, a3, a4, ..., an−1) (∗) Indeed, this one is equivalent to f (a1, a2, ..., an) − f (a1, √a2an, √a2an, a3, a4, ..., an−1) = ( 1 √a2 − 1 √an )2 − 3n( √a2 − √an) 2 (a1 + a2 + ... + an)(a1 + 2 √a2an + a3 + ... + an−1) , hence, it suﬃces to prove that (a1 + a2 + ... + an)(a1 + 2 √a2an + a3 + ... + an−1) ≥ 3na2an. Mathematical Reflections 6 (2006) 5 Because a1 ≥ a2 ≥ ... ≥ an, we deduce that (a1 + a2 + ... + an)(a1 + 2 √a2an + a3 + ... + an−1) ≥ (2a2 + (n − 2)an)(a2 + 2 √a2an + (n − 3)an) ≥ (2 + 2√n − 3)2 √ 2(n − 2)a2an ≥ 3na2an, for all non-negative integer n ≥ 4. Otherwise, for n = 3, this one is still true (with a2 ≥ a3) because (a2 + 2 √a2a3 + a3)(2a2 + a3) ≥ 9a2a3. Thus (∗) is proved. Furthermore, (∗) brings us a more important result. By S.M.V. theorem, we have f (a1, a2, ..., an) ≥ f (a1, b, b, ..., b), b = n−1√a2a3...an, and the rest is (before replacing n by n + 1 for aesthetics) proving that g(b) ≥ n + 4 . g(b) = bn + n b + 3(n + 1) nb + 1/bn = bn + n b + 3(n + 1)bn nbn+1 + 1 g′(b) = nbn−1 − n b2 + 3(n + 1)(nbn−1(nbn+1 + 1) − (n + 1)nb2n) (nbn+1 + 1)2 g′(b) = nbn−1 − n b2 + 3n(n + 1) (nbn+1 + 1)2 (bn−1 − b2n). Hence g′(b) = 0 ⇔ (bn+1 − 1)((nbn+1 + 1) 2 − 3(n + 1)bn+1) = 0. By AM − GM Inequality, we get (nbn+1 + 1) 2 ≥ 4nbn+1 ≥ 3(n + 1)bn+1. Thus g′(b) ≤ 0 ∀b ≤ 1 and g′(1) = 0, imply g(b) ≥ g(1) = n + 4, which is exactly the desired result. The equality holds for a1 = a2 = ... = an = 1. q Notice that in the above problem, the best constant to replace 3n is 4(n − 1), hence we need to add the condition n ≥ 4. But the solution for each one is similar. Problem 5. Let a, b, c, d be positive real numbers adding up to 4 and k is a given positive real number. Find the maximum value of the expression (abc) k + (bcd) k + (cda) k + (dab) k. (Pham Kim Hung) Solution. Without loss of generality, we may assume a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d. Firstly, suppose that 1 ≤ k ≤ 3. Let t = a + c 2 and u = a − c 2 , we get a = t + u, c = t − u. (abc) k + (bcd) k + (cda) k + (dab) k = (bk + dk)(ac) k + bkdk(a k + c k). 6 Let s = b−k + d−k and consider the function f (u) = s(ac) k + a k + c k = s(t2 − u2) k + (t + u) k + (t − u) k. We will prove that f (u) ≤ f (0). Indeed f ′(u) = −2kus(t2 − u2) k−1 + k(t + u) k−1 − k(t − u) k−1 = ku(t2 − u2) k−1 (−2s + (t − u) −k+1 − (t + u) −k+1 2u ) . Because a ≥ b ≥ c ≥ d, so d ≤ t − u. On the other hand, because k ≤ 3 and δ(x) = x −k+1 is a decreasing function, so Lagrange Theorem implies that (t + u) −k+1 − (t − u) −k+1 2u = δ′(β) ≥ (−k + 1)(t − u) −k ⇒ (t − u) −k+1 − (t + u) −k+1 2u ≤ (k − 1)(t − u) −k ⇒ −2s + (t − u) −k+1 − (t + u) −k+1 2u ≤ −2 dk + k − 1 (t − u)k ≤ 0. Thus f (u) ≤ f (0). By S.M.V. Theorem, we only need to prove the problem in case a = b = c = t ≥ d. Consider the function g(t) = t3k + 3t2k(4 − 3t) k, We will prove g(t) ≤ max (g(1), g( 4 3 ) ). Indeed, g′(t) = 3kt3k−1 + 6kt2k−1(4 − 3t) k − 9kt2k(4 − 3t) k−1 g′(t) = 0 ⇔ tk + 2(4 − 3t) k = 3t(4 − 3t) k ⇔ ( t 4 − 3t )k + 2 = 3t 4 − 3t . Let r = r(t) = t 4 − 3t ⇒ r(t) is a monotonically increasing function, that yields g′(t) = 0 ⇔ rk + 2 = 3r. Clearly, the above equation has no more than two positive real roots. Since g′(1) = 0, we deduce that g(t) ≤ max (g(1), g ( 4 3 )) = max ( 4, ( 4 3 )3k) . From the above result, we ﬁnd out (by taking k = 1) abc + bcd + cda + dab ≤ 4, Mathematical Reflections 6 (2006) 7 Hence for all k ≤ 1 then (abc) k + (bcd) k + (cda) k + (dab) k ≤ 4. Consider the case k ≥ 3, we have (abc) k + (bcd) k + (cda) k + (dab) k ≤ (ab) k(c + d) k ⇔ (ab) k ((c + d) k − c k − dk) ≥ (a k + bk)c kdk. This last inequality is obviously true because (c + d) k − c k − dk ≥ kc k−1 ≥ 2c k. Moreover, applying the AM − GM Inequality (ab) k(c + d) k ≤ ( a + b + c + d 3 )3k = ( 4 3 )3k . Hence the inequality has been proved completely (abc) k + (bcd) k + (cda) k + (dab) k ≤ max (4, ( 4 3 )3k) . q To conclude try applying the method to the following examples to improve your skill. Problem 6. Let a, b, c, d be non-negative real numbers such that a + b + c + d = 4. Prove the following inequality 16 + 2abcd ≥ 3(ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd). Problem 7. Let a, b, c, d, e ≥ 0 satisfy that a + b + c + d + e = 5. Prove that 4(a 2 + b2 + c 2 + d2 + e 2) + 5abcde ≥ 25. Problem 8. Let a, b, c, d be non-negative real numbers and a + b + c + d = 4. Prove that (1 + a 2)(1 + b2)(1 + c 2)(1 + d2) ≥ (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c)(1 + d). (Pham Kim Hung) 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
