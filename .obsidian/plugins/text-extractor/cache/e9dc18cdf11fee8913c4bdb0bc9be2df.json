The solutions will be posted in about one month’s time, but can be obtained before then by email if you write to one of us with evidence that you’ve tried the problems seriously. Good luck!

Let P A1 and P C1 be the perpendiculars from P to lines AB and BC respectively (A1 and C1 lie on lines AB and BC respectively). Prove that A1C1 is perpendicular to AC. Solution: Since ∠P C1B = ∠P A1B = 90◦, the points P ,A1,C1,B lie on a circle. There are two cases, when they are in order P A1C1B or P A1BC1. We will consider the order P A1C1B and the other case is very similar (the main observation is that they all lie on a circle). We have that ∠CC1A1 = 180 ◦ − ∠A1C1B = ∠A1P B = 90 ◦ − ∠A1BP. On the other hand ∠A1BP = ∠ACB. Hence ∠CC1A1 = ∠A1P B = 90 ◦ − ∠ACC1, which shows A1C1 and AC are perpendicular. The other case is done similarly. 2. Does there exist a positive integer k such that all the positive integers from 1 to k can be partitioned into two sets, and all the numbers in each set can be written down one after another (in some order without spaces) to form two new numbers, so that these two numbers are equal. Solution: There does not exist such an integer. Assume such a k exists. It is clear that k ≥ 10, since the numbers from 1 to 9 never have digits repeating. Consider 10n, the largest power of 10 before k, i.e. 10 n ≤ k < 10 n+1. Then 10 n must be in one of the two sets and hence the constructed number from this set must have n consecutive zeros preceded by a 1. Since natural numbers are not written with zeros at the front, this string of n zeros preceded by a 1 could not have formed in the other number by joining two or more other 1 natural numbers, and so it must have come from one natural number. But the next smallest natural number containing such a string is 10n+1, so if the two obtained numbers are equal, we must have used a number greater than or equal to 10 n+1 in the other set. But this implies 10 n+1 ≤ k, and so contradicts the maximality of n. 3. Nine skiers participated in a race. They started one by one, and each skier completed the race with a constant speed (which could be diﬀerent for diﬀerent skiers). Determine if it could happen that each skier participated in an overtaking exactly four times. (In each overtaking, exactly two skiers participated: the one who overtakes and the one who is overtaken.) Solution: This could not happen. Since the speed of each skier is constant, the skier who started ﬁrst could not overtake anyone. Hence he must have been overtaken four times. Hence he arrived in the ﬁfth position. On the other hand, the skier who started last could not be overtaken by anyone, hence he overtook four other skiers and again arrived in the ﬁfth position, which gives a contradiction. 4. Let 100 pairwise distinct real numbers be arranged in a circle. Prove that there exist four consecutive numbers along the circle such that the sum of the middle two numbers is strictly less than the sum of the other two numbers. Solution: Solution 1. Assume the contrary. Let the numbers be a1, a2, . . . , a100 and use the notation a100+n = an (i.e. we work with indices modulo 100). Then for n = 1, 2, . . . , 100 we have the inequality an + an+3 ≤ an+1 + an+2, which is equivalent to an+3 − an+2 ≤ an+1 − an. This implies a100 − a99 ≤ a98 − a97 ≤ . . . ≤ a2 − a1 ≤ a100 − a99. So all of these inequalities are equalities. Hence for k = 1, 2, . . . , 50 we have a2k − a2k−1 = b for a ﬁxed b, and similarly for k = 1, 2, . . . , 50 we have a2k+1 − a2k = c for a ﬁxed c. Summing these equalities gives 50b + 50c = 0, so b = −c. But then a2 − a1 = b = −c = −(a3 − a2) = a2 − a3 =⇒ a1 = a3, which contradicts that all numbers are distinct. Solution 2. Let a be the smallest number in the circle, b and c its neighbours (b < c) and d the other neighbour of b (diﬀerent from a). Then these numbers go in the order d, b, a, c (or reversed) and a < d, b < c, so we have a + b < d + c, which is what we wanted.
