Each of eight boxes contains six balls. Each ball has been colored with one of n colors, such that no two balls in the same box are the same color, and no two colors occur together in more than one box. Determine, with justiﬁcation, the smallest integer n for which this is possible. 2. Let ABC be a triangle and let ω be its incircle. Denote by D1 and E1 the points where ω is tangent to sides BC and AC, respectively. Denote by D2 and E2 the points on sides BC and AC, respectively, such that CD2 = BD1 and CE2 = AE1, and denote by P the point of intersection of segments AD2 and BE2. Circle ω intersects segment AD2 at two points, the closer of which to the vertex A is denoted by Q. Prove that AQ = D2P . 3. Let a, b, and c be nonnegative real numbers such that a 2 + b2 + c2 + abc = 4. Prove that 0 ≤ ab + bc + ca − abc ≤ 2.

Let P be a point in the plane of triangle ABC such that the segments P A, P B, and P C are the sides of an obtuse triangle. Assume that in this triangle the obtuse angle opposes the side congruent to P A. Prove that ∠BAC is acute. 5. Let S be a set of integers (not necessarily positive) such that (a) there exist a, b ∈ S with gcd(a, b) = gcd(a − 2, b − 2) = 1; (b) if x and y are elements of S (possibly equal), then x2 − y also belongs to S. Prove that S is the set of all integers. 6. Each point in the plane is assigned a real number such that, for any triangle, the number at the center of its inscribed circle is equal to the arithmetic mean of the three numbers at its vertices. Prove that all points in the plane are assigned the same number. Copyright c⃝ Committee on the American Mathematics Competitions, Mathematical Association of America","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
