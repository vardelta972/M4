Let p = 4k + 3 be a prime number. Find the number of diﬀerent residues modulo p of (x2 + y2) 2, where gcd(x, p) = gcd(y, p) = 1. 2. Let both p and 2p + 1 be primes. There are a total of 2p + 1 balls in two boxes, and neither is empty. Each step, one is allowed to move exactly half the balls in one box to the other box. Let k be any positive integer less than 2p + 1. Prove that there is a stage such that there are exactly k balls in one of the boxes. 3. Let p be an odd prime and let f (x) = p−1∑ i=1 ( i p ) xi−1.
