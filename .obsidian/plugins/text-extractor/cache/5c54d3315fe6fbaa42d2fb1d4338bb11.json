Total marks is 50. Attempt as many as you can. Answers without proper explanations will fetch no mark. 1. (10 marks) Suppose that z1, · · · , zn and w1, · · · , wn are complex numbers with |zi| ≤ 1 and |wi| ≤ 1 for each i = 1, 2, · · · , n. Show that, |z1z2 · · · zn − w1w2 · · · wn| ≤ |z1 − w1| + |z2 − w2| + · · · + |zn − wn|. 2. (10 marks) On the sides AB, BC, CD, DA of a quadrilateral ABCD, we con- struct squares (exterior to the quadrilateral) with centers O1, O2, O3, O4 respec- tively. Prove that O1O3 ⊥ O2O4 and O1O3 = O2O4. 3. (10 marks) Find all positive real numbers x, y satisfying the system of equations: √x(1 + 1 x + y ) = 3 2, √y(1 − 1 x + y ) = 1 2 . 4. (10 marks) Suppose that A1A2 · · · An is a regular polygon with n sides (n > 2), inscribed in a circle of radius r. Find the product of the distances of A1 from all the other vertices. That is, ﬁnd A1A2 × A1A3 × . . . × A1An. 5. (10 marks) A sequence (a1, b1), (a2, b2), (a3, b3), . . . of points in the coordinate plane satisﬁes (an+1, bn+1) = ( √3an − bn, √ 3bn + an) for each n = 1, 2, 3, · · · . Suppose that (a100, b100) = (18, 20). What is a1 + b1? Do not cheat to yourself. All the best! Contact: +91-9831935258","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
