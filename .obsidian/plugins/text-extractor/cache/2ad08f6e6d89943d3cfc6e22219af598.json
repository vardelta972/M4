Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Problem statement In triangle ABC, points P , Q, R lie on sides BC, CA, AB, respectively. Let ωA, ωB, ωC denote the circumcircles of triangles AQR, BRP , CP Q, respectively. Given the fact that segment AP intersects ωA, ωB, ωC again at X, Y , Z respectively, prove that Y X/XZ = BP /P C. Let M be the concurrence point of ωA, ωB, ωC (by Miquel’s theorem). A B CP Q R M X Y Z Then M is the center of a spiral similarity sending Y Z to BC. So it suffices to show that this spiral similarity also sends X to P , but ∡M XY = ∡M XA = ∡M RA = ∡M RB = ∡M P B so this follows. 3 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2013/2, proposed by Kiran Kedlaya Available online at https://aops.com/community/p3041823. Problem statement For a positive integer n ≥ 3 plot n equally spaced points around a circle. Label one of them A, and place a marker at A. One may move the marker forward in a clockwise direction to either the next point or the point after that. Hence there are a total of 2n distinct moves available; two from each point. Let an count the number of ways to advance around the circle exactly twice, beginning and ending at A, without repeating a move. Prove that an−1 + an = 2n for all n ≥ 4. Imagine the counter is moving along the set S = {0, 1, . . . , 2n} instead, starting at 0 and ending at 2n, in jumps of length 1 and 2. We can then record the sequence of moves as a matrix of the form [p0 p1 p2 . . . pn−1 pn pn pn+1 pn+2 . . . p2n−1 p2n ] where pi = 1 if the point i was visited by the counter, and pi = 0 if the point was not visited by the counter. Note that p0 = p2n = 1 and the upper-right and lower-left entries are equal. Then, the problem amounts to finding the number of such matrices which avoid the contiguous submatrices [ 0 0] [ 0 0 ] [1 1 1 1 ] which correspond to forbidding jumps of length greater than 2, repeating a length 2 jump and repeating a length 1 jump. We will for now ignore the boundary conditions. Instead we say a 2 × m matrix is silver (m ≥ 2) if it avoids the three shapes above. We consider three types of silver matrices (essentially doing casework on the last column): • type B matrices, of the shape [ 1 · · · 1 0 · · · 0 ] • type C matrices, of the shape [1 · · · 0 0 · · · 1 ] . • type D matrices, of the shape [1 · · · 1 0 · · · 1 ]. We let bm, cm, dm denote matrices of each type, of size 2 × m, and claim the following two recursions for m ≥ 4: bm = cm−1 + dm−1 cm = bm−1 + dm−1 dm = bm−1 + cm−1. Indeed, if we delete the last column of a type B matrix and consider what used to be the second-to-last column, we find that it is either type C or type D. This establishes the first recursion and the others are analogous. 4 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Note that b2 = 0 and c2 = d2 = 1. So using this recursion, the first few values are m 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 bm 0 2 2 6 10 22 42 cm 1 1 3 5 11 21 43 dm 1 1 3 5 11 21 43 and a calculation gives bm = 2m−1+2(−1)m−1 3 , cm = dm = 2m−1−(−1)m−1 3 . We now relate an to bm, cm, dm. Observe that a matrix as described in the problem is a silver matrix of one of two forms: [1 p1 p2 . . . pn−1 0 0 pn+1 pn+2 . . . p2n−1 1 ] or [1 p1 p2 . . . pn−1 1 1 pn+1 pn+2 . . . p2n−1 1 ] . There are cn+1 matrices of the first form. Moreover, there are 2dn matrices of the second form (to see this, delete the first column; we either get a type-D matrix or an upside-down type-D matrix). Thus we get an = cn+1 + 2dn = 2n+1 + (−1)n+1 3 . This easily implies the result. 5 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2013/3, proposed by Warut Suksompong Available online at https://aops.com/community/p3041827. Problem statement Let n be a positive integer. There are n(n+1) 2 tokens, each with a black side and a white side, arranged into an equilateral triangle, with the biggest row containing n tokens. Initially, each token has the white side up. An operation is to choose a line parallel to the sides of the triangle, and flip all the token on that line. A configuration is called admissible if it can be obtained from the initial configuration by performing a finite number of operations. For each admissible configuration C, let f (C) denote the smallest number of operations required to obtain C from the initial configuration. Find the maximum value of f (C), where C varies over all admissible configurations. The answer is max C f (C) =  |||| |||| 6k n = 4k 6k + 1 n = 4k + 1 6k + 2 n = 4k + 2 6k + 3 n = 4k + 3. The main point of the problem is actually to determine all linear dependencies among the 3n possible moves (since the moves commute and applying a move twice is the same as doing nothing). In what follows, assume n > 1 for convenience. To this end, we consider sequences of operations as additive vectors in v ∈ F3n 2 , with the linear map T : F3n 2 → F 1 2 n(n+1) 2 denoting the result of applying a vector v. We in particular focus on the following four vectors. • Three vectors x, y, z are defined by choosing all n lines parallel to one axis. Note T (x) = T (y) = T (z) = 1 (i.e. these vectors flip all tokens). • The vector θ which toggles all lines with an even number of tokens. One can check that T (θ) = 0. (Easiest to guess from n = 2 and n = 3 case.) One amusing proof that this works is to use Vivani’s theorem: in an equilateral triangle ABC, the sum of distances from an interior point P to the three sides is equal. The main claim is: Claim — For n ≥ 2, the kernel of T has exactly eight elements, namely {0, x + y, y + z, z + x, θ, θ + x + y, θ + y + z, θ + z + x}. Proof. Suppose T (v) = 0. • If v uses the y-move of length n, then we replace v with v + (x + y) to obtain a vector in the kernel not using the y-move of length n. • If v uses the z-move of length n, then we replace v with v + (x + z) to obtain a vector in the kernel not using the z-move of length n. • If v uses the x-move of length 2, then 6 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 – if n is odd, replace v with v + θ; – if n is even, replace v with v + (θ + y + z) to obtain a vector in the kernel not using the x-move of length 2. A picture is shown below, with the unused rows being dotted. Then, it is easy to check inductively that v must now be the zero vector, after the replacements. The idea is that for each token t, if two of the moves involving t are unused, so is the third, and in this way we can show all rows are unused. Thus the original v was in the kernel we described. (An alternative proof by induction is feasible too; as a sequence of movings which does not affect the top n rows also does not affect the to n − 1 rows.) Then problem is a coordinate bash, since given any v we now know exactly which vectors w have T (v) = T (w), so given any admissible configuration C one can exactly compute f (C) as the minimum of eight values. To be explicit, we could represent a vector v as v ←→ (a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2) where a1 is the number of 1’s in odd x-indices, a2 number of 1’s in even x-indices. Then for example v ←→ (a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2) v + x + y ←→ (⌈ n 2 ⌉ − a1, ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − a2, ⌈ n 2 ⌉ − b1, ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − b2, c1, c2) v + θ ←→ (a1, ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − a2, b1, ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − b2, c1, ⌊ n 2 ⌋ − c2) ... and f (T (v)) is the smallest sum of the six numbers across all eight 6-tuples. So you expect to answer about 3 2 n if all things are about n/4. The details are too annoying to reproduce here, so they are omitted. 7 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2013/4, proposed by Titu Andreescu Available online at https://aops.com/community/p3043752. Problem statement Find all real numbers x, y, z ≥ 1 satisfying min (√x + xyz, √y + xyz, √z + xyz) = √x − 1 + √ y − 1 + √z − 1. Set x = 1 + a, y = 1 + b, z = 1 + c which eliminates the x, y, z ≥ 1 condition. Then the given equation rewrites as √ (1 + a) (1 + (1 + b)(1 + c)) = √a + √b + √c. In fact, we are going to prove the left-hand side always exceeds the right-hand side, and then determine the equality cases. We have: (1 + a) (1 + (1 + b)(1 + c)) = (a + 1) (1 + (b + 1)(1 + c)) ≤ (a + 1) ( 1 + (√b + √c )2) ≤ (√a + (√b + √c )) by two applications of Cauchy-Schwarz. Equality holds if bc = 1 and 1/a = √b + √c. Letting c = t2 for t ≥ 1, we recover b = t−2 ≤ t2 and a = 1 t+1/t ≤ t2. Hence the solution set is (x, y, z) = ( 1 + ( t t2 + 1 )2 , 1 + 1 t2 , 1 + t 2) and permutations, for any t > 0. 8 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2013/5, proposed by Richard Stong Available online at https://aops.com/community/p3043754. Problem statement Let m and n be positive integers. Prove that there exists a positive integer c such that cm and cn have the same nonzero decimal digits. One-line spoiler: 142857. More verbosely, the idea is to look at the decimal representation of 1/D, m/D, n/D for a suitable denominator D, which have a “cyclic shift” property in which the digits of n/D are the digits of m/D shifted by 3. Remark (An example to follow along). Here is an example to follow along in the subsequent proof If m = 4 and n = 23 then the magic numbers e = 3 and D = 41 obey 103 · 4 41 = 97 + 23 41 . The idea is that 1 41 = 0.02439 4 41 = 0.09756 23 41 = 0.56097 and so c = 2349 works; we get 4c = 9756 and 23c = 56097 which are cyclic shifts of each other by 3 places (with some leading zeros appended). Here is the one to use: Claim — There exists positive integers D and e such that gcd(D, 10) = 1, D > max(m, n), and moreover 10em − n D ∈ Z. Proof. Suppose we pick some exponent e and define the number A = 10en − m. Let r = ν2(m) and s = ν5(m). As long as e > max(r, s) we have ν2(A) = r and ν5(A) = s, too. Now choose any e > max(r, s) big enough that A > 2r5s max(m, n) also holds. Then the number D = A 2r5s works; the first two properties hold by construction and 10 e · n D − m D = A D = 2r5 s is an integer. Remark (For people who like obscure theorems). Kobayashi’s theorem implies we can actually pick D to be prime. 9 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Now we take c to be the number under the bar of 1/D (leading zeros removed). Then the decimal representation of m D is the decimal representation of cm repeated (possibly including leading zeros). Similarly, n D has the decimal representation of cm repeated (possibly including leading zeros). Finally, since 10 e · m D − n D is an integer it follows that these repeating decimal representations are rotations of each other by e places, so in particular they have the same number of nonzero digits. Remark. Many students tried to find a D satisfying the stronger hypothesis that 1/D, 2/D, . . . , (D − 1)/D are cyclic shifts of each other. For example, this holds in the famous D = 7 case. The official USAMO 2013 solutions try to do this by proving that 10 is a primitive root modulo 7e for each e ≥ 1, by Hensel lifting lemma. I think this argument is actually incorrect, because it breaks if either m or n are divisible by 7. Put bluntly, 7 49 and 8 49 are not shifts of each other. One may be tempted to resort to using large primes D rather than powers of 7 to deal with this issue. However it is an open conjecture (a special case of Artin’s primitive root conjecture) whether or not 10 (mod p) is primitive infinitely often, which is the necessary conjecture so this is harder than it seems. 10 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2013/6, proposed by Titu Andreescu, Cosmin Pohoata Available online at https://aops.com/community/p3043749. Problem statement Let ABC be a triangle. Find all points P on segment BC satisfying the following property: If X and Y are the intersections of line P A with the common external tangent lines of the circumcircles of triangles P AB and P AC, then ( P A XY )2 + P B · P C AB · AC = 1. Let O1 and O2 denote the circumcenters of P AB and P AC. The main idea is to notice that △ABC and △AO1O2 are spirally similar. A B C P O1 O2 X1 Y1 X2 Y2 X Y Claim (Salmon theorem) — We have △ABC + ∼ △AO1O2. Proof. We first claim △AO1B + ∼ △AO2C. Assume without loss of generality that ∠AP B ≤ 90◦. Then ∠AO1B = 2∠ABP but ∠AO2C = 2 (180 − ∠AP C) = 2∠ABP. Hence ∠AO1B = ∠AO2C. Moreover, both triangles are isosceles, establishing the first similarity. The second part follows from spiral similarities coming in pairs. Claim — We always have ( P A XY )2 = 1 − ( a b + c )2 . 11 USAMO 2013 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 (In particular, this does not depend on P .) Proof. We now delete the points B and C and remember only the fact that △AO1O2 has angles A, B, C. The rest is a computation and several approaches are possible. Without loss of generality A is closer to X than Y , and let the common tangents be X1X2 and Y1Y2. We’ll perform the main calculation with the convenient scaling OBOC = a, AOC = b, and AOB = c. Let B1 and C1 be the tangency points of X, and let h = AM be the height of △AOBOC. O1 O2 A P M X1 X2 X Note that by Power of a Point, we have XX 2 1 = XX 2 2 = XM 2 − h2. Also, by Pythagorean theorem we easily obtain X1X2 = a2 − (b − c)2. So putting these together gives XM 2 − h2 = a2 − (b − c)2 4 = (a + b − c)(a − b + c) 4 = (s − b)(s − c). Therefore, we have Then XM 2 h2 = 1 + (s − b)(s − c) h2 = 1 + a2(s − b)(s − c) a2h2 = 1 + a2(s − b)(s − c) 4s(s − a)(s − b)(s − c) = 1 + a2 4s(s − a) = 1 + a2 (b + c)2 − a2 = (b + c)2 (b + c)2 − a2 . Thus ( P A XY )2 = ( h XM )2 = 1 − ( a b + c )2 . To finish, note that when P is the foot of the ∠A-bisector, we necessarily have P B · P C AB · AC = ( b b+c a) ( c b+c a) bc = ( a b + c )2 . Since there are clearly at most two solutions as P A XY is fixed, these are the only two solutions. 12","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
