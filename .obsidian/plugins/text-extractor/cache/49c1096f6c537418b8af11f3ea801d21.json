Find a closed form expression for (3n 0 ) + (3n 3 ) + · · · + ( 3n 3n ) . 2. (IMO 1981) Consider all r-element subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, where 1 ≤ r ≤ n. Prove that the arithmetic mean of the smallest elements of the subsets is n+1 r+1 . 3. Let p be an odd prime and let 0 ≤ a ≤ b be nonnegative integers. How many ap-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , bp} have sum divisible by p? 4. (Putnam 1999) Sum the series ∞∑ m=1 ∞∑ n=1 m 2n 3m(n3m + m3n) . 5. Let p be an odd prime. Consider the p 2 points (i, j) for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ p. How many subsets of these points have x-coordinates and y-coordinates both summing to multiples of p? 6. (TST 2001) Express n∑ k=0 (−1)k(n − k)!(n + k)! in closed form. 7. (ELMO 200?) A cycle of a permutation π of {1, . . . , n} is a cyclically ordered subset (a1a2 · · · ak) of {1, . . . , n} satisfying π(ai) = ai+1 for each i (indices taken mod k). Let z(π) denote the number of cycles in a permutation π. Prove that ∑ π 2z(π) = (n + 1)!, where the sum runs over all n! permutations of {1, . . . , n}. 8. Let n be a positive integer, let a be any nonzero real, and let b and c be any real numbers. Show that (a + b)n = a n∑ k=0 (n k ) (a − kc) k−1(b + kc) n−k. 9. Prove that for any positive integer n, n∑ k=0 (2k k )(2n − 2k n − k ) = 4 n. 10. (TST 2000) Let n be a positive integer. Prove that (n 0 )−1 + (n 1 )−1 + · · · + (n n )−1 = n + 1 2n+1 ( 2 1 + 2 2 2 + · · · + 2 n+1 n + 1 ) . 11. Show that ∑ 0≤k<l≤n (−1)k(n k) + (−1) l(n l ) (k + 1)(l + 1) = 0 for any positive integer n. 12. (Putnam 2005) For a permutation π, let f (π) denote the number of ﬁxed points of π. (A ﬁxed point of π is a number i such that π(i) = i.) Also let s(π) be equal to 1 if π is an even permutation and −1 if π is an odd permutation. Show that ∑ π s(π) 1 + f (π) = (−1) n+1 n n + 1 , where the sum runs over all n! permutations of {1, . . . , n}. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
