{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/Algebra/Algebra/Polynomials/Polynomials 2 - Reid Barton - MOP 2005.pdf","text":"Polynomials Reid Barton June 21, 2005 There are three basic ways to think about a polynomial P (x): 1. in terms of its coe\u000ecients (a0; a1; : : : ; an), where P (x) = a0 + a1x + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anxn; 2. in terms of its roots fr1; : : : ; rng, where P (x) = c(x \u0000 r1) \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 (x \u0000 rn); 3. as a function from R to R (or C to C, Z to Z, etc.) by evaluation. Interesting problems are those which involve multiple viewpoints on the same polynomial, so we need ways to relate these di\u000berent aspects. For the \frst two to be equivalent ways of looking at polynomials, we need to know whether any polynomial P (x) = a0+a1x+\u0001 \u0001 \u0001+anxn can be written as a product of linear factors. This follows from the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra, if we are willing to use complex numbers: Every non-constant polynomial with complex coe\u000ecients has a complex root. The relationship between the coe\u000ecients and the roots of a polynomial is given by Vieta's formulas: c = an; \u0000c(r1 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + rn) = an\u00001; . (\u00001)ncr1 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 rn = a0; where generally ak is the sum of all products of the ri taken n \u0000 k at a time, multiplied by (\u00001)n\u0000kc. Of course, it is not so easy to determine the roots of a polynomial from its coe\u000ecients, as evidenced for example by the unsolvability of the general \ffth degree equation in quadratics. Nevertheless, the equations above already form the basis for some interesting problems. Problem 1. (USAMO '77) Prove that the product of the two real roots of x4 + x3 \u0000 1 is a root of x6 + x4 + x3 \u0000 x2 \u0000 1. Problem 2. (Canada?) If \u000b, \f, \r are the roots of x3 \u0000 x \u0000 1, then \fnd \u000b \u0000 1 Given a polynomial in terms of its coe\u000ecients or roots, it is a simple matter to evaluate at any given real or complex number. The reverse problem is more interesting|given a function from R to R, is it determined by a polynomial P (x), and if so can we reconstruct the coe\u000ecients of P ? The Lagrange Interpolation Formula gives one kind of answer to this question: If (x0; y0), (x1; y1), . . . , (xn; yn) are points in the plane with distinct x-coordinates, then there exists a unique polynomial P (x) of degree at most n passing through these points, and it is given by the expression P (x) = nX i=0 yi (x \u0000 x0) \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \\(x \u0000 xi) \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 (x \u0000 xn) It turns out that polynomials in one variable over the rational (or real or complex) numbers behave a lot like integers. For example, there is a notion of divisibility: a polynomial P (x) divides another polynomial Q(x) if there exists a third polynomial R(x) such that P (x) = Q(x)R(x). One way to determine divisibility of polynomials uses complex factorization: P (x) divides Q(x) i\u000b every root of P (x) appears as a root of Q(x) with at least as high a multiplicity. Problem 13. (USAMO '77) For which pairs of positive integers (a; b) does xa + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x + 1 divide xab + xab\u0000b + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x2b + xb + 1? There is also an analogue to the division algorithm: If P (x) and Q(x) are two non-zero polynomials then there exist polynomials R(x) and S(x) such that P (x) = Q(x)S(x) + R(x); and deg R < deg P . (The degree of the zero polynomial is conventionally taken to be \u00001.) A consequence is that, like the integers, polynomials have unique factorization, up to constant factors, and one can de\fne the notion of the greatest common divisor of two polynomials. Analogously to the integers, the GCD of two polynomials P (x) and Q(x) is the polynomial of smallest degree which can be written in the form A(x)P (x) + B(x)Q(x). Problem 14. (Part of IMO '96 SL) For each positive integer n, show that there exists a positive integer k for which there exist polynomials f (x), g(x) with integer coe\u000ecients such that k = f (x)(x + 1)2n + g(x)(x2n + 1): The problem of factoring polynomials over the complex numbers is solved by the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic, and the situation over the reals is only slightly more complicated; any polynomial factors as a product of linear terms and quadratic terms with negative discriminant. However, when we restrict ourselves to the rational numbers, things become much more interesting. We call a polynomial P (x) reducible if it can be written as a product of two polynomials each of degree at least one, otherwise irreducible. It turns out that questions of reducibility are equivalent whether we work over the rationals or integers, according to Gauss's Lemma: Let P (x) be a polynomial with integer coe\u000ecients which is reducible over the rationals. Then P (x) is reducible over the integers. So in subsequent discussions of reducibility we will only consider polynomials with integer coe\u000ecients. There are many irreducible polynomials, for example by Eisenstein's Criterion: Let P (x) = a0 + a1x + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anxn be an integer polynomial and let p be a prime such that p j a0, p j a1, . . . , p j an\u00001, but p does not divide an and p2 does not divide a0. Then P (x) is irreducible. There are many other techniques for proving irreducibility, however. Problem 15. Show that P (x) = xp\u00001 + xp\u00002 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x + 1 is irreducible for any prime p. Problem 16. Find all values of n such that the polynomial P (x) = xn \u0000 64 is reducible. Problem 17. Find all reducible polynomials of the form (x \u0000 a1)(x \u0000 a2) \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 (x \u0000 an) \u0006 1 with a1, a2, . . . , an distinct integers. Problem 18. (IMO '93) Let n \u0015 2 and let P (x) = xn + 5xn\u00001 + 3. Prove that P (x) is irreducible. Problem 19. Show that for any positive integer n, the polynomial P (x) = (x2 + x)2n + 1 is irreducible. Let's return to our multiple viewpoints on polynomials, this time considering conditions of integrality. For example, if a polynomial with integer coe\u000ecients is evaluated at an integer, the result must be an integer. However, looking at two points at a time, one can say slightly more: 3 If P (x) is a polynomial with integer coe\u000ecients, then for any distinct integers a and b, a \u0000 b divides P (a) \u0000 P (b). Problem 20. Let P (x) be a polynomial with integer coe\u000ecients, and let n be an odd positive integer. Suppose x1, x2, . . . , xn is a sequence of integers such that x2 = P (x1), x3 = P (x2), . . . , xn = P (xn\u00001), and x1 = P (xn). Prove that all the xi are equal. Problem 21. (IMO '97 SL) Find all positive integers k for which the following statement is true: if P (x) is a polynomial with integer coe\u000ecients satisfying the condition 0 \u0014 P (c) \u0014 k for c = 0, 1, . . . , k + 1, then F (0) = F (1) = \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 = F (k + 1). In the opposite direction, we have the following result: A polynomial P (x) of degree n has integral value at every integer i\u000b P (x) can be written in the form P (x) = a0 \u0012x 0 \u0013 + a1 \u0012x 1 \u0013 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + an \u0012x n \u0013 for some integers a0, a1, . . . , an. (Note that P (x) need not have integer coe\u000ecients.) Finally, some miscellaneous extra problems, arranged roughly in increasing order of di\u000eculty. Problem 22. Proble that every polynomial over the complex numbers has a nonzero polynomial multiple whose exponents are all divisible by 109. Problem 23. (USAMO '92) A complex polynomial P (z) has degree 1992 and distinct zeros. Show that we can \fnd complex numbers zn, such that if Q1(z) = z \u0000 z1 and Qn(z) = Qn\u00001(z)2 \u0000 zn, then P (z) j Q1992(z). Problem 24. (MOP '97) Find, with proof, all nonzero polynomials P (x) such that P (x2)+P (x)P (x+1) = 0. Problem 25. (MOP '96) Find all polynomials P (x) with real coe\u000ecients for which there exists a polynomial Q(x) with real coe\u000ecients such that P (x2) = Q(P (x)). Problem 26. (MOP '97) Let S = fs1; s2; : : : ; sng be a set of n distinct complex numbers, for some n \u0015 9, exactly n \u0000 3 of which are real. Prove that there are at most two quadratic polynomials f (x) with complex coe\u000ecients such that f (S) = S (that is, f permutes the elements of S). Problem 27. (IMO '97 SL) Let P (x) be a polynomial with real coe\u000ecients such that P (x) > 0 for all x \u0015 0. Prove that there exists a positive integer n such that (1 + x)nP (x) is a polynomial with nonnegative coe\u000ecients. Problem 28. (USAMO '88) Let P (x) be the polynomial (1 \u0000 x)a1 (1 \u0000 x2)a2 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 (1 \u0000 x32)a32, where a1, a2, . . . , a32 are nonnegative integers. When expanded in powers of x, the coe\u000ecient of x1 is \u00002 and the coe\u000ecients of x2, x3, . . . , x32 are all zero. Find k. Problem 29. (MOP '96) Let P (x) be a monic polynomial of degree n with real coe\u000ecients. Prove that for any distinct integers a0, . . . , an, there exists i 2 f0; : : : ; ng such that jP (ai)j \u0015 n!=2n. Problem 30. (The rest of Problem 14) Find the smallest such value of k. Problem 31. (MOP '97) Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be distinct real numbers, and de\fne the polynomials P (x) = (x \u0000 x1)(x \u0000 x2) \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 (x \u0000 xn) Q(x) = P (x) \u0012 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
