Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be real numbers. For any permutation (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) of (a1, a2, . . . , an), we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a′ 1b1 + a′ 2b2 + · · · + a′ nbn ≥ anb1 + an−1b2 + · · · + a1bn, with equality if and only if ai = ai+1 for all i such that bi < bi+1. In particular, if b1 < b2 < . . . < bn, the equality takes place if (a′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) is equal to (a1, a2, . . . , an) or (an, an−1, . . . , a1), respectively. Proof. We will prove only the ﬁrst inequality. Suppose a′ i > a′ i+1, then a′ ibi + a′ i+1bi+1 − a′ i+1bi − a′ ibi+1 = (a′ i − a′ i+1)(bi − bi+1) ≤ 0. Moreover, if bi < bi+1, we have a′ ibi + a′ i+1bi+1 − a′ i+1bi − a′ ibi+1 < 0, which proves the statement since swapping neighboring pairs like the one above we can convert (a′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) into (a1, a2, . . . , an). Corollary 1. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be real numbers and (a′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) be a permutation of (a1, a2, . . . , an). Then a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a2 n ≥ a1a′ 1 + a2a′ 2 + · · · + ana′ n. ∗with borrowings from the article K.Wu and Andy Liu ”The rearrangement inequality.” 1 Corollary 2. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive numbers and (a′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) be a permuta- tion of (a1, a2, . . . , an). Then a′ 1 a1 + a′ 2 a2 + · · · + a′ n an ≥ n. For the two inequalities above it is hard to formulate a general rule when inequal- ity becomes an equality. But there are cases, when it is possible. For example, if (a′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) is cyclic, then the equality takes place iﬀ a1 = a2 = . . . = an. Exercise 1. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be real numbers. Then a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a2 n ≥ a1a2 + a2a3 + · · · + ana1 (1) with the equality iﬀ a1 = a2 = . . . = an. Exercise 2. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive numbers. Then an a1 + a1 a2 + · · · + an−1 an ≥ n (2) with the equality iﬀ a1 = a2 = . . . = an. Exercise 3. Prove that for all non-negative a, b, c the following two inequality hold a2b + b2c + c2a ≤ a3 + b3 + c3 ≤ a4 b + b4 c + c4 a . Establish when these are equalities. Simple as it sounds, the Rearrangement Inequality is a result of fundamental im- portance. We shall derive from it many familiar and useful inequalities. Theorem 2 (The Arithmetic Mean Geometric Mean Inequality). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive numbers. Then x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ n√x1x2 · · · xn, with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof. Let G = n√x1x2 · · · xn, a1 = x1 G , a2 = x1x2 G2 , . . . , an = x1x2 · · · xn Gn = 1. By Corollary 2, n ≤ a1 an + a2 a1 + · · · + an an−1 = x1 G + x2 G + · · · + xn G , which is equivalent to x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ G. As the permutation was cyclic, equality holds if and only if a1 = a2 = · · · = an, or x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. 2 Theorem 3 (The Geometric mean Harmonic Mean Inequality). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive numbers. Then n√x1x2 · · · xn ≥ n 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn , with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof. Let G, a1, a2, . . . , an be as in Example 5. By Corollary 2, n ≤ a1 a2 + a2 a3 + · · · + an a1 = G x1 + G x2 + · · · + G xn , which is equivalent to G ≥ n 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn . As the permutation was cyclic, equality holds if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Theorem 4 (The Root Mean Square Arithmetic Mean Inequality). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be real numbers. Then √ x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n n ≥ x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n , with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof. By Corollary 1, we have x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n ≥ x1x2 + x2x3 + · · · + xnx1, x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n ≥ x1x3 + x2x4 + · · · + xnx2, · · · ≥ · · · x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n ≥ x1xn + x2x1 + · · · + xnxn−1. Adding these and x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n = x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n, we have n(x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n) ≥ (x1 + x2 + · · · + x2 n) 2, which is equivalent to the desired result. Equality holds if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Exercise 4. Prove that for positive a, b, c aabbcc ≥ abbcca. When does this become an equality? 3 2 Cauchy’s Inequality and Its Consequences The full name of this inequality is Cauchy-Schwarz-Bunyakovski Inequality. Theorem 5 (Cauchy’s Inequality). Let a1, a2, . . . an, b1, b2, . . . , bn be real numbers. Then (a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) 2 ≤ (a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a2 n)(b2 1 + b2 2 + · · · + b2 n), with equality if and only if for some constant k, ai = kbi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n or bi = kai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Proof. If a1 = a2 = · · · = an = 0 or b1 = b2 = · · · = bn = 0, the result is trivial. Otherwise, deﬁne S = √ a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a2 n and T = √b2 1 + b2 2 + · · · + b2 n. Since both are non-zero, we may let xi = ai S and xn+i = bi T for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By Corollary 1, 2 = a2 1 + a2 2 + · · · + a2 n S2 + b2 1 + b2 2 + · · · + b2 n T 2 = x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 2n ≥ x1xn+1 + x2xn+2 + · · · + xnx2n + xn+1x1 + xn+2x2 + · · · + x2nxn = 2(a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) ST , which is equivalent to the desired result. Equality holds if and only if xi = xn+i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, or aiT = biS for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Example 1. For positive real numbers x1, . . . , xn we have (x2 1 + x2 2 + . . . + x2 n)(1 2 + 1 2 + . . . + 1 2) ≥ (x1 + x2 + . . . + xn) 2, from which x2 1 + x2 2 + . . . + x2 n n ≥ ( x1 + x2 + . . . + xn n )2 and we again obtain the Root Mean Square Arithmetic Mean Inequality. Example 2. Prove the inequality sin α sin β + cos α + cos β ≤ 2. Indeed, sin α sin β + cos α · 1 + 1 · cos β ≤ √sin2 α + cos2 α + 12√sin2 β + 12 + cos2 β = 2. 4 Exercise 5. Use Cauchy’s inequality to prove that, for all positive x1, . . . , xn, (x1 + x2 + . . . + xn) ( 1 x1 + 1 x2 + . . . + 1 xn ) ≥ n2, and show that this is equivalent to Arithmetic Mean Harmonic Mean Inequality. Another very useful form of Cauchy’s inequality is as follows. Theorem 6. Let x1, . . . , xn be arbitrary real numbers and y1, . . . , yn be positive real numbers. Then x2 1 y1 + x2 2 y2 + . . . + x2 n yn ≥ (x1 + x2 + . . . + xn) 2 y1 + y2 + . . . + yn . Solution. One can reduce this to the Cauchy’s inequality by substituting ai = xi√yi and bi = √yi. Let us reformulate the Cauchy’s inequality as follows: Theorem 7. n∑ k=1 x2 k = max    ( n∑ k=1 xkyk )2 ( n∑ k=1 y2 k )−1 ‖  , (3) where (y1, . . . , yn) ̸= (0, . . . , 0) and arbitrary otherwise. Proof. Obvious from the original Cauchy’s inequality. Indeed it implies that n∑ k=1 x2 k ≥ ( n∑ k=1 xkyk )2 ( n∑ k=1 y2 k )−1 . On the other hand both sides are equal, for example, at xk = yk. One obvious but very useful corollary. Corollary 3. n∑ k=1 x2 k = max ( n∑ k=1 xkyk )2 , (4) where ∑n k=1 yk = 1 and arbitrary otherwise. Firstly we will exploit the theorem. 5 Example 3 (IMO 95). Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that abc = 1. Prove that 1 a3(b + c) + 1 b3(c + a) + 1 c3(a + b) ≥ 3 2. Solution. The idea is to “dismantle” the complicated expression on the left. We will represent all three summands on the left as squares: x2 1 = 1 a3(b + c), x2 2 = 1 b3(c + a), x2 3 = 1 c3(a + b), and will choose y1, y2, y3 as follows: y2 1 = a(b + c), y2 2 = b(c + a), y3 = c(a + b). The idea is clear: to make both terms on the right of (4) managable. As abc = 1, we get 1 a3(b + c) + 1 b3(c + a) + 1 c3(a + b) ≥ ( 1 a + 1 b + 1 c )2 (a(b + c) + b(c + a) + c(a + b)) −1 = ab + bc + ca 2 ≥ 3 2, since AM-GM implies ab + bc + ca ≥ 3 3√a2b2c2 = 3. The inequality is proven. Exercise 6 (Kvant, 1985). Prove that for any positive numbers a, b, c, d a b + c + b c + d + c d + a + d a + b ≥ 2. Example 4 (GDR 67). Prove that, if n ≥ 2, and a1, . . . , an are positive numbers whose sum is S, then a1 S − a1 + a2 S − a2 + . . . + an S − an ≥ n n − 1. Solution. We will apply the theorem for the numbers x2 k = ak S − ak , y2 k = ak(S − ak). We will obtain n∑ k=1 ak S − ak ≥ ( n∑ k=1 ak )2 · ( n∑ k=1 ak(S − ak) )−1 = S2 ( n∑ k=1 ak(S − ak) )−1 . 6 Hence it is enough to show that S2 ( n∑ k=1 ak(S − ak) )−1 ≥ n n − 1. or (n − 1)S2 ≥ n ∑n k=1 ak(S − ak) = nS2 − n ∑n k=1 a2 k, which follow from the RootMean Square - Arithmetic Mean inequality. Exercise 7 (Mongolia, 1996). Prove that for any positive numbers a, b, c, d satisfying a + b + c + d = 1 1 1 − √a + 1 1 − √b + 1 1 − √c + 1 1 − √d ≥ 8. Let us now see what the corollary has to oﬀer. Example 5 (Beckenbach Inequality). For positive numbers x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn the following inequality holds: ∑n k=1(xk + yk) 2 ∑n k=1 xk + ∑n k=1 yk ≤ ∑n k=1 x2 k∑n k=1 xk + ∑n k=1 y2 k∑n k=1 yk . Solution. Let X = x1 + . . . + xn and Y = y1 + . . . + yn. We claim that it is suﬃcient to show that for any positive numbers z1, . . . , zn ( ∑n k=1(xk + yk)zk) 2 X + Y ≤ ( ∑n k=1 xkzk) 2 X + ( ∑n k=1 ykzk) 2 Y (5) Indeed, if (5) was true, then due to Corollary 4 ∑n k=1(xk + yk) 2 ∑n k=1 xk + ∑n k=1 yk = max ( ∑n k=1(xk + yk)zk) 2 X + Y = (∑n k=1(xk + yk)z′ k)2 X + Y ≤ (∑n k=1 xkz′ k)2 X + (∑n k=1 ykz′ k)2 Y ≤ max ( ∑n k=1 xkzk) 2 X + max ( ∑n k=1 ykzk) 2 Y = ∑n k=1 x2 k∑n k=1 xk + ∑n k=1 y2 k∑n k=1 yk . To prove (5) we denote x = n∑ k=1 xkzk√X , y = n∑ k=1 ykzk√Y . 7 Then (5) becomes (x√X + y√Y ) 2 X + Y ≤ x2 + y2, which is easy to prove by expanding of brackets. Exercise 8 (Minkowski’s inequality). Using the same idea prove that for any pos- itive integers x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn √ x2 1 + x2 2 + . . . + x2 n+ √y2 1 + y2 2 + . . . + y2 n ≥ √(x1 + y1)2 + (x2 + y2)2 + . . . + (xn + yn)2. The trick used in the last two problems and formulated in Corollary is called quasi- linearisation of Cauchy’s inequality. You can do it with some other inequalities too. The quasilinearisation of AM-GM will look as follows. Theorem 8. For any positive integers x1, . . . , xn n√x1x2 · · · xn = min n∑ k=1 xkyk n , where y1, . . . , yn are positive numbers such that y1y2 · · · yn = 1. Exercise 9. Prove this theorem. Exercise 10. Use the theorem proved in the previous exercise and prove another Minkowski’s inequality n√x1x2 · · · xn + n√y1y2 · · · yn ≤ n√(x1 + y1)(x2 + y2) · · · (xn + yn). 3 Chebyshev’s Inequality This is also known as Tchebychef’s inequality. Deﬁnition. Let a1, a2, . . . , an and b1, b2, . . . , bn be two monotonic (monotone increas- ing or monotone decreasing) sequences of real numbers. These sequences are called similarly directed, if (ai − aj)(bi − bj) ≥ 0 for all i ≤ j. The sequences are called oppositely directed, if (ai − aj)(bi − bj) ≤ 0 for all i ≤ j. 8 Theorem 9 (Chebyshev’s Inequality). Let a1, a2, . . . , an and b1, b2, . . . , bn be two monotonic sequences of real numbers. Then a1 + a2 + . . . + an n · b1 + b2 + . . . + bn n ≤ a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn n , (6) if the two sequences are similarly directed and a1 + a2 + . . . + an n · b1 + b2 + . . . + bn n ≥ a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn n , (7) if they are oppositely directed. Proof. Suppose the two sequences are similarly directed. By the Rearrangement In- equality a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn = a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn, a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn ≥ a1b2 + a2b3 + . . . + anb1, · · · ≥ · · · a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn ≥ a1bn + a2b1 + . . . + anbn−1. Adding all of them together we obtain n(a1b1 + a2b2 + . . . + anbn) ≥ (a1 + a2 + . . . + an)(b1 + b2 + . . . + bn), which is equivalent to Chebyshev’s Inequality (6). The second Chebyshev’s Inequality (6) can be proved similarly. Exercise 11. Prove Chebyshev’s Inequality (7). Example 6. Prove that for all real numbers x1, . . . , xn (x1 + x2 + . . . + xn) (x3 1 + x3 2 + . . . + x3 n) ≤ n (x4 1 + x4 2 + . . . + x4 n) . Indeed, we may assume that x1 ≤ x2 ≤ . . . ≤ xn. But then x3 1 ≤ x3 2 ≤ . . . ≤ x3 n and Chebyshev’s Inequality (6) is applicable and gives the result. Exercise 12. Prove that for all real numbers x1, . . . , xn (x5 1 + x5 2 + . . . + x5 n) ( 1 x2 1 + 1 x2 2 + . . . + 1 x2 n ) ≥ n (x3 1 + x3 2 + . . . + x3 n) . 9 4 Jensen’s Inequality This method might require a little bit of Calculus. Deﬁnition 1. Let us recall that a function f (x) on a segment [a, b] is concave up if for all x1, x2 ∈ [a, b] f ( x1 + x2 2 ) ≤ f (x1) + f (x2) 2 , (8) and concave down if for all x1, x2 ∈ [a, b] f ( x1 + x2 2 ) ≥ f (x1) + f (x2) 2 . (9) Proposition 1. If the function f (x) is continuous on [a, b] and twice diﬀerentiable on (a, b), then it is concave up iﬀ f ′′(x) ≥ 0 and it is concave down iﬀ f ′′(x) ≤ 0. Theorem 10 (Jensen’s Inequality). Let n ≥ 2 and α1, . . . , αn be nonnegative real numbers such that α1 + . . . + αn = 1. Then 1. For an arbitrary concave up function f (x) on a segment [a, b] f (α1x1 + · · · + αnxn) ≤ α1f (x1) + · · · + αnf (xn) for all x1, . . . , xn ∈ [a, b]. 2. For an arbitrary concave down function f (x) on a segment [a, b] f (α1x1 + · · · + αnxn) ≥ α1f (x1) + · · · + αnf (xn) for all x1, . . . , xn ∈ [a, b]. Example 7. Prove that for all nonnegative x1, . . . , xn and y1, . . . , yn, (x3 1 + x3 2 . . . + x3 n) (y3 1 + y3 2 . . . + y3 n)2 ≥ (x1y2 1 + x2y2 2 . . . + xny2 n)3 . To prove this, let us denote S = y3 1 + . . . + y3 n. Then our inequality can be rewritten as x3 1 + x3 2 . . . + x3 n S ≥ (x1y2 1 + x2y2 2 . . . + xny2 n) 3 S3 , or y3 1 S ( x1 y1 )3+ y3 2 S ( x2 y2 )3+. . .+ y3 n S ( xn yn )3 ≥ ( y3 1 S ( x1 y1 ) + y3 2 S ( x2 y2 ) + . . . + y3 n S ( xn yn ))3 , which follows from concavity up of the function f (x) = x3 for nonnegative x. Indeed, f ′′(x) = 6x ≥ 0 for x ≥ 0 and y3 1 S + y3 2 S + . . . + y3 n S = S S = 1. 10 Often you need to take logs before applying Jensen’s inequality. Example 8. Prove that (1 + 1 x ) ( 1 + 1 y ) ( 1 + 1 z ) ≥ 64, where x, y, z > 0 and x + y + z = 1. After taking logs on both sides, we get log2 (1 + 1 x ) + log2 (1 + 1 y ) + log2 (1 + 1 z ) ≥ 6. We check that the function f (t) = log2(1 + 1/t) is concave up. Indeed, calculation show that f ′′(t) = 1 t2 − 1 (t + 1)2 > 0. Hence by Jensen’s inequality 1 3 log2 (1 + 1 x ) + 1 3 log2 (1 + 1 y ) + 1 3 log2 (1 + 1 z ) ≥ log2 (1 + 3 x + y + z ) = 2 and the desired inequality follows. Exercise 13. Using Jensen’s inequality prove that aa/a+b+c · bb/a+b+c · cc/a+b+c ≤ a2 + b2 + c2 a + b + c , where a, b, c are positive integers. One of the powerful tools is the so-called weighted AM-GM inequality. Theorem 11 (Weighted AM-GM inequality). Let w1, . . . , wn be non-negative reals such that w1 + . . . + wn = 1, then for any non-negative reals x1, . . . , xn w1x1 + w2x2 + . . . + wnxn ≥ xw1 1 xw2 2 . . . xwn n with equality if and only if all the xi with wi ̸= 0 are equal. Exercise 14. Deduce Weighted AM-GM inequality from Jensen’s inequality. Weighted AM-GM inequality is quite powerful but sometimes diﬃcult to use. We illustrate this on the following example. 11 Example 9. Prove that for all positive reals a, b, c, d a4b + b4c + c4d + d 4a ≥ abcd(a + b + c + d). Solution. By weighted AM-GM 23a4b + 7b4c + 11c4d + 10d 4a 51 ≥ 51√a102b51c51d51 = a2bcd. It remains to symmetrise this inequality. How can we ﬁnd weights w1 = 23 51 , w2 = 7 51 , w3 = 11 51 , w4 = 10 51 ? Aiming to get in this particular case (a4b) w1(b4c) w2(c4d) w3(d 4a) w4 = a2bcd, we solving the system of linear equations w1 + w2 + w3 + w4 = 1, 4w1 + w4 = 2, 4w2 + w1 = 1, 4w3 + w2 = 1. and ﬁnd the weights. Weighted AM-GM plus symmetrisation is a powerful tool. Exercise 15. Prove that if abc > 0, then 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≤ a8 + b8 + c8 a3b3c3 . by reducing this inequality to weighted AM-GM inequality. 5 Schur’s Inequality The following simple inequality can be often useful. Theorem 12. Let t ≥ 1 be a real number. Then for all non-negative real numbers x, y, z xr(x − y)(x − z) + yr(y − z)(y − x) + zr(z − x)(z − y) ≥ 0, where the equality occurs only when x = y = z ̸= 0 or some two of x, y, z are equal and the third is zero. 12 Proof. Due to the symmetry of the inequality we may assume that x ≥ y ≥ z. Then our inequality can be rewritten as (x − y) [xr(x − z) − yr(y − z)] + zr(x − z)(y − z) ≥ 0, which is obvious since every term of it is non-negative. Exercise 16. Prove that for any positive a, b, c a3 + b3 + c3 + 3abc ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(a + c) + c2(a + b). (10) 6 Muirhead’s Inequality Let us consider the set Sn of sequences (α) = (α1, . . . , αn) with the following two properties: α1 + α2 + . . . + αn = 1, (11) α1 ≥ α2 ≥ . . . ≥ αn ≥ 0. (12) For any two sequences (α) and (β) from S we say that (α) majorises (β) if α1 + α2 + . . . + αr ≥ β1 + β2 + . . . + βr for all 1 ≤ r < n. We denote this as (α) ≽ (β). If (α) ≽ (β) and (α) ̸= (β), we will write (α) ≻ (β). Example 10. (1, 0, 0) ≻ ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0) ≻ ( 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 6 ) ≻ ( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ). Now we introduce one more notation: for (α) from Sn we denote x(α) = 1 n! (xα1 1 xα2 2 . . . xαn n + . . .), where the dots denote all n! − 1 terms obtained by permutations of α’s. Example 11. Let n = 3. Then x(1,0,0) = 1 6(x1 1x0 2x0 3 + x1 1x0 3x0 2 + x1 2x0 1x0 3 + x1 2x0 3x0 1 + x1 3x0 1x0 2 + x1 3x0 2x0 1) = 1 3(x1 + x2 + x3); x( 1 2 , 1 2 ,0) = 1 6(x 1 2 1 x 1 2 2 x0 3 + x 1 2 2 x 1 2 1 x0 3 + x 1 2 1 x 1 2 3 x0 2 + x 1 2 3 x 1 2 1 x0 2 + x 1 2 2 x 1 2 3 x0 1 + x 1 2 3 x 1 2 2 x0 1) = 1 3( √x1x2 + √x1x3 + √x2x3); x( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ) = 3√x1x2x3. 13 Theorem 13 (Muirhead). If (α) ≽ (β), then the inequality x(α) ≥ x(β) holds for all non-negative x1, . . . , xn. There is equality only when (α) = (β) or all the xi are equal. Proof. We will prove this theorem for the case n = 3. The general case can be proved similarly. We assume that (α) ̸= (β) and not all the xi are equal. Let us consider the following three partial cases from which the general case will follow. (a) Let (α) = (α1, α2, α3), and ρ be a positive real number such that ρ < α1 − α2 and (α′) = (α1 − ρ, α2 + ρ, α3). Then 3! (x(α) − x(α′)) = (xα1 1 xα2 2 + xα2 1 xα1 2 − xα′ 1 1 xα′ 2 2 − xα′ 2 1 xα′ 1 2 )xα3 3 + (xα1 1 xα2 3 + xα2 1 xα1 3 − xα′ 1 1 xα′ 2 3 − xα′ 2 1 xα′ 1 3 )xα3 2 + (xα1 2 xα2 3 + xα2 2 xα1 3 − xα′ 1 2 xα′ 2 3 − xα′ 2 2 xα′ 1 3 )xα3 1 . The latter expression is positive. Indeed, if xi ̸= xj, then xα1 i xα2 j + xα2 i xα1 j − xα′ 1 i xα′ 2 j − xα′ 2 i xα′ 1 j = (xixj) α2 [ (xα1−α2−ρ i − xα1−α2−ρ j )(xρ i − xρ j ) ] > 0, since both round brackets are either both positive or both negative. Since not all the xi are equal, there will be x1 ̸= x2, or x1 ̸= x3, or x2 ̸= x3. This secures that x(α) > x(α′). (b) Similarly, if ρ < α2 − α3 and (α′′) = (α1, α2 − ρ, α3 + ρ), then x(α) > x(α′′). (c) The same argument also shows that if α2 = α′ 2, then, for any ρ ≤ α1 − α3, and (α′′′) = (α1 − ρ, α2, α3 + ρ), then x(α) > x(α′′′). Suppose now that α2 < β2. Then α2 < β1, and ρ = α1 − β1 < α1 − α2. Then by the case (a), x(α) > x(α′), where (α′) = (α1 − ρ, α2 + ρ, α3) = (β1, α2 + ρ, α3). As α3 < β3, α2 + ρ > β2, hence x(α′) > x(β) by (b). Thus x(α) > x(β), as required. The case α2 > β2 is considered similarly using the cases (b) and (a). If α2 = β2, then the statement follows straight from (c). Example 12. Prove that for all non-negative a, b, c 1 3(a2 + b2 + c2) ≥ 1 3(ab + ac + bc) ≥ 3√a2b2c2. 14 Solution. For all non-negative x1, x2, x3 by Muirheads theorem x(1,0,0) ≥ x( 1 2 , 1 2 ,0) ≥ x( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ). Hence 1 3(x1 + x2 + x3) ≥ 1 3( √x1x2 + √x1x3 + √x2x3) ≥ 3√x1x2x3 or, after the substitution a = √x1, b = √x2, c = √x3, 1 3(a2 + b2 + c2) ≥ 1 3(ab + ac + bc) ≥ 3√a2b2c2. Exercise 17. Prove that for all non-negative a, b, c the following two inequalities hold 2(a3 + b3 + c3) ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(c + a) + c2(a + b) ≥ 6abc. Establish when they are equalities. In fact, we do not need to restrict ourselves with positive αn requiring only the ﬁrst of the two conditions (11) but not (12). Example 13. For example, ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0) ≺ (2, −1, 0) and the inequality 2( √xy + √xz + √yz) ≤ x2 y + x2 z + y2 x + y2 z + z2 x + z2 y . holds. Exercise 18. Prove this extension of the Muirhead Theorem. Americans call Muirhead’s Theorem a “Bunching Principle.” They also use a dif- ferent notation that can sometimes be useful. The notion of majorisation can be extended to sequences of the same length. If s = (s1, . . . , sn) and t = (t1, . . . , tn) are two nonincreasing sequences, we say that s majorizes t if s1 + · · · + sn = t1 + · · · + tn and s1 + · · · + si ≥ t1 + · · · + ti for i = 1, . . . , n. Theorem 14 (“Bunching Principle”). If s and t are two nonincreasing sequences of nonnegative real numbers such that s majorizes t, then ∑ sym xs1 1 · · · xsn n ≥ ∑ sym xt1 1 · · · xtn n , where the sums are taken over all n! permutations of variables. 15 7 Constraints and Homogenisation Homogenisation is a very important technique, especially in conjunction with Muirhead Theorem. We illustrate it on the following simple example. Example 14. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that abc = 1. Prove that a + b + c ≤ a2 + b2 + c2. Proof. The inequality is not homogeneous in the sense that diﬀerent terms have dif- ferent degrees. However the constraint abc = 1 is not homogeneous either and we may use this to homogenise the inequality. We make it homogeneous by multiplying the LHS by 3√abc. We will obtain an equivalent inequality a 4 3 b 1 3 c 1 3 + a 1 3 b 4 3 c 1 3 + a 1 3 b 1 3 c 4 3 ≤ a2 + b2 + c2, which follows from Muirhead’s inequality a 2 3 b 1 6 c 1 6 + a 1 6 b 2 3 c 1 6 + a 1 6 b 1 6 c 2 3 ≤ a + b + c since (1, 0, 0) ≻ ( 2 3 , 1 6 , 1 6 ). One can also use Weighted AM-GM to show 2 3a2 + 1 6b2 + 1 6c2 ≥ 6√a8b2c2 = a 4 3 b 1 3 c 1 3 and then symmetrise this expression. Example 15. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers such that a + b + c = 1. Prove that a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc ≥ 1 4. Proof. Multiplying by 4 and homogenising, we obtain 4(a3 + b3 + c3) + 24abc ≥ (a + b + c) 3. Simplifying we get a3 + b3 + c3 + 6abc ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(a + c) + c2(a + b), which follows from (10). Exercise 19. Let a, b, c be real numbers such that abc = −1. Show that a4 + b4 + c4 + 3(a + b + c) ≥ a2 b + a2 c + b2 a + b2 c + c2 a + c2 b . 16 8 Symmetric Averages Two more theorems which have been seldom used in Math Olympiad practice so far. Let x1, . . . , xn be a sequence of non-negative real numbers. We deﬁne the symmetric averages of x1, . . . , xn by di = si(n i) , where si’s are the coeﬃcients of the polynomial (x − x1)(x − x2) . . . (x − xn) = snxn + . . . + s1x + s0. For example, if n = 4, then d1 = 1 4(x1 + x2 + x3 + x4), d2 = 1 6(x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 + x2x4 + x3x4), d3 = 1 4(x1x2x3 + x1x2x4 + x1x3x4 + x2x3x4), d4 = x1x2x3x4. Theorem 15 (Newton). For all i = 1, . . . , n − 1 d 2 i ≥ di−1di+1. Example 16. For example, for n = 4 we have d 2 2 ≥ d1d3, i.e. (x1x2+x1x3+x1x4+x2x3+x2x4+x3x4) 2 ≥ 9 4(x1+x2+x3+x4)(x1x2x3+x1x2x4+x1x3x4+x2x3x4). or ( ∑ sym x1x2 )2 ≥ 9 4 ∑ sym x1 · ∑ sym x1x2x3. The latter makes sense only if n = 4 is agreed upon and implicitely assumed. Otherwise it is confusing. Theorem 16 (Maclaurin). d1 ≥ √d2 ≥ 3√d3 ≥ . . . ≥ n√dn. Example 17. For example, for n = 4 we have √d2 ≥ 3√d3, or equivalently ( ∑ sym x1x2 )3 ≥ 27 2 ( ∑ sym x1x2x3 )2 . Example 18. d1 ≥ n√dn is the familiar AM-GM inequality. Maclaurin’s theorem is a reﬁnement of it. 17 9 Hints and Solutions to Exercises 1. Check that if a1 < an, then the process of transforming (a2, . . . , an, a1) into (a1, . . . , an) described in the theorem will give at least one strict inequality. 2. Same as in Exercise 1. 3. Assume a ≤ b ≤ c. Then a2 ≤ b2 ≤ c2. Applying the LHS of Rearrangement inequality to these two sequences we get a2b + b2c + c2a ≤ a3 + b3 + c3 Also we have a4 ≤ b4 ≤ c4 and 1/c ≤ 1/b ≤ 1/a. Applying the RHS of Rear- rangement inequality we obtain a3 + b3 + c3 ≤ a4 b + b4 c + c4 a . 4. Suppose a ≤ b ≤ c. As ln x is increasing function of x it is suﬃcient to compare logarithms of both sides of the inequality, i.e. to establish that ln(aabbcc) ≥ ln(a bbcca). This can be written as a ln a + b ln b + c ln c ≥ b ln a + c ln b + a ln c, which is true by Rearrangement inequality since ln a ≤ ln b ≤ ln c. 5. Apply Cauchy’s inequality to ai = xi and bi = 1/xi. To obtain AM-HM inequality divide both sides by n and the sum of reciprocals. 6. Let us make use of Theorem 6 to prove it. We will apply (3) for x2 1 = a b + c , x2 2 = b c + d, x2 3 = c d + a, x2 4 = d a + b , y2 1 = a(b + c), y2 2 = b(c + d), y2 3 = c(d + a), y2 4 = d(a + b). We will obtain a b + c + b c + d+ c d + a + d a + b ≥ (a+b+c+d) 2 (a(b + c) + b(c + d) + c(d + a) + d(a + b)) −1 = (a + b + c + d) 2(2ac + 2bd + ab + bc + cd + da) −1. To show that the RHS is greater or equal than 2 we need to prove that (a + b + c + d) 2 ≥ 2(2ac + 2bd + ab + bc + cd + da), which can be checked by simply expanding brackets. 18 7. Let us note that 1 1 − √a = √a 1 − √a + 1, hence we have to prove that √a 1 − √a + √b 1 − √b + √c 1 − √c + √d 1 − √d ≥ 4. We will prove a more general inequality: for all non-negative a1, . . . , an such that∑n k=1 ak = 1 it is true that n∑ k=1 √ak 1 − √ak ≥ 4, which coincides with the Mongolian question for n = 4. Let us use Theorem 6 again and apply (3). We obtain √ak 1 − √ak ≥ ( n∑ k=1 ak )2 ( n∑ k=1 ak√ak(1 − √ak )−1 = ( n∑ k=1 ak√ak(1 − √ak )−1 . By AM-GM ak√ak = 2ak √ak 2 ≤ ak 4 + a2 k, hence n∑ k=1 ak√ak ≤ 1 4 n∑ k=1 ak + n∑ k=1 a2 k. This implies n∑ k=1 ak√ak(1 − √ak) ≤ 1 4, which, in turn, implies the inequality. 8. We will apply (4) of Corollary 3. It implies that for some z1, . . . , zn such that z2 1 + . . . + z2 n = 1 √(x1 + y1)2 + . . . + (xn + yn)2 = max ( n∑ k=1(xk + yk)zk )2 . Using that max(u + v) ≤ max u + max v, we obtain √(x1 + y1)2 + . . . + (xn + yn)2 = max ( n∑ k=1(xk + yk)zk )2 ≤ max ( n∑ k=1 xkzk )2 + max ( n∑ k=1 ykzk )2 = √x2 1 + . . . + x2 n + √y2 1 + . . . + y2 n. 19 9. For any y1, . . . , yn such that y1y2 · · · yn = 1 AM-GM implies n√x1x2 · · · xn = n√(x1y1)(x2y2) · · · (xnyn) ≤ n∑ k=1 xiyi n . This becomes an equality iﬀ x1y1 = . . . = xnyn. This can be achieved by taking yi = q xi , where q = n√x1x2 · · · xn. 10. Using the theorem from the previous exercise we get for some z1, . . . , zn such that z1z2 · · · zn = 1 n√(x1 + y1)(x2 + y2) · · · (xn + yn) = min ( n∑ k=1(xk + yk)zk ) ≥ min ( n∑ k=1 xkzk ) + min ( n∑ k=1 ykzk ) = n√x1x2 · · · xn + n√y1y2 · · · yn. 11. Use Chebyshev’s inequality (6) for sequences a1, . . . , an and −b1, −b2, . . . , −ln. 12. We may assume that x1 ≤ x2 ≤ . . . ≤ xn. But then x5 1 ≤ x5 2 ≤ . . . ≤ x5 n and 1/x2 1 ≥ 1/x2 2 ≥ . . . ≥ 1/x2 n so these two sequences are oppositely directed. Hence Chebyshev’s Inequality (7) is applicable and gives the result. 13. Since y = ln x is an increasing function, it is suﬃcient to prove the same inequality for logarithms. Taking logs we will obtain ( a a + b + c ) · ln a + ( b a + b + c ) · ln b + ( c a + b + c ) · ln c ≤ ln ( a a + b + c · a + b a + b + c · b + c a + b + c · c) . This is true. We apply Jensen’s inequality for the function y = ln x, which is concave down and α1 = a a + b + c , α2 = b a + b + c , α3 = c a + b + c . (Note that α1 + α2 + α3 = 1). 14. Take logs on both sides and use concavity of logarithm down. 20 15. The inequality can be rewritten as follows: (ab + bc + ca)a2b2c2 ≤ a8 + b8 + c8. Weighted AM-GM yields 3 8a8 + 3 8b8 + 2 8c8 ≥ a3b3c2. Symmetrising it we obtain the inequality we want. 16. For r = 1 Schur’s inequality yields a(a − b)(a − c) + b(b − c)(b − a) + c(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0, which can be rewritten as a3 + b3 + c3 + 3abc ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(a + c) + c2(a + b). 17. For all non-negative x1, x2, x3 by Muirheads theorem x(1,0,0) ≥ x( 2 3 , 1 3 ,0) ≥ x( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ). Hence 1 3(x1 + x2 + x3) ≥ 1 6 ( 3 √ x2 1x2 + 3 √ x2 1x3 + 3 √ x2 2x1 + 3 √ x2 2x3 + 3 √ x2 3x1 + 3 √ x2 3x2 ) ≥ 3√x1x2x3 or, after the substitution a = 3√x1, b = 3√x2, c = 3√x3, 2(a3 + b3 + c3) ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(a + c) + c2(a + b) ≥ 6abc. 18. Check that the given proof of Muirhead’s theorem works. 19. First we homogenise, obtaining a4 + b4 + c4 + a3(b + c) + b3(a + c) + c3(a + b) − 3abc(a + b + c) ≥ 0. We now note that a + b + c is a factor of the RHS and the inequality can be rewritten as (a + b + c)(a3 + b3 + c3 − 3abc) ≥ 0. Now we see that for c = −(a + b) the second bracket is zero, hence it is divisible by a + b + c. Finally we ﬁnd that the inequality can be written as (a + b + c) 2(a2 + b2 + c2 − ab − bc − ca) ≥ 0 in which form it is obvious. 21 10 Further Exercises 17.
