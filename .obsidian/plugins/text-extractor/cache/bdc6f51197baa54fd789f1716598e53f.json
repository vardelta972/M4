This is seen frequently with induction (or the equivalent “inﬁnite descent”). 2 Interpolation The most important result here is that if two polynomials of degree at at most n agree at n + 1 points, then they are identical. Suppose we have some pairwise distinct real numbers x0, x1, . . . , xn and some arbitrary real numbers y0, y1, . . . , yn. Then we can ﬁnd exactly one polynomial with real coeﬃcients such that f (xi) = yi for 0 ≤ i ≤ n. This polynomial is given by the Lagrange interpolation formula, which says f (x) = n∑ i=0 yi ∏ 0≤j≤n j̸=i x − xj xi − xj While it might not be obvious where to come up with this at ﬁrst glance, it should be clear that the polynomial takes on precisely the values advertised, and, by the ﬁrst fact stated, is the only such polynomial. 3 Problems 1. Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n. Knowing that P (k) = k k + 1 for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, ﬁnd P (m) for m > n. (Note: this problem or very simple variants appear at least three times per year on normal contests and seemingly no one can solve them in time. Know how to solve it). 2. A polynomial P (x) of degree n satisﬁes P (k) = 1/k for k = 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . , 2n. Find P (0). 3. Let a1, a2, ..., a100 and b1, b2, ..., b100 be 200 distinct real numbers. Consider an 100 × 100 table and put the number ai + bj in the (i, j) position. Suppose that the product of the entries in each column is 1. Prove that the product of the entries in each row is −1 4. Let α be a real number. Let Q be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients with minimal degree satisfying Q(α) = 0. (This is called the minimal polynomial of α.) If P a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients satisfying P (α) = 0, prove that Q|P . 5. A polynomial p of degree n satisﬁes p(k) = 2k for all 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Find its value at n + 1. 6. Let P be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Let n, k be integers with n > 0, and let P n be the n-fold application of P (that is, P ◦ P ◦ · · · ◦ P| {z } n ). Suppose that P n(k) = k. Prove that P 2(k) = k. 1 7. Let P (x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Prove that P (x) − x|P (P (x)) − x. 8. Let P (x), Q(x) be polynomials such that the points (P (1), Q(1)), (P (2), Q(2)), · · · , (P (n), Q(n)) are the vertices of a regular n-gon. Prove that at least one of P, Q has degree at least n − 1. 9. Let F1 = F2 = 1, Fn+2 = Fn + Fn+1 and let f be a polynomial of degree 990 such that f (k) = Fk for k ∈ {992, . . . , 1982}. Show that f (1983) = F1983 − 1. 10. Let f be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, and let p be a prime such that f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1, and f (k) is congruent to either 0 or 1 modulo p, for all positive integers k. Show that the degree of f is at least p − 1. 11. Prove that for any real number a we have the following identity: n∑ k=0(−1) k(n k )(a − k) n = n! 12. Let a, b, c, d ∈ R such that |ax 3 + bx 2 + cx + d| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [−1, 1]. Prove that |a| + |b| + |c| + |d| ≤ 7 13. Prove that for any real numbers x1, x2 . . . , xn ∈ [−1, 1] the following inequality is true: n∑ i=1 1 ∏ 1≤j≤n j̸=i |xi − xj| ≥ 2n−2 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
