The members of E are called hyperedges, or just edges for short. • An r-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph in which all edges have are r-subsets of V . Note that a 2-uniform hypergraph is just a graph. • If U ⊂ V , the sub-hypergraph H[U ] of H induced by U is the hypergraph with vertex set U , together with all edges of the original H which were completely contained within U . • An independent set in a hypergraph is a collection of vertices which induces no edges. 2 Problems and famous results 1. Let F be a collection of subsets A1, A2, . . . of {1, . . . , n}, such that for each i ̸= j, Ai ∩ Aj ̸= ∅. Prove that F has size at most 2 n−1. Solution: For each set S ∈ 2[n], observe that at most one of S and S is contained in F. 2. Suppose that F above has size exactly 2n−1. Must there be a common element x ∈ {1, . . . , n} which is contained by every Ai? Solution: No. First, observe that in [3], one can create an intersecting family with the four sets {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}, and {1, 2, 3}. Then for every n ≥ 3, one can blow up this construction by taking all sets S which are obtained by taking the union of one of these 4 sets together with an arbitrary subset of {4, . . . , n}. 3. (Sauer-Shelah.) A family F shatters a set A if for every B ⊂ A, there is F ∈ F such that F ∩ A = B. Prove that if F ⊂ 2 [n] and |F| > (n 0) + · · · + (n k), then there is a set A ⊂ [n] of size k + 1 such that F shatters A. Solution: Compressions: show that if a set family has no shattered subset of size t, then after compressing, it still has no shattered subset of size t. To visualize this, a shattered subset S of size t is speciﬁed by a collection of t elementary basis vectors in the hypercube, and the plane P determined by the 2 t vectors in their span. Now, consider the orthogonal complement of P , and imagine partitioning the entire hypercube into |P | ﬁbers, each of which is running orthogonally into P . The shattering means that each of the ﬁbers contains some point in the set family. Now a compression is a wind which blows in one dimension. If the wind blows orthogonally to P , and S is shattered, then it is clear that 1 S was also shattered before. Also, if the wind blows parallel to P , and S is now shattered, then it is also clear that S was shattered before. Therefore, we may assume that all compressions have been completed, and now if a set is in the family, all of its subsets are as well. This forces there to be a set of size k + 1. 4. (Erd˝os-Ko-Rado.) Let F be a collection of distinct r-subsets of [n], with the property that every pair of subsets A, B ∈ F intersects. Prove that |F| ≤ (n−1 r−1) whenever n ≥ 2r. 5. (Putnam 1956/A7.) Call an integer 0 ≤ r ≤ 1000 strange if the number of r-subsets of {1, . . . , 1000} is odd. Prove that the number of strange integers is a power of 2. (To make this an AIME problem: how many strange integers are there?) Solution: Lucas’s theorem: it is going to be 2 raised to the power which is equal to the number of 1’s in the binary expansion of 1000. 6. (From Peter Winkler.) The 53 MOPpers were divided into 7 teams for Team Contest 1. They were then divided into 6 teams for Team Contest 2. Prove that there must be a MOPper for whom the size of her team in Contest 2 was strictly larger than the size of her team in Contest 1. Solution: In Contest 1, suppose the team breakdown was s1 + · · · + s7 = 60. Then in the i-th team, with si people, say that each person did 1 si of the work. Similarly, in Contest 2, account equally for the work within each team, giving scores of 1 s′ i . However, the total amount of work done by all people in Contest 1 was then exactly 7, and the total amount of work done by all people in Contest 2 was exactly 6. So somebody must have done strictly less work in Contest 2. That person saw 1 s′ i < 1 si , i.e., the size of that person’s team on Contest 2 was strictly larger than her team size on Contest 1. 7. Let F be a collection of r-subsets of [n], and let t = |F|/n. Then there is always a set S ⊂ [n] of size at least n/(4t 1 r−1 ), which does not completely contain any member of F. 8. (Tur´an.) Let G be an n-vertex graph with average degree d. Then it contains an independent set of size at least n d+1 , and this is tight. 9. (Oddtown.) Let F be a collection of distinct subsets of 2[n] such that every A ∈ F has size which is nonzero modulo 2, but every pair of distinct A, B ∈ F has intersection size which is zero modulo 2. Prove that |F| ≤ n. 10. (Open.) What if 2 is replaced by 6? 11. (Folklore.) The chromatic number χ of a hypergraph H is the minimum integer k such that it is possible to assign a color from [k] to each vertex of H, with no edge having all of its vertices in the same color. Prove that if χ > 2, then H must have two edges which intersect in exactly one vertex. 12. (L.) An r-tree is an r-uniform hypergraph created in the following way: starting with a single hyperedge of size r, repeatedly add new hyperedges by selecting one existing vertex v, and adding r−1 new vertices, together with a new hyperedge through v and the r − 1 new vertices. Let T be an arbitrary r-tree with t edges. Observe that T will always have exactly 1 + (r − 1)t vertices. Prove that every r-uniform hypergraph H with chromatic number χ > t must contain T as a sub-hypergraph. 13. (TST 2005/1.) Let n be an integer greater than 1. For a positive integer m, let Xm = {1, 2, . . . , mn}. Suppose that there exists a family F of 2n subsets of Xm such that: (a) each member of F is an m-element subset of Xm; 2 (b) each pair of members of F shares at most one common element; (c) each element of Xm is contained in exactly 2 elements of F. Determine the maximum possible value of m in terms of n. Solution: Count in two ways: ∑ v (dv 2 ) = # set pairs intersect ≤ (2n 2 ) . But all dv = 2, so we have mn ≤ n(2n − 1), i.e., m ≤ 2n − 1. Equality is possible: take 2n lines in general position in R2, and let their (2n 2 ) = mn intersection points be the points. 14. (USAMO 2011/6.) Let X be a set with |X| = 225. Suppose further that there are eleven subsets A1, . . . , A11 of X such that |Ai| = 45 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 11 and |Ai ∩ Aj| = 9 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 11. Prove that |A1 ∪ · · · ∪ A11| ≥ 165, and give an example for which equality holds. Solution: The |X| = 225 condition is unnecessary. Count in two ways: ∑ v∈X ( dv 2 ) = (11 2 ) · 9 = 495 . But also ∑ v∈X dv = 11 · 45 = 495. This suggests that equality occurs when all dv = (dv 2 ), which is precisely at dv = 3. Indeed, by Cauchy-Schwarz, if we let Let n = |X|, we ﬁnd ( ∑ v∈X 1dv )2 ≤ ( ∑ v∈X 1 ) ( ∑ v∈X d 2 v ) 4952 ≤ n · 3 · 495 , where we deduced ∑ d 2 v = 3 · 495 from ∑ (dv 2 ) and ∑ dv. We conclude that n ≥ 165. For the construction, take 11 planes in general position in R3, and let their (11 3 ) = 165 points of intersection be the points in the set. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
