The number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n, is denoted by ϕ(n). This function is called Euler’s ϕ-function or Euler’s totient function. Let us denote Zn = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n−1} and by Z ∗ n the set of those nonzero numbers from Zn that are relatively prime to n. Then ϕ(n) is the number of elements of Z ∗ n, i.e., ϕ(n) = |Z ∗ n|. Example 1. Let n = 20. Then Z ∗ 20 = {1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19} and ϕ(20) = 8. Lemma 1. If n = pk, where p is prime, then ϕ(n) = pk − p k−1 = pk (1 − 1 p ) . Proof. It is easy to list all integers that are less than or equal to p k and not relatively prime to p k. They are p, 2p, 3p, . . . , pk−1 · p. We have exactly pk−1 of them. Therefore p k − pk−1 nonzero integers from Zn will be relatively prime to n. Hence ϕ(n) = p k − p k−1. An important consequence of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is that the function ϕ(n) is multiplicative in the following sense: Theorem 2. Let m and n be any two relatively prime positive integers. Then ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Proof. Let Z ∗ m = {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(m)} and Z ∗ n = {s1, s2, . . . , sϕ(n)}. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, for each pair (i, j), there exists a unique positive integer Nij such that 0 ≤ Nij < mn and ri = Nij (mod m), sj = Nij (mod n); that is, Nij has remainder ri on dividing by m, and remainder sj on dividing by n, or, in particular, for some integers a and b, Nij = am + ri, Nij = bn + sj. (1) As in the Euclidean algorithm, we notice that gcd(Nij, m) = gcd(m, ri) = 1 and gcd(Nij, n) = gcd(n, sj) = 1, that is Nij is relatively prime to m and also relatively prime to n. Since m and n are relatively prime, Nij is relatively prime to mn, hence Nij ∈ Z ∗ mn. Clearly, diﬀerent pairs (i, j) ̸= (k, l) yield diﬀerent numbers, that is Nij ̸= Nkl for (i, j) ̸= (k, l). Suppose now that a number N ̸= Nij for all i and j. Then r = N (mod m), s = N (mod n), 1 where either r does not belong to Z ∗ m or s does not belong to Z ∗ n. Assuming the former, we get gcd(r, m) > 1. But then gcd(N, m) = gcd(m, r) > 1 and N does not belong to Z ∗ mn. It shows that the numbers Nij and only they form Z ∗ mn. But there are exactly ϕ(m)ϕ(n) of the numbers Nij, exactly as many as the pairs (ri, sj). Therefore ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Theorem 3. Let n be a positive integer with the prime factorisation n = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . p αr r , where the pi are distinct primes and the αi are positive integers. Then ϕ(n) = n ( 1 − 1 p1 ) ( 1 − 1 p2 ) . . . (1 − 1 pr ) . Proof. We use Lemma 1 and Theorem 2 to compute ϕ(n): ϕ(n) = ϕ (pα1 1 ) ϕ (p α2 2 ) . . . ϕ (pαr r ) = pα1 1 (1 − 1 p1 ) pα2 2 ( 1 − 1 p2 ) . . . p αr r (1 − 1 pr ) = n ( 1 − 1 p1 ) ( 1 − 1 p2 ) . . . ( 1 − 1 pr ) . Example 2. ϕ(264) = ϕ(23 · 3 · 11) = 264 ( 1 2 ) ( 2 3 ) ( 10 11 ) = 80. 3 Congruences. Euler’s Theorem If a and b are integers we write a ≡ b mod m, and say that a is congruent to b modulo m, if a and b have the same remainder on dividing by m. For example, 41 ≡ 80 mod 13, 41 ≡ −37 mod 13, 41 ̸≡ 7 mod 13. Lemma 4. Let a and b be two integers and m is a positive integer. Then (a) a ≡ b mod m if and only if a − b is divisible by m. (b) If a ≡ b mod m and c ≡ d mod m, then a + c ≡ b + d mod m. (c) If a ≡ b mod m and c ≡ d mod m, then ac ≡ bd mod m. (d) If a ≡ b mod m and n is a positive integer, then a n ≡ bn mod m. (e) If ac ≡ bc mod m and c is relatively prime to m, then a ≡ b mod m. Proof. (a) By the division algorithm a = q1m + r1, 0 ≤ r1 < m, and b = q2m + r2, 0 ≤ r2 < m. Thus a − b = (q1 − q2)m + (r1 − r2), where −m < r1 − r2 < m. We see that a − b is divisible by m if and only if r1 − r2 is divisible by m but this can happen if and only if r1 − r2 = 0, i.e., r1 = r2. (b) is an exercise. (c) If a ≡ b mod m and c ≡ d mod m, then m|(a − b) and m|(c − d), i.e., a − b = im and c − d = jm for some integers i, j. Then ac − bd = (ac − bc) + (bc − bd) = (a − b)c + b(c − d) = icm + jbm = (ic + jb)m, whence ac ≡ bd mod m. 2 (d) Follows immediately from (c). (e) Suppose that ac ≡ bc mod m and gcd cm = 1. Then there exist integers u, v such that cu + mv = 1 or cu ≡ 1 mod m. Then by (c) a ≡ acu ≡ bcu ≡ b mod m and a ≡ b mod m as required. The property in Lemma 2 (e) is called the cancellation property. Theorem 5 (Fermat’s Little Theorem). Let p be a prime. If an integer a is not divisible by p, then a p−1 ≡ 1 mod p. Also a p ≡ a mod p for all a. Proof. Let a, be relatively prime to p. Consider the numbers a, 2a, ..., (p − 1)a. All of them have diﬀerent remainders on dividing by p. For suppose that for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p−1 we have ia ≡ ja mod p. Then by the cancellation property a can be cancelled and i ≡ j mod p, which is impossible. Therefore these remainders are 1, 2, ..., p − 1 and a · 2a · · · · · (p − 1)a ≡ (p − 1)! (mod p), which is (p − 1)! · a p−1 ≡ (p − 1)! (mod p). Since (p − 1)! is relatively prime to p, by the cancellation property ap−1 ≡ 1 mod p. When a is relatively prime to p, the last statement follows from the ﬁrst one. If a is a multiple of p the last statement is also clear. Theorem 6 (Euler’s Theorem). Let n be a positive integer. Then a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for all a relatively prime to n. Proof. Let Z ∗ n = {z1, z2, . . . , zϕ(n)}. Consider the numbers z1a, z2a, ..., zϕ(n)a. Both zi and a are relatively prime to n, therefore zia is also relatively prime to n. Suppose that ri is the remainder on dividing zia by n. Then gcd(ri, n) = gcd(zia, n) = 1, so ri ∈ Z ∗ n. These remainders are all diﬀerent. For suppose to the contrary that ri = rj for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then zia ≡ zja mod n; by the cancellation property, a can be cancelled and we get zi ≡ zj mod n, which is impossible. Therefore the remainders r1, r2, ..., rϕ(n) coincide with z1, z2, . . . , zϕ(n), apart from the order in which they are listed. Thus z1a · z2a · . . . · zϕ(n)a ≡ r1 · r2 · . . . · rϕ(n) ≡ z1 · z2 · . . . · zϕ(n) (mod n), which is Z · aϕ(n) ≡ Z (mod n), where Z = z1 · z2 · . . . · zϕ(n). Since Z is relatively prime to n it can be cancelled, giving a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 mod n. January 24, 2009 http://www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
