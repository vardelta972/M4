Here powers of x are non-negative integers and coeﬃcients come from any set of numbers: N, Z, Q, R, or C. For the expression to be unique, we take the leading coeﬃcient an ̸= 0 and the highest power of x (here, n) is called the degree of the polynomial (deg P ). The constant 0 is called zero-polynomial and degree of zero polynomial is undeﬁned. Basic Theorems and Results 1. Division algorithm for Polynomials: Given any polynomial A(x) and a non-zero polyno- mial B(x), there exist unique polynomials Q(x) and R(x) such that A(x) = B(x)Q(x) + R(x) with deg R < deg B. ◦ If A(x), B(x) are polymials with rational/real/complex coeﬃcients, then so are Q(x) and R(x). However, if A, B have integer coeﬃcients then it is not neccesary that Q, R have integer coeﬃcients. ◦ If A, B have integer coeﬃcients with leading coeﬃcient of B being ±1, then Q,R have integer coeﬃcients. 2. Divisibility: A polynomial A(x) is divisible by a polynomial B(x) if there exists a non-zero polynomial Q(x) such that A(x) = B(x)Q(x), and we write B(x)|A(x). This notation looks same as the notation for divisibility of integers, but meaning is diﬀerent. One trivial but useful fact is: Q(x)|P (x) ⇒ deg Q ≤ deg P. 3. Remainder Theorem: If P (x) is divided by (x − a), the remainder will be P (a). 4. Factor Theorem: If P (a) = 0 then (x − a) divides P (x). In other words, (x − a) appears as a factor in P (x). If P (a) = 0, We say that ‘x = a is a root of the equation P (x) = 0’ or that ‘x = a is a zero of the polynomial P (x).’ 5. For any polynomial P (x), we have a − b | P (a) − P (b). This result is very helpful when P (x) has integer coeﬃcients. 6. Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: Every polynomial P (x) of degree n with complex coeﬃcients has exactly n complex roots. It can be uniquely factorised as : P (x) = a(x − r1)(x − r2) . . . (x − rn). Note, roots r1, . . . , rn are not necessarily distinct, but all total n roots are there. 7. Vieta’s Formulas: Let P (x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with complex coeﬃcients (an ̸= 0) and suppose r1, . . . , rn are roots of P (x) = 0. Then ∑ 1≤k≤n rk = r1 + · · · + rn = −an−1 an , ∑ 1≤j<k≤n rjrk = r1r2 + r1r3 + · · · + rn−1rn = an−2 an etc. In general, for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, sum of the roots taken k at a time = (−1) k coeﬃcient of xn−k leading coeﬃcient . 8. If P (x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that P (0), P (1) are both odd integers then P (x) = 0 does not have any integer root. 9. Suppose P (x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients having a rational zero m/n where m, n are coprime integers, n ̸= 0. Then leading coeﬃcient is divisible by n and constant term is divisible by m. 10. If P (x) is a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients and a + √b is a root of P (x) = 0 then a − √b is also a root. Here a ∈ Z and b ∈ N such that √b is irrational. 11. If P (x) is a polynomial with real coeﬃcients and P (z) = 0 for some z ∈ C, then P (z) = 0. (Recall, if z = a + ib (a, b ∈ R) then z = a − ib. Also recall that z1 + z2 = z1 + z2, z1 · z2 = z1 · z2, zk = zk, and z · z = |z| 2.) 12. Any polynomial of odd degree with real coeﬃcients has at least one real root. Problems 1.
