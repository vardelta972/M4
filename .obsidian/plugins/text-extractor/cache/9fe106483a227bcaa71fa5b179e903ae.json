As 5n − 4 = 2011, Johnny has enough money to buy a playstation. 2. Yes, it is possible since 52 + 122 = 13 2. 3. Obviously x0 is also a root of the new quadratic. Therefore it has another real root x (which may coincide with x0 though). By Vieta’s theorem x0 + x = − 1 2(a1 + a2) = 1 2(x0 + x1 + x0 + x2). Hence x = 1 2(x1 + x2). 4. Answer: the second player wins. In his ﬁrst move the second player colours three squares close to one of the ends of the strip (left end on the picture below) in such a way as to leave only three uncoloured squares at that end. × × × Let us call those three uncloured squares “the reserve.” The ﬁrst player cannot make his move colouring the squares of the reserve, he must play elsewhere. The strategy of the second player is to make any moves outside the reserve until it is no longer possible. If it is not possible for the second player to make a move outside the reserve, then the ﬁrst player cannot make any move at all. At this moment the second player colours the squares of the reserve and wins. 5. Let ABCD be the given quadrilateral and K, L, M, N be the midpoints of AB, BC, CD, DA, respectively. Suppose that CK is the only one among eight line segments which is not equal to a.

Further, the right-angled triangles ALN and BN L are equal, hence AN = BL and AN LB is a rectangle. Similarly, DN LC is a rectangle and hence ABCD is a rectangle too. This now implies that right-angled triangles DKA and CKB are equal with CK = KD. This contradict our assumption that CK ̸= a. 6. We may assume that 2b = a + c. Then we may have one of these: 2 b = 1 a + 1 c , 2 a = 1 b + 1 c , 2 c = 1 a + 1 b . In the ﬁrst case, we have 2ac = ab+cb from which we obtain 4ac = (a+c) 2 or (a−c) 2, i.e. we obtain a = b = c and the numbers are not distinct. In the second case we have 2bc = ab + ac or (a + c)c = a(a + c)/2 + ac. This implies (a/c) 2 + a/c − 2 = 0 from which a/c = 1 or a/c = −2. In the second case we have a = −2c, b = −c/2. It is better to express the numbers in terms of b: we have c = −2b and a = 4b. The integer b can be arbitrary. For example, we have −2, 1, 4 and their reciprocals −1/2, 1/4, 1. 7. Substituting x = y we get f (x) = x2 + a/2, where a = f (0). Now substituting x = y = 0 we get a = 2a, hence a = 0. Hence f (x) = x2 is the only function that may satisfy the equation. Now we have to check that it indeed satisﬁes the equation: (x − y)2 = x2 + y2 − 2xy is indeed true. So the answer is: f (x) = x2. 8. Firstly, since a and b have the same sum of digits, they have the same remainders on division by 9, hence a − b must be divisible by 9, i.e. the sum of digits of a − b must be divisible by 9. However this sum of digits is n, so n ≥ 9. This value of n can be realised, for example, as follows: 9012345678 − 8901234567 = 111111111. 9. Let us drop perpendiculars IC1, IA1, IB1 from I onto AB, BC, CA, respectively. · I ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... .......................................................................... ................................................................................... ..................................................................................... .......................................................................... A B CB1 M N A1 K C1 L 2 These perpendiculars are equal in length. Moreover, AC1 = AB1 (as the two tangents to the incircle drawn from the same point) and similarly CA1 = CB1. The right-angled triangles IKB1 and IN A1 are equal since since IB1 = IA1 and ∠IKB1 = ∠IN A1. Thus we have B1K = A1N . Similarly, B1L = C1M . Thus AM + KL + CN = AM + M C1 + N A1 + CN = AC1 + CA1 = AB1 + CB1 = AC. 10. The ﬁrst player writes 5 in the upper left corner and divides the remaining numbers into pairs: (1, 8), (2, 7), (3, 6), (4, 9). Let us call these pairs selected. He also divides the table without the left upper corner square into four 1 × 2 dominoes A, B, C, D which contain squares a1, a2, b1, b2, c1, c2 and d1, d2, respectively. 5 a1 a2 b1 b2 c1 c2 d1 d2 If the second player writes a number in one of the dominoes, then the ﬁrst player ﬁnds a selected pair with this number, takes the other number of this pair and writes it down in the same domino. For example, if the second player writes 4 in d2, then the ﬁrst player writes 9 in d1. Let us explain why this strategy works. In three of the four selected pairs the sum of numbers is 9, let us call them good pairs, and only one pair is bad. At the end of the game there will be a good pair either in domino A or in domino D which will make either the sum in the ﬁrst row or the sum in the ﬁrst column equal to 14. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
