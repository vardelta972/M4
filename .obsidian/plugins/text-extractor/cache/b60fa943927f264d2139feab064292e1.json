First, we will treat symmetric polynomials and the fundamental Newton Identities. Then we will take a seemingly abrupt change of course by discussing the Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality. Understand that this lecture is driven primarily by the problems at the end, so you should be sure to solve them all on your own time. Each problem has appeared at least once – and usually multiple times – in math competitions, so you would do well to solve the problems and understand the algebraic techniques involved in their solution. 1 Symmetric Polynomials Symmetric polynomials are polynomials such that f (x, y) = f (y, x) for all x, y. The building blocks of the symmetric polynomials are the elementary symmetric polynomials σ1 = x + y σ2 = xy Likewise, for three variables, the elementary symmetric polynomials are σ1 = x + y + z σ2 = xy + yz + zx σ3 = xyz All power sums x k 1 + x k 2 + · · · + x k n can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials1. We can do this in the two-variable case by constructing a recurrence. Letting Tn(x, y) = x n + yn, we ﬁnd that Tn = x n + yn = (x + y)(x n−1 + yn−1) − xy(x n−2 + yn−2) = σ1Tn−1 − σ2Tn−2 Via a nearly identical argument, we ﬁnd the recurrence for Tn(x, y, z) to be Tn = σ1Tn−1 − σ2Tn−2 + σ3Tn−3. This is suggestive of a general rule – even more suggestive when we notice that this works for the one-variable case Tn = σ1Tn−1. Indeed, the “general rule” is one of the celebrated Newton Identities and ﬁnds applications in combinatorics, Galois theory, and even general relativity. 2 Cauchy-Schwarz Let a1, a2, . . . , an and b1, b2, . . . , bn be sequences of real numbers. Then the Cauchy-Schwarz in- equality states that (a1b1 + · · · + anbn) 2 ≤ (a 2 1 + · · · + a 2 n) (b2 1 + · · · + b2 n) 1In fact, we can do even better and claim the Fundamental Theorem of Symmetric Polynomials: every symmetric polynomial can be represented as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials. However, this is unnecessary for the purposes of this lecture. 1 If we write the sequences as n-dimensional vectors a = ⟨a1, . . . , an⟩ and b = ⟨b1, . . . , bn⟩, we get (a · b) 2 ≤ |a| 2 |b| 2 Equality holds if and only if a1/b1 = a2/b2 = · · · = an/bn, which is the same thing as saying that a and b are linearly dependent. For a quick proof, consider the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial P (x) = (a1x + b1) 2 + (a2x + b2) 2 + · · · + (anx + bn) 2 = ( n∑ k=1 a 2 k ) x 2 + ( 2 n∑ k=1 akbk ) x + ( n∑ k=1 b2 k ) Observe that P (x) is always nonnegative, so it has as most one real root. Thus, its discriminant is non-positive and the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality follows.

Note that when a Vieta bash exists, there is often a more elegant and less error-prone solutions using some basic calculus techniques.

Then the formal derivative of the polynomial P ′(x) is deﬁned to be P ′(x) = nanx n−1 + (n − 1)an−1x n−2 + · · · + a1 The Log Trick: Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be the zeros of the polynomial P (x). Then d dx (log P (x)) = P ′(x) P (x) = 1 x − x1 + 1 x − x2 + 1 x − x3 + · · · + 1 x − xn Sophie Germain Identity a 4 + 4b4 = (a 2 − 2ab + 2b2) (a 2 + 2ab + 2b2) 2 Brahmagupta’s Identity (a 2 + b2) (c 2 + d2) = (ac − bd) 2 + (ad + bc) 2 = (ac + bd) 2 + (ad − bc) 2 Lagrange Identity n∑ k=1 a 2 k n∑ k=1 b2 k − ( n∑ k=1 akbk )2 = ∑ i<k (aibk − akbi) 2 Crazy Complex Arctan: Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be the zeros of the polynomial P (x). Then arctan x1 + arctan x2 + · · · + arctan xn = Im [ln (iP (i))] as long as the sum on the left hand side of the equation is no larger than 2π.
