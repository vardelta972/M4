In addition, E must be on the opposite side of AD to B, since ABCDE is convex. Considering now the triangles BCD and BCE, we see that they have the same base BC, but the altitude of BCE is twice that of BCD. It follows that it has twice the area, as claimed. Solution: n = 1 or 11. It is enough to determine for which n there exist positive integers a, b with gcd(a, b) = 1 such that 9n âˆ’ 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
