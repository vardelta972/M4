Most of the problems on the handout are challenging, especially the last ones, so it is normal to spend more than 1-2 hours on them. Warm-Up: 1. Use Fermat’s Little Theorem. 2. Look at a speciﬁc prime p dividing both numbers. 3. Show d is even. 4. You are allowed to use ONLY Fermat’s Little Theorem and Lemma 4. 5. Use Lemma 4. For the second note, use Lemmas 4 and 5. 6. Use Fermat’s Little Theorem. 7. Use Fermat’s Little Theorem and the fact that numbers 22n + 1, 22m + 1 are coprime if m ̸= n. First Set of Problems: 1. This is a straightforward application of Lemma 5. 2. Try to look at (kp + b)i and (kp2 + b)i modulo p2 and modulo p3 by expanding. 3. Look at a2. What kind of a number is it? 4. The question is destroyed with Lemma 4. 5. Look at the smallest prime divisor of n. 6. Look at a prime dividing n. 7. Look at the smallest prime divisor of n. 8. Prove that 3 divides n. Now look at the second smallest prime divisor of n, and prove it does not exist. 9. Show that one of p, q, r must be even. 10. Let d = gcd(m, n). Then if b = ad then b − 1 and br − 1, where n = rd, have the same prime divisors. Now show that r cannot have an odd prime divisor. Show that if p|(b + 1) then p|br − 1. 1 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes: Hints and Solutions Alexander Remorov Second Set of Problems: 1. Use induction on the number of divisors, k. Show that that we can ﬁnd n with exactly k prime divisors so that n|(2n + 1) and there is a prime dividing 2n + 1 but not dividing n. 2. Look at an odd prime divisor of n. Use corollary 4. 3. What if we look at n7 + 27? Now work modulo 4. Useful Result 1 may be helpful. 4. Use induction on the number of divisors and something similar to corollary 4, but stronger, since you need 4 new divisors. 5. Show that if ap−1 − 1 is divisible by p2 then (p − a)p−1 − 1 is not. So if ap−1 − 1 is divisible by p2 then (a + 1)p−1 − 1 is not. Now get a contradiction by looking at speciﬁc numbers. 6. The answer is all primes. To rule out the composite numbers is not as hard; to prove it for primes look at a prime p dividing an + 1 a + 1 . 7. The answer is a power of a prime or 12. First deal with odd primes. Look at p, the smallest prime divisor of n and write n = pkm where p ̸ |m. Show that p + m − 1 is corpime with m and so is a power of p. For the highest power of 2 dividing n, use the same idea. 8. Show that pp − 1 p − 1 has a prime factor not congruent to 1 modulo p2. It is congruent to 1 modulo p from useful result 6. Now show this prime will solve the problem. 9. For a prime p, ﬁnd n so that p|(an − n). 10. Use useful result 7 and consider prime factorization of n. 11. Work modulo a prime. 12. Prove that x is even. Use corollaries 3 and 4. 2 Winter Camp 2010 Exponents and Primes: Hints and Solutions Alexander Remorov The solutions to almost all of the problems can be found on Art of Problem Solving. 1 IMO Problems, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/resources.php?c=1&cid=16 2 IMO ShortList, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/resources.php?c=1&cid=17 3 China TSTs, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/resources.php?c=37&cid=47 4 Russian Olympiads, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/resources.php?c=143&cid=61 5 USA TSTs, http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/Forum/resources.php?c=182&cid=35 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
