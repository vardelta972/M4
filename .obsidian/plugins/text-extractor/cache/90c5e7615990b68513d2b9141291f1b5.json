As well as being a useful tool, quoting it is a great way to intimidate people who are not familiar with it. To quote the diary notes (from the UKMT Yearbook) of the UK team leader for the ’05 IMO, when a ‘jury’ decides which questions will be used: ‘. . . many leaders don’t know the technique known as Muirhead’s inequality, and some of those who do seem to think that it is an advanced exotic technique . . . ’ ‘. . . it turns out that Muirhead’s inequality might be better known among the students than parts of the jury . . . ’ A good deal of the material for this article is taken from Inequalities by Hardy, Littlewood, P´olya, with examples culled from various sources. Majorisation Suppose we have two sequences of reals, (α1, . . . , αn) and (α′ 1, . . . , α′ n), which we refer to as (α) and (α′). We say that (α) majorises (α′), or equivalently that (α′) is majorised by (α), if the following conditions are met: • αi ≥ 0 ∀i, α′ j ≥ 0 ∀j • α1 + . . . + αn = α′ 1 + . . . + α′ n • If the elements of (α) and (α′) are arranged in descending order, then α1 + . . . + αi ≥ α′ 1 + . . . + α′ i 1 ≤ i ≤ n Note that there is no requirement that the αi, α′ i be integers. 1 If these conditions are satisﬁed then (α) majorises (α′), which we write as (α) ≻ (α′) For example: • (0, 3, 0) ≻ (1, 0, 2) • (4, 0, 0, 0) ⊁ (2, 0, 2) since the number of elements is diﬀerent • (5, 0, −1) ⊁ (2, 2, 0) since terms cannot be negative • (2, 1, 1, 1) ⊁ (1, 1, 1, 1) since 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 ̸= 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 • (4, 1, 1, 1) ⊁ (3, 3, 1, 0) since 4 + 1 ≱ 3 + 3 Symmetric Means Suppose we have n positive reals, xi and a sequence (α). Then we can construct a function F (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = xα1 1 xα2 2 . . . xαn n We can, of course, permute the xi to give, for example, F (x2, x1, . . . , xn) = xα1 2 xα2 1 . . . xαn n We denote the sum over all n! permutations of the xi by ∑!F (x1, x2, . . . , xn) Finally, we deﬁne the symmetric mean as [α] = 1 n! ∑!F (x1, x2, . . . , xn) Obviously, [α] is a function of x1, x2, . . . , xn. If we swap any of the xi, [α] is unchanged. That is why it is called a symmetric mean! For example: • If (α) = (0, 3, 1) then F (x1, x2, x3) = x3 2x3 • If (α) = (2, 1) then ∑ !F (x, y) = x2y + y2x 2 • If (α) = (1, 3, 2) then the symmetric mean [α] = 1 3!(x1x3 2x2 3 + x1x3 3x2 2 + x2x3 1x2 3 + x2x3 3x2 1 + x3x3 1x2 2 + x3x3 2x2 1) Muirhead’s Inequality Now that we have deﬁned majorisation and symmetric means, the state- ment of Muirhead’s inequality is easy: Muirhead’s Theorem: If (α) ≻ (α′) then [α] ≥ [α′]. There is equality if and only if (α) and (α′) are identical or all the xi are equal. For example: • For positive x, y, prove that 2(x5 + y5) ≥ (x2 + y2)(x3 + y3). Solution: We have: (5, 0) ≻ (3, 2) therefore by Muirhead’s inequality: 1 2!(x5 + y5) ≥ 1 2!(x3y2 + x2y3) so x5 + y5 ≥ x3y2 + x2y3 hence 2(x5 + y5) ≥ x5 + x3y2 + x2y3 + y5 = (x2 + y2)(x3 + y3) • BMO1 2002 Round 1 Q3: For positive real x, y, z such that x2 + y2 + z2 = 1 prove that x2yz + xy2z + xyz2 ≤ 1 3 Solution: We have (4, 0, 0) ≻ (2, 1, 1) and (2, 2, 0) ≻ (2, 1, 1) 3 therefore 2 3!(x4 + y4 + z4) ≥ 2 3!(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) and 2 3!(x2y2 + y2z2 + z2x2) ≥ 2 3!(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) i.e. x4 + y4 + z4 ≥ x2yz + xy2z + xyz2 and x2y2 + y2z2 + z2x2 ≥ x2yz + xy2z + xyz2 Adding the ﬁrst to twice the second gives: (x4 + y4 + z4) + 2(x2y2 + y2z2 + z2x2) ≥ 3(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) Rearranging: (x2 + y2 + z2) 2 ≥ 3(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) But x2 + y2 + z2 = 1, so 1 ≥ 3(x2yz + xy2z + xyz2) x2yz + xy2z + xyz2 ≤ 1 3 Exercises • BMO1 1996 Round 1 Q5: Let a, b and c be positive real numbers.
