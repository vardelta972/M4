In modular arithmetic, a residue of an integer a in modulo n is the unique value of 0 ≤ r ≤ n − 1 such that a = kn + r. In the context of division, a residue is simply a remainder. A residue class is a complete set of integers that are congruent modulo n for some positive integer n. In modulo n, there are exactly n diﬀerent residue classes, corresponding to the n possible residues {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , n − 2, n − 1}. Each residue class contains all integers in the form kn + r where r is the corresponding residue. Note that {kn + r : k ≥ 0} is an arithmetic progression. 2. A complete residue system modulo n is a set of integers which satisfy the following condition: Every integer is congruent to a unique member of the set modulo n. In other words, the set contains exactly one member of each residue class. Examples: {1, 2, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, and {9, 17, 85} are all Complete residue systems (mod 3). {k, k + 1, k + 2, k + 3, . . . , k + m − 1} is a complete residue system (mod m), for any integer k and positive integer m. Basically, any consecutive string of m integers forms a complete residue system (mod m). 3. A subset R of the integers is called a reduced residue system modulo n if every integer coprime to n is congruent to a unique member of the set R. We can easily see that, R is a reduced residue system modulo n if: (i) gcd(r, n) = 1 for each r in R, (ii) R contains ϕ(n) elements, and (iii) no two elements of R are congruent modulo n. A reduced residue system modulo n can be formed from a complete residue system modulo n by removing all integers not relatively prime to n. For example, a complete residue system modulo 12 is {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 10, 11}. Observe that 1, 5, 7 and 11 are the only integers in this set which are relatively prime to 12, and so the corresponding reduced residue system modulo 12 is {1, 5, 7, 11}. Note that it has ϕ(12) = 4 elements. Some other reduced residue systems modulo 12 are: {13, 17, 19, 23}, {−11, −7, −5, −1}, {−7, −13, 13, 31} etc. 4. Fermat’s theorem. Let p be a prime and a be an integer not divisible by p. Then, ap−1 − 1 is a multiple of p. Basic idea behind this is that {a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} is a complete residue system modulo p. So if we multiple these numbers modulo p, that will be same as multiplying {1, 2, . . . , p − 1}. Thus, a × 2a × · · · × (p − 1)a ≡ 1 × 2 × · · · × (p − 1) (mod p), which implies (p − 1)!ap−1 ≡ (p − 1)! (mod p) =⇒ ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). 5. Euler’s theorem. Let n be a any positive integer and a be an integer coprime to n. Then aϕ(n) − 1 is a multiple of n. 1 Instead of complete residue system, we consider a reduced residue system here. Suppose {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n. You can in fact show that {ar1, ar2, . . . , arϕ(n)} is also a reduced residue system modulo n iﬀ a is coprime to n. Then, multiplying the elements of the last set modulo n is same as multiplying the elements of the former. Hence, ar1×ar2×· · ·×arϕ(n) ≡ r1 × r2 × · · · × rϕ(n) (mod n), which yields aϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). 6. Bezout’s theorem. For any two integers a, b (not both zero), we can express their gcd as a linear combination of themselves, i.e. there exists integers x, y such that gcd(a, b) = ax + by. The existence of such integers x, y follows from the Euclidean algorithm that we use to ﬁnd gcd(a, b). Note, x, y need not be unique. In fact, if x0, y0 is a solution of the equation then x = x0 + bt, y = y0 − at will also be a solution for any integer t. 7. Special case: when a, b are coprime, Bezout’s theorem tells us that ax + by = 1 for some integers x, y. The converse is also true: if there exist integers x, y such that ax + by = 1, then you can show that a, b must be coprime. This gives us the idea of modular inverse. 8. Modular inverse. Suppose n is a positive integer. A number a′ is said to be an inverse of a modulo n if aa′ = 1 (modn). It is easy to show that a has an inverse modulo n iﬀ a is coprime to n. Furthermore, the inverse a′ is unique modulo n. Example: 2 × 3 ≡ 1 (mod 5), so 2 and 3 are inverses of each other modulo 5. 9. Wilson’s theorem. Suppose p is a prime. Then, (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). Proof. The positive integers {1, 2, . . . , p − 1} are coprime to p, so each of them has an inverse modulo p. Note that a2 ≡ 1 (mod p) iﬀ a = 1 or p − 1. Therefore each of the numbers {2, 3, . . . , p − 2} has an inverse diﬀerent from themselves, and its not hard to see that no two of them will have the same inverse. Therefore, we can pair them up as {a, b} such that ab ≡ 1 (mod p). Multiplying the pairs, we get (p − 2)! ≡ 1 (mod p), which yields (p − 1)! ≡ p − 1 ≡ −1 (mod p). □ In fact, we can show that n | (n − 1)! + 1 ⇐⇒ n is a prime. 10. Let p be an odd prime. Then, (i) p | n 2 + 1 for some n only if p ≡ 1 mod 4. (ii) If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then there exists some n such that p | n 2 + 1. Proof. (i) Use Fermat’s theorem. (ii) Use Wilson’s theorem. 11. Chinese Remainder theorem. Suppose we are seeking integer x satisfying x = a (mod m) and x = b (mod n). The theorem says that if m, n are coprime then there exists such x and it is in fact unique modulo mn.
