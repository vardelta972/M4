However, the might of the arithmetic in Q is bounded. Thus, some polynomials, although they have zeros, cannot be factorized into polynomials with rational coefﬁcients. Nevertheless, such polynomials can always be factorized in a wider ﬁeld. For instance, the polynomial x2 + 1 is irreducible over Z or Q, but over the ring of the so called Gaussian integers Z[i] = {a + bi | a, b ∈ Z} it can be factorized as (x + i)(x − i). Sometimes the wider ﬁeld retains many properties of the rational numbers. In particular, it will turn out that the Gaussian integers are a unique factorization domain, just like the (rational) integers Z. We shall ﬁrst discuss some basics of higher algebra. Deﬁnition 1. A number α ∈ C is algebraic if there is a polynomial p(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 with integer coefﬁcients such that p(α) = 0. If an = 1, then α is an algebraic integer. Further, p(x) is the minimal polynomial of α if it is irreducible over Z[x] (i.e. it cannot be written as a product of nonconstant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients). Example 1. The number i is an algebraic integer, as it is a root of the polynomial x2 + 1 which is also its minimal polynomial. Number √ 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com The theme of this text are extensions of the ring Z of degree 2, so called quadratic extensions. Thus, for example, the polynomials x2 + 1 and x2 + x + 1 determine the extensions Z[i] and Z[ω], where ω = −1 + √ Duˇsan Djuki´c: Arithmetic in Extensions of Q 3 Deﬁnition 4. An element y of a quadratic ring K is adjoint to element x (denoted y ∼ x) if there exists a unit ε such that y = εx. Deﬁnition 5. A nonzero element x ∈ K which is not a unit is prime if it has no other divisors but the units and elements adjoint to itself. We have the following simple proposition. Theorem 3. Let x ∈ K. If N(x) is a prime, then x is prime. Proof. Suppose that x = yz, y, z ∈ K. Then N(x) = N(y)N(z), so at least one of N(y), N(z) equals ±1, i.e. either y or z is a unit, while the other is (by deﬁnition) adjoint to x. 2 The converse does not hold, as 3 is a prime in Z[i], but N(3) = 9 is composite. Of course, the elements conjugate or adjoint to a prime are also primes. Therefore the smallest positive rational integer divisible by a prime z equals z 4 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Proof. If the division with remainder is possible in K, then the Euclidean algorithm ends in a ﬁnite number of steps. A simple implication of the Euclidean algorithm is that if p is a prime, a, b ∈ K and p | ab, then p | a or p | b. The uniqueness of factorization into primes (FTA) now easily follows. 2 There are quadratic rings in which FTA holds despite the nonexistence of a division with remain- der. However, FTA is an exception rather than a rule. Example 5. FTA is false in Z[ √ Duˇsan Djuki´c: Arithmetic in Extensions of Q 5 Solution. We use the following important fact: If m, n, p, q are elements of a unique factorization domain K (in this case, K = Z[i]) satisfying mn = pq, then there exist u1, u2, v1, v2 ∈ K such that m = u1v1, n = u2v2, p = u1v2, q = u2v1. The proof of this fact is the same as in the case of m, n, p, q ∈ Z and follows directly from the factorizations of m, n, p, q into primes. Since xy = z 2 + 1 = (z + i)(z − i), the above fact gives us x = u1v1 (1), y = u2v2 (2), z + i = u1v2 (3), z − i = u2v1 (4) for some u1, u2, v1, v2 ∈ Z[i]. The numbers x, y are real, and therefore v1 = q1 6 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Proof. Suppose that x, y, z are nonzero elements of Z[ω] that satisfy (∗). We can assume w.l.o.g. that x, y, z are pairwise coprime. Consider the number ρ = 1 − ω. It is prime, as its norm equals (1 − ω)(1 − ω2) = 3.
