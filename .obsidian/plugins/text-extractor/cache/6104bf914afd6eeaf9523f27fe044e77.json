If P (x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, then a − b | P (a) − P (b) for any integers a and b. Proof: Suppose that P (x) = c0 + c1x + c2x2 + · · · + cnxn. Observe that P (a) − P (b) = c1(a − b) + c2(a 2 − b2) + c3(a3 − b3) + · · · + cn(an − bn). We know that a − b | ak − bk for every k ≥ 1. [Why? a = b (mod a − b) =⇒ ak = bk (mod a − b) =⇒ a − b | ak − bk.] Since c1, c2, . . . , cn are integers, P (a) − P (b) = c1(a − b) + c2(a2 − b2) + · · · + cn(an − bn) will be a multiple of a − b. □ The fact a − b | P (a) − P (b) is really important for problems involving polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Fact. Suppose that P (x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that P (0) and P (1) are both odd. Show that the equation P (x) = 0 cannot have an integer root. Solution: Let, if possible, m be an integer root of P (x) = 0, i.e., P (m) = 0. We know that for any two integers a and b, a − b divides P (a) − P (b). Here, m − 0 | P (m) − P (0) and m − 1 | P (m) − P (1). Since P (m) = 0, we get that m | P (0) and m − 1 | P (1). Now one among m − 1 and m must be even and that cannot divide an odd number, so we get a contradiction here. Alternate way: m − 1 and m being coprime, we get from the above that m(m − 1) divides P (0)P (1). But m(m − 1) is even and P (0)P (1) is odd, so we get a contradiction. Next we shall learn one more theorem, which more or less completes our bag of tools, for now. Theorem. (Rational root theorem) Let A(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose that x = p/q is a rational root of the equation A(x) = 0, where p and q are coprime integers. We shall show that p | a0 and q | an. Proof: Since p/q is a root of the equation A(x) = 0, we have an (p q )n + an−1 ( p q )n−1 + · · · + a1 ( p q ) + a0 = 0 or, anpn + an−1pn−1q + · · · + a1pqn−1 + a0qn = 0. 1 All the terms except the last one contains p as a factor. We write the above equation as −a0qn = anpn + an−1pn−1q + · · · + a1pqn−1, which will tell us that p | a0qn. Since p and q are coprime, this implies that p | a0. Similarly, q | anpn, which gives q | an. We shall remember this theorem as follows: If p q (in reduced form) is a rational root, then q divides the leading coeﬃcient and p divides the constant term. Corollary. If P (x) is a monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients then any rational root of P (x) must be an integer. (Proof: If p/q (in reduced form) is a rational root, then the rational root theorem tells us that q | 1, which implies that p/q is an integer.) Try the following problems. 1. Suppose P (x) is a polynomial with P (2) = 2017 and P (5) = 2002. If it is given that P (x) = 0 has exactly one integer root, ﬁnd that root. Solution: Let m ∈ Z be the desired root of P (x) = 0. We know that for an integer polynomial P (x), it holds that a − b | P (a) − P (b) for every a, b ∈ Z. Using this, we get that m − 2 | P (m) − P (2) =⇒ m − 2 | 2017 . Similarly, m − 5 | P (m) − P (5) =⇒ m − 5 | 2002 . Since 2017 is a prime, the ﬁrst condition gives m − 2 = ±1, ±2017, which gives m − 5 = −4, −2, 2014, −2020. Only of them satisﬁes the second condition (that m − 5 | 2002), namely m − 5 = −2, or, m = 3. (Answer) 2. Find all rational roots of the equation 2x10 − 66x6 − 135 = 3x9 − 99x5 − 90x. Solution: First observe that the equation can be factorized as (2x − 3)(x9 − 33x5 + 45) = 0. (∗) We can see that x = 3/2 is a rational root. For the second factor in (∗), namely the polynomial p(x) = x9 −33x5 +45, we can apply the rational root theorem to conclude that every rational zero of p(x) must be an integer. Note that p(0) = 45 and p(1) = 1−33+45 both are odd. And we know that if an integer polynomial p(x) has the property that p(0) and p(1) are both odd, then p(x) cannot have any integer zero. Therefore, the equation (∗) has only one rational root, namely 3/2. (Answer) 2 Some more problems 3. The product of two of the four roots of the equation x4 − 18x3 + kx2 + 200x − 1984 = 0 is −32. Determine the value of k. Solution: Let the roots be a, b, c, d, such that ab = −32. Applying Vieta’s theorem, we get the following relations: a + b + c + d = 18, ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = k, abc + bcd + cda + dab = −200, abcd = −1984. First, cd = −1984/ab = 62. Next, from the third relation, ab(c + d) + cd(a + b) = −200 which gives −32(c + d) + 62(a + b) = −200. And we also have (c + d) + (a + b) = 18. Solving these two equations, we get c + d = 14, and a + b = 4. Finally, from the second relation we get k = ab + cd + (a + b)(c + d) = · · · = 86. 4. Given a polynomial f (x) with integer coeﬃcients whose value is divisible by 3 for three integers k, k + 1, and k + 2, prove that f (m) is divisible by 3 for all integers m. Solution: First let us ﬁx an integer m. Our goal is to show that 3 | f (m). All we know about f is that it has integer coeﬃcients and f (k), f (k + 1), f (k + 2) are all multiples of 3, for some integer k. Since k, k + 1, k + 2 are three consecutive integers, their remainders upon division by 3 are {0, 1, 2} (in some order), so one of them should match with m, modulo 3. Let that candidate be a. Then we have m ≡ a (mod 3) and 3 | f (a). Now m − a | f (m) − f (a) and 3 | m − a, so 3 | f (m) − f (a). Since 3 | f (a), we conclude that 3 | f (m). □ 5. Suppose that the roots of the equation x4 + ax3 + bx2 + ax + c = 0 are α1, α2, α3, and α4. Show that (α2 1 + 1)(α2 2 + 1)(α2 3 + 1)(α2 4 + 1) = (1 − b + c) 2. Solution: Since α1, α2, α3, α4 are the roots of the equation p(x) = 0 where p(x) = x4 + ax3 + bx2 + ax + c, we can say that p(x) = (x − α1)(x − α2)(x − α3)(x − α4). (1) Now the key idea is to write α2 + 1 = α2 − i2 = (α − i)(α + i). Using this idea, we have 4∏ j=1(α2 j + 1) = 4∏ j=1(α2 j − i2) = 4∏ j=1(αj − i) 4∏ j=1(αj + i) = 4∏ j=1(i − αj) 4∏ j=1(−i − αj). Using (1) we can say that the last expression equals p(i)p(−i), which equals (1 − b + c) 2 (because i2 + 1 = 0). 3 6. If x1, x2, . . . , x2020 are the zeros of P (x) = x2020 + 2020x − 1, ﬁnd the value of x1 x1 − 1 + x2 x2 − 1 + · · · + x2020 x2020 − 1. Solution: For the sake of brevity let me write n instead of 2020. Let us denote yi = xi xi−1, i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Using the given polynomial P (x), we shall ﬁnd a polynomial whose roots are y1, . . . , yn, then we just have to ﬁnd its sum of roots. Note that yi = xi xi − 1 ⇐⇒ xi = yi yi − 1 , so P (xi) = 0 implies that P ( yi yi − 1 ) = 0. Therefore, y1, . . . , yn are the roots of the equation P ( y y − 1 ) = 0, or, ( y y − 1 )n + n ( y y − 1 ) − 1 = 0 or, yn + ny(y − 1) n−1 − (y − 1) n = 0 or, ny(yn−1 − (n − 1)yn−2 + · · · ) + (nyn−1 − · · · ) = 0 Note that the leading term of this polynomial equation is nyn and the coeﬃcient of yn−1 is n(−(n − 1) + 1) = −n(n − 2). Now the required sum is just the sum of the roots of the above polynomial, which is found (using Vieta’s theorem) to be (n − 2) = 2018. 7. Suppose that p(x) is a cubic polynomial such that the graph of y = p(x) passes through the points A(2, 4), B(3, 9) and C(4, 16). The lines AB, BC, and CA intersect the graph again at points D, E, F respectively. If the sum of the x-coordinates of D, E, F be 24, ﬁnd p(0). Solution: It is given that p(2) = 4, p(3) = 9 and p(4) = 16. Consider the polynomial p(x) − x2. We see that 2, 3, 4 are the roots of this new polynomial, which is also cubic, so we can say that p(x) − x2 = a(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4) for some constant a. In order to ﬁnd p(0), we have to ﬁnd the value of a. Let d, e, f be respectively the x-coordinates of the points D, E, F. Since AB passes through D, the slope of BD must be same as the slope of AB. This gives p(d) − p(3) d − 3 = p(3) − p(2) 3 − 2 =⇒ d 2 + a(d − 2)(d − 3)(d − 4) − 3 2 d − 3 = 3 2 − 2 2 3 − 2 =⇒ d + 3 + a(d − 2)(d − 4) = 3 + 2 =⇒ d − 4 = −1/a. Similarly, for e, f we would get e − 2 = f − 3 = −1/a. (check!) Now it is given that d + e + f = 24, hence d − 4 + e − 3 + f − 2 = −3/a =⇒ a = −1/5, and thus p(0) = a(−2)(−3)(−4) = 24/5 . 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
