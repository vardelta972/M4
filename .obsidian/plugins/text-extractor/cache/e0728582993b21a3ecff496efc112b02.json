A graph G is k-connected i\u000b jV (G)j \u0015 k + 1 and for every X ˆ V (G) with jXj < k, G n X is connected. De\fnition 1.2. The line graph L(G) of a graph G is the graph with V (L(G)) = E(G), with an edge for for every pair of incidences of two edges of G on the same vertex of G. De\fnition 1.3. A graph G is k-edge-connected i\u000b its line graph is k-connected. Alternately, G is k-edge-connected i\u000b for every X ˆ E(G) with jXj < k, G n X is connected. De\fnition 1.4. A separation of G is a pair (A; B) of subsets of V (G) with A [ B = V (G), such that there is no edge between A n B and B n A. Its order is jA \\ Bj. 2 Matchings 1. (K onig's Theorem) Let G be bipartite, and k \u0015 0 an integer. Then G has a matching of size at least k unlesss there exists X ˆ V (G) with jXj < k such that X meets every edge of G. 2. Let G be a loopless graph in which every vertex has positive degree. Let X be the largest matching in G, and let Y be the smallest set of edges of G whose union contains V (G). Show that jXj + jY j = jV (G). 1 3. (Tutte's Theorem) Let odd(X) be the number of components of X with an odd number of vertices. Then G has a perfect matching unlesss there exists X ˆ V (G) with odd(G n X) > jXj. 4. Show that every 2-edge-connected cubic graph has a perfect matching. 5. Let G be a d-regular bipartite graph. Show that E(G) can be partitioned into perfect matchings. 3 Other Problems De\fnition 3.1. A circulation on a digraph is an assignment of real weights to its edges such that the di\u000berence between every vertex's inedges' and outedges' weights is 0. An s-t \row is similar, but vertices s and t are allowed to have that di\u000berence nonzero; that di\u000berence is called the \row's total value. 1. Let s and t be vertices of a digraph G, and let ' be a real-valued s-t \row. Show that there's an integer-valued s-t \row with total value at least that of ' such that 8e 2 E(G), j (e) \u0000 '(e)j < 1. 2. (Menger's Theorem) Let Q; R ˆ V (G), and let k \u0015 0. Then there are k pairwise vertex-disjoint paths from Q to R unless there's a separation (A; B) of G of order < K with Q ˆ A and R ˆ B. 3. (Dirac/Posa) If G is simple, jV (G)j \u0015 3, and for all fu; vg ˆ V (G), either u is adjacent to v or deg(u) + deg(v) \u0015 n, then G has a Hamiltonian cycle. 4. (Erd}os) If G is a graph with no stable set of size t, then there's a graph H with V (G) = V (H) and at most t \u0000 1 components, each of which is a complete graph, such that 8v; degH (v) \u0014 degG(v). 5. (Bipartite Ramsey) Let s; t \u0015 1 and let G be a simple graph with a bipartition (A; B) such that jAj = jBj \u0015 \u0000s+t s \u0001 \u0000 1. Show that G has a Ks;s or Kt+t subgraph. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
