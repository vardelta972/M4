Factorization Example 1. Solve the equation 2^x +1 = y^2 for integers x and y. Solution. No solution for x < 0 and it is enough to consider y > 0. For x = 0, we have no solution. So now let x > 0, y > 0. Now factorize: 2^x = (y+1)(y-1). This implies both y+1 and y-1 must be some power of 2 (including 2^0). Let y+1 = 2^a, and y-1 = 2^b. Then, 2 = (y+1) - (y-1) = 2^a - 2^b = 2^b (2^(a-b) - 1). This implies b = 1 and a - b = 1, so a = 2. Hence x = a + b = 3 and that gives y = ±3. Ans: (x, y) = (3, ±3). The following facts are often used: 1. If two numbers a and b are coprime and their product ab is a perfect k-th power then each of them has to be perfect k-th powers. 2. If ab = p^k where p is a prime, then each of a, b must be powers of p. Another fact which is rarely used, but important: (Four numbers theorem) If ab = cd for some positive integers a, b, c, d, then we must have a = xy, c = xz, d = wy, b = wz for some positive integers w, x, y, z. [a/c = d/b = y/z (reduced form). Then, a = xy, c = xz, d = wy, b = wz.] 2. Consider modulo something. Usually, we first try modulo 3, 4, 5, 8. If cubes are present, try mod 7 or 9. But sometimes considering the equation modulo other integers are also helpful. Example 2. Solve y^2 = x^5 - 4 for integers x, y. Solution. x^10 = 0 or 1 (mod 11) => x^5 = -1, 0 or 1 (mod 11). [Since 11 | n^2 -1 = (n-1)(n+1) => 11 | n-1 or n+1. Take n = x^5 here.] Now x^5 = -1, 0 or 1 (mod 11) => x^5 - 4 = -5, -4, or -3 (mod 11). But y = 0, ±1, ±2, ··· , ±5 (mod 11) => y^2 = 0, 1, 4, 9, 5, 3 (mod 11). Therefore the given equation has no solution. 3. Give bounds/use inequalities. Example 3. Find all pairs of positive integers x, y satisfying the equation x^3 - y^3 = xy + 61. Solution. First note that, we must have x > y. Let x = y + a. Putting this into the equation we get 3ay^2 + 3ya^2 + a^3 = y^2 + ay + 61. Rewriting it as y^2 (3a - 1) + ay (3a - 1) + a^3 = 61, we can say that a^3 < 61 => a ≤ 3. Therefore a = 1, 2, or 3. Note, we can in fact write the equation as (y^2 + ay)(3a - 1) + a^3 = 61. Page of 1 5 When a = 1, y^2 + y = 30 => y = 5, -6. Since y > 0, so y = 5. And the corresponding value for x is x = y + a = 6. When a = 2, (y^2 + 2y)*5 + 8 = 61. No solution. When a = 3, (y^2 + 3y)*8 + 27 = 61. No solution. Therefore, x = 6 and y = 5 is the only solution. Another approach: First factorize x^3 - y^3 as (x-y)(x^2 + xy + y^2). Then use the inequality x^2 + y^2 ≥ 2xy to show that x-y ≤ 3. Needless to say, the above ideas are just some basic approaches by which one should start to think. In an olympiad problem, they are often used together, along with other approaches like viewing an equation as linear or quadratic in some variable, using Fermat or Euler’s theorem, or occasionally using tools like Vieta Jumping or Infinite Descent. II. Solving some Olympiad problems Example 4. Find all positive integers such that |3^x - 2^y| = 1. First, consider the equation 3^x = 2^y + 1. Considering mod 3, 3^x = 0 (mod 3) and 2^y +1 = (-1)^y + 1 (mod 3). We conclude that y must be odd. If y = 1 then we have a valid solution for x, namely x = 1. If y ≥ 3, then we can consider modulo 4. Because for y ≥ 3, we have 2^y + 1 = 1 (mod 4) and 3^x = (-1)^x (mod 4). Hence x must be even. So we got x even, y odd. Now what? 3^x - 1 = 2^y. Since x is even, we can factorise the LHS as (3^k -1)(3^k +1) [where x=2k]. Let 3^k +1 = 2^a, 3^k -1 = 2^b (where a+b = y). 2 = 2^a - 2^b => a = 2, b = 1 => y = 3 => x = 2. This is another valid solution. This completes the hunt for this equation. Next, 3^x = 2^y -1. Considering mod 3, we get y is even. Let y = 2k. 3^x = (2^k -1)(2^k +1) => 2^k -1 = 3^a, 2^k +1 = 3^b (here a, b ≥ 0, and a+b = x) => 3^b - 3^a = 2 => b = 1, a = 0 => k = 1 => y = 2 => x = 1, which is the only valid solution. All solutions: (x, y) = (1, 1), (2, 3), (1, 2). Another way to solve 3^x +1 = 2^y: work modulo 8 to find that 3^x + 1 is 2 or 4 (mod 8). But 2^y would be 0 (mod 8) if y > 2. Hence y = 1 or 2. And from the original equation we get a valid choice of x only for y = 1. Example 5. Find all positive integer solutions of 3^x + 4^y = 5^z. Solution. First try to see the parity of x, z. Considering modulo 4, we get that 3^x = 1 (mod 4) => x must be even. Page of 2 5 Considering modulo 3, we get 5^z = (-1)^z = 1(mod 3) => z even too. One possible approach: x = 2a, z = 2c. Then write the equation as (3^a)^2 + (2^y)^2 = (5^c)^2 and consider them as a pythagorean triple. Result. All integer solutions of the equation x^2 + y^2 = z^2, where x is odd and y is even (w.l.o.g) are given by: x = (r^2 - s^2)t, y = 2rst, and z = (r^2 + s^2)t, where r and s are coprime and have different parity, and t is any integer. Here, 3^a = r^2 - s^2, 2^y = 2rs, 5^c = r^2 + s^2. Although this does not immediately finish the problem, you can fill in the remaining details. Another approach (perhaps easier): 2^(2y) = 5^z - 3^x = (5^c)^2 - (3^a)^2 => both 5^c + 3^a and 5^c - 3^a must be powers of 2 => 5^c + 3^a = 2^m, and 5^c - 3^a = 2^n (where m, n ≥ 0, m+n=2y) => 2 * 3^a = 2^m - 2^n = 2^n (2^(m-n) - 1) [this red part is odd!] => n = 1, and 3^a = 2^(m-1) -1. We solved the equation 3^a = 2^b -1 just now. Recall that only solution of this equation was a = 1 and b = 2. So in this problem, a = 1, and m - 1 = 2 => m = 3. Thus m = 3, n = 1, hence 2y = m + n => y = 2. Also, a = 1 => x = 2a = 2. Therefore 3^2 + 4^2 = 5^z => z = 2. So x=y=z=2 is the only solution to the given equation. Example 6. Find all positive integers x, y such that x + y^2 + z^3 = xyz, where z is the gcd of x and y. Solution. Since z = gcd(x, y), we can let x = za, y = zb where a, b are coprime. Plugging this in the given equation, and cancelling one factor of z, we get a + zb^2 + z^2 = z^2ab => z | a. Let a = zc. Then, we get c + b^2 + z = z^2 bc. Note, here b and c are coprime. This equation is quadratic in z or b, but a linear equation in c. First let us consider it as the linear eqn. in c. We get b^2 + z = c (bz^2 -1) => c = (b^2 +z)/(bz^2 -1). This is all what we need to solve now. Idea: (informal) if z is large enough then it is possible that bz^2 -1 will be greater than b^2 +z, which makes the last equation impossible. Can we try to find an upper bound for z? So, we want bz^2 -1 > b^2 + z, except for few small values of z. How can we get that? Idea: If m, n are natural numbers then mn + 1 ≥ m + n. [since (m-1)(n-1) ≥ 0.] Here, (b-1)(z^2 - 1) ≥ 0 => bz^2 + 1 ≥ z^2 +b. (Equality holds for z = 1 or for b = 1). So, for b > 1 and z > 1 we have bz^2 + 1 > z^2 +b. Can we have z^2 +b ≥ b^2 +z? (Because we need to relate bz^2 with b^2+z.) Page of 3 5 This z^2 +b ≥ b^2 + z is equivalent to (z-b)(z+b-1) ≥ 0, which holds when z ≥ b. Can we somehow have z ≥ b? Observe that cz^2 = (b^2 z^2 +z^3)/(bz^2 -1) = (b·bz^2 +z^3)/(bz^2 -1), implying cz^2 = (b(bz^2 -1) + b+z^3)/(bz^2 -1) = b + (b+z^3)/(bz^2 -1). This yields bz^2 -1 | b +z^3 => bz^2 -1 ≤ b+z^3 => b(z^2 - 1) ≤ z^3 +1. Now if b ≥ z+1, then we get z^3 +1 ≥ b(z^2 -1) ≥ (z+1)(z^2 -1) = z^3 + z^2 -z -1. => z^3 +1 ≥ z^3 + z^2 -z -1 => 0 ≥ z^2 - z -2 = (z+1)(z-2). This clearly does not hold if z > 2. Conclusion: For z > 2, we have z ≥ b. Easier way to prove the above observation: We have b ≤ (z^3 + 1)/(z^2 -1) = (z^2 - z+1)(z-1) = z + 1/(z-1) ≤ z +1/2, for z ≥ 3. Since b is an integer, this implies b ≤ z for z > 2. Combining the lines coloured red: For z > 2, we have z ≥ b. Earlier we had shown that bz^2 + 1 > z^2 +b, for z, b > 1 and we have z^2 +b ≥ b^2 + z, since z ≥ b. The last two inequalities yield b^2 + z < bz^2 +1, provided b > 1. From b^2 + z < bz^2 +1, we can say that either b^2 + z = bz^2, which is impossible; or b^2 + z ≤ bz^2 -1, which yields c = (b^2 + z)/(bz^2 -1) ≤ 1 => c = 1. It just remains to check the following cases one by one: c = 1, or b = 1, or z = 1, or z = 2. Our main equation is c = (b^2 +z)/(bz^2 -1) When z = 1, the equation gives c = (b^2 +1)/(b-1), which can be written as c = b + 2/(b-1) and hence b = 2 or b = 3. The corresponding solutions are (x, y) = (5, 2) and (5, 3). When z = 2, the equation gives c = (b^2 +2)/(4b-1). We may rewrite it as 16c = 4b + 1 + 33/(4b-1), which gives b = 1 or b = 3. The corresponding solutions are (x, y) = (4, 2) and (4, 6). When b = 1, the equation gives c = (1 + z)/(z^2 -1) = 1/(z-1), which is possible only when z = 2 and c = 1. This goes back to the previous case (where z = 2 and b = 1) and gives the solution (x, y) = (4, 2). When c = 1, the equation c = (b^2 +z)/(bz^2 -1) gives b^2 +z = bz^2 -1. Since we already considered the cases z ≤ 2 or b = 1, let us take b > 1 and z > 2 here. Then, we get (b-1)(z^2 -1) > 2 => bz^2 -1 > z^2 + b ≥ b^2 + z (last inequality holds because z ≥ b for z > 2). So we have no solution in this case. Page of 4 5 The last problem was long. Take a break and then go to the next problem. Example 7. Find all pairs of (k, n) of positive integers such that k! = (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n - 2^2)···(2^n - 2^(n-1)). First, let us take the 2’s common. We get k! = 2^(1+2+···+(n-1)) (2^n -1)(2^(n-1) -1)(2^(n-2) -1)···(2^1 -1). The red part above is odd. Hence the exponent of 2 in k! must be same as (1+2+···+(n-1)) = (n-1)n/2. But we know that the exponent of 2 in k! is given by [k/2] + [k/4] + [k/8] + ···, which is less than or equal to k/2 + k/4 + k/8 + ··· = k. Therefore we can say that (n-1)n/2 ≤ k. Now, k! = (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n - 2^2)···(2^n - 2^(n-1)) ≥ ((n-1)n/2)! On the other hand, we have (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n - 2^2)···(2^n - 2^(n-1)) ≤ (2^n)^n = 2^(n^2). [Since each of the n factors is less than 2^n.] Combining these upper and lower bounds, we get ((n-1)n/2)! ≤ (2^n -1)(2^n -2)(2^n - 2^2)···(2^n - 2^(n-1)) ≤ 2^(n^2) Since factorials grow really faster, we can hope that ((n-1)n/2)! won’t be less than 2^(n^2) except for a few initial values of n. In fact, we can show that ((n-1)n/2)! > 2^(n^2) for every n ≥ 6. Proof. For n = 6, we have 2^36 = 8^12 < 10^12, while 15! > 10^12. [Proving this without a calculator is painstaking but possible. Here is one way: 15 14 13 ··· 10 > 3.6 10^6 and 9! > 3.6 10^5. So their product is greater than (3.6)^2 10^11 > 10^12.] For n ≥ 7, we can proceed in this manner: ((n-1)n/2)! = 15! 16 ···  ((n-1)n/2) > 15! 16^((n-1)n/2 - 15) > 2^36 2^(2n(n-1) - 60) = 2^(n^2 + n(n-2)-24) > 2^(n^2), since n ≥ 7. Hence the given equation does not have a solution for any n ≥ 6. For n ≤ 5, we check manually (whether the RHS of the given equation is a factorial or not). Answers: (k, n) = (1, 1) or (3, 2).
