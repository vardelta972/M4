Does there exist a positive real number C such that the inequality x1x2 + x1x3 + x1x4 + x2x3 + x2x4 + x3x4 ≤ C(x1x2 + x2x3 + x3x4 + x4x1) holds for arbitrary positive real numbers x1, x2, x3, x4? 2. Let n ≥ 2 be a natural number, and suppose that positive numbers a0, a1, . . . , an satisfy the equality (ak−1 + ak)(ak + ak+1) = ak−1 − ak+1 for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Prove that an < 1 n − 1. 3. For a positive integer d deﬁne the sequence a0 = 1, an+1 = {an 2 , if an is even, an + d, if an is odd. Determine all d such that an = 1 for some n > 0. 4. Find all triples (x, y, z) of real numbers that satisfy x2 + y2 + z2 + 1 = xy + yz + zx + |x − 2y + z|. 5. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (x2 + f (y)) = y − x2 for all x, y ∈ R. 6. If k is an integer, let c(k) denote the largest cube that is less than or equal to k. Find all positive integers p for which the following sequence is bounded: a0 = p and an+1 = 3an − 2c(an) for n ≥ 0. (A sequence a0, a1, . . . of real numbers is said to be bounded if there exists an M ∈ R such that, for all n ≥ 0, |an| ≤ M .) 7. For each integer n ≥ 2, determine the largest real constant Cn such that for all positive real numbers a1, . . . , an we have a2 1 + · · · + a2 n n ≥ ( a1 + · · · + an n )2 + Cn · (a1 − an) 2. 6th February 2012 www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
