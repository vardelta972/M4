Over the reals, however, it is possible to define polynomials that are always greater than (or equal to) zero. These are known as positive (semi)definite functions. One such example is x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 0, which is true for all x, y \u0000 \u0000. In general, as squares of real numbers are non-negative, sums of squares are also non-negative. This is the most basic useful inequality. \u0000 If x1, x2, …, xn \u0000 \u0000 and %1, %2, …, %n \u0000 0, then %1 x12 \u0000 %2 x22 \u0000 … \u0000 %n xn2 \u0000 0, with equality if and only if x12 \u0000 x22 \u0000 … \u0000 xn2 \u0000 0. [Sum of squares inequality] Artin proved Hilbert’s seventeenth problem, namely that every positive semidefinite polynomial (and, by exten- sion, rational function) can be expressed as the sum of squares of rational functions. Charles Delzell later devel- oped an algorithm to do so. Hence, it is theoretically possible to prove any inequality involving rational functions simply by reducing it to the sum of squares inequality. However, this approach is similar in its impracticality to building an automobile using Stone Age tools. Certainly, it is impossible in the 270 minutes allocated in the International Mathematical Olympiad. Nevertheless, we can still tackle some basic inequalities in this way, especially if they are expressible as the sums of squares of polynomials. 1. Prove that x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x. Jensen’s inequality According to Ross Atkins, “Jensen’s inequality is greater than or equal to all other inequalities”. This strongly indicates that it is advisable to assimilate it into one’s problem-solving repertoire. It is geometrically very obvi- ous, namely that the barycentre of a convex figure is located inside it. This makes it all the more remarkable that so many useful inequalities, such as the power means inequality, are trivialised by Jensen’s inequality. \u0000 A continuous function f is convex over an interval \u0000a, b\u0000 if, for all x1, x2 \u0000 \u0000a, b\u0000 and %1, %2 \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000 such that %1 \u0000 %2 \u0000 1, we have f \u0000%1 x1 \u0000 %2 x2\u0000 \u0000 %1 f \u0000x1\u0000 \u0000 %2 f \u0000x2\u0000. If the reverse inequality holds instead, the function is concave. [Definition of convexity] This is most easily represented with the aid of a diagram: For any two points X and Y on the curve of a convex function, any point A on the line segment X Y lies above the curve. The Australian IMO team leader, Ivan Guo, created a mnemonic for remembering the shapes of generic \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 convex and concave functions: \u0000 Ivan: “Concave looks like a cave, and convex looks like a vex.” \u0000 Someone else: “What’s a vex?” \u0000 Ivan: “An upside-down cave.” 2. Let f be a convex function over the interval \u0000a, b\u0000. Let \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a, b\u0000 and \u0000%1, %2, …, %n\u0000 \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000 such that %1 \u0000 %2 \u0000 … \u0000 %n \u0000 1.

[Weighted Jensen’s inequality] Observe that the n \u0000 2 case of the weighted Jensen inequality is just the definition of convexity. It is often quoted as the slightly less general (but asymptotically equivalent) theorem where %1 \u0000 %2 \u0000 … \u0000 %n \u0000 1 n . \u0000 Let f be a convex function over the interval \u0000a, b\u0000, and let \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a, b\u0000. Then f \u0000 1 n \u0000x1 \u0000 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 xn\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1 n \u0000 f \u0000x1\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x2\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 f \u0000xn\u0000\u0000. [Jensen’s inequality] 3. If \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000 are all positive, show that 1 n \u0000x1 \u0000 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 xn\u0000 \u0000 x1 x2 … xn n . [AM-GM inequality] 4. If a and b are two non-zero real numbers such that a \u0000 b, show that 1 \u0000x1a \u0000 x2a \u0000 … \u0000 xna\u0000a \u0000 1 \u0000x1b \u0000 x2b \u0000 … \u0000 xnb\u0000b . [Power means inequality] The arithmetic mean, quadratic mean and harmonic mean arise when a is 1, 2 and \u00001, respectively. The geomet- ric mean is the limit as a \u0000 0. Muirhead’s inequality Muirhead’s inequality is a powerful generalisation of the AM-GM inequality. Before we can define it, however, it is necessary to introduce the idea of majorisation. \u0000 Let a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 an \u0000 1 and b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bn \u0000 1, and all ai \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000 and bi \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000. Assume further that the sequences are ordered such that a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 an and b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bn. Then \u0000ai\u0000 majorises \u0000bi\u0000 if and only if a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 ak \u0000 b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bk for all k \u0000 \u00001, n\u0000. [Definition of majorisation] The sequence \u00004, 0, 0, 0\u0000, for example, majorises \u00001, 1, 1, 1\u0000, as they are sorted into descending order and the following inequalities hold: \u0000 4 \u0000 1; \u0000 4 \u0000 0 \u0000 1 \u0000 1; \u0000 4 \u0000 0 \u0000 0 \u0000 1 \u0000 1 \u0000 1; \u0000 4 \u0000 0 \u0000 0 \u0000 0 \u0000 1 \u0000 1 \u0000 1 \u0000 1. Occasionally, the notation \u00004, 0, 0, 0\u0000 \u0000 \u00001, 1, 1, 1\u0000 is used to denote this relationship. Majorisation may appear at first to be a contrived relation, although it has several equivalent and more enlightening formulations. We inter- pret a \u0000 \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000 as a vector in \u0000n, and consider the set of n \u0000 (not necessarily distinct) vectors obtained by permuting the elements of the vector a. They all lie in the \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-dimensional plane with equation x1 \u0000 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 xn \u0000 a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 an, and form the vertices of a permutation polytope. In general (when all elements are distinct), the three-variable case is a hexagon, whereas the four-variable case is a truncated octahedron. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 01234 0 1 2 3 4 0 1 2 3 4 The red and blue hexagons correspond to the sets \u00004, 2, 0\u0000 and \u00003, 2, 1\u0000, respectively. The condition that the red hexagon contains the blue hexagon is equivalent to \u00004, 2, 0\u0000 \u0000 \u00003, 2, 1\u0000, which in turn is equivalent to the Birkhoff- von Neumann theorem: \u00003, 2, 1\u0000 can be expressed as a weighted average of permutations of \u00004, 2, 0\u0000. More subtly, this also implies that, for all x, y, z \u0000 0, the polynomial x4 y2 z0 \u0000 z4 y2 x0 \u0000 y4 z2 x0 \u0000 x4 z2 y0 \u0000 z4 x2 y0 \u0000 y4 x2 z0 is greater than or equal to x3 y2 z1 \u0000 z3 y2 x1 \u0000 y3 z2 x1 \u0000 x3 z2 y1 \u0000 z3 x2 y1 \u0000 y3 x2 z1; a fact known as Muirhead’s inequality. \u0000 Let \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000, \u0000%1, %2, …, %n\u0000 and \u0000(1, (2, …, (n\u0000 be sequences of non-negative real numbers. If \u0000%1, %2, …, %n\u0000 majorises \u0000 (1, (2, …, (n\u0000, then \u0000 sym \u0000x1%1 x2%2 … xn%n\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 sym \u0000x1 (1 x2 (2 … xn (n\u0000. The sigmas denote symmetric sums, i.e. sums over all n \u0000 permutations of \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000. [Muirhead’s inequality] It is discussed in https://nrich.maths.org/discus/messages/67613/Muirhead-69859.pdf. Geoff Smith described how Muirhead’s inequality is not well known amongst members of the IMO jury; occasionally certain inequalities, which were highly amenable to attack by this method, appeared on the IMO as a result of this. 5. Prove that, for all positive real numbers x, y and z, we have 2 x3 \u0000 2 y3 \u0000 2 z3 \u0000 x2 y \u0000 y2 x \u0000 y2 z \u0000 z2 y \u0000 z2 x \u0000 x2 z. Majorisation as fluid transfer We have already defined majorisation in terms of decreasing sequences and permutation polytopes. A third interpretation involves containers of fluid. In each configuration below, the total volume of fluid is 1 unit; we will assume this without loss of generality to simplify things. Suppose we have a sequence of containers of fluid, such that if container X is immediately to the left of container Y , then X contains at least as much fluid as Y . We are allowed to siphon fluid from X to Y as long as this weak inequality is maintained. From the configuration above, we can siphon up to 0.175 units of fluid from the first container to the second one without breaking the weak inequality. In the diagram below, we have transferred 0.1 units. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 This is known as a valid q-move, where q \u0000 0.1 is the amount of fluid transferred. We can continue in this man- ner. The fluid transfer lemma states that we can get from an initial sequence S0 to (arbitrarily close to) a target sequence S\u0000 by applying valid q-moves if and only if S0 majorises S\u0000. A more formal definition follows: \u0000 Suppose S0 and S\u0000 \u0000 \u0000b1, b2, …, bn\u0000 are two weakly decreasing sequences of non-negative real numbers, each with unit sum and length n. Let / \u0000 0 be a small real number. Define a valid q-move to be an operation \u0000a1, a2, …, ak, ak\u00001, …, an\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a1, a2, …, ak \u0000 q, ak\u00001 \u0000 q, …, an\u0000 such that the sequence remains strictly decreasing and still majorises S\u0000. Then there exists some \" \u0000 / such that there exists a finite sequence of N valid \"- moves S0 \u0000 S1 \u0000 … \u0000 SN such that each term of SN differs by the corresponding term of S\u0000 by at most / if and only if S0 majorises S\u0000. [Fluid transfer lemma] Proof: The ‘only if’ part is much easier, as it is evident that S0 majorises S1, which in turn majorises S2. By induction, S0 majorises SN . If S0 does not majorise S\u0000, then one of the weak inequalities must be broken by an amount h. If we let / \u0000 h , then SN must be sufficiently close to S\u0000 to also break one of those inequalities. Hence, S0 does not majorise SN , so we have a contradiction. For the ‘if’ part, note that there are a finite number of attainable configurations for a given S0 and \", and the process cannot cycle, so must eventually terminate. Suppose we perform valid \"-moves arbitrarily until we reach a position SN where no further valid \"-moves are possible. By definition, for each pair of adjacent elements \u0000ai, ai\u00001\u0000 in SN , it must be the case that either: \u0000 ai \u0000 ai\u00001 \u0000 2 \" (in which case applying a \"-move would break the weakly decreasing criterion); \u0000 or \u0000a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 ai\u0000 \u0000 \u0000b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bi\u0000 \u0000 \" (in which case applying a \"-move would break the majorisation criterion). If the first case applies to all pairs of adjacent elements, we have a1 \u0000 an \u0000 2 \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \". So, each element must be within 2 \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \" of the mean, 1 n . As SN majorises S\u0000, the same must be true of S\u0000. Hence, corresponding ele- ments can differ by no more than 4 \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \", which we can make smaller than / by letting \" be sufficiently small. This leaves the alternative case where there exists some i such that 0 \u0000 \u0000a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 ai\u0000 \u0000 \u0000b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bi\u0000 \u0000 \" . In that case, we can split the problem into two separate problems: one involving the first i elements of the sequences, and the other involving the last n \u0000 i. (We need not worry that the sum of the first i elements of SN is slightly greater than that of S\u0000, as we can make the difference arbitrarily small. It is not important that things are exact, as long as the largest accumulative error is smaller than /.) By inducting on the number of elements, we prove the fluid transfer lemma. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Returning to the geometric interpretation, this means that we can incrementally move the vertices of the larger polytope inwards (varying two coordinates of any vertex at any one time whilst preserving the full symmetry group) until it becomes arbitrarily close to ‘suffocating’ the smaller polytope. This is rather intuitive, and implies the Birkhoff-von Neumann theorem. Energy minimisation lemma A corollary of this lemma is the energy minimisation lemma. The proof relies on concepts from real analysis such as continuity and convergence, which are taught in most undergraduate maths degrees (such as the Cambridge Mathematical Tripos). \u0000 Suppose we have a continuous function E : \u0000n \u0000 \u0000, known as the energy function. Suppose that applying a valid q- move to S \u0000 \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000 cannot increase the value of E\u0000S\u0000. If we have two sequences S0 and S\u0000, such that S0 majorises S\u0000, then E\u0000S0\u0000 \u0000 E\u0000S\u0000\u0000. [Energy minimisation lemma] Effectively, we associate an ‘energy function’ with the configuration of containers, such that the energy either remains constant or decreases whenever a valid q-move is applied. The energy minimisation lemma states that E\u0000S0\u0000 \u0000 E\u0000S\u0000\u0000 if S0 majorises S\u0000. Proof: Due to the fluid transfer lemma, we can apply valid q-moves to Sn to result in a new sequence (Sn\u00001) where each term differs from S\u0000 by at most / \u0000 \u0000\u0000n. Starting from S0, we produce an infinite sequence of sequences \u0000S0, S1, …\u0000 where each term is an increasingly close approximation to S\u0000. More specifically, this sequence of sequences converges to S\u0000. As E is a continuous function, this means that \u0000E\u0000S0\u0000, E\u0000S1\u0000, …\u0000 must converge to E\u0000S\u0000\u0000. Also, as valid q-moves cannot increase the value of E\u0000S\u0000, we have E\u0000S0\u0000 \u0000 E\u0000S1\u0000 \u0000 …; by the monotone convergence theorem, this means E\u0000S\u0000\u0000 is the infimum of these terms, and therefore no larger than any of them. The result then follows. Generalised Muirhead inequality Using the lemmas developed above, it is straightforward to prove the generalised Muirhead inequality. 6.

[Generalised Muirhead’s inequality] We can derive the ordinary Muirhead’s inequality by letting f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x.

Then f \u0000a1\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 f \u0000an\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b1\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 f \u0000bn\u0000. [Karamata inequality] This can be extended in another direction. We can assume without loss of generality that \u0000ai \u0000 \u0000bi \u0000 1. Effec- tively, we can consider two new functions, g ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 n a\u0000x n\u0000 and h ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 n b\u0000x n\u0000, which are defined on the open interval \u00000, 1\u0000. As \u0000ai\u0000 majorises \u0000bi\u0000 and the sequences are sorted in descending order, we have that g ' and h ' are weakly decreasing and \u0000 0 k g ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000 0 k h ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x for all 0 \u0000 k \u0000 1. We represent these integrals by g\u0000x\u0000 and h\u0000x\u0000, respectively. It is clear that g\u00000\u0000 \u0000 h\u00000\u0000 \u0000 0 and g\u00001\u0000 \u0000 h\u00001\u0000 \u0000 1. The graph of g ' \u0000x\u0000 is a collection of n rectangles of decreasing height. Integrating this to obtain g\u0000x\u0000 results in a concave line formed from n straight line segments of decreasing gradient. If we take the limit as n tends towards infinity, the sequences in Karamata’s inequality are replaced with arbitrary non-negative decreasing functions, g ' and h '. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Suppose g and h are increasing concave functions with domain \u00000, 1\u0000 such that g\u00000\u0000 \u0000 h\u00000\u0000 \u0000 0, g\u00001\u0000 \u0000 h\u00001\u0000 \u0000 1 and g\u0000k\u0000 \u0000 h\u0000k\u0000 for all k \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000. The derivatives of g\u0000x\u0000 and h\u0000x\u0000 with respect to x are denoted g ' \u0000x\u0000 and h ' \u0000x\u0000, respectively. Let f be an arbitrary convex function.

[Continuous Karamata inequality] Schur’s inequality A useful inequality that can be proved using sums of squares is Schur’s inequality. Unlike the previous inequali- ties, which generalise to arbitrarily many variables, this has just three terms. 9. Suppose a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 z \u0000 y \u0000 0. Show that x2\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000 y2\u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000b \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000 z2\u0000c \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000c \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 0. [Strong 6-variable Schur] It is often quoted as the much weaker result shown below. 10. Show also that x\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000 y\u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000b \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000 z\u0000c \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000c \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 0. [Weak 6-variable Schur] This can be used, with a little work, to form a very powerful inequality. 11. Let f : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 be a function expressible as the sum of non-negative monotonic functions. Let g : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 and h : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 be odd and increasing. Show that f \u0000a\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 h\u0000a \u0000 c\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 h\u0000b \u0000 a\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000c \u0000 a\u0000 h\u0000c \u0000 b\u0000\u0000 \u0000 0. [Weak generalised Schur] When h\u0000w\u0000 \u0000 w k and g\u0000w\u0000 \u0000 w, this is known as the Vornicu-Schur inequality. With the additional constraints of k \u0000 1 and f \u0000w\u0000 \u0000 w p, this is simply Schur’s inequality. \u0000 If a, b, c \u0000 \u0000\u0000, then a p\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000 b p\u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000b \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000 c p\u0000c \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000c \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 0. [Schur’s inequality] It is popularly believed that a suitable combination of Muirhead and Schur can conquer any inequality. This is obviously an exaggeration, since neither can prove (for instance) Jensen’s inequality. Nevertheless, most symmet- ric inequalities in three variables submit to such an attack. 12. Prove that x 6 \u0000 y6 \u0000 z6 \u0000 3 x2 y2 z2 \u0000 2 x3 y3 \u0000 2 y3 z3 \u0000 2 z 3 x3. Nevertheless, we can go further. The strong 6-variable Schur inequality can also be generalised in a similar way to its weaker counterpart. We define a function f to be positive-illuminable if f \u0000% x\u0000 \u0000 % f \u0000x\u0000 for all 0 \u0000 % \u0000 1 and x \u0000 0. Informally, this means that a light source placed infinitesimally above the origin will be able to illuminate every point on the curve y \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000, x \u0000 0 from above. This is demonstrated in the following diagram, where no rays emitted from the origin intersect the curve twice. Positive-illuminability is a weaker condition than convexity. \u00001.0 \u00000.5 0.5 1.0 \u00000.4 \u00000.2 0.2 0.4 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 We are now in a position to state and prove the stronger generalised form of Schur’s inequality. 13. Let f : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 be a function expressible as the sum of non-negative monotonic functions. Let g : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 and h : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 be odd, increasing and positive-illuminable. Show that f \u0000a\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 h\u0000a \u0000 c\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 h\u0000b \u0000 a\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000c \u0000 a\u0000 h\u0000c \u0000 b\u0000\u0000 \u0000 0. [Strong generalised Schur] Calculus Although ideas of limiting processes and integration can be traced back to Archimedes, our modern understand- ing of calculus was developed much later. It was conceived independently, and almost simultaneously, by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz. As Newton only considered differentiation with respect to time, we currently use Leibniz’s (much clearer) notation instead. In the explorations of various general inequalities, terms such as ‘increasing’, ‘convex’ and ‘positive-illuminable’ appeared. It is possible to express each of these concepts in the environment of calculus. We will represent the first derivative of a function f \u0000x\u0000 with f ' \u0000x\u0000. The second derivative, f '' \u0000x\u0000, is also of interest. \u0000 A differentiable function f is increasing on an interval I if and only if f ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 0 for all x \u0000 I. This is intuitive. The derivative measures the rate of increase of a function, which we require to be non-negative. Convex functions have an increasing gradient, so we require the second derivative to be positive. \u0000 A differentiable function f is convex on an interval I if and only if f '' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 0 for all x \u0000 I. The properties ‘decreasing’ and ‘concave’ are similarly defined, but with the ‘\u0000’ operator reversed in direction. 14. Prove that \u00002 x \u0000 \u00002 y \u0000 2 \u0000x\u0000y for all x, y \u0000 \u0000. So far, we have considered calculus in one variable. Nevertheless, it is possible to delve into the realms of multivariate calculus. The main approach is to consider the partial derivative of a function with respect to a variable. To do this, we allow one variable to vary and force the others to remain constant. For example, z \u0000 y2 \u0000 2 x y has the partial derivatives 0z 0x \u0000 2 y and 0z 0y \u0000 2 y \u0000 2 x. If we want to show that the value of a function z \u0000 f \u0000x, y\u0000 increases as we move parallel to the x-axis, we need to show that 0z 0x is always non-negative. To investigate how it changes as we move parallel to the vector \u00003, 2\u0000, we are interested in 3 0z 0x \u0000 2 0z 0y . 15. Let x, y and z be positive real numbers. Prove that 4 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00003 \u0000 27 \u0000x2 y \u0000 y2 z \u0000 z2 x\u0000. [BMO2 2010, Question 4] Warning: A stationary point is a point where all partial derivatives are zero. Be careful, however, as this could be a point of inflection or saddle point instead of a minimum or maximum. Also, calculus does not guarantee that a particular extremum is global; for example, x3 \u0000 3 x has a local minimum at x \u0000 1, but still takes on arbitrarily low values. You should bear this in mind when attempting to tackle a problem using calculus, especially Lagrange multipliers. If you want to use calculus to locate an extremum of a function, it is invariably a good idea to sketch a graph of the function first. Unfortunately, your two-dimensional paper and three-dimensional imagination are insufficient when there are many variables. Lagrange multipliers Suppose we have some additional constraints on the variables in an inequality. For example, we encountered a problem where we had to minimise x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 subject to the constraint that x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 1. One way of \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 incorporating the side constraint is to homogenise the inequality. In that example, it would involve making all terms in x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 of degree zero. In this case, it ‘reduces’ to the following problem, which is really quite horrible: \u0000 Find the minimum value of x2\u0000y2\u0000z2 \u0000x3\u0000y3\u0000z3\u00003 x y z\u0000 2 , where x, y, z \u0000 \u0000. If we could guess that the minimum value is 1 (which is by no means obvious), then it is equivalent to proving that \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z\u0000 2. One could attempt to bash this degree-6 polynomial inequality with any combination of Muirhead, Schur and the u v w method (as we shall do shortly), but it lacks a certain elegance. A method that is more amenable to incorporating side constraints into problems is the use of Lagrange multipli- ers, which enable the application of calculus. If we want to minimise the value of f (which is a function of some variables) subject to the algebraic constraint g \u0000 0 (where g is a function of those variables), then we introduce a new variable, \u0000. We consider the function \u0000 \u0000 f \u0000 \u0000 g, and minimise it by locating its stationary points. We’ll start with a simple non-trivial example in two variables: \u0000 Find the minimum and maximum of f \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 x y, subject to the constraint x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 1. The contours of f are ellipses of the form f \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 x y \u0000 k, and we want to find the ones that touch the circle g \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 1 \u0000 0. Let \u0000 \u0000 f \u0000 \u0000 g. Consider a point of tangency, such as that highlighted in the diagram above. We imagine setting a new orthogonal coordinate system centred at this point, with an axis normal to the common tangent. Call this coordinate \u0000. The partial derivatives 0 f 0\u0000 and 0g 0\u0000 are both non-zero, whereas the partial deriva- tives with respect to the other axes are all zero. Hence, if we let \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 0 f 0\u0000 0g 0\u0000 , the partial derivatives of \u0000 with respect to all of the (new) axes are zero, so the partial derivatives are all zero. In other words, any extremal point of f on the curve g \u0000 0 is also a stationary point of \u0000. This method only works if 0g 0\u0000 is non-zero at the extremal points, so it is important to verify this before proceeding with the method of Lagrange multipliers. In this example, g is quadratic and only stationary at the origin, so we can safely apply the method. \u0000 Find the stationary points of \u0000 \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 x y \u0000 \u0000\u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 1\u0000. Equating 0\u0000 0x \u0000 0 and 0\u0000 0y \u0000 0, we have the equations 2 x \u0000 y \u0000 2 \u0000 x \u0000 0 and 2 y \u0000 x \u0000 2 \u0000 y \u0000 0, which simplify to 2 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 y x \u0000 x y . Hence, y2 \u0000 x2 and thus x \u0000 \u0000 y, from whence we obtain all four tangency points: \u0000\u0000 1 2 , \u0000 1 2 \u0000. They correspond to the maximum value f \u0000 3 and minimum value f \u0000 1. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 We shall now contemplate the original problem. As shown above, let f \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 and g \u0000 x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 1. This simplification is more appetising than the previous attempt at homogenising the problem. \u0000 Find the stationary points of \u0000 \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 \u0000\u0000x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 1\u0000. Differentiating it with respect to x gives the partial derivative 0\u0000 0x \u0000 2 x \u0000 3 \u0000 x2 \u0000 3 \u0000 y z, which we wish to equate to zero. Similarly, by differentiating with respect to y and z, we obtain two more equations. (The final equation, 0\u0000 0\u0000 \u0000 0, is precisely the original side constraint, x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 1.) More interestingly, we can multiply 2 x \u0000 3 \u0000 x2 \u0000 3 \u0000 y z \u0000 0 by x to result in the cubic equation 3 \u0000 x3 \u0000 2 x2 \u0000 3 \u0000 x y z. Hence, x, y and z are all solutions of the equation 3 \u0000 x3 \u0000 2 x2 \u0000 k, where k \u0000 3 \u0000 x y z. Either x, y, z are the three distinct roots, or two of them are equal. In the former case, we have x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x \u0000 0 by Vieta’s formulas, resulting in the equation x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00003 \u0000 \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 3 , and thus x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 1 and we are done. In the other case, we can assume without loss of generality that y \u0000 z and thus eliminate a variable. \u0000 Find the stationary points of \u0000 \u0000 x2 \u0000 2 y2 \u0000 \u0000\u0000x3 \u0000 2 y3 \u0000 3 x y2 \u0000 1\u0000. We obtain 0\u0000 0y \u0000 4 y \u0000 6 \u0000 y2 \u0000 6 \u0000 x y \u0000 0, which has solutions y \u0000 0 and \u0000\u0000x \u0000 y\u0000 \u0000 2 3 . The former case clearly results in \u0000x, y, z\u0000 \u0000 \u00001, 0, 0\u0000, again giving a minimum of x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 1. The other solution is more intricate. By considering the other partial derivative, 0\u0000 0x \u0000 2 x \u0000 3 \u0000 x2 \u0000 3 \u0000 y2 \u0000 2 x \u0000 3 \u0000\u0000x \u0000 y\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y\u0000 \u0000 0, we get 2 x \u0000 2 \u0000x \u0000 y\u0000 \u0000 0. This gives 2 x \u0000 \u0000y, which can be substituted back into the original equation to give \u000027 x3 \u0000 1, or \u0000x, y, z\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 1 3 , 2 3 , 2 3 \u0000. This also attains the value of x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 1. We now just need to choose the minimum value of x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2, which is 1. 16. Find the distance from the closest points on the hyperbola x y \u0000 x2 \u0000 1 to the origin O \u0000 \u00000, 0\u0000. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u00002 \u00001 1 2 \u00002 \u00001 1 2 The u v w method Symmetric polynomial inequalities in three positive real variables have frequently appeared in olympiads. The ‘u v w method’ uses the idea of expressing these as polynomials in the ESPs. \u0000 3 u \u0000 x \u0000 y \u0000 z \u0000 3 v2 \u0000 x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x \u0000 w3 \u0000 x y z 17. If x, y, z \u0000 \u0000, prove that \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z 3 \u0000 3 x y z\u0000 2. When does equality occur? The full power of the u v w method is realised when we require that x, y, z \u0000 0. By the AM-GM inequality, u \u0000 v \u0000 w with equality if and only if x \u0000 y \u0000 z. This leads to an approach for tackling all three-variable symmetric polynomial inequalities of reasonably low degree. The blue plane x \u0000 y \u0000 z \u0000 3 u intersects the red two-sheeted hyperboloid x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x \u0000 3 v2 in a conic. It is the intersection of the blue plane with the sphere with equation x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 9 u2 \u0000 6 v2, so is a circle. If we fix u and v, we can ‘move’ around the circumference of the circle and examine how w varies. This can be accomplished by the method of Lagrange multipliers. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 18. Show that the stationary points of \u0000 \u0000 x y z \u0000 \u0000\u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 6 v2 \u0000 9 u2\u0000 \u0000 '\u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z \u0000 3 u\u0000 occur only where two of the variables are equal. If the circle intersects the planes x \u0000 0, y \u0000 0 and z \u0000 0, however, we must also account for the ‘boundary case’ where one of the variables is zero. \u0000 If we want to find the maximum or minimum values of w 3 for some fixed u and v 2, it suffices to only check the cases where x \u0000 0 or y \u0000 z. Now let’s suppose we are trying to prove a symmetric polynomial inequality where the degree of the greatest term is 8. It can be expressed as the inequality F w 6 \u0000 2 G w 3 \u0000 H \u0000 0, where F, G, H are functions of u and v2. This is a quadratic in w 3, so its extreme values occur when either w 3 is minimised, maximised, or reaches the stationary point. By differentiating the above expression with respect to w 3, this occurs when F w \u0000 G \u0000 0, i.e. w \u0000 \u0000 G F . \u0000 To prove the inequality F w 6 \u0000 2 G w 3 \u0000 H \u0000 0 (which is an arbitrary symmetric polynomial of degree d \u0000 8 in three variables), where F, G, H are polynomials in u and v2, it suffices only to check that it holds under each of the following three cases: \u0000 One variable is zero (without loss of generality, x \u0000 0); \u0000 Two variables are equal (without loss of generality, y \u0000 z); \u0000 F w \u0000 G \u0000 0. (only relevant where d \u0000 6). [Generalised Tejs’ corollary] F w \u0000 G \u0000 0 is a degree-\u0000d \u0000 3\u0000 symmetric polynomial equation, where d is the degree of the inequality. In some problems, you may be sufficiently fortunate to find that equality can never occur, for instance if F w \u0000 G \u0000 0 in all cases. Since this is a degree-5 inequality, it can be itself verified using Tejs’ corollary. Gamma function The function f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 2x can be defined on the positive integers by the product 2 \u0000 2 \u0000… \u00002 n times . If we want to extend this function to the reals and complex numbers, we can do so by using the recurrence f \u0000x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 2 f \u0000x\u0000. This gives an uncountably infinite number of possible contenders. If we insist that the function is continuous, differentiable and is ‘logarithmically convex’, then there is only one possible function: f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 exp\u0000x log\u00002\u0000\u0000, where exp\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 1 \u0000 x \u0000 x2 2\u0000 \u0000 x3 3\u0000 \u0000 … and log\u0000x\u0000 is its inverse. Euler did the same for the factorial function. The Gamma function is defined by *\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 1\u0000\u0000 for x \u0000 \u0000, and more generally over the positive complex numbers with positive real part by the convergent integral *\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000t tx\u00001 \u0000 t. For complex numbers with negative real part, we can extrapolate using the recurrence *\u0000x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 x *\u0000x\u0000. For example, it is known that *\u0000 1 2 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 , so *\u0000\u0000 1 2 \u0000 \u0000 \u00002 \u0000 and *\u0000\u0000 3 2 \u0000 \u0000 4 3 \u0000 . \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 A plot of *\u0000z\u0000 is shown above for complex values of z. Observe that for non-positive integers, the function is undefined. From the integral definition of the Gamma function, it is straightforward to establish this identity: \u0000 1 Ax \u0000 1 *\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 A t tx\u00001 \u0000 t. [Identity involving the Gamma function] If we want to show that a Ax \u0000 b Bx \u0000 c Cx \u0000 0, we can convert it to the equivalent inequality 1 *\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 \u0000a \u0000\u0000A t \u0000 b \u0000\u0000B t \u0000 c \u0000\u0000C t\u0000 tx\u00001 \u0000 t \u0000 0. If x is positive and a \u0000\u0000A t \u0000 b \u0000\u0000B t \u0000 c \u0000\u0000C t \u0000 0, the integrand and integral are therefore also non-negative. 19. Prove that \u0000 i\u00001 n \u0000 j\u00001 n ai a j \u0000 pi\u0000p j\u0000c \u0000 0, where c, p1, p2, …, pn \u0000 0 and a1, a2, …, an \u0000 \u0000. [KöMaL, Problem A493, November 2009] An interesting fact concerning the Gamma function is that the volume of a n-dimensional hypersphere of radius r is given by \u0000 n rn *\u0000 n \u00001\u0000 . One can verify easily that this agrees with known formulae for the line segment, circle and sphere. 20. The E8 lattice consists of points in \u00008 such that the coordinates are either all integers or all half-integers, and the sum of the coordinates is an even integer. Suppose we place (hyper)spheres of radius r, centred at each point in E8. What is the maximum value of r such that the spheres are disjoint, and what is the density of the resulting sphere packing? \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. This follows from the non-negativity of \u0000x \u0000 y\u00002 \u0000 \u0000y \u0000 z\u00002 \u0000 \u0000z \u0000 x\u00002. 2. By induction on the number of variables, the barycentre B \u0000 \u0000%1 x1 \u0000 … \u0000 %n xn, %1 f \u0000x1\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 %n f \u0000xn\u0000\u0000 must lie in the convex hull of the points \u0000Pi \u0000 \u0000xi, f \u0000xi\u0000\u0000\u0000. As every point on the perimeter of the convex hull lies above the curve by the definition of convexity, so too must every point in the interior of the convex hull, including the barycentre. 3. This is the special case of Jensen’s inequality where f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x. 4. We can replace a and b with a b and 1, respectively, without altering anything, and thus assume without loss of generality that b \u0000 1. Applying Jensen’s inequality to f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 xa gives the desired result. 5. \u00003, 0, 0\u0000 majorises \u00002, 1, 0\u0000, so this follows from Muirhead’s inequality. 6. Without loss of generality, re-define the interval so that %1 \u0000 0, %2 \u0000 1. We then need to prove that f \u0000x2\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x1\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000(1 x1 \u0000 (2 x2\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000(1 x2 \u0000 (2 x1\u0000. By the definition of convexity, we have f \u0000(1 x1 \u0000 (2 x2\u0000 \u0000 (1 f \u0000x1\u0000 \u0000 (2 f \u0000x2\u0000 and f \u0000(1 x2 \u0000 (2 x1\u0000 \u0000 (1 f \u0000x2\u0000 \u0000 (2 f \u0000x1\u0000. Adding these together yields the desired inequality. 7. Suppose we apply a q-move to %i and %i\u00001. Consider each sum of the form f \u0000%1 x\u0000\u00001\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 %i x\u0000\u0000i\u0000 \u0000 %i\u00001 x\u0000\u0000i\u00001\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 %n x\u0000\u0000n\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000%1 x\u0000\u00001\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 %i x\u0000\u0000i\u00001\u0000 \u0000 %i\u00001 x\u0000\u0000i\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 %n x\u0000\u0000n\u0000\u0000. Note that this is equal to g\u0000%i x\u0000\u0000i\u0000 \u0000 %i\u00001 x\u0000\u0000i\u00001\u0000\u0000 \u0000 g\u0000%i x\u0000\u0000i\u00001\u0000 \u0000 %i\u00001 x\u0000\u0000i\u0000\u0000 for some convex function g\u0000w\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000w \u0000 k\u0000. The previous theorem tells us that this cannot increase when %i and %i\u00001 are replaced with (i and (i\u00001. Apply this principle to all n\u0000 2 pairs of terms. 8. This is a corollary of the energy minimisation lemma and the previous question. 9. Let a \u0000 b \u0000 d and b \u0000 c \u0000 e. Then the inequality becomes x2 d\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000 \u0000 y2 d e \u0000 z2 e\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000 \u0000 0. Rearranging, we obtain the equivalent \u0000x d \u0000 z e\u00002 \u0000 \u0000\u0000x \u0000 z\u00002 \u0000 y2\u0000 d e \u0000 0. This is clearly true if \u0000x \u0000 z\u00002 \u0000 y2. 10. x2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 y2 is a weaker condition than x \u0000 z \u0000 y, so the result follows from the previous question. 11. Assume without loss of generality that a \u0000 b \u0000 c, and let d \u0000 a \u0000 b and e \u0000 b \u0000 c. For any non-negative monotonic function f , we have f \u0000a\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b\u0000; hence, this must be true of any sum of non-negative monotonic functions. The problem reduces to showing that f \u0000a\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000d\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d\u0000\u0000. As g and h are increasing, we have f \u0000a\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000d\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 f \u0000a\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d\u0000\u0000, which in turn must be greater than f \u0000b\u0000 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d\u0000\u0000, as f \u0000a\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000b\u0000. 12. Obviously, the worst-case scenario is when all variables are positive. Expanding the Schur inequality x2\u0000x2 \u0000 y2\u0000 \u0000y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 \u0000 y2\u0000y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 \u0000y2 \u0000 x2\u0000 \u0000 z2\u0000z 2 \u0000 x2\u0000 \u0000z2 \u0000 y2\u0000 \u0000 0 gives the variant x6 \u0000 y6 \u0000 z6 \u0000 3 x 2 y2 z2 \u0000 x4 y2 \u0000 x2 y4 \u0000 y4 z2 \u0000 y2 z4 \u0000 z4 x2 \u0000 z2 x4. The other inequality, x4 y2 \u0000 x2 y4 \u0000 y4 z2 \u0000 y 2 z 4 \u0000 z4 x2 \u0000 z2 x4 \u0000 x 3 y3 \u0000 y3 z3 \u0000 z3 x3, is a simple application of Muirhead. 13. Again, assume without loss of generality that a \u0000 b \u0000 c, and let d \u0000 a \u0000 b and e \u0000 b \u0000 c. As h is positive- illuminable, h\u0000m \u0000 n\u0000 \u0000 h\u0000m\u0000 \u0000 h\u0000n\u0000 for all m, n \u0000 \u0000\u0000. As g and h are increasing and odd, we have f \u0000a\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000d\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 h\u0000d \u0000 e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000a\u00002 g\u0000h\u0000d\u00002 \u0000 h\u0000d\u0000 h\u0000e\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000c\u0000 2 g\u0000h\u0000e\u0000 2 \u0000 h\u0000d\u0000 h\u0000e\u0000\u0000. Hence, we can reduce this, effectively, to the case where h is the identity function. As g is positive- \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 illuminable, we can express g\u0000w\u0000 \u0000 G\u0000w\u00002 w for all w \u0000 \u0000\u0000, where G is an increasing function. Now, we let x \u0000 f \u0000a\u0000 G\u0000h\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 h\u0000a \u0000 c\u0000\u0000 and define y and z similarly. We have x \u0000 z \u0000 y by the same argument as in the proof of the weak generalised Schur inequality. The result then follows from the strong 6-variable Schur. 14. We let f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u00002 x. Differentiating this twice gives 4 \u00002 x, which is positive-definite. Hence, f is convex and we can apply Jensen’s inequality to show that 1 \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000y\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000 x\u0000y 2 \u0000. 15. Let w \u0000 f \u0000x, y, z\u0000 \u0000 4 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00003 \u0000 27 \u0000x2 y \u0000 y2 z \u0000 z2 x\u0000. Differentiate with respect to x to give the partial derivative 0w 0x \u0000 12 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00002 \u0000 27 \u00002 x y \u0000 z2\u0000. The cyclic sum is 0w 0x \u0000 0w 0y \u0000 0w 0z \u0000 36 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00002 \u0000 27 \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 2 x y \u0000 2 y z \u0000 2 z x\u0000 \u0000 9 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u00002. This is obviously positive, so the function increases as we move parallel to the vector \u00001, 1, 1\u0000. Hence, we have f \u0000x \u0000 h, y \u0000 h, z \u0000 h\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x, y, z\u0000 for all h \u0000 0. Assume without loss of generality that x \u0000 y and x \u0000 z. Using the previous statement, f \u0000x, y, z\u0000 \u0000 f \u00000, y \u0000 x, y \u0000 z\u0000. To prove the strict inequality in general, therefore, we need only prove the weak inequality when one of the variables is zero. We have reduced the problem to showing that 4 \u0000y \u0000 z\u00003 \u0000 27 y2 z. This is evident from the factorisation 4 \u0000y \u0000 z\u00003 \u0000 27 y2 z \u0000 \u00004 y \u0000 z\u0000 \u0000y \u0000 2 z\u00002. 16. We wish to minimise x2 \u0000 y2 subject to the constraint x y \u0000 x2 \u0000 1. We use Lagrange multipliers to obtain \u0000 \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 \u0000\u0000x y \u0000 x2 \u0000 1\u0000. We equate each of its partial derivatives, 2 x \u0000 \u0000 y \u0000 2 \u0000 x and 2 y \u0000 \u0000 x, to zero. The latter gives us the value of \u0000, namely 2 y x , so we can substitute it into the other equation and obtain 2 x \u0000 2 y2 x \u0000 4 y \u0000 0. We can multiply throughout by 1 2 x to give the quadratic x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 2 x y \u0000 0, or \u0000 x y \u0000 2 \u0000 2 \u0000 x y \u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 0. The Babylonian formula gives us x y \u0000 1 \u0000 2 . It is sensible to draw a graph of the hyperbola to confirm that the root we are looking for is actually x y \u0000 1 \u0000 2 . Hence, x \u0000 \u00001 \u0000 2 \u0000 y and y \u0000 \u0000 2 \u0000 1\u0000 x. Substituting this into the equation of the hyperbola gives x2 \u0000 1 2 . Similarly, we have y2 \u0000 \u0000 2 \u0000 1\u0000 2 x2 \u0000 \u00003 \u0000 2 2 \u0000 x2, giving x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 \u00004\u00002 2 \u0000 2 \u0000 2 2 \u0000 2. The distance is the square-root of that, namely 2 2 \u0000 2 . 17. The inequality \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2\u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z\u0000 2 can be expressed in the u v w notation as \u00009 u2 \u0000 6 v2\u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000\u00003 u\u0000 \u00009 u2 \u0000 9 v2\u0000\u0000 2. We can divide throughout by 36, giving the equivalent inequality \u0000u2 \u0000 2 v2\u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000u3 \u0000 v2 u\u0000 2, which expands to u6 \u0000 2 u4 v2 \u0000 4 3 u2 v4 \u0000 8 27 v6 \u0000 u6 \u0000 2 u4 v2 \u0000 u2 v4. Observe that the first two terms on each side of the equation cancel, so we wish to prove that 4 3 u2 v4 \u0000 8 27 v6 \u0000 u2 v4, or 1 u2 v4 \u0000 8 27 v6. We can neatly divide by 1 27 v4 (which must be positive, since 9 v4 \u0000 \u0000x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x\u00002), giving 9 u 2 \u0000 8 v2. As u2 is necessarily positive and greater in magnitude than v2, this is true. Equality occurs when v4 \u0000 0, i.e. x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x \u0000 0. 18. Firstly, obtain the partial derivative 0\u0000 0x \u0000 y z \u0000 2 \u0000 x \u0000 ' \u0000 0. We can multiply throughout by x to get 2 \u0000 x2 \u0000 ' x \u0000 w \u0000 0, where w \u0000 x y z. As x, y, z are all roots of this quadratic equation, which only has two roots, at least two must be identical. 19. We note that this is equivalent to 1 *\u0000c\u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 tc\u00001 \u0000 i\u00001 n \u0000 j\u00001 n ai a j \u0000 \u0000\u0000 pi\u0000p j\u0000 t \u0000 t \u0000 0. Observe that this simplifies to 1 *\u0000c\u0000 \u0000 0 \u0000 tc\u00001 \u0000 i\u00001 n ai a j \u0000\u0000pi t 2 \u0000 t \u0000 0, which is necessarily true. 20. The points in the lattice (regarded as vectors) clearly form a group under addition, so we need only calculate the minimum distance from the zero vector to another vector a. If the coordinates of a are all half-integers, \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 the minimum norm (squared length) of a is 8 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 2 \u0000 2. Similarly, the closest integer point in the lattice is \u00001, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0\u0000, with a norm of 2. Hence, the maximum value of r is 1 2 2 , so the volume of each sphere is \u0000 4 r8 4\u0000 \u0000 \u00004 384 . We now need to determine the number of lattice points per unit volume. The points in \u00008 and \u0000\u0000 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 8 each have one point per unit volume, so \u00008 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 8 has two points per unit volume. E8 comprises half of these points (those with an even sum of coordinates), so it has one point per unit volume. Hence, the sphere packing has a density of \u0000 4 384 . \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
