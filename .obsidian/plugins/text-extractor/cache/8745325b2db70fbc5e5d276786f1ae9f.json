Show ζ 2 3 + ζ3 + 1 = 0. Using this, deduce that Z[ζ3] is closed under multiplication. (Note the set of integer linear combinations of 1 and α, {a + b · α|a, b ∈ Z}, is not always closed under multiplication. For example when α = 3√2 or α = e2πi/5, α2 is not a linear combination of 1 and α.) Exercise 7.2. For α ∈ Z[ζ3], let α be the complex conjugate of α, and deﬁne the norm by N (α) = |α|2 = αα. (The norm of a + bζ3 is not (a + bζ3)(a − bζ3).) Show α ∈ Z[ζ3] for any α ∈ Z[ζ3]. Compute ζ 3, N (ζ3) and N (1 + ζ3). Write down a formula for N (a + bζ3) where a, b ∈ Z. Exercise 7.3. Determine the units of Z[ζ3] (the elements of norm 1). Exercise 7.4. Exercise 7.4.1. This resolves the non-unique factorization of 4 = 2·2 = (1+√−3)(1−√−3) in Z[ √−3] by going to Z[ζ3]. Exercise 7.5. What are the possible remainders mod π = √−3 in Z[ζ3]? (Hint: they will be the elements whose norm is less than that of π.) Show that for any z, x ∈ Z (or even Z[ζ3]) z − x ≡ z − xζ3 ≡ z − xζ 2 3 , which we need in the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem for n = 3. (If you need at hint, look at p. 131.) Exercise 7.6. Fermat’s Last Theorem says xn + yn = zn has no solutions in N if n > 2. Show that if d|n then a solution to xn + yn = zn give a solution to xd + yd = zd. Deduce that Fermat’s Last Theorem is true for n ≡ 0 mod 3. Also deduce that to prove Fermat’s Last Theorem, it suﬃces to prove it for n = 4 and n = p where p is any odd prime. Exercise 8.1. Let p be an odd prime. We say a is a square or quadratic residue mod p if a ≡ x2 mod p for some x. Prove there are p+1 2 distinct squares mod p. Exercise 8.2. Let p be an odd prime. Show x2 + y2 ≡ −1 mod p for some x, y ∈ Z. (Hint: use the previous exercise and the pigeonhole principle.) 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
