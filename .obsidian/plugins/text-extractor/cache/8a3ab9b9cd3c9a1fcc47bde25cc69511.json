As in Solution 2 above L must be nonempty. If there is a player B in L that beat a player C in W then A, B, C form the required three-cycle, and we are done. Suppose then that there is no such player, and consider the tournament consisting of just the players in L. Since each player in L beat at least one other player, and did not beat either A or a player in W , each player in L must have beaten some other player in L. Moreover, for this to be possible there must be at least 3 players in L. The induction hypothesis then gives us a three-cycle within L, and we are done. Solution 4. Suppose there is no three-cycle, We will show that it is possible to label the players P1, P2, . . . , Pn in such a way that Pi beat Pj if i < j. Then Pn will have lost all of his or her games, contradicting the fact that every player wins at least one game. To construct the labelling, choose an arbitrary player as P1. Suppose now that for some 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1 we have chosen k players P1, . . . , Pk such that Pi beat Pj if i < j. Each player won at least one game, and since P1, . . . , Pk−1 all beat Pk, there must be some as- yet unlabelled player Q such that Pk won against Q. If i < k then Pi must also have won against Q, otherwise P1, Pk, Q form a three-cycle, and this implies that we may choose Q as player Pk+1. By induction this gives us the required labelling, and the problem is solved. 3. The cells of an n × n table are to be ﬁlled with the numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4 in such a way that whenever four cells share a common vertex they are to contain all four numbers. How many ways are there to ﬁll in the table? Solution: We ﬁrst show that the table is correctly ﬁlled in if and only if at least one of the following conditions is fulﬁlled: (a) Each row of the table has exactly two numbers alternating throughout the entire row. One pair of numbers appears in the even numbered rows, and the other pair in the odd numbered rows. (b) Each column of the table has exactly two numbers alternating throughout the entire column. One pair of numbers appears in the even numbered columns, and the other pair in the odd numbered columns. To prove this, we may assume without loss of generality that the upper left 2 × 2 square is ﬁlled in as follows: Without loss of generality this gives us the conﬁgurationof weight 1/2i become a single cookie of weight 1/2i−1. On the other hand, if a cookie is passed away from A0, then the total weight decreases. So W is non-increasing. Suppose ﬁrst that m < 2n, and that all of the cookies are initially given to An. Then W = m/2n < 1 initially, and it is impossible for A = A0 to receive a cookie, because then the ﬁnal weight would be at least 1. We must now show that if m ≥ 2n, then no matter how the cookies are distributed there is a strategy for passing them such that A receives a cookie. We will show that this can always be done just by passing the cookies around one side of the circle, and to do this we modify W , letting W+ = n∑ i=0 ai To complete the proof we show that x0 ≥ 1. We have 1 ≤ W+ = n∑ i=0 xi on this path belonging to R′ 1. Additionally, R′ 1 doesn’t use em+1, because W doesn’t use this edge, and if P1 did, then it would have vm as a repeated vertex. Finally, R′ 1 cannot share an edge with the portion of R′ 2 coming from P2, because P1 is edge disjoint from P2, and the portion of Q from w to vk has no vertices in common with P2 except possibly w. This proves the claim. The existence of Q contradicts our choice of m, and so there can be no path from α to ω that omits em+1. This completes the proof. Lemma 7.1. If X does not contain a triangle then |X| < 100. Proof. First note that if X is triangle-free then it cannot contain sets Ai, Aj, Ak such that Ai ∩ Aj = Aj ∩ Ak = Ak ∩ Ai = {x}. This is because X must also contain a set Am that omits x but meets each of Ai, Aj, Ak, and then Ai, Aj and Am will form a triangle, because the elements in common between Am and each of Ai, Aj, Ak will all be distinct. Suppose next that X contains sets Ai, Aj such that |Ai ∩ Aj| = 1. Without loss of generality we may assume that these sets are A1 = {1, 2, 3} and A2 = {1, 4, 5}. Now X must contain some set Ak that does not contain 1, and any such set must meet both A1 and A2, so must contain at least one of 2 and 3, and at least one of 4 and 5. In addition, it must contain either {2, 3} or {4, 5}, or A1, A2 and Ak will form a triangle. This means that X contains at most four sets that omit 1, and we may assume that one of them is A3 = {2, 3, 4}. Applying the same argument to A2 and A3 we see that there are at most four sets that omit 4. Any further sets belonging to X must then contain {1, 4}; there are at most 34 such sets, so X certainly can’t contain more than 2 + 4 + 4 + 34 = 44 < 100 sets. Lastly we must consider the case where no two sets in X intersect in a set of size 1. Without loss of generality {1, 2, 3} ∈ X. Then X must contain some set omitting 1 but meeting {1, 2, 3} in a set of size 2; without loss of generality this set is {2, 3, 4}. Additionally we require a set omitting 2, and this must meet {1, 2, 3} in {1, 3}, and {2, 3, 4} in {3, 4}, so can only be {1, 3, 4}. A similar argument forces {1, 2, 4} to belong to X, and at this point we can add no further sets without violating the condition |Ai ∩Aj| > 1. In this case X contains at most four sets (which can be regarded as the faces of a tetrahedron), so the lemma is proved. Proof. Since X contains a triangle with vertices a, b, c there must be some d /∈ {a, b, c} such that {b, c, d} ∈ Xbc. Elements of Xa must therefore have the form {a, d, x}, for x /∈ {a, b, c, d}. We consider two cases, according to whether or not {b, c, d} is the only element of Xbc. If {b, c, d} is the only element of Xbc then every set of the form {a, d, x} may belong to Xa. This gives us at most 32 sets in Xa, with the equality |Xa| + |Xbc| = 33 realised if and only if Xa contains all such sets. This is condition (a) above. If Xbc contains a second set {b, c, e} and no other then Xa may contain only the set {a, d, e}, and |Xa| + |Xbc| ≤ 3. If Xbc contains any additional sets then Xa must be empty, and in this case |Xa| + |Xbc| is maximised when Xbc contains all sets of the form {b, c, x}, as in condition (b) above.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
