WHOLE RATIONAL EXPRESSIONS The problems presented in this section are mainly on the identity transformations of whole rational expressions. These are the elementary operations we have to use here: addition, multiplication, division and subtraction of mono- mials and polynomials, as well as raising them to various powers and resolving them into factors. As regards trigono- metric problems, we take as known the definition of trigonc- metric functions, principal relationships between these functions, all thJ properties connected with their periodi- city, and all corollaries of the addition theorem. Attention should be drawn only to the formulas which enable us to transform a product of trigonometric functions into a sum or a difference of these functions. Namely: 1 cos A cos B=-:r[cos (A+B) +cos (A-B)], sin A cos B =+ [sin (A + B) + sin (A- B)]. sin A sin B = -} [cos (A - B) - cos (A + B)]. 1.

RATIONAL FRACTIONS 15 Transformations of fractional rational expressions to be considered in this section are based on standard rules of operations with algebraic fractions. Let us draw our attention only to one point which we have to- use (see Problems 15, 16, 17). If we have a first-degree binomial in x Ax+ B and if we know that it vanishes at two different values of x (say, at x = a and x = b), then we may state that the coefficients A and B are equal to zero. Indeed, from the equalities Aa + B = 0, Ab + B = 0 we get A (a - b) = 0 and since a - b =1= 0, then A = O. Substituting this value into one of the equalities (*), we find B = O. Similarly, we may assert that if a second-degree trinomial in x Ax 2 + Bx + C vanishes at three distinct values of x (say, at x = a, x = b and x = c), then A = B = C = O. Indeed, we then have Aa2 + Ba + C = 0, Ab 2 + Bb + C = 0, Ac2 + Bc + C = O. Subtracting term by term, we have A (a2 - b2) + B (a- b) = 0, A (a2 - c2) + B (a - c) =0. 16 Problems Since a - b =1= 0, a - c =1= 0, we have A (a + b) + B = 0, A (a + c) + B = O. Hence A = 0 (since b - c =1= 0), and then we find B = 0 and C = o. Analogously, we can show that if a third-degree poly- nomial Ai' + Bx2 + Cx + D vanishes at four different values of x, then A = B = C = D = 0, and, in general, if an nth-degree polynomial vanishes at n + 1 different values of x, then its coefficients are equal to zero (see Sec. 6). Finally, considered in this section are a number of pro- blems pertaining finite continued fractions. We take as known the information on these fractions contained usually in elementary textbooks. The principal trigonometric relations used in solving triangles are also taken here as known. 1. Prove the identity 3_ ( pS-2 q3 )3 (2 p3 _ q3 )3 3 P .-- P p3 + q3 + q p3 + q3 + q . 2.

RADICALS. INVERSE TRIGONOMETRIC FUNCTIONS. LOG~RITHMS The symbol ;Y A is understood here (if n is odd) as the only real number whose nth power is equal to A. In this case A can be either less or greater than zero. If n is even, then the symbol ;Y A is understood as the only positive number the nth ·power of which is equal to A. Here, neces- sarily, A ~ O. Under these conditions, for instance, VA2=A if A>O, . VA2= -A if A<O. All the rest of the standard rules and laws governing the operations involving radicals, fractional and negative exponents are considered here to be known. Let us also remind of two formulas which sometimes turn out to be 3. Radicals. Inverse Trigonometric Function,~. Lo{{aruhms 29 rather useful in performing various transformations, namely: Y- V _1/ A+VA2_H -01\" A-VA2_H A+ B-\" 2 + V 2 ' V V .. I\" A + V A2_H A- B= V 2 As far as trigonometric functions are concerned, let us first of all consider the reduction formulas: 1 ° The functions sin x and cos x are characterized by the period 2n, whereas tan x and cot x by the period n so that we may write the following equalities sin (x + 2kn) = sin x, cos (x + 2kn) = cos x, tan (x + kn) = tan x, cot (x + kn) = cot x, where k is any whole number (positive, negative or zero). 2° For the functions sin x and cos x the quantity n is the half-period, i.e. the rejection of the quantity +n in the argument results in a change in the sign of a function. Consequently, sin (x + kn) =(_1)k sin x, cos (x + kn) = (_1)k cos x, where k is any whole number (positive, negative or zero). 3° The functions sin x, tan x and cot x are odd functions, and cos x is an even function. Therefore sin (-x) = -sin x, tan (-x) = -tan x, cot (-x) = -cot x, cos (-x) = cos x. 4° If x and yare two quantities entering the relationship then cos x = sin y, tan x = cot y, sin x = cos y, cot x = tan y. Using these remarks, we can always reduce sine or cosine of any argument to sine or cosine of an argument lying in the interval between 0 and ~. The same can be said about tangent and cotangent. 30 Problems Indeed, any argument c.t can be written in the following form n c.t=s·-+c.to 2 - , where s is an integer, and 0 ~ c.to ~ ~, wherefrom follows the stated proposition. Let us also mention the following formulas (k an integer): sin kn = 0, tan kn = 0, cos 1m = (-1)\", . kn 0 Sill 2= kn \"-1 sin -2- = ( - 1) 2 kn ~ cosT=(-1)2 kn cos 2 =0 if k is even, if k is odd, if k is even, if k is odd. Further, we use the symbol arcsin x to denote an arc whose sine is equal to x and which lies in the interval 11: n between - 2 and + 2\" . Thus, in all cases Similarly - ~ ~ arcsin x ~ + ~ . n n - 2 < arctan x < + 2\" ' O~arccos x~n, 0< arccotx < n.

Thus, when dividing a by 2 only two cases are possible: either a is divisible exactly, or leaves a remainder equal to 1. In the first case we write a = 0 (mod 2), in the second a == 1 (mod 2). The division by 3 can also yield a remainder (0, 1, 2), and, consequently, only three cases are possible: a = 0 (mod 3), a == 1 (mod 3), a == 2 (mod 3) and so on. Consider tho following problom.

EQUATIONS AND SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST DEGREE The general form of a first-degree equation in one un- known is Ax + B = 0, where A and B are independent of x. To solve the first- degree equation means to reduce it to this form, since then the expreS$ion for the root becomes explicit B x = - A' 4. Equations and Systems of Equations of the First Degree 41 Therefore the problem of solving the fust-degrre equation is one of transforming the given exprpssion to the form Ax + B = O. In doing so great attention should be paid to make sure that all the equ<1tions involved are equivalent. The prc,blem of solving a system of rquations also consists to a considerable extent in transforming a system into an equivalent one. This section deals not only with equations of the first degree in the unknown x, but also with the equations which can be reduced to them by means of appropriate transforma- tions (such are equations involving radicals, trigonometric equations and ones involving exponential and logarithmic functions). Here and in the following section we consider a trigonometric equalion solvrd if we find the value of one of the trigonometric functions of an expression linear in x. I ndeed, if it is known that tan (mx + n) = A, then we flOd mx + n = arctan A + kn, where k is any intl'ger. Consequently, all the required values of x are given by formula arctan A - n -l kn x -= -----'-- m Likewise, if it is found that cot (mx+ n) = A, then mx+ n = arccot A + kn and arc cot A - n + kn x = ------'-- But if it is known that sin(mx+n)=A, m then all the values of x satisfying the last equation are found by the formula mx + n = (_1)11 arcsin A + kn, where k, as before, is any integer. 42 l'roblems Analogously, fl'Orn the equatioll cos (rnx + n) = A follows rnx + n = +arccos A + 21m.

EQUATIONS AND SYSTEMS OF EQUATIONS OF THE SECOND DEGREE The present section contains mainly problems on solving quadratic equations and using the properties of the second- degree trinomial. I t should be remembered that if the roots of the trinomial ax? + bx +\" c* are imaginary, then this trinomial retains its sign at any real values of x. As is easily seen in this case the sign of the trinomial coincides with that of the constant term (i.e. with the sign of c). Thus, if c > 0 and the roots of the trinomial ax2 + bx + c are imaginary, then ax? + bx + c > 0 for any real x. When solving systems of equations the following proposi- tion should be taken into account. Let a system of m equa- tions in m unknowns be under consideration, the degrees of these equations being, respectively, kj, k2' ... , k m • Then our system, generally speaking, allows for k t k 2 . .. k.n solution sets. To be more precise, the product of the degrees of the equations is the maximal number of solutions. Sometimes this limit is reached (see Problem 23), but some- times it is not. Nevertheless, this proposition is of impor- tance, since it prevents the loss of solutions. 1.

COMPI.JEX NUMBERS AND POL YNOMIALS We proceed here from the assumption that the principal operations with complex numbers (i.e, addition, multipli- cation, division and evolution) are already known to t.he reader. Likewise, we take as known the trigonometric form of a complex number and de Moivre's form1lla. III factoring polynomials and solving cel'tain higher-degree equations an important role is played by the so-called remainder theorem (stated by the French mathematician Bezout), usually considered in textbooks of elementary algebra. Let us recall it: if f (x) is a polynomial in x and if f (a) = 0, then f (x) is exactly divisible by x-a. Hence (assuming that the polynomial has one root) follows the possibility of resolving an nth-degree polynomial into n, equal or unequal, linear factors as well as the following propositio,n used here repeatedly: if it is known that a certain nth-degree polyno- mial ill x vanishes at n + 1 different values of x, then such a polynomial identically equals zero. Consequently, if two polynomials of the nth degree oi x attain equal values at n + 1 different values of x, then such polynomials are identically equal to each other, that is, the coefftcients of equal powers of x coincide. Finally, let us mention the relationship bet- ween the roots of an nth-degree equation and its coeffi- cients. Let the polynomial Xll + p/x ll - 1 -1. P2Xn-2 + . , . + Pn-IX + pn have the roots Xl, X2, ••• , X n , so that there exists the facto- rization ' X n + PIX n - 1 + P2x'H + ... + pn = (X-Xl} (X-X2)' • • (X- x n ).

PROGRESSIONS AND SUMS Solution of problems regarding the arithmetic and geo- metric progressions treated in the present section requires only knowledge of elementary algebra. As far as the summing of finite series is concerned, it is performed using the method of finite differences. Let it be required to find the sum Problems f (1) + f (2) + ... + f (n). Find the function F (k) which would satisfy tbe relationship F (k + 1) - F (k) = j-(k). Then it is obvious that f (1) + f (2) + ... + f (n) = [F (2) - F (1)] + + [F (3) - F (2)] + ... + [F (n + 1) - F (n)] = = F (n + 1) - F (1). 1. Let a2 , b2 , c2 form an arithmetic progression.

INEQUALITIES Let us recall the basic properties of inequalities. 1° If a> band b > c, then a> c. 2° If a > b, then a + m > b + m. 03 3° If a> b, then am> bm for m > ° and am < bm for m < 0, i.e., when multiplying both members of the inequa- lity by a negative number, the sign of the inequality is reversed. 4° If a> b > 0, then aX> bX if X> 0. This last inequality is readily proved for a rational x. Indeed, let us first assume that X = m is a whole positive number. Then am - bm = (a- b) (am- 1 + am- 2b + ... + bm - 1). But either of the bracketed e4pressions on the right exceeds zero, therefore am_bm > ° and am> bm . We now put x=~. Then aX-bx=r;/li-y/\"b. m We have (a- b) = (';Ili-y/b) (';I am- 1 + ... +y/b m - 1). Hence, actually, it follows that 94 Problems Let, finally, x=.!!.... We have q p p aX_bx=aq -bq =YaP-Yb P • But aP > bP (as has been proved), consequently, YaP> > ;Y bP • To prflve this inequality for an irrational x we may consider x as a limit of a sequence of rational numbers and pass to the limit. 5° If a > 1 and x > y > 0, then aX > aY; but if ° < < a < 1 and x> y > 0, then aX < aY. The proof is basically reduced to that of aU- > 1 if a> ° and a> 1 and can be obtained from 4°. 6° log\" x > log\" y if x > y and a > 1; and loga x < < log\" y if x > y and ° < a < 1. Out of the problems considered in this section, utmost interest undoubtedly lies with Problem 30 both with respect to the methods of its solution and to the number of corollaries.

LIMITS We take as known the concept of a variable and its limit, as well as the basic theorems on limits which are usually treated in elementary textbooks of algebra (the limit of a S11m, product and quotient). Let us here remind the reader .. 10. Lim!ts 111 of one of the indications for a limit to exist: if a variable increases but remains smaller than a certain constant, then such a variable has a limit (likewise, a variable which, when decreasing, remains greater than a certain constant also has a limit). When dealing with an infinitely decreasing geometric progression and, in general, with simple i nfmite series, one should bear in mind that the symbolic notation Ut + U2 + U3 + ... + un + .. . denotes none other than lim (Ut + U2 + ... + un) if n-->oo such a limit exists. If there is no limit, then the series Ut + U2 + U3 + ... + Un + ... is said to be divergent, and it is useless to speak of its nume- rical value. 1. Let Xn = an and I a I < 1.

If we remove the brackets from the right member and apply the formula for a square of a polynomial, then it is easily seen that all the doubled products are cancelled out, and we get the required identity. 3. If the identity of the preceding problem is used, then from the condition of our problem it follows that whence either a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 0, or x 2 + y2 + Z2 + + t2 = 0. But the sum of the squares of real numbers equals zero only when each of the numbers is equal to zero. Therefore, from t~e equality a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 0, we get a = b = = c = d = 0, and from the equality x2 + y2 + Z2 + t2 = = ° we have x = y = z = t = 0. Hence follows the required result. 4. This identity can be checked directly, and also can be obtained from identity (2) if we put in it d = t = ° and replace y by -y and z by -z. 5. If we expand the right member of the equality, then all doubled products are cancelled out and the validity of the identity becomes obvious. 6. Put in identity (5) al = a2 = a3 = ... = an = 1, bl = a, b2 = b, ... , bn - I = k, bn = I. We then get n (a2 + b2 + c2 + ... + k2 + 12) = = (a + b + ... +/)2 + (b _ a)2 + + (c - a)2 + ... + (k - 1)2. 118 Solutions But since by hypothesis n (a2 + b2 + ... + k 2 + 12) = (a + b + ... + k + l)2, we have (b - a)2 + (c - a)2 + ... + (k - 1)2 = O. Hence a = b = c = . . . = k = l. 7. Make use of identity (5). By hypothesis a; + a~ + ... + a; = 1, b: + b; + ... + b; = 1. Therefore we have (atb! + a2b2 + ... + a\"b,,)2 = = 1 - (a!b 2 - a2bl)2 - (a 1b3 - a3bl)2 - ... - - (an-Ibn - anb,,_!)~. Whence o ~ (atbt + a2b2 + ... + a\"b,,)2 ~ 1. Thus, -1 ~ atb! + a2b2 + ... + anb\" ~ +1. 8. We have (y + z - 2X)2 - (y - Z)2 + (z + x - 2y)2 - (z - X)2 + + (x -+ y - 2Z)2 - (X-y)2=O. But (y + z - 2X)2 - (y - Z)2 = 4 (y -- x) (z - x) (using the formula for a difference of squares). Likewise we find (z + x - 2y)2 - (z - X)2 = 4 (z - y) (x - y), (x + y - 2Z)2 - (x - y)2 = 4 (x - z) (y - z). Consequently, 4 (y - x) (z - x) + 4 (z - y) (x - y) + -+ 4 (x - z) (y - z) = 0 Removing the brackets, we get 2x2 + 2y2 + 2Z2 - 2xz - 2yz - 2xy = 0 Solutions to Sec. 1 119 or (x - y)2 + (x _ Z)2 + (y _ Z)2 = 0, whence x = y = Z = o. 9. The first identity is obvious. Let us rewrite the second one in the following way (6a2 - 4ab + 4b2)3 - (4a2 - 4ab + 6b2)3 = = (3a2 + 5ab - 5b2)3 + (5a2 - 5ab _ 3b2)3. Applying the formula for a difference of cubes to the left member and the formula for a sum of cubes to the right member, we find that it suffices to prove tho following iden- tity (3a2 - 2ab + 2b2)2 + (3a2 - 2ab + 2b2) (2a2 - 2ab +3b2) + + (2a2 - 2ab + 3b2)2 = (5a2 - 5ab _ 3b2)2 - - (5a2 - 5ab - 3b2) (3a2 + 5ab - 5b2) + + (3a 2 + 5ab - 5b2)2. This identity is proved by directly removing the brackets. 10. To see whether the identity under consideration is valid, we may rewrite it as (p2 _ q2)4 = (p2 + pq + q2)4 _ (2pq +q2)4 + + (p2 + pq + q2)4 _ (2pq + p2)4. It remains to simplify tho right member and to show that it is equal to the left one. Using the formula A 4 - B4 = (A + B) (A - B) (A 2+B2), we get the following expression for the right member (p2 + 3pq + 2q2) (p2 _ pq) [(p2 + pq + q2)2 + + (2pq + q2)2] + (2p2 + 3pq + q2) (q2 - pq) X X [(p2 + pq + q2)2 + (2pq + p2)2] = (p + 2q) X X P (p2 _ q2) [(p2 + pq + q2)2 + (2pq + q2)2] + + (2p + q) q (q2 _ p2) [(p2 + pq + q2)2 + + (2pq + p2)2] = (p2 _ q2) {(p2 + pq + q2)2 X X [p2 + 2pq2_ 2pq _ q2] + (p2 + 2pq) (q2 + 2pq) X X [2pq + q2_ 2pq _ p2]} = (p2 _ q2)2 {(p2 + pq+q2)2 _ _ (p2 + 2pq) (el + 2pq)} = (p2 _ q2)4. 120 Solutions 11. Check by direct substitution. 12. Check by substitution. 13. 10 The cases n = 0, 1, 2 are readily checked directly. At n = 4 let us rewrite the identity in the following way (ix - ky)4 - (ix - kZ)4 + (iy - kZ)4 - - (iy - kX)4 + (iz - kX)4 - - (iz - ky)4 = 0. Transform the first two terms (ix - ky)4 - (ix - kZ)4 = [(ix - ky)2 + + (ix - kZ)2] (2ix - ky - kz) k (z - y). (1) By virtue of the equality x + y + z = 0, we get 2ix - ley - kz = (2i + k) x. The expression in square brackets can be rewritten as follows (2i2 + 2ik) x2 + k2 (y2 + Z2). Thus, we have (ix - ky)4 - (ix - kZ)4 = = k (2i + k) (y2 - Z2) [(2i2 + 2ik) x2 + k2 (y2 + Z2)J. (1') I t remains to transform the following expressions (iy - kZ)4 - (iy - kx)4, (2) (iz - kX)4 - (iz - ky)4. (3) But it is easily seen that expression (2) is obtained from the first one, already considered, by means of a circular permu- tation of the letters x, y and z, i.e. when x is replaced by y, y by z, and z by x. Expression (3) is obtained from (2) also through such a permutation. Therefore, there is no need to repeat computations for simplifying expressions (2) and (3); it is sufficient only to apply appropriate permuta- tions to the result obtained. We then have (iy - kZ)4 - (iy - kX)4 = = k (2i + k) (Z2 - x2) [(2i2 + 2ik) y2 + + k2 (Z2 + x2»), (2') Solutions to Sec. 1 (iz - kX)4 - (iz - ky)4 = = k (2i + k) (x2 - y2) [(2i 2 + 2ik) Z2 + + k2 (x2 + y2)1. And adding expressions (1'), (2') and (3'), we get k (2i + k) {(2i 2 + 2ik) [(y2 - Z2) x2 + (Z2 _ x 2) y2 + + (x2 _ y2) Z2] + + k2 (y4 _ Z4 + Z4 _ X4 + + X4 _ y4)} = O. 121 (3') 2° At n = 0 the relation is obvious. Let us denote, for brevity, the sum in the left member of the equality by 2: (x + k)n, and the sum in the right member by ~ (x + l)n. At n = 1 we have to prove that 8x + ~ k = 8x + 2: l, i.e. we have to prove that Lk = h l. Finally, we have to check that But 2}k = 2} l. L k = 3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 60, 2: 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 8 + 11 -+ 13 + 14 = 60. At n = 2 we have to prove that ~ (x + k)2 = ~ (x + l)2, i.e. that 8x2 + 2x L k + L k2 = 8x2 + 2x L 1 + L l2. And so, it remains to prove that ~k2 = ~ l2, 122 Solutions which is easily checked directly. Likewise, to prove the last case (n = 3) we have only to show that 14. The first idenLity is proved in the following way (a + b + c + d)2 + (a + b - c - d)2 + + (a + c - b - d)2 + (a + d - b - C)2 = = [(a + b) + (c + d)12 + [(a + b) - (c + d)12 + -+ [(a - b) + (c - d)12 -+ [(a - b) - (c - d)J2 = = 2 (a + b)2 + 2 (c -+ d)2 + 2 (a - b)2 + 2 (c - d)2 = = 2 [(a + b)2 + (a - b)2] -+ 2 [(c -+ d)2 + + (c - d)2] = 4 (a 2 + b2 + c2 + d2 ). The second and third identities are also proved by a direct check with some preliminary transformations. 15. Rewrite our equality as follows [(a -+ b -+ C)4 - (a4 -+ b4 + c4)] -+ [(b + c - a)4 - - (a4 +- b4 -+ c4)] + [(c -+ a _ b)4 - - (a 4 + b4 + c4)] + [(a + b - C)4 - - (a 4 -+ b4 + c4)] = 24 (a 2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2). Consider the first term. 'Ve have (([2 + b2 + c2 -1- 2ab -+ 2ac + 2bc)2 _ a4 _ b4 _ c4 = = (ja 2b2 + 6a2c2 +- Gb2c2 + 4ac (a 2 -+ c2) + + 4ab (a 2 + b2) + 4bc (b2 + c2) -I- 12a2bc + -+ 12b2ac + 12c2ab. The remaining terms are obtained from the first one by means of successive substitutions: -a for a, -b for b, -c for c. Adding the terms, we make sure that our identity is valid. Solutions to Sec. 1 123 16. We have s (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + s (s - 2e) (s - 2a) + + s (s - 2a) {s - 2b) = (s - 2a) (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + + 2a (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + s (s - 2a) (2s - 2e - 2b) = = (s - 2a) (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + 2a (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + + s (s - 2a) 2a. Transform the sum 2a (s - 2b) (s - 2e) + s (s - 2a) 2a = = 2a [(s - 2b) (s - 2e) + s (s - 2a)] = = 2a [(s - 2b) (s - 2e) + (s - 2a) (s - 2b) + + 2b (s - 2a)] = 2a [(s - 2b) (2s - 2e - 2a) + + 2b (s - 2a)] = 2a [(s - 2b) 2b + 2b (s - 2a)] = = 2a ·2b [s - 2b - 2a] = 4ab ·2e = 8abe. 17. Expanding the expression in the left member in powers of s, we get 0+b+~~-~~+~+~+~+~+~+ + 2,il - 2S2 (a + b + c) + + 2s (ab + ae + be) -- 2abe. Since a + b + e = 2s, we have 2,il - 28 (a2 + \"b2 + e2) + a3 + b3 + e3 +- 283 - 4.il + +2s (ab + ae + be) - 2abe = -28 (a2 + b2 + e2) + + a:l + b:l + e:l + 2s (ab + ae + be) - 2abe = = a3 + b3 + e3 + (a + b + c) (ab + ae + be - - a2 _ b2 - e2) - 2abe. Directly transforming the last expression, we make sure tha tit is equal to abc (see also Problem 20). 18. We have (202 _ 2a2) (202 _ 2b2) = (a2 + e2 _ b2) (b2 + e2 _ a2) = = e4 _ (a 2 _ b2)2, 124 Solutions Using a circular permutation, we obtain (202 _ 2b2) (202 _ 2c2) = a4 _ (b2 _ C2)2, (202 _ 2c2) (202 _ 2a2) = b4 _ (C2 _ a2)2. Hence 4 [(02 - a2) (02 - b2) + (02 - b2) (02 _ C2) + But +(02 _ C2) (02 _ a2)] = a4 + b4 + C4 _ (a2 _ b2)2 _ _ (b2 _ C2)2 _ (C2 _ a2)2 = -a 4 _ b4 _ C4 + -+ 2a2b2 + 2a2c2 -+ 2b2c2 = _[a 4 _ 2 (b2 + c2)a2 -+ + (b2 _ C2)2] = _[a 4 _ 2 (b2 _ c2) a2 + -+ (b2 _ C2)2 _ 4a2c2] = 4a2c2 _ (a2 _ b2 + C2)2 = = (2ac + a2 - b2 + c2) (2ac - a2 + b2 _ c2) = = (a + b + c) (a + c-=- b) (b - a + c) (b + a - c). a -+ b + c = 28, a + b - c = 2 (8 - c), a + c - b = 2 (8 - b), b + c - a = 2 (8 - a) and we see that the identity is valid. 19. We have: (x + y + Z)3 = x3 + y3 + Z3+ 3x2 (y + z) + + 3y2 (x + z) + 3z2 (x + y) + 6xyz. Hence (x + y -+ Z)3 - x3 - y3 _ Z3 = 3 {X2y -+ x2z + y2x -]_ y2z + -+ Z2X -+ Z2y + 2xyz} = 3 {z (x2 + y2 + 2xy) + + Z2 (x + y) + xy (x + y)} = 3 (x + y) {z (x + y) -+ + Z2 + xy} = 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z). Thus, (x + y + Z)3 - x3 - y3 - Z3 = 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z). Solutions to Sec. 1 125 20. We have (x + y + Z)3 = X3 + y3 + Z3 + 3xy (x + y + z) + Consequently + 3xz (x + y + z) + 3yz (x + y + z)- - 3xyz. 3-3 + y3 + Z3 - 3xyz = (x + y + Z)3 - 3 (x + y + Z) X X (xy + xz + yZ) = (x + y +.z) X X (X2 + y2 + Z2 - xy - XZ - yz). 21. Put a + b - c = x, b + c - a = y, c + a - b = = z. It is readily seen that x + y + z = a + b + c and, hence, we have to simplify the following expression (x + y + Z)3 _ x3 _ y3 _ Z3. On the basis of Problem 19 we have (x + y + Z)3 - x3 - y3 - Z3 = 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z) But x + y = 2b, x + z = 2a, y + z = 2c, therefore, (a + b + C)3 - (a + b - C)3 - (b + c - a)3 - - (c + a - b)3 = 24abc. 22. On the basis of Problem 19 we have x3 + y3 + Z3 = (x + y + Z)3 - 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z). Putting here x = b - c, y = c - a, z = a - b, we find x + y + z = 0, x + y = b - a, x + z = a - c, y + z = c - b. Hence (b - C)3 + (c - a)3 + (a - b)3 = = 3 (a - b) (a - c) (c - b). 23. Readily obtained from Problem 20. But it is possible to use the following method (a + b + c) (a2 + b2 + c2) = 0. 126 Solutions since a + b + e = 0. Hence, a3 + b3 + e3 + ab (a + b) + ae (a + e) + be (b + e) = 0. But a + b = -e, a + e = -b, b + e = -a. Now the required identity is obvious. 24. We have (a + b + e)2 = 0, a2 + b2 + e2 = -2 (ab + ae + be). Squaring both members of the latter equality, we get (a 2 + b2 + e2)2 = 4 [a2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2 + 2a2be + + 2b2ae + 2e2abJ = 4 [a2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2 + + 2abe (a + b + e)J = 4 [a2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2J. On the other hand, (a2 + b2 + e2)2 = a4 + b4 + e4 + 2 (a 2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2). Hence 4 (a 2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2) = 2 (a 2 + b2 + e2)2 _ - 2 (a 4 + b4 + e4). Comparing it with the equality 4 (a 2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2) = (a2 + b2 + e2)2, we get the required result. 25. Since (a - b) -+- (b - e) + (e - a) = 0, the result follows immediately from Problem 21. 26. 1° We have (see Problem 23) a~ -+- b3 + e3 = 3abe. Whence (a3 + b3 + e3 ) (a 2 +- b2 + e2) = = 3abe (a 2 + b2 + e2). Solutions to Sec. 1 Then, transforming the left member, we obtain a5 + b5 + e5 + a2b2 (a + b) + a2e2 (a + c) + 127 + b2e2 (b + c) = 3abe (a 2 + b2 + e2) or a5 + b5 + e5 _ a2b2e _ a2e2b _ b2e2a =3abe (a 2 + b2 + e2). IIence a5 + b5 + e5 - abc (ab + ae + be) = 3abe (a 2 + b2 + e2). But -2 (ab + ae + be) = a2 + b2 + e2 • Hence follows the final result. 2° The answer follows immediately from Problem 23 and 1 0. 3° Let us write the relations 2 (a 4 + b4 + e4) = (a 2 + b2 + e2)2 (Problem 24), a3 + b3 + e3 = 3abe (Problem 23). Multiplying these equalities, we fwd 2 [a7 t- b7 + e7 + a3 b3 (a + b) + a3e3 (a + c) + + b3eS (b + e)l = 3abe (a 2 + b2 + e2 )2. Hence 2 [a7 + b7 + e7 - a3 b3e - a3eSb - b:1e3al = = 3abe (a 2 + b2 + C2)2 or 2 (a7 + b7 -\\- e7 ) - 2abe (a 2/)2 + a2e2 + b2e2) = = Babe (a 2 + /)2 + e2)2. But a2b2 + a2e2 + b2e2 = 1 (a 2 + b2 +- e2)2 (Problem 2,'J). Therefore 7 2 (a7 + b7 + e7 ) =-= ~ abc (a 2 + b2 + e2)2. Using the result of 1°, we tinally get the required relation 128 Solutions 27. For the sake of convenience let us introduce the sum- mation symbol. And so, we put k=n al+az+··· +a n = ~ ak· k=1 Using this symbol, we can now write k=n k=n a lb l + a zb2 + ... + allbn = ~ akbk = alb l + ~ akb k • k=1 k=2 But it is obvious that b k = (b l + b 2 + ... + b k) - (b l + b 2 + ... + b k - l ) = therefore our sum takes the following form k=n k=n-l k=n albl + ~ -ak (Sk - Sk-l) ~ alb l + ~ aksk - ~ akSk-1 + k=2 k=2 k=3 h=n-l + anSn -azsl = (al- a2) SI + anSn + ~ a\"sk- h=2 h=n-l ~n-l - ~ ak+Js\" = (al - a2) SI + ~ (ak - ah+l) Sh + a\"Sn = k=2 k=2 = (aJ - az) SI + (az - a3) S2 + ... + (an-t - an) S,,_I + ans\". 28. Readily proved if we remove the brackets in the left member and use the relation n al + a2 + ... + an = 2 ,s. 29. Substituting into the given expression x' and y' for x and y, we find that A' = Aa 2 + 2Bay + Cy2, C' = A~2 + 2B~ll + Cll2, B' = Aa~ + B (all + ~y) + Cyll. Making up the expression B'2 - A' C/, we easily check the required identity. Solutions to Sec. 1 129 30.

Let a < x < a + 1, where a is an integer. Subdivide the interval between a and a + 1 into n parts. Then x will lie in one of these subintervals, i.e. we can find a whole number p (0 < p < n - 1) such that a+L~x<a+ p+1. n -..::: n Therefore a+ p+1 ~x+~ <a+ p+2 n -...;::: n n ' Hence [X1=fx+!]= ... =[x+ n-~-1]=a f x+ n-;:p ] = ... = f x+ n-;:1 J =a+1.

On the other hand, from the inequality a+ ~ ~x<a+ p~1 132 Solutions we get an + p ~ nx < an + p + 1, hence, [nxl = an + p, and the formula is proved. 36. We have cos (a + b) cos (a - b) = = [cos a cos b - sin a sin bl X X [cos a cos b + sin a sin bl = cos2 a cos2 b - - sin 2 a sin 2 b = cos2 a (1 - sin 2 b) - - (1 - cos2 a) sin 2 b = cos2 a - sin 2 b. 37. Expanding the bracketed expressions in the left members, we easily prove the equalities. 38. We have (1-sin a) (i-sin b) (1-sin c) = (1- sin2 a) (1-sin 2 b) (1- sin2 c) (1 + sin a) (1 + sin b) (1 + sin c) cos2 a cos2 b cos2 C b = cos a cos b cos c = cos a cos cos c. 39. Multiplying both members of the given equality by (1 + cos a) (1 + cos ~) (1 + cos y), we get [(1 + cos a) (1 + cos ~) (1 + cos y))2 = = sin 2 a sin 2 ~ sin 2 y. 40. Using the formula sin x cos y = ~ [sin (x + y) + sin (x - y)l, we get 2 cos (a + ~) sin (a - ~) ~ sin 2a - sin 2~, 2 cos (~ + y) sin (~ - y) = sin 2~ - sin 2V and so on. Hence follows the identity. Sulutions to Sec. I 133 41. Using the formula sin x sin y = ~ [cos (x - y) - cos (x + y)l, we get the identity (cos 2b - cos 2a) (cos 2d - cos 2c) + + (cos 2b - cos 2c) (cos 2a - cos 2d) + + (cos 2b - cos 2d) (cos 2c - cos 2a) = O. Let cos 2b = a, cos 2a =~, cos 2d = y, cos 2c = 8, then (a - ~) (y - 8) + (a - 8) (~ - 1') + (a - 1') (8 - ~) = = (a - ~) (1' - 6) + (a - l' + l' - 6) (~ - 1') + + (a - 1') (6 - ~) = (a - ~) (y - 6) + + (a - 1') (~ - 1') + (1' - 6) (~ - 1') + + (a - y) (6 - ~) = O. But (a - ~) (1' - 6) + (1' - 6) (~ - 1') = (1' - 0) (a - 1') and (a - 1') (~ - 1') + (a - 1')-(8 - ~) = (a - 1') (6 - 1'); hence the required sum is equal to (a - y) (1' - 6) + + (a - 1') (6 - 1') = O. 42. 10 Summing the first two cosines, we get 2 cos l' cos (~ - a); the sum of the second two cosines yields 2 cos (a + ~) cos y. The further check is obvious_ 20 Analogous to 10. 43. We have sin ( A + ! ) + cos ( A + ~ ) = sin (A+ ! ) + + sin (~-A - ~ ) = 2 sin ~ cos (.::. - A - ~ ) 2 4 4 4 4' With the aid of a circular permutation we obtain (denoting the transformed sum by S) ~2 =- cos ( ~ - A - 1 ) + cos ( ~ - B - ~ ) + + cos ( ~ - C - ~ ) = 2 cos ( ~ - At B - B t C ) X X cos (A-;B +BtC)+sin (~ +C+:). 134 Solutions Making use of the relation A + B + C = n, we can show that cos (..::. _ A + B _ B + C ) = sin (..::. + i:.-+ ~ ) 42 8 828' Therefore we have -S-=2sin (..::.+~+~) cos (A-B + B-C) + V2 8 2 8 2 8 + 2 sin ( ~ + ~ + ~ ) cos ( ; + ~ + ~ ) = = 2 sin ( ~ + ~ + ~ ) [ cos ( A -; B + B -; C ) + + cos (\"::'+.£+~)J-4sin (~+~+!!-.-) X 828- 828 ,(11: B+C), (11: C+A) XSlll 8'+2 \"\"8 Sill 8'+2 \"\"8' 44.

We have sin 2a = 2 sin a cos a, sin 4a = 2 sin 2a cos 2a, sin 8a = 2 sin 4a cos 4a, sin 2n a = 2 sin 2\"-1 a cos 2n - 1a, Multiplying term by term and dividing both members by the product sin 2a sin 4a , , , sin 2n- 1a, we get sin 2n a = 2\" sin a cos a cos 2a .. , cos 2n - 1a, whence Solutions to Sec. 1 sin 2na cos a cos 2a ... cos 2n- 1a = -,,---,--- 2n sin a 135 46.

Hence a 2 + a'2 + a\"2 = (cos 2 cp cos2 1p + cos2 (P sin21P) + + (sin2 cp sin 2 1P cos2 6 + sin2 cp COS2 1P cos2 6) + + sin2 (P sin2 0 = cos2 cp + + (sin2 cp cos2 0 + sin2 cp sin2 6) = 1. The remaining equalities are proyed similarly. SOLUTIONS TO SECTION 2 1. Rewrite the identity in the following way 3 3 (2p3 - q3)3 _ 3 3 (p3 - 2q3)3 q +q (p3,q3)3 - P - P (p3+q3)3 . I t is evident that the right member can be obtained from the left one by permuting p and q. Let us reduce the left mE'mber to such a form, wherefrom it would be seen that after the permutation its vallie remains unchanged. Then the validity\"I:H the identity will become clear. We have q3 {( 3 + 3\")3 + (2 3 3)3} _ 9p3q3 (6 + 6 6,..6) (p3 + q3)3. P q p -q - (p3+q3)3 P q - P 'i . Solutions to Sec. 2 137 2.

We have to prove that 1+x 1+y 1+z_1 1-x' i-y '1-Z- - . Replacing x by its expression, we find \\~: = 1;. Since y and z are obtained from x by means of a circular permutation of the letters a, b, c, we have 1+y b 1-y =c' 1 +z c l-z a l-Ience, the required identity is obvious. 5. We have a+b+c+d a+b-c-d a-b+c-d a-b-c+d 138 Solutions But IOf ~ _- ~ then A+B C+D d 1 of B D' A-B = C-D' an converse y I there exists the second of these equalities, then the first one exists as well. Reasoning in the same way (putting A = a + b + e + d, B = a + b - e - d, C = a - b + e - d, D = a - b - e + d, we find a+b a-b a+b c+d --=--or-----c+d c-d a-b - c-d 0 Hence a C Il b T=(f or c=(f 0 6. The denominator has the form bey2 + bcz2 - 2beyz + aez2 + aex2 - 2aexz + abx2 + + aby2 - 2abxy = e (ax2 + by2) + b (ax2 + ez2) + + a (ez2 + by2) - 2beyz - 2aexz - 2abxy = = (a + b + e) (ax2 + by2 + ez2) - e2z2 _ b2y2 - - a2x 2 - 2beyz - 2aexz - 2abxy = (a + b + e) X X (ax2 + by2 + ez2) - (ax + by + ez)2o Since, by hypothesis, ax + by + cz = 0, the denominator turns out to be equal to (a + b + e) (ax2 + by2 + ez2), and our fraction is equal to 1 a+b+c 7. Reduce to a common denominator the expression on the left. The numerator of the fraction obtained will be equal to X2y2z2 (a2 _ b2) + b2 (x2 _ a2) (y2 _ a2) (Z2 _ a2) _ _ a2 (x2 _ b2) (y2 _ b2) (z2_b2)o It is obvious that (a2 _ x 2) (a2 _ y2) (a2 _ Z2) = = as _ (x2 + y2 + Z2) a' + (X2y2 + X2Z2 + y2Z2) a2 _ _ X 2y 2Z2. Solutions to Sec. 2 139 Hence (b2 ~ x 2) (b2 _ y2) (b2 _ Z2) = = b6 _ (x2 + y2 + Z2) b4 + + (X 2y 2 + X 2Z2 + y2Z2) b2 __ X 2y 2Z2. Substituting these expressions into the numerator and performing all the necessary transformations, we obtain the required value of the fraction. 111 8.8 0 = (a-b)(a-c) + (b-a)\\b-c) + (c-a) (c-b) Reducing the fractions to a common denominator, we have 1 8 0 = (a-b) (a-c) (b-c) {(b-c)-(a-c)+(a-b)}=O, abc 8 1 = (a-b) (a-c) + (b-a) (b-c) + (c-a) (c-b) = 1 = Ta-b) (a-c) (b-c) {a(b-c)-b(a-c)+c(a-b)}=O, a2 b2 c2 (a-b) (a-c) + (b-a) (b-c) + (c-a) (c-b) (a-b) (a~c) (b-c) {a2 (b- c) _b 2 (a - c) + c2 (a -b)}. Consid'er the numerator. We have a2 (b - c) - b2 (a - c) + c2 (a - b) = = ab (a - b) - c (a 2 - b2) + c2 (a - b) = = (a - b) (ab - ca - cb + c2) = = (a - b) [a (b - c) - c (b - c)] = = (a - b) (b - c) (a - c), wherefrom it follows that 8 2 = 1. 8 3 , 8 4 and 8 5 can be computed analogously, but we shall proceed here in a some- what different way. It is easily seen that there exists the following identity (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) = x 3 - (a + b +c )x2 + + (ab + ac + be) x - abc. 140 Solutions Putting, x = a, x = b and x = e, in turn, we get the fol- lowing equalities a3 - (a + b + e) a2 + (ab + ae + be) a - abe = 0, b3 - (a + b + e) b2 + (ab + ae + be) b - abe = 0, c3 - (a + b + e) e2 + (ab + ae + be) e - abe = 0. Further, divide the fust of them by (a - b) (a - e), the second by (b - e) (b - a) and the third by (e - a) X X (e - b), and add them term by term. Then S 3 - (a + b + e) S 2 + (ab + ae + be) S 1 - abe So = 0. But since it is known that So = S1 = 0, S2 = 1, we have: S3 = a + b + e. To compute S4 let us take the preceding identity and multiply its members by x. We obtain x (x - a) (x - b) (x - e) = X4 - (a + b + e) x 3 + + (ab + ae + be) x 2 - abex. Proceeding analogously, we find: S4 - (a + b + e) S3 + (ab + ae + be) S2 - abe S1 = 0. Hence S4 --/(a + b + e) S3 - (ab + ae + be) S2 = = (a + b + e)2 - ab - ae - be = = a2 + b2 + e2 + ab + ae + be. Likewise, for computing S 5 (multiplying the original iden- tity by X2), we find S 5 - (a + b + e) S 4 + (ab + ae + be) S 3 - abe S 2 = 0. Consequently S 5 = (a + b + e) (a 2 + b2 + e2 + ab + ae + be) - - (ab + ae + be) (a + b + e) + abe = = (a + b + e) (a 2 + b2 + e2) + abe = = a3 + b3 + c3 + a2b + a2e + b2a + b2e + + e2a + e2b + abe. Solutions to Sec. 2 141 9. This problem is solved analogously to the precerling one. Namply, the equalities So = SI -~ S2 = 0, S3 --- 1 are established by a direct check; and to compute S 4 we may resort to the following identity (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) (x - d) = Hence = X4 - (a -+ b + c + d) x3 + + (ab + ae + ad + be + bd + de) x 2 - - (abc + abd + aed + bed) x + abed S 4 = (a + b + e -j - d) S 3 = a + b + e + d. 10. Put as before am bm em Sm= (a-b) (a-c) + (b-a) (b-c) + (c-a) (c-b) Let us take the first term of our sum am and transform it am (a+b) (a+c) _ (a+b+c) am+ 1+a m- 1.abc (a-b) (a-c) - (a-b) (a-c) . Making use of a circular permutation, we get similar expressions for the second and third terms of am. Adding now all these terms, we find: am = (a + b + c) Sm+! -+ + abc S m-1- Hence (after some transformations) al = (a -+ b + c) S 2 + abc So = a + b + e (S 2 = 1, So = 0), a2 = (a + Q + c) S 3 -\\- abc SI = (a + b + e)2, since S3 = a + b + e, SI=O, a3 = (a + b + c) S 4 -+ abc S 2 = = (a -+ b -+ c) (a 2 + b2 -+ e2 -+ ab + ae + be) + abc, a 4 = (a -+ b + c) S 5 -+ abc S 3 = = (a + b + c) [(a + b -+ c) (a 2 + b2 + e2) + 2abel. 14~ Solutions 11.

Expand- ing the numerator of the first term in powers of a, we get a3 - (a + ~ + V) a2 + (a~ + aV + ~V) a - a~v· Performing an analogous operation with the remaining three terms and adding them, we find that the sum of the first four terms is equal to 8 3 - (a + ~ + V) 8 2 + (a~ + av + ~V) 8 1 - a~v8o, where 8 k is the known sum (see Problem 9, where it is neces- sary to put d = 0). Proceeding from the results of this problem, we find that the sum of the first four terms under consideration is equal to unity, and, consequently, the sought-for expression takes the form abe {1- ~~; } =abe-a~y. 12. Consider the following sum: a4 ~4 8 4 = (a-~) (a-I') (a-6) + (~-a) (~-y) (~-I\\) + 1'4 64 + (y-a) (y-~) (1'-6) + (6-a)(b-~)(6-y) . From Problem 9 we have: 8 4 = a + ~ + V + 6. Put a = = abe, ~ = abd, V = aed, 6 = bed. Then a 4 a4b4e4 (a-~) (a-y) (a-l) -- (abc-abd) (abc-acd) (abc-bed) - (e-d) (b-d) (a-d) . Using a circular permutation, we get analogous expression for the remaining three terms. Thus, the given identity is proved. Solutions to Sec. 2 143 13. 1° Transform one of the terms in the following way: 1 1 1 1 - - ---;---,----:----;-- a(a-b)(a-c) a (i--+) (+-+) Then the required sum is equal to 1 {(+)2 (})2 abC ( -} _}) ( + _ ~) + -( -:-! -_---:-!'--) --'--( -:-! _--:-! -) + (+)2 } __ 1 S + (+_-}) (+-i-) - abc 2' But (see Problem 8) S2 = 1, and, hence, we get: 1 1 1 1 a (a-b) (a-c) + b (b-c) (b-a) + c (c-a) (c-b) abc' However, this result can be obtained in a somewhat diffe- rent way. Let us consider the four quantities: a, h, c and 0, and form So for them. We then have S _ 1 + 0- a (a-b) (a-c) b (b-a) (b-c) + c (c-a) (c-b) + 1 + -:(\"'\"\"0 --a):-(\"\"'O---:b-;-) -:-;(o:---c\"\"-) = 0, since So = O. Hence we get the previous result. 2° Likewise the sum can be transformed as 144 Solutions And so t 1 1 0 2 (a-b) (a-e) + b2 (b-a) (b-c) + e2 (e-a) (e-b) ab+ae+be a2b2e2, A similar method can be applied when computing other sums of the form ___ 1 ___ + + 1 ok (a-h) (a--c) bit (h-a) (h-e) eil (e-a) (e-b) 14. We have alt bk (a-b) (a-c) (a-x) + (b-a) (b-e) (b-x) + k xlt e =0 + (e-a) (e-b) (e-x) + (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) at k = 1 and at Hence k = 2 (Problem 9). alt (a-b) (a-e) (x-a) + (b-a) (b-c) (x-b) + en + (e-a) (e-b) (x-e) 15. We have b+e+d (b-a) (e-a) (d-a) (x-a) (x-a) (x-b) (x-e) (1£=1,2). (a+b+e+ d-x)+(x-a) (b-a) (e-a) (d-a) (x-a) 1 =(a+b+c+d-x) (b-a) (e-a) (d-a) (x-a) + 1 + (b-a) (e-a) (d-a) Applying a circular permutation to the letters a, b, c, d and adding the expressions thus obtained, we find that the sum in the left member is equal ,to { t (a + b -f- c + d - x) + (a-b) (a-e) (a-d) (a-x) + 1 1 ' ~-~~-~-~~-~+ + ' (n-a) (h-c) (h-d) (b-x) (e-a) (e-b) (e-d) (e-x) , 1 } T (d-a) (d--b) (d-c) (d--x) . Solutions to Sec. 2 since the second sum equals zero. I t remains only to make sure that 1 + 1 ~ (a-b) (a-c) (a-d) (a-.r) (b-a) (b-c) (b-d) (b-.r) I . 1 f- 1 ~ T (c-a) (c--b) (c-d) (c -x) - (d-a) (d-b) (d-c) (d-f) I 1 + (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) (x-d) =0. It is possible to reduce these fractions to a common deno- minator and, on performing necessary transformations in the numerator, to obtain zero. But we can, however, proceed in a different way. Multiplying the left member by (a - x) (b - x) (c - x) X X (d - x), we get 1 (a-b) (a-c) (a-d) (b-x)(c-x) (d-x)+ 1 + (b-a)(b-c)(b-d) (a-x)(c-x)(d-x)+ 1 + (c-a) (c-b)(c-d) (a-x)(b-x)(d-x)+ 1 + (d-a) (d-b) (d-c) (a-x)(b-x)(c-x)+1. It is obvious that we deal with a third-degree polynomial in x. It is required to prove that it is identically equal to zero. For this purpose it is sufficient to show (see the beginn- ing of the section) that it becomes zero at four different particular values of x. Replacing x successively by a, b, c, d, we make sure that our polynomial vanishes at these four values of x, and, consequently, it is identically equal to zero. 16. Transposing x 2 to the left, we get there a second- degree trinomial in x. To prove that it identically equals zero it suffices to show that it becomes zero at three diffe- rent values of x. Putting x = a, b, c, we make sure that the identity is valid. 17. Solved analogously to the preceding problem. How- ever, Problem 16, as well as this one, can be solved by making lise of the quantities S k (see Problem 8 and the following o ill'S). 111-122' 146 Solutions 18.

Using a circular permutation, we find y+z + x+z + x+y = 2c2 -L 2a2 + 2b2 =~ (a3 +b 3 +c 3 ). x y z ab I bc ac abc But if a + b + c = 0, then a3 + b3 + c3 = 3abc (see Problem 23, Sec. 1). Consequently y + z + x + z + x + y == 6 x y z ' and the equality is solved. 19. Miltiplying the given expression by (a + b) (b + c) X X (c + a), we get (a - b) (a + c) (b + c) + (a + c) X X (a + b) (b - c) + (a + b) (c - a) (b + c) + + (a - b) (c - a) (b - c). This expression is a second-degree trinomial in a which becomes zero at a = b, a = c and a = 0 and, consequently, is identically equal to zero, i.e. a-b _!.... b-c c-a (a-b) (b-c) (c-a)_O a+b I b+c + c+a +(a+b)(b+c)(c+a)- . We assume here b =1= c. If b = c, then it is easy to make sure directly that the identity holds true. 20. We have b-c (b-a)+(a-c) 1 1 (a-b) (a-c) = (a-h) (a-c) = a-b - a-c' Solutions to Sec. 2 147 Treating the remaining two terms in a similar way, we arrive at the proposed identity. 21. Answer. O.

However, if the numerator is divided by the product (a - b) (a - c) (a - d) (b - c) (b - - d) X (c - d), we get the following expression am bm (a-b) (a-c) (a-d) + (b-a) (b-c) (b-d) + cm dna + (c-a) (c-b) (c-d) + (d-a) (d-o)(d-c) .

Suppose a + b - c = 0; then all the three bracketed expressions in the equality (*) are equal to zero, and, consequently two of the given fractions are equal to 1, while the third one to - 1. The remaining two possibili ties yield the same result. 25. Reducing the original equality to a common deno- minator and cancelling it out, we get (after some trans- forma tiOIlS) (a + b) (a+ c) (b+c) =,0. (1) But the second equality (which is to be proved) can also be reduced to the form (an+ bn)(an+cn)(bn + crt) =0. (2) Solutions to Sec. 2 149 It is quite obvious, that with an odd n' equality (2) follows from (f), since if, for instance, a+b=O, then a= -b and an+bn=a\"+(_a)n=an_an=O. 26. Rewrite the given proportion in the following way (bz+cy) yz (cx+az) xz (ay+bx) xy -ax-j- by+cz = ax-by+cz = ax+by-cz • ACE A+C But from the proportion 73=75= y follows B-\"-D - C+E A \\-E ( , A - D+F B+F it is easy to check, putting -B = C E = 75 = y= A and ('xpressing A, C and E in terms of A, B, D, F). Therefore we ha ve C (x2+ y2)+z (ax+by) c a (z2+ y2) + x (by +cz) a b (x2 j-z2)+y (cz+ax) - b Subtractingx2 + y2 + Z2 from each term of this equality, we get z (ax+ by-cz) x (by + cz-ax) y (cz+ax-by) cab Take the original equalities ay+bx bz+cy cx+az - z (ax+by-cz) x (-ax+by+cz) y (ax-by+cz) Multiplying these equalities, we find ay+bx bz+cy cx+az Hence cab e = (ay + bx) /l, b = (ex + az) /l, a = (bz + ey) /l. Multiplying the first of these equalities bye, the second by b and the third by a, and forming the expression b2 + + e2 - a2, we find b2 + e2 - a2 = 2/lbex. Analogously, we get e2 + a2 - b2 = 2/leay, a2 + b2 - e2 = 2/labz. 150 Solutiuns Hence, finally x y z a(b2 +c 2 -a 2) = b(a2 +c 2 _b 2) = c(a 2 +b 2 -c 2 ) • 27. Since a + b + c = 0, we may write (a + b + c) (aex + bP + cy) = o. Expanding the expression in the left member, we find a2ex + b2p + c2y + ab (ex + P) + ac (ex + y) + + cb (P + y) = o.

It is evident that our problem is equivalent to the follow- ing one: if the equation x3 + y3 + z3 = (x + y) (x + z) X X (y + z) has the solution x = a, y = b, z = c, then it also has the following solution 111 x=A' y=7I' Z=C' We know the following identity (see Problem 19, Sec. 1). (x + y + Z)3 - x3 - y3 - Z3 = 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z). Solutions to Sec. 2 151 Using this identity, we can easily prove that the equalities x3 + y3 + Z3 = (x + y) (x + Z) (y + z), (1) (x + y + Z)3 = 4 (r + y3 + Z3) = = 4 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z), (2) (x + y - z) (x + z - y) (y + z - x) = -4xyz (3) are equivalent, and the existence of any of them involves the existence of the remaining ones.

But A + B = 2c2 , A + C = 2b 2 , B + C = 2a 2 • Therefore we have to prove (AB + AC + BC)3 = 32a2b2c2 ·ABC. Let us fIrst compute AB + AC + BC, and then ABC. We have AB + AC + BC = A (B + C) + BC = = (b 2 + c2 _ a2) .2a2 + [a 2 + (b 2 - c2)J X X [a 2 - (b 2 - c2)J = 2a2b2 + 2a 2c2 - 2a4 + + a4 _ b4 _ c4 + 2b2c2 = _a 4 _ b4 - c4 + + 2a2 b2 + 2a2c2 + 2b 2c2 = 4a2b2 _ (a 2 + b2 _ C2)2 = = (a - b + c) (-a + b + c) (a + b - c) (a + b + c). By virtue of equality (3) (a + c - b) (b + c - a) (a + b - c) = -4abc. Therefore AB + AC + BC = -4abc (a + b + c). Solutions Compute ABC. Put then ABC = (s - 2a 2 ) (s - 2b 2 ) (s - 2c2 ) = But = s3 - 2 (a 2 + b2 + C2 ) 82 + 4 (a 2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2 ) s - - 8a 2 b2c2 = 4 (a 2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2 ) s _ S3 - 8a 2b2c2 = = s {4a 2 b2 + 4a2c2 + 4b 2c2 _ (a 2 + b2 + C2 )2} _ _ 8a 2b2c2 = _ s {a 4 + b4 + c4 - 2a2 b2 - 2a2c2 _ - 2b 2c2 } - 8a 2b2c2 = s (a -I- c - b) (b + c - a) X X (a -I- b - c) (a + b + c) - 8a 2 b2c2 = = -4abc (a + b + c) (a 2 + b2 + c2 ) - 8a 2 b2c2 = = -4abc {a3 + b3 + c3 + a2 (b + c) + b2 (a + c) + + c2 (a + b) + 2abc}. (a + b) (a -I- c) (b -I- c) = a2 (b + c) + + b2 (a + c) + c2 (a + b) + 2abc. Therefore, by virtue of equality (1), the bracketed expres- sion is equal to 2 (a3 + b3 + c3). But, by virtue of equality (2), 1 2 (a3 + b3 + c3) = \"2 (a + b -I- C)3. Therefore ABC = -2abc (a -I- b -I- C)3. But, as has been deduced, AB -I- AC + BC = = - 4abc (a + b + c). Therefore, (AB + AC + BC)3 = 32a2b2c2 ·ABC. 29. 1° We have: P n = anPn- 1 -I- P n- 2, P n - P,,-2 = anPn - l , Qn = anQn-1 + Qn-2, Qn - Qn-2 = anOn_I.

It only remains to prove that (1 + a + a 3 )2 = 1 + 4a + a 2 + 2a3 + 2a4 • The last equality is readily proved by removing the bra- ckets in the left member and performing simple transfor- mations. To prove the second equality we have to show that or Put 5/2 = a a 5 = 2 N 6 = 2a a 7 = 2a 2 a 8 = 2a3 • y \"\", ,........., , Then we have to prove that (a 4 + a 3 + a - 1)2 = 5 (1 + a 2). Expanding the left member, we find 1 + a 2 + a 6 + a 8 + 2a7 + 2a5 - 2a4 + 2a4 - 2a3 - 2a. Making use of the equalities enabling us to replace high powers of a by lower ones, we find the required identity. 3.

Subtracting the last-but-one equality from the last one termwise, we find the required result. 6° and 7° are proved analogously to the previous cases. 7. 1° We have 1 1 2 [(a2+b 2)2 -a) [(a2+b 2)2 -b) = 1 = 2 (a2 + b2 ) -2 (a+ b) (a2+ b2)2 + 2ab= = (a 2 + b2) -2 (a+b) Va 2+ b2+(a+ b)2 + + (a2 + b2)+2ab- (a + b)2 (singling out a perfect square).

Consider the second one of the fractions contained in the first brackets, namely: 1-a 1-a Vt=a V1-a 2-1+a = V1-a 2-(1-a) = V1+a- V1-a • And so, the transformed expression takes the form [ ViTa + Vr=a ] .

Put Hence 2 = p3 + 3pq + (3p2 + q) V-q, Solutions to Sec. 3 187 since q is not a perfect square, it must be 3p2 + q = 0, which is impossible. 17. 1° We have tan (3; - a ) = tan ( n + ~ - a ) = tan ( ~ - a ) = cot a, cos ( 3; - a ) = cos ( n + ~ - a ) = - cos ( ~ - a ) = cos (2n - a) = cos ( - a) = cos a cos ( a - ~ ) = cos ( ; - a ) = sin a sin (n--a)= -sin(-a)= +sina cos (n+ a) = -cos a sin ( a - ~ ) = - sin ( ; - a ) = - cos a Now we get = -sin a (2°, 4°), (1°, 3°), (3°,4°), (2°,3°), (2\") , (3°, 4°). -cotex·sinex . 2 2 l' 2 . 2 0 ----- + sm a + cos a = - + sm a + cos a = . cos ex 2° In this case we obtain sin(3n-a)=(-1)3 sin(-a)= -sin(-a)=sina (2°,3°), cos (3n + a) = ( -1)3 cos a = - cos a (2°), sin ( 321t - a) = sin (n + ~ - a ) = - sin ( ; - a ) = = -cosa (2°,4°), cos ( 5; - a) = cos (2n + ; - a) = cos ( ; - a ) = sin a (1° or 2\",4°). Thus, we have (1 - sin a - cos a) (1 + cos a + sin a) + sin 2a = = [1 - (sin a + cos a)] [1 + (sin a + cos a)] + sin 2a = 1 - (sin a + cos a)2 + sin 2a = = 1 - sin2 a - cos2 a - 2 sin a cos a + sin 2a = O. 188 Solutions 3° Analogous to the previous ones. 18.

We have: 1 ( 1 13) ( 3 3) 2\" A 14 = cos 7\" nn - 14 n + cos 7\" nn - 14 n + + cos ( ~ nn - ;: n ) . If we replace here n by a number, which is comparable with it by modulus 7, then all the cosines will acquire only a common factor equal to +1. Indeed, let us assume that n = ex (mod 7), i.e. n = ex + 7N, where N is an integer. Therefore cos (k;1t _~) =cos (k(a~7N)1t _~) = = cos (k~1t + kN n _ ~ ) = ( _ 1) kN cos ( k~1t _ ~ ) = =(_1)N cos (k~1t _~), since in our case k = 1,3,5 and, consequently, is odd; (~ is equal either to 1~ n or to !! n ) . Therefore, in order to prove that Au = 0 at n == 1, 3, 4 (mod 7), it is sufficient to prove that it will take place at n = 1, 3, 4. The validity of this is readily checked. First put n = 1. Then we prove that cos (..!. n -. 13 n ) + cos (~n - ~ n) + cos (~n - ~ n) = 0 7 14 7 14 7 14 • After transformations we get: 11 3 7 (3) 3 cos 14 n + cos 14 n + cos 14 \"t = cos n - 14 n + cos 1.4 n + 1t 3 3 +cos '2= -cos 14 n+cos 1.4 n =0. Let now n = 3. Then we have to prove that cos (1. n _ 13 n ) +cos (~n-1.n) +cos (15n_~n) = 7 14 7 14 7 14 7 15 27 (1t ) = cos 14 n+cos 14 n+cos 14 n=cos n+14 + + cos ( 2n - ~4 ) = - cos ~4 + cos ~ = O. 190 Solutions Reasoning in t.he same way, we make sure that at n = 4 we also obtain zero. In conclusion, let us prove that As never becomes zero, i.e. at no whole values of n. We have 1 (1 7) (1 1 ) Z-AR=cos -:rnn-16n +cos --:rnn+nn-1Un = = cos ( ! nn - ~ n ) + ( - 1 t cos ( ! nn + 116 n ) . Consider the following cases: 1° Let n = 0 (mod 4), n = 4N. Then ~ As=cos (Nn-176n)+(-1)'lNCOS (Nn+116 n ) = N 7 N 1 = (-1) cos 16 n + (-1) cos 16 n = = ( -1t ( cos ~ n +cos 176 n). The bracketed expression is not equal to zero, since it represents a sum of cosines of two acute angles. 2° Let n == 1 (mod 4), i.e. n = 1 + 4N. } As = cos ( ~ + N n - 176 n) + cos ( 3: + 3N n - 116 n) = = ( - 1) N { cos ( ~ - 176 n) + cos ( 3: - 1~ n ) } = = ( - 1 t { cos 1~ n + cos /6 n } . It is obvious that the braced sum is not equal to zero, and, consequently, in this case As is also not equal to zero. I t only remains to consider the cases: n == 3 (mod 4) and n = 2 (mod 4), but we leave them to the reader. 20. It is required to prove that LJp (k) = 0 ifk=n, n-1, n-2, n-4, n-5, n-6, and the sign before p (k) is chosen accordingly. J t is evident t.hat ~ p(k)=A ~ (k+3)2+C ~ (_1)11 +D ~ cos 2~k . Solutions to Sec. 3 191 The first two sums on the right are equal to zero. It remains to prove that '\" 211k L.J cos -3- = o. If k is a whole number, the following cases are possible: 1° k is exactly divisible by 3, k = 3l; 2° k, when divided by 3, leaves the remainder 1, k = = 3l + 1; 3° k, when divided by 3, leaves the remainder 2, k = = 3l+2. In case 1° 211k cos -3-= 1. 211k 211 In cases 2° and 3° cos -3- = cos 3 . Let us first assume that n is divisible by 3.

Since by the assumption n = 0 (mod 3), we have n - 1 == -1, n - 2 = 1, n - 4 = -1, n - 5 = +1, n - 6 = 0, and our sum takes the form 211 211 211 211 1- cos -3- - cos 3 + cos -3- + cos 3 -1 = o. It remains to prove that our sum is also equal to zero in the cases when n = +1 (mod 3). The proof is similar to the previous case. 192 Solutions 21.

First of all it is easy to prove that the quantities arctan x + arctan y and arctan --=.±!L. i-xy differ from each other only by en, where e is an integer. Indeed, tan (arctan t+ y ) x+y -xy - 1-xy , tan (arctan x + arctan y) = tan (arctan x) + tan (arctan y) i-tan (arctan x) tan (arctan y) x+y 1-xy' 196 Solutions But if two quantities have equal tangents, then they differ from each other by a term divisible by ll. Therefore, indeed, arctan x + arctan y = arctan t + Y + ell. (*) -xy Let us fmd out the exact val-ue of e. Since n n n n -2 < arctan x < +2' -2 < arctany< +2' we have -ll < arctan x +- arctan y < + II and, consequently, I arctan t~;y + elli < ll. And since n x+y n -2< arctan 1-xy < +2 ' then lei < 2 and, consequently, e may attain only one of the following three values 0, +1, -1. To find the value of e let us write the following equality cos (arctan x + arctan~) = cos (arctan t~x~ + ell). Hence cos (arctan x) cos (arctan y) - sin (arctan x) sin (arctan y) = = cos ( arc tan t~ ;y ) cos ell. On the basis of the resul ts of Problem 23 we ha ve 1 1 x Y V1+x 2 .

V 1-xy V (1-xy)2 Y(1-xy)2 But V(1-xy)2=1-xy if 1-xy>0, i.e. if xy< 1, and V(1-xy)2 = - (1-xy) if 1-xy < 0, i.e. if xy> 1. 197 Therefore, cos en = 1 if xy < 1, and cos en = -1 if xy > 1. Since en can attain only the values 0, nand -n, it follows that if xy < 1, then e = 0, and if xy> 1, then e = +1. What sign is to be taken is decided in the follo- wing way: if xy > 1 and x > 0, then also y > 0, then arctan x> ° and arctan y > 0, and arctan 1x-t-y < 0. -xy The left member of the equality <*) is a positive quantity, consequently, the right member must also be positive, and therefore en must exceed zero, and e = +1. Quite in the same way we make sure that if xy > 1 and x < 0, y < 0, then e = -1. 26.

First of all let us notice, that since arcsin x is con- tained between - ~ and + ~ , and 2 arctan x lies between -n and +n, we have 3n 2x 3n -2~2arctanx+arcsin 1+x2 < +2' Let us now compute the sine of the required arc, i.e. find what the expression is equal to.

Put arctan x = y, tan y = x. Then sin (2 arctan x) = sin 2y = tan 2y ·cos 2y. But 2tany 1-tan 2 y tan 2y = 1- tan 2 y , cos 2y = 1 + tan2 y • Consequently, . 2 2 tan y 2x Slll( arctanx)=1+tan 2 y=1+x 2 ' Further cos (arcsin 1~x2 ) = -V 1 - ( 1~x2 )2 = since x> 1. _ -. ;---;-( 1-:-_-x\"\"\"'2)':C\"\"2 - V (1+x 2)2 Further, it is obvious that 1-x 2 cos (2 arctan x) = 1 +x2 ' . ( . 2x) 2x sm arCSlll 1 + x2 = 1 + x2 , x 2 -1 1 +x 2 ' Solutions to Sec. 3 199 therefore sin (2 arctan x + arcsin 1 ~:r2 ) = 2x x2 - 1 1 - x2 2x = 1 + x2 . 1 + x2 + 1 + x2 . 1 + x2 = 0. Thus, the sine of the required arc is equal to zero, consequ- ently, this arc can have one of the infinite number of values: ... , -3n, -2n, -n, 0, +n, 2n, 3n, 4n, .... But among these values there are only three (-n, ° and n) lying in the required interval between - 3; and + 3; . On the other hand, x > 1 and, consequently, 2 arctan x > ° and arcsin 1 ~~xX2 > 0, and therefore the required sum 2 t . 2x arc an x + arCSlll 1 + x 2 will also be greater than zero and, consequently, can be equal only to n. 29. It is evident that Let us form 1 - n~ arctan x +- arctan -~ + n. x sin ( arc tan x + arctan ! ) The required sine turns out to be equal to (see Problem 23) sin (arctan x) cos (are tan .! ) +cos (arctan x) sin (arctan ! ) = 1 x 1 x 1/1+x2 V 1+-1 + Y1+x2 V1+-1 x2 x2 .1: Vx2 1 Vx2 V1+x 2 V 1 + x2 + V 1 + x2 x·Y1+x 2 x2 1 =1 1+x2 + 1+x2 200 Solutions if x> 0 (since in this case V:?=x). And if x < 0, then V x2 = -x and we have sin ( arctan x -+ arctan ; ) = - 1. Hence follows tha t 1 n arctan x -+ arctan 7 = +\"\"2 -+ 2kn, where plus is taken whon x > 0, and minus when x < O. But since, on the other hand, it must be 1 -n::::;; arctan x-+arctan -::::;; -+n, x our problem has been solved. 30. Compute the expression sin (arcsin x -+ arcsin y). We have sin (arcsin x -+ arcsin y) = sin (arcsin x) cos (arcsin y) + -+cos (arcsin x) sin (arcsin y) = x V 1- y2 -+ y V 1-x 2. Thus, considering the two arcs arcsin x -+ arcsin y and arcsin{xV1- y2-+ y V1-x 2 ), we may assert that their sines are equal to each other. However, if • • R 2sl·na-~Cosa+~=0 smr:J.=slnp, 2 2 ' and, consequently, eiLher a;~ =kn or a~~ =(2k' +1) ; (k and k' in tegers), Le. ei ther r:J. = ~ -+ 2kn or r:J. = - ~ -+ (2k' -+ 1) n. Therefore we may assert that arcsin x -+ arcsin y = 1] arcsin (x V 1- y2 + y V 1 - X2) -+ en, Solutions to Sec. 3 201 where l] = +1 if e is even, and l] = -1 if e is odd. To de- termine e more accurately, let us take cosines of both members. We get cos (arcsin x + arcsin y) = = eos [l] arcsin (x V 1 - y2 + y V 1 X2) + en] . Hence V 1 - x 2. V 1 y2 - xy = =(-1)ecos [arcsin (x V 1 y2+ y V1 X2)]. Further V 1- x2. V 1 y2 - xy = =(-1)£V1-(xV1 y2+ y V1 X2)2. The radicand on the right can be transformed as 1- (x V 1 y2 + y V 1 X2)2 = = 1 - x 2 (1 - y2) - y2 (1 - x 2) - 2xy y 1 x 2 . V 1 y2 = = (1 - x 2) (1 - y2) - 2xy V 1 x2. V 1 y2 + x2y2 = == (V 1·-x 2V 1 y2_xy)2. If it turns out that V 1 x 2.lfT=Y2-xy > 0, then V 1- (x Vf=Y2 + y Vf=X2r~ = = V (V 1 X2.y 1 y2_xy)2 = y 1_X~.YT=Y2-xy. Therefore, in thi\" case (-1)£ = +1, i.e. e is even. And if V 1 x 2 V 1 y2 - xy < 0, then (-1)E = -1, and, consequently, e is odd. 202 Solution., Let us now consider the expression 1 - X2 _ y2. We have 1- X2 - y2 = 1 _ x2 _ y2 + x2y2 _ x 2y2 = = (1 - X2) (1 _ y2) _ X2 y2 = = (V 1-x 2 • V1 - y2_xy) (V 1_X2. V 1- y2+.1·Y)· The quantity 1 - X2 - y2 can be greater (smaller) than or equal to zero. Let us consider all the three cases. 1° Suppose 1 - X2 - y2 > 0, i.e. X2 + y2 < 1. If the product of two factors is positive, then these factors are either both positive simultaneously, or both negative Rirnul- taneously. And so, we have either V 1 - X2. V 1 - y2 - xy > 0, V 1 - x 2 V 1 - y2 + xy > () or V 1-x 2 V1- y2- xy < 0, V 1-x2V1-y2+xy < O. But the second case is imposRible, since, adrling the laRt two inequalities, we get V 1 - x 2 V 1 - y2 < 0, which is impossible. If, however, the first two inequalities exist, then V 1- x 2 V 1- y2 - xy > 0. Consequently, in this case e is even. or Thus, if X2 + y2 < 1, then in our formula e is even. 2° Let now 1 - X2 - y2 < ° and, consequently, either V1_X2 V1_y2-xy > 0, V 1_X2 V1- y2+ xy <O V 1 - :1:2 V 1 - y2 - xy < 0, V~ 1 - X2 V 1 - y2 + xy > 0. But from the first two inequalities we easily obtain xy < 0 If this inequality is fulfilled, then it will obligatory be V 1 - x2 V 1- y2 - xy > 0, and, consequently, e is even, Solutions to Sec. 3 203 From the second pair of inequalities we get xy > 0, and e is odd. 3° Finally, suppose 1 - x 2 - y2 = 0. Then again two cases are possible: either xy :::;;; ° or xy > 0. In the first case l/1 - x2·V1-y2-xy>0, and, hence, e is even. Likewise, the second case gives an even e (e = 0), since there ·exists the following relation: arcsin x + arcsin V 1- x2 = ~ (x> 0). Thus, we can judge whether e is even or odd. Now let us consider the value of e. We have I arcsin x + arcsin y I < n. Consequently I 'I'] arcsin (x -V 1- y2 + y V 1- X2) + en 1< n. Hence lei < 2. And so, e may attain only three values: 0, +1, -1. Comparing the results obtained, we may now assert that if x 2 + y2:::;;;1 or if xy < 0, then e = 0, 'I'] = +1, and if x2 + y2 > 1 or if xy > 0, then e = +1, 'I'] = -1. To find out when e = +1 and when e = -1, let us notice that at x > 0, y > ° arcsin x + arcsin y > ° and, con- sequently, -arcsin (x V 1_y2+ y V 1 __ X2) + en > 0, and therefore in this case e = +1. If, however, x < 0, y < 0, then it is obvious that e = -1. 31. We have (see Problem 24) arccos x + arccos ( ~ + -} V 3 - 3x2 ) = = n - arcsin x-arcsin ( ~ +-} V 3-3x 2 ); on the other hand (Problem 30), arcsin x + arcsin ( ; + -} V 3 - 3x2) ~ 'I'] arcsin £ + en, 204 Solutions where lit ( x.

Then Hence = aX = mY.aY, ali = mao Taking logarithms of this last equality to the base a, we get the required result. 35. Put x(y+z-x) _ y (z+x-y) z (x+y-z) logx - log y log z t 206 Solutions Then log x = tx (y + z -x), log y = ty (z + x - y), log z = tz (x + y - z). Hence y log x + x log y = 2txyz, y log z + z log y = 2txyz, z log x + x log z = 2txyz. Consequently y log x + x log y = y log z + z log y = z log x + x log z, log xYyX = log zYyZ = log xZzx. Finally xYyX = zYyZ = xZzx. 36. 10 Put 10gb a = x. Then bX = a. Taking logarithms of this equality to the base a, we get x loga b = 1. But x = 10gb a. Consequently, indeed, 10gb a loga b = 1. 20 We have Therefore 10gb ( 10gb a) 1 a = (a lOgb a)IOgb(iogb a) = (a10ga b)IOgb (10gb a) = biogb (10gb a) 1 = = Ogba. 37. From the given relations ,it follows that yl-log x = 10, z1-log Y = 10. Taking logarithms of these equalities to the base 10, we get (1 - log x) log y = 1, (1 - log y) log z = 1. whence log x = 1 __ 1_ = 1 -----,-- logy 1 __ 1_ log z i-log z and, consequently, 1 X = 101- log z.

Multiplying these equalities, we find 4 logc+ba ·logc_ba = logc+b (c - b) + logc_b (c + b) + + 1 + logc+b (c - b) loge_b (c + b). However, loge-Ii (c + b) logc+b (c - b) = 1. Therefore 4 logc+b a loge-b a = 2 logc+b a - 1 + 2 logc-b a - 1+ 2. Finally log,+b a + logc-b a = 2 logc+b a log c-b a. 39. Put loga N = x, loge N = y, logva;; N = z. The last eqnality yields z (ac)2 = N. Hence log\" N = ~ (1 + loga c), loge N = ~ (1 + loge a). Therefore 2.r 1 I -- = oga c, Z 2y --1=loge a. z Consequen t I y or x x-z y z-y 40.

If, however, 111 a+b + a+e + b+c =0, then the given equation turns into an identity which holds true for any value of x. 2.

It is assumed, of course, that none of the quantities a, b and c, as also bi +.!.. +.!.b is equal to zero. c ac a 3. If we put in our equation 6x + 2a = A, 3b + c = B, 2x + 6a = C, b + 3c = D, then it is rewritten in the following way A+B C+D A-B = C-D . Adding unity to both members of the equation, we find 2A 2C A-B .-- C-D . Likewise, subtracting unity, we get 2B 2D A-B = C-D . Dividing the last equalities termwise, we have A C 7J-=-75' i.e. 6x+2a 2x+6a 3b+e = b+ 3e . Hence Finally ab .T=-. c 210 Solutions 4. Add 3 to both members of the equation and rewrite it in the following way ( a+~-x + 1) + ( a+~-x + 1) + ( b+:-x + 1) = Hence (a+ b+c-X') ( ! + ~ + ! ) =4 a~~t~-:·x . Consequently ( 1 1 1 4) (a+b+c-x) a-+T+c- a.j-b te =0 and, finally, x = a + b + c. 5.

Consequently, Solutions to Sec. 4 2V x 2 - 1 = 1 - 2x, 4x2 - 4 = 1 + 4x2 - 4x, 5 x =7;. 211 Since squaring leads, generally speaking, to an equation not equivalent to the given one, or rather to such an equa- tion which in addition to the roots of the given equation may ha ve other roots different from them (so-called extraneous roots), it is necessary to check, by substitution, whether ! is really the root of the original equation. The check shows that ! does not satisfy the original equation (here, as befo- re, we consider only principal values of the ,roots). 2° Carrying out all necessary transformations similar to the previous ones, we find that x = { is the root of our equation. 7. Cube both members of the given equation, taking the formula for the cube of a sum in the following form (A + B)3 = A3 + B3 + 3AB (A + B). We ha\\fe a + Vx+ a- V x+3 V a2 -x(Va+ V x·j-V a-V;;) =b. Since V V- a+ V x+ a- V x=V\"b, we have 2 V-- V- 2 (b-2a)3 a-j-3 a2 -x· b=b, x=a - 27b . We assume that a and b are such that 2_ (b-2a)3 >-0 a 27b ~. Since the equality of cubes of two real numbers also means the equality of the numbers themselves, the found valliI' of x satisfies the original equation as well. 212 Solutions 8. Squaring both members of the equation, we find - V X4 - X 2 = X 2 - 2x. Hence x 2 [X 2 - 1 - X 2 - 4 + 4x] = X 2 (4x - 5) = 0. Thus, the last equation has two roots x = ° and x = !. Substituting them into the original equation, we see that the unique root of this equation is or 5 x=t;. 9. Getting rid of the denominator, we obtain Vb(x-b)=Va(x-a), b(x-b)=a(x-a), x=a+b. As is easily seen, this value of x is also the root of the origi- nal equation. 10. Multiplying both the numerator and denominator by V a + x + Va - x, we get Hence -v a2 -x 2 =xVb-a. Squaring both members of this equality, we find two roots x=o, 2aVii x = 1+b . However, the first of these values is not the root of the ori- ginal equation, the second one will be its root if Solutions to Sec. 4 213 Indeed, we have 1;-::-;-:: ,/ 2a-V;; V- ,/(1+-V b)2=Vli 1+ Vb , V a + x = V a + \"\"T+b ~--' a V 1 + b -V H- b Va __ x='/a_2aYb=Vli 1 /(Yb_1)2 = V 1 :-b V 1+b = Va -V;;-1 (if Vb-1;?O). -V1+b Substituting the obtained values for V a + x and -V a - x into the original equation, we make sure that our assertion is true. 11. Adding all the given equations, we have I + + a+b+c+d .TTY Z V= 3 Consequently a+b+c+d v=(x+y+z+v)---(x+y+z)=~ -a~ 3 Likewise, we obtain a+c+d-2b a+b+d-2c a+b+c-2d Z= 3 ,Y= 3 ,x= 3 . 12. Adding all the four equations, we get 4Xl = 2al + 2az + 2a3 + 2a4, Multiplying the last two equations by -1, and then adding all the four equations, we find Similarly, we get 214 Solutions 13. Put X + y + z + V = s. Then the system is rewrit- ten as follows so that ax + m (s - x) = k by + m (s - y) = l cz + m (s - z) = P dv + m (s - v) = q ms + x (a - m) = k, ms + y (b - m) = l, ms + z (c - m) = p, ms + v (d - m) = q. Hence k In Imp m X = a-m - a-m S, y= b-.m - b-m s, z= c-m - c-m S, q m v=-----s. d-m d-m Adding these equalities termwise, we find kIp q s= a-m + b-m +c=m+ d-m- ( 1 1 1 1) -ms --+--+--+-- . a-m b-m c-m' d-m Consequently s [1 +m( a~m + b~m + c~m + d~ln) ] = =_k_+_I_+_p_+_q_ . a-m b-m c-m d-m Wherefrom we find s, and then from the equalities (*) we obtain the required values of the unknowns x, y, z and v. 14. Put Hence Xi = ai + miA, X2 = a2 + m2A, A. Solutions to Sec. 4- 215 Substituting these into the last one of the given equations, we get Xt + X 2 + . . . + Xp = a = = (at + a2 + + a p ) + 'A, (mt + m2 + ... + m p )' Consequently, a-at-a2-'\" -a p 'A, = , mt+ m2+···+ m p and then we readily get the values of 15. If we put 1,1,1,1, -X=x, y=y, -;=Z, v=v, then the solution of this system is reduced to that of Pro- blem 11. Using the result of Problem 11, we easily obtain 3 2 x = a + b + c - 2d ' Y = a + b + d - 2c ' 3 3 Z = a+c+d-2b' V = b+c+d-2a • 16. Dividing the first equation by ab, the second by ae and the third by be (assuming abe =1= 0), we get Hence ~= (.::.+.1L+~) __ ('::'+.1L) =~ (_c +J:...+...!:.) __ c. cab cab 2 ab ac bc ab z a2 + b2 -c 2 Consequently, -= 2 b c a c analogously . a2 + b2 -c 2 I.e.

Let us now look for nonzero solutions, i.e. for 216 Solutions such in which x, y, z are not equal to zero. Dividing the first of the given equations by yz, the second by zx and the third by xy, we obtain \":'+.!:.=2d ~+!...=2d' .!:.+~=2d\". z y 'x z 'y x Hence ~+.!:.+~ =d+d' +d\". x y z Therefore !!.-=d'+d\" -d, .!:.=d+d\"-d' .:....=d+d'-d\". x y , z Finally abc X = d'+d\"-d' Y = d+d\"-d\" Z = d+d'-d\" • 18.

Dividing both members of each equation of our system by xyz, we get 1111_1 111_1 Xzi~-Yz-~' ~+Yz-Xz-bz' 1 111 y.-+x;-;y = \"C2' Adding pairwise, we find 21121 1 ~=az+'b2' 1iI='b2+7' Consequently Solutions to Sec. 4 217 Multiplying the equalities, we obtain 2 2 2 8a4b4c4 x y z = (a2 + 112) (b2 + C2) -(a-=-2 +---'C2C:-) Hence 2a2b2 xy = a2 +b2 ' we find for z two values which differ in the sign. By the obtained value of z we find the corresponding values of y and x from the equalities (*). Thus, we get two sets of values for x, y and z satisfying our equation. 20. Adding all the three equations, we find (x + y + z) (a + b + e) = O. Hence whence a-b a-~c ii-a X = a + b + c' Y =- a + b + c' z ~ a -i b + c 21. Adding all the three equations termwise, we get (b + e) x + (e + a) y + (a + b) z =-= 2a3 + 2b3 + 2e3 • Using the given equations in succession, we fmd 2 (b + e) x = 2b3 + 2e3 , 2 (e + a) y = 2a3 + 2e3 , 2 (a + b) z = 2a3 + 2b3 , whence x = b2 - be + e2 , y = a2 - ae + e2 , z = a2 - ab + b2 • 22. Consider the following equality x y z (8-A) (8-J.t) (8-v) a+8+ b+8 +T+e- 1 = - (8+a)(6+b) (8+c) . Let us transform the equality, by reducing its terms to a common denominator and then rejecting the latter. We get a second-degree polynomial in 8 with coefficients depending on x, y, z, A., ~, '\\I, a. b. c, which is equal to zero. If now we 218 Solutiuns substitute successivly A, /-.l and 'V for a into the original expression, then, by virtue of the given equations, this expression (and, consequently, the second-degree polyno- mial) vanishes. However, if a second-degree polynomial becomes zero at three different values of the variable, then it is identically equal to zero (see Sec. 2) and, consequently, the equality x y z a+8 + b+8 + c+8 -1 = (8-1..) (8-p,) (8-v) (8+a) (8+b) (8+c) (by virtue of existence of the three given equations) is an identity with respect to a, i.e. it holds for any values of a. Multiplying both members of this equality by a + a, put e = -a. Then we find x = ....:(_u ...:..+-;-1....:..) ...:..(a-;-;+,-;-,-p,,-)(.:...,a,....:+_v_) (a-b) (a-c) Likewise we get (b+l..) (b+p,) (b+v) Y= (b-c) (b-a) , (c+l..) (c+p,) (c+v) z= . (c-a) (c-{J) Of course, we assume here that the given quantities A, /-.l, v, as also a, band c, are not equal to one another. 23. The given equations show that the polynomial ex3 + xex2 + yex + z vanishes at three different values of a, namely at ex = a, at ex = b and at ex = c (assuming that a, band c are not equal to one another). Set up a difference ex3 + xex' + yex + z - (ex - a) (ex - b) (ex - c). This difference also becomes zero at ex equal to a, b, c. Expanding this expression in powers of ex, we obtain (x + a + b + c) ex2 + (y - ab - ac - bc ) ex + + z + abc. This second-degree trinomial in ex vanishes at three different values of ex, and therefore it equals zero identically and, consequently, all its coefficients are equal to zero, i.e. x + a + b + c = 0, y - ab - ac - bc = 0, z + abc = O. Hence Solutions to Sec. 4 x = -(a + b + c), y = ab + ae + be, z = -abc is the solution of our system. 24. We find similarly t = -(a + b + e +- d), x = ab + ae + ad + be + bd + cd, y = -(abc + abd + aed + bcd), z = abed. 21!J 25. Multiplying the first equation by r, the second by p, the third by q and the fourth by 1 and adding, we get (a3 + a2q + ap + r) x + (b3 + b2q + bp + r) y + + (e3 + e2q + ep + r) z + (d3 + d2q +- dp + r) It = mr t- np + kq + l. Let us choose the quantities r, p and q so that the follo- wing equalities take place b3 + b2q +. bp + r = 0, c3 + e2q + ep + r = 0, d3 + d2q + dp + r = O. Hence, we obtain (see Problem 23) q = -(b + e. + d), p = be + bd + cd, r = -bcd, and, consequently N N x= a3+a2q+ap+r = (a-b)(a-c) (a-d) , where N = -mbedo + n (be + bd + cd) - k (b + e + d) -I- l. As to the equality a3 + a2q + ap + r = (a - b) (a - c) (a - d), it follows readily from the identity a,3 + qa.2 + pa. + r = (a. - b) (a. - c) (a. - d). 220 Solutions To find the variable y, the quantities q, p and r are so chosen that the following equalities take place a3 + a 2q + ap + r = 0, c3 + c2q + cp + r = 0, rJ3 + d2q + dp + r = O. The remammg variables are found analogously. 26. Put XI + X2 + . . . + Xn = S. Adding the equations term by term, we get s + 2s + 3s + . . . + ns = al + a2 + . . . + an' But 1+2+3+ Therefore + n = n(n+1) 2 (an arithmetic pro- gression). 2 s = n (n+1) (al + a2 + ... + an) = A (for brevity). Subtracting now the second equation from the first one, we find XI + X2 + xa + ... + xn - nXj = al - a2' Hence and A+a2- al XI= n • Subtracting the third equation from the second, we get A+aS-a2 X2= n and so on. 27. Put Then we have Hence XI + x 2 + . . . + xn = S. -s + 2xI = 2a, -s + 4X2 = 4a, -8 + 8X3 = 8a, t • t, -8 + 2nxn = 2na. 8 S , B XI == a + 2\" Xa == a + 4\"' Xa = a +\"8' ... , Xn = a + 2n' Solutions to Sec. 4 221 Adding these equalities, we get ( 1 1 1 ) s=na+s 2+4+'\" +2'1 . But Therefore Consequently S X2 = a + 4 = a + 2n - 2na = a (1 + n· 2n - 2 ) and so on. 28. Let Xl + X2 + X3 + . . . + Xn = S = 1. Then s - X2 = 2, s - X3 = 3, . . -, S - Xn -1 = n - 1, S - Xn = n. Consequently (since s = 1) x2=-1, x3=-2, Hence . . -, Xn = -(n - 1). X2 + X3 + ... + Xn = - [(1 + 2 + ... + (n - 1)] n(n-1) 2 Finally Xl = 1 - (X2 + X3 + 29. Suppose the equations are compatible, i.e. there exists such a value of X at which both equations are satisfied. Substituting this value of X into the given equations, we get the following ideQtities ax + b = 0, a'x + b' = 0. Multiply the first of them by b', and the second by b. Sub- tracting termwise the obtained equalities, we find (ab' - a'b) x = 0. 222 SolutionlJ If the common solution for x is nonzero, then it actually follows from the last equality ab'-a'b=O. If the common solution is equal to zero, then from the ori- ginal equation it follows that b = b' = 0, and therefore in this case also ab' - a'b = 0. And so, in both cases, if the two given equations have a common solution, then ab' - a'b = 0. Hence, conversely if the condition ab' - a'b = ° is satisfied, the two given equations have a common root (the coefficients of the equations are proportional), and, consequently, they are compatible. 30. To prove that the given systems are equivalent it is necessary to prove that each solution of one of the systems is simultaneously a solution for the other system. Indeed, it is apparent, that each solution of the first system is at the same time a solution for the second system. It only remains to prove that each solution of the second system will also be a solution for the first system. Suppose a pair of numbers x and y is the solution of the second system, i.e. we have identically l£ + l'£' = 0, m£ + m'£' = 0, where £ = ax + by + c, £' = a'x + b'y + c'. Multiplying the first equality by m' and the second by l', and subtracting them termwise, we find (lm' - ml') £ = 0. Likewise, multiplying the first equality by m and the se- cond by l, and subtracting, we get (lm' - ml') ~' = 0. Solutions to Sec. 4 But since, by hypothesis, lm' - ml' =1= 0, it follows from the last two equalities that ~=O and r = 0, i.e. ax + by + c = ° and a'x + b'y + c' = 0. 223 Thus, the pair of numbers x and y, which is the solution of the second system, is simultaneously the solution of the first system. 31. Multiplying the first equation by b' and the second by b, and subtracting termwise, we find (ab' - a'b) x + cb' - c'b = 0. We get similarly (ab' - a'b) y + c'a - a'c = 0. These two equations are equivalent to the original ones. It is evident that if ab' - a' b =1= 0, then there exists one and only one pair of values of x and y satisfying the last two equalities, and, consequently, the original system as well. 32. Multiplying the first equality by b' and the second by b, anrl subtracting, we find (ab' - a'b) x = 0. Since, by hypothesis, ab' - a' b =1= 0, it follows that x = 0. In the same way we prove that y = 0. 33. From the first two equations we get e'b-cb' a'e-e'a .c -= ab' -a'b' y = ab' -a'b . If the three equations are compatible, then a pair of num- bers x and y being the solution of the system of the first two equations must also satisfy the third equation. Therefore, if the three given equations are compatible, then there 224 Solutions exists the following relation a\" e'b-eb' + b\" a'e-e'a +e\" = ° ab' -a'b ab' -a'b or a\" (e'b - eb') + b\" (a'e - e'a) + e\" (ab' - a'b) = 0. (*) Conversely, the existence of this relation means that a solution, which satisfies the first two equations, satisfies the third one as well. This relation may be rewritten in the following ways a' (eb\" - e\"b) + b' (ac\" - ca\") + e' (ba\" - b\"a) =~ 0, a (e\"b' - e' b\") + b (a\"e' - e\"a') + e (b\"a' - a\"b') = 0. Hence it follows that the solution of each pair of the three equations is necessarily the solution of the third equation, i.e. our system is compatible provided the condition (.) is observed. 34. Subtracting from the first equality the second, and then the third one, we find (a - b) y + (a 2 - b2) Z = 0, (a - c) y + (a 2 - e2) z = 0. Since a - b =1= ° and a - e =1= 0, we have the following equalities y + (a + b) z = 0, y + (a + c) z = 0. Subtracting them term by term, we have (b - c) z = 0. But by hypothesis b - e =1= 0, therefore z = 0. Substitu- ting this value into one of the last two equations, we find y = 0. Finally, making use of one of the original equations, we get x = 0. 35. Multiplying the first equality by B j and the second one by B, and subtracting them termwise, we get (AB t - AtB) x + (CB t - CtB) z = 0. (1) We find analogously (ACt - AtC) x + (BC t - BIC) y = 0. (2) Solutions to Sec. 4 Suppose none Qf the expressions ABI - AlB, CB I - CIB, AC I - AIC is equal to zero. Then we get x z' C1B-CBI - ABI-AIB 225 [multiplying both members of the first equality by the product and x y Thus, in this case the required proportion really takes place. Let now one and only one of the expressions ABI - AlB, CB I - CIB, AC I - AIC vanish. Put, for instance, CB I - CIB = O. Then from equalities (1) and (2) we get x = O. Further, suppose that two of the mentioned expressions, for instance, CIB - CB I and CAl - ACI are equal to zel'o, and the third one, i.e. ABI - AlB is nonzero. We then find x = y = O. In these cases our proportion, or, more precisely, three equalities, x = ').. (CIB - CB I), y = ').. (CAl - ACI), z = ').. (ABI - AlB), will also take place. Thus, in these cases two given equations determine the variables x, y and z \"accurate to the common factor of pro- portionali ty\". If all the three quantities ABI - AlB, CB I - CIB and ACI - AjC are equal to zero, then there exists the following proportion A B C 221l Solutions In this case the two equations (forming a system) turn into one, and nothing definite can be said about the values of the variables x, y and z which satisfy this equation. 36. From the first two equations (see the preceding pro- blem) we get x y z oc-b 2 bc-a 2 ab-c 2 Hence x = ').. (ae - b2 ), y = ').. (be - a2 ), z = ').. (ab - e2 ). Substituting these values into the third equation, we find b (ae - b2 ) + a (be - a2 ) + e (ab - e2 ) = 0 or a3 + b3 + e3 - 3abe = O. 37. Multiplying the first two equations, we get x 2 z2 y2 ----1--a2 c2 - b2' The same result is obtained by multiplying the third equa- tion by the fourth one, which shows that if there exist any three of the given equations, then there also exists a fourth one, i.e. the system is compatible. To determine the values of x, y and z satisfying the given system proceed in the following way: equating the right members of the first and the third equations, find Solving this equation with respect to y, we have ft-A. y=b ft+A. . Substituting this into the first two equations, we get =- ...:. _ 2A.ft a + c - ft+A. ' Hence x=a :r z a c 2 ft+A.· Solutions to Sec. 4 38. Rewrite the system in the following way a (x + py) + b (x + qy) = ap2 + bq2 ap (x + py) + bq (x + qy) = ap3 + bq3 ap\"-l (x + py) + bqh-l (x + qy) = ap\"+l + bqh+l. 227 Now it is obvious that the system is equivalent to the follow- ing two equations x + py = p2, X + qy = q2, and, hence, the system is compatible. 39. We have X2 = al - Xj, X3 = a2 - X2 = a2 - al + XI, X4 = a3 - X3 = a3 - a2 + al - XI, Xn = an -I - an -2 + . . . + a2 + al + XI' I t should be noted that in the last equality the upper signs will occur when n is odd, and the lower signs when n is even. Consider the two cases separately. 10 Let n be odd. Then Xn = an-l - an -2 + . . . + a2 - al + XI' On the other hand, Xn + XI = an' From these two equalities we get an -an-t +a n-2-'\" -a2 +at Xj= 2 ' and, hence, ai-an +an-t -.,. -a3+ a2 X2= 2 ' a2 - at -1-- an - ... - a4 + a3 X3= 2 ' 20 Let now n be even. Then Xn = an-l - an-2 + ... - a2 + al - Xl' 228 sotution.~ On the other hand, Consequently, for the given system of equations to be com- patible the following equality must be satisfied an -I - an -2 + . . . - a2 + al = an, i.e. an + an -2 + . . . + a2 = an -I + an -3 + . . . + al (the sum of coefficients with even subscripts must equal the sum of coefficients with odd subscripts). It is apparent that in this case the system will be indeterminate, i.e. will allow an infinite number of solutions, namely: XI = A, X2 = al - A, X3 = a2 - al + A, X4 = a3 - a2 + al - A, Xn = an-I - a n -2 + ... + a3 - a2 + aj-A, where A is an arbitrary quantity. 40. From the first two equations we find x y z -an2--\"\"'b2'-= A. a-d - b-d Substituting this into the third equation, we have A { a~d ( b~d - C~d ) + b~d ( c~2d - a~d ) + + c ~ d ( a ~ d - b b2 d ) } = d (a - b) (b - c) (c - a). After sim plifica tion we get a (b 2 C2 ) b (C 2 a2 ) a-d b-d - c-d + b-d c-d' - a-d + c (a 2 b2 ) d (a-b) (b-c) (a-c) + c-d a-d - b-d = (a-d) (b-d) (c-d) . Therefore A = -(a - if) (b - if) (c - if), Solutions to Sec. 4 and, consequently, x = (a - d) (b - e) (db + de - be), y = (b - d) (e - a) (de + da - ae), z = (e - d) (a - b) (ad + db - ab). 229 41. Solving the last two equations with respect to x and y, we find Hence x+n= (c-m) (n--a) z+c _ .:...( b_-_l..:...) .:...( m_----'c)e-y+b= z+m x+a= (c-m)(n-a) --(n-a)=(a-n) z+m . z+c z+c Analogously + 1 = (l- b) z + c . Y z+m Substituting the founll values of x + a and y + 1 into the first equation, we see that it is a consequence of the two last equtions. Thus, the system is indeterminate, and all its solutions are given by the formulas (c-m) (n-a) x= -n, z+c for an arbi trary z. y = -,(_b _l),-;,(,--m_-_c...:.)_ z+m b, 42. From the second and the third equations we have (1 - k) x + ky = - [(1 + k) x + (12 - k) y], hence, taking into account the first equation, (5 - k) y = = 0 wherefrom either k = 5 or y = 0 (hence x = 0), which yields (substituting into the second equation) k = -1. 43. We have sin 2a = 2 sin a cos a, sin 3a = sin a (4 cos2 a - 1), sin 4a = 4 sin a (2 cos3 a - cos a). 230 Solutions Therefore the first of the equations of our system is rewrit- ten in the following way x + 2y cos a + z (4 cos2 a - 1) = 4 (2 cos3 a - cos a). The remaining two are similar. Expand this equation in powers of cos a. We have 8 cos3 a - 4z cos2 a - (2y + 4) cos a + z - x = O. Putting cos a = t and dividing both members by 8, we get Our system of equations is equivalent to the statement that the equation (*) has three roots: t = cos a, t = cos band t = cos c, wherefrom follows (see Problem 23) z 2\"= cos a+ cos b + cos c, yt 2 = -(cosacosb+cosacosc+cosbcosc), x-z -8- = cos a cos b cos c. Therefore the solution of our system will be x = 2 (cos a + cos b + cos c) + 8 cos a cos b cos c, y = -2 - 4 (cos a cos b + cos a cos c + cos b cos c), z = 2 (cos a + cos b + cos c). 44. Put abc ---------k sin A - sinB - sinG - . Since A + B + C = 11:, we have sin A = sin (B + C) = sin B cos C + cos B sin C. But from the given proportion we have 'A a 'B b ·C C SIll =-,;' SIll =-,;' SIll =-,;.' Substituting this into the last equality, we find a = b cos C + c cos B. The rest of the equalities are obtained similarly. Solutions to Sec. 4 231 45. Expressing a and b in termS of c and trigonometric functions (from the first two of the given equalities), we get b ~. c (cos A --- cos B cos C) - sin 2 C . c (cos B + cos A cos C) a= sin2 C (1) (2) Substituting (1) and (2) into the third equality anrl accom- plishing all necessary transformations, we find 1 - cos2 A - cos2 B - cos2 C - 2 cos A cos B cos C = O. Let us now prove that A + B + C = n. Transform the obtained equality in the following way cos2 A + 2 cos A cos B cos C = = 1 - cos2 B - cos2 C - cos2 B cos2 C + cos2 B cos2 C, cos 2 A + 2 cos A cos B cos C + cos2 B cos2 C = = 1 - cos2 B ~ cos2 C (1 - cos2 B), ((OS A + cos B cos C)2 = sin 2 B sin2 C. But since we have obtained [soe (1)] that cos A + cos B cos C = h sin 2 C c >0, we havE' cos A + cos B cos C = sin B sin C, cos A = sin B sin C - cos B cos C =~ - cos (B -;- C), I C A+B+C A-B-C cos A T cos (B + ) = 2 cos 2 cos 2 = 0, wherefrom follows that either A+~+C =(2l+1) ~ or A-B-C ~ --.\",-- = (2l' -l- 1) ~ 2 '2 ' 232 Solutions where land l' are integers. Let us first show' tha t the second case is impossible. In this case we would have A - B - C = (2l' + 1) n, B = A - C - (2l' + 1) n, cos B = cos (A - C - n) = -cos (A - C) = = -cos A cos C - sin A sin C. Consequently, cos B + cos A cos C = -sin A sin C < 0 which is impossible, since we have obtained (2) a sin2 C cosB+cosAcosC= > O. c· Thus, there remains only the case A -+:- B + C = (2l + 1) n. However, by virtue of the inequalities, existing for A, B and C, we have i.e. and 0< 2l + 1 < 3, 2l + 1 = 1 A + B + C = n. It only remains to show that abc sin A = sin B = sin C . We ha ve shown that cos A + cos B cos C = sin B sin C. On the other hand, cos B + cos A cos C = cos (n - A - C) + cos A cos C = = -cos (A + C) + cos A cos C = = sin A sin C. Using this equality and also equalities (1) and (2), we easily obtain the required proportion. 46. Let us first show that equation (2) follows from equa- tions (1). Multiplying the first of equations (1) by a, the second by b and the third by - c and adding them term- Solutions to Sec. 4 233 wise we get a2 + b2 - e2 = 2ab cos C, i.e. the third of equations (2). Likewise we obtain the re- maining two of equations (2). To obtain equations (1) from equations (2) add the first two of (2). Collecting like terms, we find 2e2 -2 be cos A - 2 ae cos B = O. Hence e = b cos A + a cos B, i.e. we get the third of equations (1). The rest of them are obtained similarly. 47. From the first equality we get Hence cos a - cos b cos c cos A = ---:--.,----,;---- sin b sin c sin2 A = 1 - cos2 A = sin2 b sin2 c- (cos a-cos b cos c)2 sin2 b sin2 c _ (1-cos 2 b) (1-cos 2 c)-(cos a-cos b cos c)2 - sin2 b sin 2 c 1-cos2 a -cos 2 b-cos 2 c+ 2 cos a cos b cos c sin2 b sin2 c Consequently sin 2 A 1- cos2 a-cos 2 b-cos 2 c+ 2 cos a cos b cos c sin2 a = sin2 a sin2 b sin 2 c Since the given formulas turn one into another by means of a circular permutation of the letters a, b, e, A, B, C, and as a result of this transformation the right member of the last equality remains unchanged, we actually have sin2 A sin2 B sin2 C sin2 a = sin 2 b = sin2 c . But the quantities a, b, c and A, B, C are contained between o and n, therefore Sin A sin B sin C ,in (1 = SI!lb ---< Si\"ri\"'C\" . 234 Solutions 48. 1° Let us take the last two of the eqllalities (*) from the preceding problem. We have cos b - cos c cos a = sin a sin c cos B, -cos a cos b + cos c = sin a sin b cos C. Multiplying the first of them by cos a and the second by 1 and then adding, we find -cos c cos2 a + cos c = sin a sin c cos B cos a + + sin a sin b cos C. Hence cos c sin a = sin c cos a cos B + sin b cos C. But since it was shown in the preceding problpID that from the equalities (*) follows the proportion sin a ~in A sin I! sin H sin c sin C . in the last equality we can replace the quantities sin a, sin b anrl sin c by ones proportional to them . We get cos c sin A -c sin C cos a eos B -t- sin B cos C. It is apparent, that there exist six similar equalities. Let us take one more of them, namely, the one which also contains cos c and cos a. It will have the form cos a si n C = si n A cos c cos B t si Il B eos A . (This equality can be obtained in the following way: mul- tiply the second of the equalities (*) by cos c and the first one by unity, add them, and in the obtained equalityrepla- ce sin c by sin C .and so on.) Thus, we have cos c sin A = sin C cos a cos B + sin B cos C, cos a sin C = sin A cos c cos B + si n B cos A. Eliminating cos c, we find cos A = -cos B cos C + sin B sin C cos a. The rest of the equalities are obtained from this one w,ing a circular permutation. 2° The formulas (*) of Problem 47 make it possible to express cos A, cos B and cos C in terms of sin a, sin b, Solutions to Sec. 4 235 sin c and cos a, cos b, cos c.

Show that if sin x and cos x are rational, then tan ~ is rational too. From the first relationship we have ( 1 + tan 2 ~ ) cos x = 1 - tan 2 ~ • Hence tan 2 ~ __ = 1 -cos x 2 1..Lcos X 238 Solutions Consequently, if cos x is rational, then tan 2 ~ is rational as well. But from the second equality it follows that 2 tan ; = sin x ( 1 + tan 2 ; ). Hence, it is clear that if sin x and cos x are rational, then tan ~ is also rational. 51. Since Si1l 2 x + cos2 X = 1, we havc si (14 .r + cos~ X' + 2 sin 2 .r cos 2 x ~~. 1, i.c. sin 4 x -+ cos4 X = 1-2 sin 2 x cos2 x. Therefore the equation is rewritten as 1 - 2 sin 2 x cos 2 x = a, 2 sin 2 x cos2 x = 1 - a, sin 2 2x = 2 (1 - a), sin 2x = + V2 (1 - a). For Lhe solutions to be real it is necessary and sufficient that +~a~1. 52. 10 Transforming the leH member of the equation, we get sin x + sin 3x + sin 2x = 2 sin 2x cos x + sin 2x = = sin 2x (1 + 2 cos x) = 0. Hence (1) sin 2x = 0, 1 (2) cos X= --. , 2 20 In this case the transformation of the left member yields cos nx + cos (n - 2) x - cos x = 2 cos (n - 1) x cos x - - cos x = cos x [2 cos (n - 1) x ~ 1] = 0, i.e. 1 either cos x = ° or cos (n - 1) x =2' Solutions to Sec. 4 239 53. 1° We have m (sin a cos x - cos a sin x) - - n (sin b cos x - cos b sin x) = 0, (n cos b - m cos a) sin x - (n sin b - m sin a) cos x = 0, [ nsinb-m sin aJ (n cos b - m cos a) cos x tan x - b = 0. _ n cos - m cos a Hence t nsinb-msina an :r = n cos b.- m cos a • 2° We have sin x cos 3a + cos x sin 3a = 3 (sin a cos x - cos a sin x). Hence sin x (cos 3a + 3 cos a) - cos x (3 sin a - sin 3a) = 0. But cos 3a = 4 cos3 a - 3 cos a, sin 3a = 3 sin a - 4 sin3 a. Therefore the equa tion takes the form sin x cos3 a - cos x sin3 a = 0. And so tan x = tan3 a. 54. I t is easy to find that sin 5x = 16 sin 5 x-20 sin3 x + 5 sin x. Therefore our equa tion takes the form -20 sin3 x + 5 sin x = ° or sin x (1 - 4 sin 2 x) = 0. Thus, we have the following solutions sin x -= 0, sin x = + }. 55. We have 2 sin :r cos (a - .r) - sill a + sin (2x - a). 240 Solutions The equa tion takes the form sin x + sin (2x - a) = 0 or 2 . 3x-a x-a 0 sm -2- cos -2-. = .

Similarly, we have a -t 2kn x= 3 ' cos x;a =0,. x 2 a =(2l+1) ~, x=a+(2l+1)n, where l is any integer. 56. We have sin x sin (1'- x) =-} [cos (2x -1') -cos 1']. Therefore the equation is rewritten in the following way cos (2x - y) - cos y = 2a, cos (2x - y) = 2a + cos y. 57. We have . ( + )+. . sin(a+x) 0 sm a x sma SIn x cos (a+x) --mcosacosx= . Further sin(a+x) cos (a-j-x) {cos (a + x) + sina sin x} - m cos a cos x = O. Hence sin(a+x) ( --l ) cos a cos x - m cos a cos x = cos a ,-x = cos acos x{tan (a+ x) -m}= O. Assuming cos a =F 0, we obtain the following equalities for determining x cos x = 0, tan (a + x) = m. Solutions to Sec. 4 241 58. Rewrite the equation in the following way cos2 a + cos 2 (a + x) - 2 cos a cos (a + x) = 1 - cos 2 x. Hence [cos a - cos (a + x))2 - sin 2 x = 0, i.e. [cos a - cos (a + x) - sin xl [cos a - cos (a + x) + + sin xl = 0. Fnrther [cos a (1 - cos x) + sin x (sin a - 1)1 X X [cos a (1 - cos x) + sin x (sin a + 1)1 = 0, sin 2 x [cos a tan ~ + sin a - 11 X X [cos a tan ; + sin a + 1] = ° (if sin x =J= 0). If sin x = 0, then cos 2 a (1 - cos X)2 = 0. Now we easily find the following solutions: eosx=1, tanx=cota, i.e. x=2kn and 2k--j-1 2 :rr. 59.

For determining x we have: tan x = 0, tan x = -1. 242 Solutions 60. We have tan A + tan B = sin (A + B) cos A cos B Therefore tan x+ tan 4x+ tan 2x + tan 3x sin 5x ----.--+ cos x cos 4x sin 5x + cos 2x cos 3x sin 5x cos x cos 2x cos 3x cos 4x X X {cos 2x cos 3x + cos x cos 4x}. But cos 3x = 4 cos3 X - 3 cos x. Thus, our equation takes the form sin 5x 2 2 3 4 [cos2x(4cos x-3)+cos4x]=0. cos x cos x cos x Hence sin 5x [4 cos2 2x-cos 2x-1] _ 0 cos 2x cos 3x cos 4x -. Consequently, either sin 5x = 0, i.e. 5x = kn, or 4 cos2 2x - cos 2x - 1 = 0, that is 8 cos 2x = 1 + V IT. 61. Substituting the expressions containing X and Y for x and y into the trinomial ax2 + 2bxy + cy2, we get ax2 + 2bxy + cy2 = a (X cos 8 - Y sin 8)2 + + 2b (X cos 8 - Y sin 8) (X sin 8 + Y cos 8) + + c (X sin 8 + Y cos 8)2 = = (a cos2 8 + 2b cos 8 sin 8 + c sin2 8) X2 + + (a sin2 8 - 2b sin 8 cos 8 + C cos2 8) y2 + + (-2a cos 8 sin 8 + 2c cos 8 sin 8 + 2b cos2 8 - -2b sin 2 8) XY. Solutions to Sec. 4 243 Since, by hypothesis, the coefficient of XY must be equal to zero, we have the following equation for determining 8: or 2b (cos2 e - sin2 8) - 2 (a - c) sin 8 cos 8 = 0 Thus, 2b cos 28 - (a - c) sin 28 = O. 2b tan 28 =--. a-c 62. It is obvious tha t x+y sin(20+a+~) x-y sin(a-~) Therefore x+y sin2(a-~)+ y+z sin2(~-1')+ z+x sin2(y-a)= x-y y-z z-x = sin (28 +a +~) sin (a-~) +sin (28+ ~+y) sin (~-y) + + sin (28 + 1'+a) sin (y-a). But sin (28 + a +~) sin (a -~) = ~ {cos (28 + 2~) - cos (28+2a)}. Using a circular permutation, we easily check the vali- dity of our identity. 63. 1° Put sin x = sin y = sin z = k abc . We then, have sin x = ak, sin y = bk, sin z = ck. On the other hand, sin z = sin (n - x - y) = sin (x + y) = Hence = sin x cos y + cos x sin y. a cos y + b cos x = c, b cos z + c cos y = a, c cos x + a cos z = b. 244 Solutions Solving this system, we find ~+~-~ ~+~-~ cos x = 2bc cos y = 2ca a2 +b 2 -c 2 cos Z = 2ab • At k = ° we get also the following solution sin x = = sin y = sin z = 0. 2° Put tan x __ tan y _ tan z _ k -a---b-----c-- . Hence tan x = ak, tan y = bk, tan z = ck. Adding these equalities term by term, we get (see Problem 40, Sec. 2) (a + b + c) k = tan x + tan y + tan z = tan x tan y tan z. Consequently, (a + b + c) k - k 3 abc ~ 0.

We have tan 2b = tan (x + y) = tan x+tan y i-tan x tan y But, by hypothesis, tan x tan y = a, therefore tan x + tan y = (1 - a) tan 2b. Knowing the product and sum of the tangents it is easy to find the tangents themselves (see Sec. 5). Solutions to Sec. 4 245 65. Transform the equation in the following way 1 4x+i-. 4x =3 x - z (1+3), Hence And so Consequen tly, 3 2x-3=0 and x=T. 66. Taking logarithms of both members of our equation, we find (x + 1) 10g1o X = 0. Hence x=1. 67. Taking logarithms of the first equation, we find x 10g1o a + y 10gio b = 10gio m. Finally, we have to solve the system 68. Put x 10gio a + y 10gio b = 10g1o m, x + y = n. x = M, y = all (from this problem on we assume that a > 0, b > 0, a =1= 1, b =1= 1 and find positive solutions). Then (by virtue of the first equation): b~Y = allX. But Consequently, 246 Solutions Hence a~s = a'IJX , x (~ - '1']) = o. Thus, either x = 0 or 'I'] = s. But at x = 0 we get y = O. Rejecting this solution, consider the case 'I'] = i. Consequently, But Hence and x log a = y log b, b' log a = a' log b, log b ~ (logb-Ioga) = log-l-' oga 1 log b og loga s= logb-loga Therefore ( log* 10gb ) x=b~= b 10gb . logb-Ioga . Since the ratio of logarithms of two numbers is independent of the base chosen, in the expression 1 log b og Toga log b we may consider the first logarithms as taken to the base b. Then and 110gb ogToga b log b log b log a log b x = ( log b ) log b-Iog a log a Analogously, we find log a =( 10gb ) 10gb-log a Y log a 69. Taking logarithms of the second equation, we find logx log y loga = 10gb • Solutions to Sec. 5 Putting this ratio to be equal to t we get x = as, y = bs. 247 Substituting these values into the first equation and assu- ming a ¥= b±l, we find S = -1. Thus 1 1 X=a' Y=T' 70. We have Consequently, mx xm=y-Y-. Making use of the second equation, we find mx y-Y-=yn. Hence, either y = 1, and then x = 1 or :x = n, i.e. x = ..!!:.JL • m Substituting into the second equation, we have: And so ( ny)m n m =y, m-n (m)m y = - . n n m y = ( : r-n , X = y: = ( : r- n .

We have x2 7-( b--!+-,x,.,..) ..;.-( x_+!..-7c ) (x-b) (x-c) x 3 (b + c + x) + xbcx (x-b)(x-c) Therefore the left member of our equation is equal to [ x3 b3 c 3 ] (b+c+x) (x-b)(x-c)+(b-x)(b-c)+(c-x)(c-b) + + bcx [(X_b)x(x_c) + (b_X)b(b_C) + (C_x)c(C_bJ· 248 S(Jiutions But (see Problem 8, Sec. 2) x 3 b3 c3 (x-b) (x-c) + (b-x) (b-c) + (c-x) (c-b) = b +e+x, x b c_ O (x-b) (x-c) + (b-x) (b-c) + (c-x) (c-b) - . Therefore the equation takes the form (b + e + X)2 = (b + e)2. Hence (b + e + X)2 - (b + e)2 = 0, (b + e + x- - b - c) (b + e + x + b + c) = 0, and consequently XI = 0, X2 = -2 (b + c). 2. Rewrite the equation in the following way (x - a) (x - b) (x - c) (b -c) (e - a) (a- b) {(x-a) (c':a) (a-b) + ~ ~} + (x-b) (b-c) (a-b) + (x-c) (c-a) (b-c) = O. As is known (see Problem 9, Sec. 2) a3 b3 (a-x) (a-b) (a-c) + (b-x) (b-a) (b-c) + c3 x 3 + (c-x) (c-a) (c-bJ + (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) = 1. Therefore, the equation is rewritten as follows (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) (b-e) (e-a) (a-b) X X {1- x 3 } =0 (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) or (b - c) (e - a) (a - b) [(x - a) (x - b) (x - c) - x 3 ] = O. Assuming that a, b, e are not equal, we get (a + b + c) x 2 - (ab + ae + be) x + abc = 0, ab+ac+bc ± V(ab+ac+bc)2-4abc (a+b+c) :c= 2 (a+b+c) • Solutions to Sec. 5 249 For the roots to be equal it is necessary and sufficient that (ab + ac + bC)2 - 4abc (a + b + c) = O. Hence a2b2 + a2c2 + b2c2 - 2a2bc - 2b2ac - 2c2ab = 0, (ab + ac - bC)2 - 4a2bc = 0, (~+~_~)2 _~=O. c b a be or [ ( ;~ + ;ii ) 2 - ! J [( ;~ - ;ii ) 2 - ! J = 0. Finally ( 1 1 1)( 1 ,1 1) V~ + Vii - Va Vc --r- Vii + Va x ( 1 1 1)( 1 1 1) X Vc - Vii - Va Vc - Vii + Va =0. 3. Rewrite the equation in the form 3 3 (a_x)2+(x_b)2 _ -b 1 1 -a , (a_x)2+(x_b)2 wherefrom we have 1 1 a-x-(a-x)2 (X-b)2 +x-b-=a-b or V(a-x) (x-b) = 0. Thus, the required solutions will be XI = a, X2 = b. 4. We have V 4a+b-5x+ V4b+a-5x=3Va+b-2x. Squaring both members of the equality and performing aU 250 Solutions the necessary transformations, we get Squaring them once again, we find (4a + b) (4b + a) - 5x (4a + b + 4b + a) + 25xll = = 4 (all + bl! + 4Xll + 2ab - 4ax - 4bx). Hence XII - ax - bx + ab = 0, and, consequently, Xi = a, X2 = b. Substituting the found values into the original equation, we get Vb-a+2 Vb-a-3 Vb-a=O. 2Va-b+ Va-b-3 Va-b=O. Hence, if a =1= b, then the equation has two roots: a and iJ (strictly speaking, if the operations with complex numbers are regarded as unknown, then there will be only one root). 5. Rewrite the given equation as (1 + A) x 2 - (a + e + ')..b + ')..d) x + ae + Abd = O. Set up the discriminant of this equation D (')..). We have D (')..) = (a + e + ')..b + ')..d)2 - 4 (1 + ')..) (ae + Abd). On transformation we obtain D (')..) = ')..2 (b - d)2 + 2').. (ab + ad + be + de - 2bd - - 2ae) + (a - e)2. We have to prove that D (A) ~ 0 for any')... Since D (A) is a second-degree trinomial in ').. and D (0) = (a - e)2 > 0, it is sufficient to prove that the roots of this trinomial are imaginary. And for the roots of our trinomial to be ima- ginary, it is necessary and sufficient that the expression 4 (ab + ad + be + de - 2bd - 2ae)2 - 4 (a - e)2 (b - d)2 Solutions to Sec. 5 be less than zero. We ha ve 4 (ab + ad + be + de - 2bd - 2ae)2 - - 4 (a - e)2 (b - d)2 = = 4 (ab + ad + be + de - 2bd - 2ae - - ab + eb + ad - cd) X X (ab + ad + be + de - 2bd - 2ae + ab - - eb - ad + cd) = 251 = -16 (b - a) (d - c) (e - b) (d - a). The last expression is really less than zero by virtue of the given conditions a < b < e < d. 6. The original equation can be rewritten in the follow- ing way 3x2 - 2 (a + b + c) x + ab + ac + be = O. Let us prove that 4 (a + b + e)2 - 12 (ab + ae + be) ~ O. We have 4 (a + b + e)2 - 12 (ab + ae + be) = = 4 (a2 + b2 + e2 - ab - ae - be) = = 2 (2a2 + 2b2 + 2e2 - 2ab - 2ae - 2be) = = 2 {(a 2 - 2ab + b2) + (a2 - 2ae + e2) + + (b2 _ 2be + e2)} = = 2{(a - b)2 + (a - e)2 + (b - e)2} ~ O. 7. Suppose the roots of both equations are imaginary. Then p2 _ 4q < 0, p~ - 4ql < O. Consequently p2 + p= _ 4q - 4ql < 0, p2 + p~ - 2pPI < 0, (p - PI)2 < 0, which is impossible. 252 Solutions 8. Let us r!'lwrite the given equation as (a + b + e) x2 - 2 (ab + ae + be) x + 3abe = O. Prove that its discriminant is greater than or equal to zero. We have 4 (ab + ae + be)2 - 12abe (a + b + e) = = 2 {(ab - ae)2 + (ab - be)2 + (ae - be)2} ~ O. 9.' By properties of the quadratic equation we have the following system p + q = -p, pq = q. From the second equation we get q (p ~ 1) = o. Hence, either q = 0 or p = 1. From the first one we find if q = 0, then p = 0; if p = 1, then q = -2. Thus, we have two quadratic equations satisfying the set requirements x2 = 0 and x2 + x - 2 = O. 10. We have x2 + y2 + Z2 - xy - xz - yz = = ~ (2x2 + 2y2 + 2Z2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz) 1 =\"2 {(x - y)2 + (x - Z)2 + (y - Z)2} ~ 0 (see Problems 6 and 8). But we can reason in a different way. Rearranging our expression in powers of x, we get x2 - (y + z) x + y2 + + Z2 - yz. To prove that this expression is greater than, or equal to, zero for all values of x, it is sufficient to prove that: firstly y2 + Z2 - yz ~ 0 and, secondly, (y + Z)2 - 4 (y2 + Z2 - 1/z) ~ O. Solutions to Sec. 5 253 It is evident that there exist the following identities y2 + Z2 _ yz = ( y _ } Z ) 2 + : Z2, (y + Z)2 _ 4 (y2 + Z2 - yz) = -3 (y _ Z)2 and, consequently, our assertion is proved. 11. We have a2 a2 X2+ y2+ Z2_ T =x 2 + y2+ (a-x- y)2-T' I t is necessary to show that the last expression is greater than, or equal to, zero for all values of x and y. Rearranging this polynomial in powers of y, we get a2 y2+ (x-a) y+x 2-ax+T' It remains only to prove that for all values of x x2-ax+ ~2 ~O, (x-a)2-4 (x2-ax+ ~2) ~O. We have 2 + a2 ( a ) 2 1 2 --- 0 X -ax T= X- 2 +1.2 a ~ , (x-a)2-4 (x 2-ax+ ~) = -3 (x- ~ a)2 ~O, which is the desired result. However, the proof can be car- ried out in a somewhat different way. Indeed, it is required to prove that 3x2 + 3y2 + 3z2 ~ a2 if x 2 + y2 + Z2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz = a2. Consequently, it suffices to prove that 3x3 + 3y2 + 3z2 ~ x 2 + y2 + Z2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz or 2x2 + 2y2 + 2Z2 - 2xy - 2xz - 2yz ~ O. And this last inequality is already known to us (see, for instance, Problem 6). 12. See the preceding problem. 13. By the properties of quadratic equation we may write a + ~ = -p, a~ = q. 254 Solutions Therefore SI = -po Since a and ~ are roots of the equation x 2 + px + q2 = 0, we have a 2 + pa + q = 0, ~2 + p~ + q = O. Adding these equalities term by term, we find S2 + PSI + 2q = O. Hence S2 = -PSI - 2q = p2 - 2q. Multiplying both members of our equation by Xk, we get Xk+2 + pX k +1 + qxk = O. Substituting a and ~ and adding, we find Sk+2 + PSk+1 + qSk = O. Putting here k = 1, we have Further S3 = -p (p2 - 2q) + qp = 3pq _ p3 Likewise we find S4 = p4 - 4p2q + 2q2, S5 = _p5 + 5p3q _ 5pq2. To obtain LI, let us put in our formula k = -1. We have SI + PSo + qS_1 = O. But Therefore So = 2, SI = -po qs _I = + P - 2p = - p, P S_I = --. q Likewise we get S-2, S_3, S_4 and S-5' However, we may pro- ceed as follows 1 1 ah+f}k Sk Sk=-+-= =- - a k f}k (af})k qk ' wherefrom all the desired values of S_k are readily found. Solutions to Sec. 5 255 14. Let Then w4 = a + 4 t/ a3~ + 6 t'\" a2~2 + 4 t/ a~3 + .~. But a + ~ = -p, a~ = q. Consequently {t)4= -p+6Vq+4'ya~(Va+VM. But Oia+ -V~)2=a+~+2Va~= - p+2Vq, therefore w=V--p+6Vq+4'yq.V -p+2Vq. 15. Let x be the common root of the given equations. Multiplying the first equation by A', and the second by A and subtracting them termwise, we get (AB' - A'B) x + AC' - A'C = O. Likewise, multiplying the first one by B' and the second by B and subtracting, we find (AB' - A'B) x 2 + BC' - B'C = O. Take the value of x from the first obtained equality and substitute it into the second one. Thus, we obtain the, re- quired result. 16. Adding all the three equations termwise, we find (x + y + Z)2 = a2 + b2 + c2 • Hence x + y + z = + Va 2 + b2 + c2 • Consequently 256 Solutions 17. I t is obvious that the system can be rewritten in the following way (x + z) (x + y) = a, (y + z) (y + x) = b, (z + x) (z + y) = c. Multiplying these equations and extracting a square root from both members of the obtained equality, we have (x -+ z) (x -1- y) (y + z) = + II abc. Hence Y +z= + Vabc , - a ' + _ ± VatiC x z-- b ' /- x+y= + 1 abc. c Adding these equalities termwise, we find VabC(1 1 1) x-'+--y tz-=+-- -+-+- . 2 abc But since , Vabc y -t- z =0 + -a- , we have x = + Vabc (! + .-!. __ ~) . - 2 b c a Analogously = + Vabc (.-!.+!_l) Y-2 a c b' z = + Vabc (~+.-!. _ ~) - 2 b a c ' simultaneously taking either pluses or minuses everywhere 18. Put y + x = y, x + z =~, y + z = a. Then our equations take the form y + ~ = ay~ a + y = bay ~ + a = ca~. Solutions to Sec. 5 257 Solving this system (see Sec. 4, Problem 17), we find the solutions of the original system x=y=z=O x= ~ (P~b + p~c - p~a) r y = ~ (p~c t p~a - P~b) , Z= ~ (p~a+p~b-p~c)' where 2p = a + b + c. 19. Adding unity to both members of the equations, we get or 1 + y + z + yz = a + 1, 1 + _x + z + xz = b + 1, 1 + x + y + xy = c + 1 (1 + y) (1 + z) = a + 1, (1 + x) (1· + z) = b + 1, (1 + y) (1 + x) = c + 1. Multiplying these equations, we get (1 + X)2 (1 + y)2 (1 + Z)2 = (1 + a) (1 t b) (1 + c) or (1 + x)-f1 + III (1 + z) = ± V (1 + a) (1 + b) (1 + c). Consequen tl y, 1+ =+-./(1+b)(1+c) 1+ =+-1/(1+a)(1+c) x - V 1+a' y - V 1+b ' 1+z=+ V(1+;~~+b). 20. Multiptying the given equations, we obtain (xYZ)2 = ab cx yz. First of all we have an obvious solution x = y = z = O. Then xyz = abc. 258 Solutions From the original equations we find xyz = ax2, xyz = by2, xyz = cz~. Hence ax2 = abc, by2 = abc, ez2 = abc, x2 = be, y2 = ac, Z2 = abo Thus, we have the following solution set x = Vbe, y = Y ac, Z = Yab; x = - Vbe, y = - Vac, Z = V ab; x=Vbe, y= -Vae, Z= -Yab; x= -Vbc, y= Vac, z= -Vab. 21. Adding the first two equations and subtracting the third one, we get 2x2 = (c + b - a) xyz. Likewise we find 2y2 = (c + a - b) xyz, 2Z2 = (a + b - c) xyz. Singling out the solution x = y = z = 0, we have 2x = (c + b - a) yz, 2y = (c + a - b) xz, 2z = (a + b - c) xy. Then proceed as in the preceding problem. 22. The system is reduced to the form xy + xz = ai, yz + yx = bi , zx + zy = c2. Adding these equations term by term, we find 1 xy+xz + YZ=T (a2+ b2+ c2). Taking into consideration the first three equations, we get b2+c2_a2 a2 + c2 -b 2 yZ= 2 ,zx= 2 a2 +b2 _c 2 xY= 2 Solutions to Sec. 5 259 Multiplying them, we have 2 (b2+c2 __ a2) (a2+ c2_b 2) (a2+b 2-c 2) (xyz) = 8 ' i.e. .. ;(b2+ cL-a2) (a2 +c 2-b 2) (a2 + b2 -c 2) xyZ= + V 8 • Now we easily fInd _ .;(a2-t-c2-b2) (a2+b 2_c 2) x- + V 8 (b2 +c 2 -a 2 ) , _ .;(a2+b2_c2) (b2+c2 _a 2) y- + V 8 (a 2 +c 2-b 2 ) , _ _.;(a2+c2-b2) (b2+c 2_a 2) Z - + V 8 (a2+b2_c2) • 23. Adding and subtracting the given equations term- wise, we find x3 + y3 = a (x + y) + b (x + y) = (a + b) (x + y), x3 - y3 = a (x - y) - b (x - y) = (a - b) (x - y). Hence (x + y) (x2 - xy + y2 - a - b) = 0, (x - y) (x2 + xy + y2 - a + b) = 0. Thus, we have to consider the following systems 1° x + y = 0, x - y = 0; 2° x + y = 0, x2 + xy + y2 - a + b = 0; 3° x - y = 0, x2 - xy + y2 - a - b = 0; 4° x2 - xy + y2 - a - b = 0, x2 + xy + y2 - a + + b = 0. The first three systems yield the following solutions 1° x=y=o; 2° X= + lla-b, y= + Ya-b; :10 x=-=.1I=+ Ya+b. 260 Solutions The last system is reduced to the following one x2 + y2 = a, xy = -b. Solving it, we get x= ~ (e Va-2b+fJ If a+2b), y= ~ (eVa-2b-fJ Va+2b), where e and fJ take on the values +1 independently of each other. Thus, we get four more solutions. 24. Reduce the system to the following form (x + y - z) (x + z - y) = a, (y + z - x) (y + x - z) = b, (x + z - y) (z + y - x) = c. Multiplying and taking a square root, we get (x + y - z) (x + z - y) (y + z - x) = + V abc. Further ac y'- x+z-y=+ lI' Consequently 25. Put x+y x+y +CXy=y, --\"y:.....+:.....z_ y+z-t-ayz=a, Then the system takes the form by + c~ = a, ca + ay = b, a~ + ba. = c Solutions to Sec. 5 261 or ~ a c -+-=-. b a ab Therefore a ~ 'V 1. a2+b2+c 2 --;-+/;+c=2 abc and, consequently, b2+c 2 __ a2 IX= 2bc ' a2 -I- c2 - b2 ~ = '2ac ' a2+b 2_c 2 Y= 2ab Further x+ y+cxy x+y y' Finally Analogously, we find 1 1. b~ x+7=1.-~' wherefrom we find x, y and z. 26. Multiplying the first, second and third equations respectively by y, z and x, we get ex + ay + bz = O. Likewise, multiplying these equations by z, x and y, we find bx + ey + az = O. From these two equations (see Problem 35, Sec. 4) we obtain i.e. _x_=_y_=_z_='A a2-bc b2-ac c2-ab ' x = (a 2 - be) 'A, y = (b 2 - ae) 'A, z = (e2 - ab) 'A. Substituting these expressions into the third equation, we find v= c _ 1 (c2-ab)2-(a 2-bc) (b2-ac) - a3+b 3+c 3 -3abq' Now it is easy to find x, y and ~. 262 Solutions 27. Rewritf' the system as follows Hence (y2 _ xz) + (Z2 - 3}Y) = a (x2 - yz) + (Z2 _ xy) = b (x2 _ zy) + (y2 - zx) = c. 2 b+c-a 2 a+c-b 2 a+b-c x - JJz = 2 ' Y - xz = 2 ' z - xy = 2 ' i.e. we have obtained a system as in the preceding problem 28. Subtracting the equations term by term, we have (x - y) (x + y + z) = b2 - a2 , (x - z) (x + y + z) = c2 - a2 • Put x + y + z = t, then (x - y) t = b2 - a2, (x - z) t = c2 - a2• Adding these two equations termwise, we have [3x- (x+ y+ z)] t = b2+c2_2a2. Hence t2+ b2+ c2_ 2a2 X= 3t . Analogously t2--1-a2--1-c2-2b2 t2+a2+b2-2c2 y= '3t Z= 3t • Substituting these values of x, y and z in one of the equations, we find t4 _ (a2 + b2 + c2) t2 + a4 + b4 + c4 _ _ a2b2 _ a2c2 - b2c2 = O. Hence 2 a2+b2+c2 ± y3 (a+b+c) (-a+b+c) (a-b+c) (a+b-c) t = 2 -. Knowing t, we obtain the values of x, y and z. 29. We have the following identities (x + y + Z)2 - (x2 + y2 + Z2) = 2 (xy + xz + yz), (x + y + Z)3 _ (x3 + y3 + Z3) = = 3 (x + y + z) (xy + xz + yz) - 3x!/z. Solutions to Sec. 5 263 Taking into account the second and third equations of our system, we get from the first identity xy + xz + yz = 0. From the second identity we have xyz = 0. Thus, we obtain the following solutions of our system x = 0, y = 0, Z = a; x = 0, y = a, Z = 0; x = a, Y = 0, Z = O. 30. Let x, y, Z and u be the roots of the following fourth- degree equation a 4 - pa 3 + qa 2 - ra + t = o. (*) Put Then S4 - PS3 + QS2 - rS1 + t = 0. But by hypothesis S4 = a 4 , S3 = a 3 , S2 = a 2 , S1 = a. Therefore, the following identity must take place a 4 - pa 3 + Qa2 - ra + t = 0, i.e. the equation (*) has the root a = a, and therefore one of the unknowns, say x, is equal to a.· Then there must take place the equalities u + y + Z = 0, u2 + y2 + Z2 = 0, u3 + y3 + Z3 = 0, and, consequently, (by virtue of the results of the last problem) u = y = Z = 0. Thus, the given s vstem has the following solutions x = a, U = Y = Z = 0; y = a, x = U = Z = 0: Z = a, x = y = U = 0; !l = a, x = y = Z = 0, 264 Solutions 31. Equivalence of these systems follows from the iden- tity (a2 + b2 + e2 _ 1)2 + (a'2 + b'2 + e'2 _ 1)2 + + (a\"2 + b\"2 + e\"2 - 1)2 + 2 (aa' + bb' + ee')2 + +·2 (aa\" + bb\" + ee\")2 + 2 (a'a\" + b'b\" + e'e\")2 = = (a2 + a'2 + a\"2 _ 1)2 + (b2 + b'2 + b\"2 _ 1)2 + + (e2 + e'2+ e\"2 - 1)2 + 2 (ab + a'b' + a\"b\")2 + + 2 (ae + a'e' + a\"e\")2 + + 2 (be + b' e' + b\"e'')2. It should be noted that nine coefficients: a, a', a\", b, b', b\\ e, e' and e\" can be (as it was established by Euler) expressed in terms of three independent quantities p, q and r in the following way 1+p2_ q2_ r2 b_2(r+pq) 2 (-.,.q+pr) a= N ' - N' e= N ' , 2(-r+pq) ,1_p2+q2_r2 ,2(p+qr) a= N ' b= N ,e= N ' b\" = 2 ( - p + rq) N ' (N=1+p2+ q2+ r 2). 32. Multiplying the first three equalities, we get X2y2z2 (y + z) (x + z) (x + y) = a3b3e3 • Using the fourth equality, we have (y + z) (x + z) (x + y) = abc or x2 (y + z) + y2 (x + z) + Z2 (x + y) + 2xyz = abc. But adding the first three equalities, we find x' (11 + z) + y2 (x + z) + Z2 (x + y) = a3 + b3 + cS. Thus, finally 33. Adding the three given equalities, we get a+b+e= (y-z)(z-x) (x- y). ;I:JJ.1. • Solutions to Sec. 5 Similarly, we have a_b_c=(Y-~)(z+x)(x+y) , xyz Hence b -c- a = (z-x) (x-f- y) (y+z) xyz ' c-a-b= (x-y) (y+z) (z-+ x). xyz (a + b +c) (b + c-a) (a+ c-b) (a+ b-c) = 265 = _ ( ; _ : ) 2 ( : _ : ) 2, ( : _ f ) 2 = _ aWc 2• Hence, we finally get the lIesult of the elimination 2b2c2 + 2b2a2 + 2a2c2 - a4 - b4 - c4 + a2b2c2 = 0. 34. We have .J!.. +-.:... = 2a, -.:... +-=- = 2b -=-+.L = 2c. z y x z 'y x Squaring these equalities and adding them, we get ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ - + - + - +- - + - + - +- 6 c-= 4a2 +- 4b2 +- 4c2 • ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ On the other hand, multiplying these equalities, we find y2 z2 z2 x2 x2 y2 12+ -y2+7+ ZZ-+YZ-+7 +2 =8abc. Consequently, the result of eliminating x, y and z from the given system is a2 + b2 + c2 - 2abc = 1. 35. We have an identity (a + b + c) (b + c - a) (a + c - b) (a + b - c) = 4b2c2 _ (b 2 + c2 _ a2)2. Replacing in the right member a2 , b2 and c2 by their expres- sions in terms of x, y and z, and using the relationship xy + xz + yz = 0, we get 266 Solutions Thus, the actual result of eliminating x, y and z from the given system is (a + b + e) (b + e - a) (a + e - b) (a + b - e) = O. 36. We have (x + y)3 = x3 + y3 + 3xy (x + y) = = x3 + !l + ~ (x + y) f(x + y)2 - (x2 + y2)J. And so (x + y)3 = 3 (x + y) (x2 + y2) _ 2 (x3 + y3). But x + y = a, x2 + y2 = b, :1:1 + y3 = e. Consequently, the result of the elimination is a3 = 3ab - 2e. 37. Put Then a = xt.., b = yt.., e = zt... (*) On the other hand, we have (a + b + e)2 = a2 + b2 + e2 + 2ab + 2ae + 2be. Since a + b + e = 1, a2 + b2 + e2 = 1, we obtain from the last equality ab + ae + be = O. Taking into consideration the equalities (*), we find xy + xz + yz = O. 38.

From the first two equalities we find z (d - c) + x (d - a) + y (d - b) = O,} (*) w (d - c) + x (a - c) + y (l> - c) = 0. Multiplying the first equality by y, and the second by x, and adding them, we get (zy + wx) (d - c) = x 2 (c - a) + y2 (b - d) + + xy (a + c - b - d). We find in the same way that (zx + wy) (d - c) = x2 (a - d) + y2 (c - b) + + xy (b + c - a - d), zw (d - C)2 = x 2 (a - d) (c - a) + + y2 (b - d) (c - b) + + xy [(a - d) (c - b) + (b - d) (c - a)J. Substituting the found expressions for zy + wx, zx + wy and zw in to the third equali t y, we get AX2 + 2/3xy + Cy2 = 0, where A = (c - a) (a - d)2 (b - C)2 + (c - d) X X (b - d)2 (c - a)2 + + (a - d) (c - a) (d - c) (n - b)2, C = (b - d) (a - d)2 (b - C)2 + + (c - b) (b - d)2 (c - a)2 + + (b - d) (c - b) (d - c) (a - b)2, 2B = (a + c, - b - d) (a - d)2 (b - C)2 + + (b + c - a - d) (b - d)2 (c - a)2 + + (d - C)3 (a - [;)2 + [(a - d) (c - b) + + (b - d) (c - a)J (d - c) (a - b)2. Performing all the necessary transformations (the work can be simplified by making use of the result of Problem 8, 268 Solutions Sec. 2), we find A = (a - d)2 (c - a)2 (c - d), B = (d - c) (a - d) (b - c) (a - c) (d - b), C = (c - b)2 (b - d)2 (c - d). Therefore we ha ve Ax2 + 2Bxy + Cy2 = (c - d) [(a - d) (a - c) x - - (b - c) (d - b) y12 = O. Hence x y (b-c) (d-b) (a-d) (a-c) . Substituting these values into the equality (*), we get the required proportion. 40. 1° We have 2cos a+~ cos a-~ -(2cos 2 a+~ -1) =~ 2 2 2 2 or 4cos 2 at~ -4cos a-;~ cos at~ +1=0.

Rewl'ite the given equalities in the following way sin e (b cos ex - a cos ~) = cos e (b sin ex - a sin ~), sin e (d sin ex _. c sin ~) = cos e (c cos ~ - d cos ex).

From the fust two equalities it is obvious that e and cp are the roots of the equation x cos a + y sin a - 2a = ° (unknown a).

Rewrite the equation as -c-os-' ('-x---a-)- {( 1 + k) cos x cos (2x - a) - - (1 + k eos 2£) eos (x -:x)} = o.

Let x =-= a + ~i, hence x = a - ~i. 1° By hypothesis, a - ~i = a 2 - ~2 + 2a~i. Hence Therefore ~ (2a + 1) = 0, a = a 2 _ ~2. Assnme first ~ = 0, a = a 2 or a (a - 1) = O.

The above proof was carried out by the method of mathematical induction. Let us add to it another proof. Suppose the complex numbers are reduced to the trigonometric form, i.e. put x = PI (cos CPt + i sin CPt), y = P2 (cos CP2 t- i sin CP2), ... , w = pn (cos cP\" + i sin cp,,).

But since 1 + e + e2 = 0, the last three expressions in square brackets are equal to zero and I A 12 + I B 12 + I e 12 = 3 [I X 12 + I Y 12 + I Z 12]. 7. On the basis of the result obtained in 10 of Problem 6, we have \"AA'+BB'+CC' \"AA'+BB'e 2 +CC'e X= 3 ,y= 3 ' Z\" _ AA' +Bfl'I::.-~ CC'e 2 - 3 . Further AA' + BB' + ee' = (x + y + z) (x' + y' + z') + + (x + ye + ze2) (x' + y'e + z'e 2) + + (x + ye 2 + ze) (x' -+ y'e 2 + Z'e) = = 3 (xx' -+ zy' + yz'). And so x\" = xx' + zy' + yz'. Analogously y\" = yy' + + xz' + zx', z\" = zz' + yx' + xy' (the last two expres- sions emerge from the first one as a result of a drcular per- mutation). 8. Though this formula was already proved (see Prob- lem 2, Sec. 1), we are going to demonstrate here another proof, using this time complex numbers. We have the identity (a6 - ~y) (a'6' - Wy') = (aa' + ~y') (yW -+ 66') - let us put here - (aW + ~6') (ya' + 6y'), a = x -j- yi, ~ = z + ti, y = -(z - ti), 6 = x - yi. a' = a + bi, W = c + di, y' = -(c - di), 6' = a - bi. .'~()l/)fions to Spc. 6 Then aO - ~V = x 2 -I- y2 + Z2 + t2 , a' 6' - W V' = a2 + b2 + e2 + d2 , aa' -\\- ~y' = (fl.'}; - by - ez ~ dt) + 2~1 + i( bx + ay + dz - et), vW + 06' = ~V' + aa' = (aa' + ~V')· Therefore (aa' + ~V') (vW + 06') = (ax - by - ez - dt)2 + + (bx + ay + dz - et)2. Further aW + ~6' = (ex - dy + az + bt) + + i (dx + cy - bz + at), va' + 6V' = -(ex - dy + az + bt) + -1 i (dx + ey - bz + at), i.e. -(aW +- ~6') (va' + 6V') = (ex - dy + az + bt)2 + + (dx + ey - bz + at) 2 • Substituting the obtained expressions into the original identity, we find (a2 + b2 + e2 + d2) (x2 + y2 + Z2 + t2) = = (ax - by - ez - dt)2 + (bx + ay + dz - et)2 + + (ex - dy + az + bt)2 + (dx + ey - bz + at)2. Replacing in it d by -d and t by -t, we get the required identity. 9. Expand the expression (cos <p + i sin <p)n, by the binomial formula. We have (cos <p + i sin <p)n = cosn <p + n cosn- 1 <p i sin <p + + n (n-1) cosn-2 <p (i sin <p)2 + 11 (n-1) (n-2) cosn- 3 m X 1·2 1·2·3 ~ X (i sin <p)3 + ... + n cos <p (i sin <p)n-l + (i sin <Pt. 292 Solutions Separating the real part from the imaginary one in this expansion, and using de Moivre's formula, we find cos ncp + i sin ncp = ( cosn cp - n (7.-; 1) cosn-2 cp sin2 cp + ... ) + + i ( n cosn - 1 cp sin cp _ n (n -;.1J.~.-2) cosn-3 cp sin3 cp + ... } . Hence n n (n-1) n-2 . 2 cos ncp = cos cp - 1 .2 cos cp sm cp + ... , sin ncp = n cos n - 1 cp sin cp _ n (n-;.1~.(;-2) cosn- 3 cp sin3 cp + ... Taking into account the parity of n and dividing both members of these equalities by cosn CPt we get the required formulas. 10. First prove case 1°. We have (cos qJ + i sin qJ) + (cos qJ- i sin qJ) cos cp= 2 Put cos cp + i sin cp = £. Then cos q> - i sin cp = £-1, Further In the second sum put m-k= -(m-k'). Then this sum is rewritten in the following manner. o m-1 ~ C 2m - k ' -2(m-k') ~ Ck -2(m-k) LJ 2m £ = LJ 2m£ • k'=m-1 k=O And so m-1 22m cos2m q> = ~ C~m (£2(m-k) + £-2(m-k») + CZm. k=O However, £2(m-k) + £ -2(m-k) = 2 cos 2 (m - k). Solutions to Sec. 6 Therefore, m-l 22m-cOS2nl cp = S 2C~m cos 2 (m - k) cp + C~m. k=O 293 Replacing in thi.s formula cp by- ~ - cp, we get formula 2°. Formulas 3° and 4° are deduced as 1° and 2°. 11. Form the expression Un + iVn = (cos ex + i sin ex) + + r [cos (ex + 8) + i sin (ex + 8)J + ... + + rn [cos (ex + n8) + i sin (ex + n8)] = = (cos ex + i sin ex) {1 + r (cos 8 + i sin 8) + ... + + rn (cos n8 + i sin n8)}.

At x = a the second factor of the last product vanishes and, consequently, is divisible by x - a; therefore the given polynomial is divisible by (x - a)2. 2° Let us denote the polynomial by P n and set up the difference P\" - P n - 1• Transforming this difference, we easily prove that it is divisible by (1 - X)3. Since it is true 296 Solutions for any positive n, we obtain a number of equalities Pn - Pn - I = (1 - X)3 CPn (x), Pn - I - Pn - Z = (1 - X)3 CPn-1 (x), P a - P z = (1 - X)3 CP2 (x), P 2 - PI = (1 - X)3 CPI (x), where CPJ (x) are polynomials with respect to x. Hence P n - PI = (1 - X)3 '\\jJ (x). But since PI = (1 - x)3, it follows that Pn is divisible by (1 - X)3 and our proposi- tion is proved. . 15. 10 Considering the given expression as a polynomial in y, let us put y = O. We see that at y = 0 the polynomial vanishes (for any x). Therefore our polynomial is divisible by y. Since it is symmetrical both with respect to x and y (remains unchanged on permutation of these letters), it is divisible by x as well. Thus, the polynomial is divisible by xy. To prove that it is divisible by x + y, let us put in it y = -x. It is evident that for odd n we have (x - x)n - xn - (_x)n = O. Consequently, our polynomial is divisible by x + y. It only remains to prove the divisibility of the polynomial by x2 + xy + y2 = (y - xe) (y - xe2), where e2 +'e + 1 = O. For this purpose it only remains to replace y first by xe and then by xe2 and to make sure that with these substitu- tions the polynomial vanishes. Since, by hypothesis, n is not divisible by three, it follows that n = 3l + 1 or 3l + 2. At y = xe the polynomial attains the following value (x+ xe)n_x\" - (xe)n = xn {e2n+ 1 + en} = xn (1 + e+ e2)=0. Likewise we prove that at y = xe2 the polynomial vanishes as well, and, consequently, its divisibility by xy (x + y) X X (X2 + xy + y2) is proved. Solutions to Sec. 6 297 2° To prove this statement let us proceed as follows. Let the quantities -x, -y and x + y be the roots of a cubic equation a 3 - ra 2 - pa - q = 0. Then, by virtue of the known relations between the roots of an equation and its coefficients (see the beginning of this section), we have r = -x - y + (x + y) = 0, -p = xy - x (x + y) - - y (x + y), q = xy (x + y). Thus, -x, - y and x + yare the roots of the following equation a 3 - pa - q = 0, where p = x 2 + xy + y2, q = xy (x + y). Put (_x)n+(_yt+(x f-y),\"=S\". Between successive values of Sn there exist the following rela tionshi ps S n +3 = pS n + I + qS n , SI being equal to zero. Let us prove that Sn is divisible by p2 if n = 1 (mod 6) using the method of mathematical induction. Suppose S\" is divisible by p2 and prove that then SnH is also divisible by p2. We have Sn+6 = pSnH +qSn+3, S\"H = pS n+2+ qSn+l' Therefore Sn+G = P (pSn+2 + qSn+') + q (pSn+! + qSn) = = p2Sn+2 + 2pqSn+1 + q2Sn. Since, by supposition, S\" is divisible by p2, it suffices to prove that Sn+1 is divisible by p. Thus, we only have to prove that (x + yt + ( - x)\" + ( _ y)n is divisible by x 2 + xy + y3 if n = 2 (mod 6). Proceeding in the same way as in 1°, we easily prove our assertion. And so, assuming that S\" is divisible by p2, we have proved that SnH is also divisible by p2. But S 1 = ° is divisible 298 Solutions by p2. Consequently, Sn=(x+y)n_ x ll _yn is divisible by (x2 + xy + y2) at any n = 1 (mod 6). It only remains to prove its divisibility by x + y and by xy. 16. Equality 1° is obvious. From Problem 15 it follows that (x + y)5 - x 5 - y5 is divisible by xy (x + y) (x2 + + xy + y2). Since both the polynomials (x + y)5 _ x5 _ y5 and xy (x + y) (x2 + xy + y2) are homogeneous with respect to x and y of one and the same power, the quotient of division (x + y)f> - x5 - y5 by xy (x + y)(x2, + xy + y2) will be a certain quantity independent of x and y. Let us denote it br A. We then have (x + y)5 _ x5 _ y5 = Ay (x + y) (x2 + xy + y2). Since this equality represents an identity and, hence, holds for all values of x and y, let us put here, for instance, x = 1, y = 1. We get 25 - 1 - 1 = A ·2 ·3. Hence A = 5, and we finally get (x + y)5 _ x5 _ y5 = 5xy (x + y) (x 2 + xy + y2). Using the result of Problem 15 (2°), we can write similarly (x + y)1 - x7 - y7 = Axy (x + y) (x2 + xy + y2)2. Putting h~'I~e x = y = 1, we find A = 7. 17. It is known that (x + y + Z)3 - x3 - y3 - Z3 = 3 (x + y) (x + z) (y + z). Let us prove that (x + y + z)m - xm - ym - zm is di- visible by x + y. Considering our polynomial rearranged in powers of x, we put in it x = -yo We have (_y + y + z)m _ (_y)m _ ym _ zm -= 0, since m is odJ. Consequently, our polynomial is divisible by (x + y). Likewise we make sure that it is divisible by (x + z) and by (y + z). . 18. The condition necessary and sufficient for a polyno- mial t (x) to be divisible by x - a consists in that t (a) = Solutions to See. 6 299 = O. Put f (x)' = X3 + kyzx = y3 + Z3. For this polynomial to be divisible by x + y + z it is necessary and sufficient that 1 (-y - z) = O. However 1 (-y - z) = -(y + Z)3 - kyz (y + z) + 1/ + Z3 = = -(k + 3) yz (y + z), wherefrom follows k = -3. Thus, for x3 + y3 + Z3 + + kxyz to be divisible by x + y + z it is necessary and suffICient that k = -3. 19. Divide n by p. We get n = lp + r, where l is a posi- tive integer and 0 < r < p. Consequently, xn_ an ,,= xlPx r _ alPa r = xlPx r _ alPx r + alPx r _ alPa r =, = xr (x iP _ alP) + alP (Xr _ a r ). But x lp - alp = (xp)l - (aP)l is divisible by x P - a P, therefore for the di visi bili ty xn - an by x P - a P it is necessary and sufficient that xr - ar is divisible by x P - aP • But it is possible only when r = 0, and, consequently, n = lp. Finally, for xn - an to be divisible by x P - a P it is necessary and sufficient that n is divisible by p. 20. Put 1 (x) = x4a + X4b+1 + X4c+2 + x 4d +3. On the other hand, x3 + x 2 + X + 1 = (x + 1) (x 2 + 1) = = (x + 1) (x + i) (x - i). I t only remains to show that 1(-1) =/(i) =/(-i) =0. 21. We have . ., x 2\"-1 1 + x 2 + X4 + ... + X 2n - 2 = x 2 -1 ' , 1 xn-1 1 -\\-.c+ x~+ ... -\\- x n - = --1-. x-- x2n-1 xn-1 It is required to fllld out at what n x2 -1 : x-l will be a polynomial in x. We fmd x2n-1 xn-l x\"+l x 2 -1 : --:x=-1 = x + 1 . 300 Solutions For xn + 1 to be divisible by x + 1 it is necessary and sufficient that .(-1)n + 1 = 0, i.e. that n is odd. Thus, 1 + x 2 + . . . + X 2n - 2 is divisible by 1 + x + + x 2 + ... + xn - 1 if n is odd. 22. 1° Put t (x) = (cos cp + x sin cp)ll - cos ncp - x sin ncp. But x 2 + 1 = (x + i) (x - i) and t (i) = = (cos' cp + i sin cp)n - (cos ncp + i sin ncp) = 0 (by de Mo- ivre's formula). Likewise we make sure that t (-i) = 0, and our supposition is proved. 2° Resolve the polynomial x2 - 2px cos cp + p2 into factors linear in x. For this purpose find the roots of the quadratic equation x 2 - 2p x cos cp + p2 = O. We get x = p cos cp + 11 p2 cos2 cp- p2 = P (cos cp + i sin cp). Let us denote xn sin cp - pn-lx sin ncp + pn sin (n -1) cp = t (x). We have to prove that t [p(cos cp + i sin cp) = O. 23. Suppose X4 + 1 = (x 2 + px + q) (x 2 + p' X + q') = = X4 + (p + p') ,x3 + (q + q' + pp') x 2 + + (pq' + qp') x + qq'. For determining p, q, p' and q' we have four equations p+ p' =0, pp' +q+q'=O, pq' +qp' =0, qq' = 1. From (1) and (3) we fmd p' = -p, p (q' - q) = O. (1) (2) (3) (4) 1° Assumep = 0, p' = 0, q + q' = 0, qq' = 1, q2=_1, q = ±i, q' = +i. Solutions to Sec. 6 T he corresponding factoriza tion has the form X4 + 1 = (x 2 + i) (x 2 - i). 2° q' = q, q2 = 1, q = + 1. 301 Suppose fIrst q' = q = 1. Then pp' = -2, p -I- p' = 0, p2 = 2, p = +Y2, 1\" = +-y2. The corrpsponding facto- rizat.ion is X4 + 1 = (x 2 - Y2x + 1) (x 2 + Y2x + 1). Assume then q = q' = -1, p + p' = 0, pp' = 2, p = +Y2i, p' -= +V2i. The factorization will be X'l + 1 = (x2 + Y2ix - 1) (x2 -- Y2ix - 1). 24. Put. -va=fbi = x + .IIi, whence a + bi = x 2 - y2 + 2xyi; consequently, x 2 - .112 ~= a, 2xy = b. To lind x andy it only remains to solve this system of two equations in two unknowns. We have (X2 + .112)2 = (X2 - y2)2 + 4x2y2 = a2 + b2, x 2 + y2 = V a2 + b2 ; therefore x 2 = a + V a2 + b2 , y2 = - a + V a~ + b2 , X= + V a+ V a2 +b 2 , y= +V -a+ Y a2 +b 2 , the signs of the roots being related as 2.];y = b. And so, the following formula takes place V a + bi = + (V a + V a2 + b2 + i V - a + y a2 + b2 ) if b > 0 (since then the signs of x and .II must be the same), and V a + bi = + (V a + V a2 + b2 - i V - a + -V a2 + b2 ) if b < O. 302 ,~olutions 25.

Consider the equation (with t as an unknown) x2 y2 z2 -t-+ t-b2 + t-c2 = 1- By virtue of the given equations this equation has three roots: ~2, y2, p2. Expanding the last equation in powers of t, we get t (t - b2) (t - c2) - x 2 (t - b2) (t - c2) - - y2 (t - c2) t - Z2 (t - b2) t = 0, t 3 + (Xt 2 + . . . = 0, where (X = _b 2 _ c2 _ x 2 _ y2 _ Z2. But as we know, the roots of this equation are ~ 2 , y2, p2. Therefore, it must be ~ 2 + y2 + p2 = b2 + c2 + x2 + y2 + Z2. 306 Solutions Hence x2 + y2 + Z2 = It 2 + V 2 + p2 _ b2 _ c2. 33.

On the basis of the given data we have identically xn + PI Xn- 1 + P2Xn-2 + ... + Pn-lx + pn = = (x-a) (x-b) ... (x-k). Substituting for x first i and then -i and multiplying term- wise, we get the required result. 35. Extracting the two given equations termwise, we find (p - p') x + (q - q') = O. (1) Multiplying the first equation by q' and the second by q and subtracting term by term, we have x3 (q' - q) + x (pq' - qp') = 0 x 2 (q' - q) + pq' - qp' = O. (2) Eliminating then x from equations (1) and (2), we obtain the required result. 36. The roots of the equation x' = 1 Solutions to Sec. 6 307 are 2kn 0 0 2kn (k 0 1 2 6) cOS-7-+lsm-7- =\", ... , . Therefore, the roots of the equation x6+x6+x4+x3+x2+x+1=0 (*) will be 2kn + 0 0 2kn x.- cos-- lSlD-- ... - 7 7 (k= 1, 2,3,4,5,6). Put • 1 x+X-=y, then 1 1 X2+ X2\"= y2-2, X3+--;3=y3_3y. Equation (*) may be rewritten in the following way (X3 + ;3 ) + (X2 + ~) + (x + ! ) + 1 = O. It is evident that 1 - 2kn XI = 3 0 6, X2 = X5, X3 = X4, Xli. + - = Xh + Xh = 2 cos -7-' Xh Hence, we may conclude that the quantities 2n 4n 8n 2 cos -7-' 2 cos -7- , 2 cos -7- are the roots of the following equation y3+ y2_2y_1 =0. Let us set up an equation with the following roots V 2n V 4n V3 ' 8n 1 2 cos -7- , 2 cos -7- , 2 cos -7- . Let the roots of a certain cubic equa tion X3 - ax2 + bx - c = 0 be a, ~, 1'. We then have a+~+I'=a, a~ +al'+~1' = b, a~1' = c. 308 Solutions Let the equation, whose roots are the quantities ;/a, .v~, ~y, be x3 - Ax 2 + Bx - C = o. Then Va+V~+Vy=A, ~,raV~+Va~/Y+nVy=B, V a~I'=C. Let us make use of the following identity (m-t- p+q)3= m3+ p3+ q3+ +3 (m+ p +q) (mp + mq+ pq)-3mpq. Putting here instead of m, p and q first Va, V~, Vy-, and then V a~, V aI', V ~I', we find A3 = a + 3AB - 3C, B3 = b + 3BCA - 3C2. In our case we have a = -1, b = -2, e = 1, C = 1. Hence A 3 = 3AB - 4, B3 = 3AB - 5. Multiplying these equations and putting AB = z, we find Z3 - 9z2 + 27z - 20 = 0, (z - 3)3 + 7 = 0, z = 3 - 7. V- But 3/-A3=3z-4=5-3V 7, Therefore, indeed, Va+V~+VY= V 2n y 4n V 8n =~ 2 cos -7-+ 2 cos -7- + 2 cos -7-= = V 5--3 V7~7 . The second identity is proved in the same way. 37. Since by hypothesis a + b + e = 0, we may consi- der that a, band e are the roots of the following equation x3 + px + q = 0, where p = ab + aC + be, q = -abc. Solutions to Sec. 6 309 We have (a + b + e)2 = a2 + b2 + e2 + 2 (ab + ae + be), i.e. 82 = -2p. Putting in our equation in turn x = a, x = b, x = e, we get the following equalities a3 + pa + q = 0, b3 + pb + q = 0, e3 + pc + q = 0. Adding them term by term, we find S3 + PS1 + 3q = 0. But since S1 = a + b + e = 0, w'e have S3 = -3q. Multiplying both members of the original equation by Xk, putting then x = a, band e, and adding, we find Sk+3 = -PSk+t - qSk' Putting here k = 1, 2, 3, 4, we find S4 = 2p2, S5 = 5pq, S6 = _2 p 3 + 3q2, S7 = _7p2q. Taking advantage of these relationships, we easily prove the first six formulas. The last one is also obtained readily. 38. We have x - u =·v - y, x2 - u2 = v2 _ y2. The second equality may be rewritten as follows (x - u) (x + u) - (v - y) (v + y) = 0. Since x - u = v - y, the last equality is rewritten as (x - u) [x + u - (v -f y)] = 0, wherefrom follows 1° x - u = 0, v - y = 0, x = u, y = v; 2° (x + u) - (v + y) = 0, (x - u) - (v - y) = 0, x = = v, y = u. Consequently, indeed, xn + yn = un + vn. 310 Solutions Let us go over to the second case. Suppose x, y, z are the roots of a cubic equation a 3 + pa 2 + qa + r = O. Prove that u, v and t are the roots of the same equation. We have x + y + z = -p, xy + xz + yz == q, xyz = -r. Hence, to prove that u, v, and t are the roots of the same equation (whose roots are x, y and z) it is sufficient to prove that u + v + t = x + y + z, uv + ut + vt = = xy + xz + yz, uvt = xyz. The first of these equalities is true by hypothesis. The se- cond one follows immediately from the identity 2 (xy + xz + yz) = {x + y + Z)2 - (x2 + y2 + Z2) and from the condition x 2 + y2 + Z2 = U 2 + v2 + t2. Likewise, the third equality follows from the identity 3xyz = x3 + y3 + Z3 + 3 (x + y + z) X X (xy + xz + yz) - (x + y + Z)3 and from the condition x3 + y3 + Z3 = u3 + v3 + t3. Thus, u, v, t as well as x, y, z are the roots of the same third- degree equation. Therefore, one of the six possibilities takes place x y x y z z 11 y x z z x y z z y x y x Solutions to Sec. 6 It is obvious that in all cases we have ;xn T yn+zn=un+vn+tn. 39. Squaring the first trinomial, we get A2 = (;x: + 2;X2;X3) + (;xi + 2;X1;X2) e + (x~ + 2XtX3) e2 • Then A3 = (x: + ;x: + x: + 6;XtX2X3) + (3X:X2+ 3x;xt + 3X;X3) e + 3ft + (3x:xa + 3x~xt + 3xix2) e2 • Put a = X:X2 + .r~X3+ x:xj, ~ = XIX: + X2X;+ X3X~, Now x~ + x:+ x: = - (pXt + q) - (PX2 + q) - (PX3+q) = - 3q, since Furthermore therefore A3 = -9q + 3ae + 3~e2. Substituting X2 and X3, we also find B3 = -9q + 3ae2 + 3~e. Hence A3 + B3 = -18q - 3a - 3~ = -27q, since a + ~ = XtX2 (Xt + X2) + X2X3 (X2 + X3) + + X3Xt (X3 + xd = -3XtX2Xa = 3q.

I 2 S 312 Solutions 40. Put We have or [(x+ ~r+ab-~J[(x+ ~ )2+cd-~J=m. Let Then the equation takes the form ( y + ab - ~ ) ( y + cd _ ~2 ) = m, i.e. y2 + ( ab + cd _ ~2 ) Y + ( ab _ ~2 ) (cd _ ~2 ) - m = O. It only remains to solve this quadratic equation. 41. Make the following substitution then a+b x=Y--2- , a-b x+a=Y+-2- , b a-b x+ =y--2-. The equation takes the form ( a-b)4 ( a-b )'. y+-2- + Y--2- =C. But (y+ a--;b f=y4+ 4y3 a--;b +6y2( a--;b )2+ + 4y ( a --; b r + ( a --; b f. Therefore the equation takes the form y4 + 6 ( a --; b ) 2 y2 + ( a --; b r = + . Thus, the problem is reduced to solving a biquadratic equation. Solutions to Sec. 6 42. Put for brevity a+b+e=p and make the substitution x + p = y. We have (y - a) (y - b) (y - c) p - abc (y - p) = O. Hence 313 p {y3 _ (a + b + c) y2 + (ab + ae + be) y} - abey = 0 or y {(a + b + c) y2 - (a + b + e)2 y + + (ab + ae + be) (a + b + c) - abc} = O. And so, we find three values for y: one of them is zero, the other two are obtained as the roots of a quadratic equation. Then it is easy to find the corresponding values of x. 43. Rewrite the equation in the following way (x + a)3 - 3be (x + a) + b3 + e3 = O. Put x + a = y. The equation takes the form y3 _ 3bey + b3 + e3 = O. But it is known (Problem 20, Sec. 1) that y3 + b3 + e3 - 3bey = = (y + b + c) (y2 + b2 + e2 - yb - ye - be) Consequently, one of the roots of the last equation will be -b - e, the other two are found by solving the quadratic equation. Then we find the corresponding values of x. 44. The equation contains five coefficients: a, b, e, d and e, and there exist two relationships among them. Thus, three coefficients remain arbitrary. Let us express all the coefficients in terms of any three. We have a = e + d, e = b + e. The equation takes the form (e + d) X4 + bx3 + ex2 + dx + (b + c) = 0, e (x 4 + x 2 + 1) + dx (x 3 + 1) + b (x 3 + 1) = o. 314 Solution.~ But :r + 1 = (x + 1) (x2 - x + 1), X4 + x 2 + 1 = (x 4 + 2x 2 + 1) _ x 2 = (x 2 + 1)2_ x2 =z = (X2 + X + 1) (x2 - X + 1). The equation is now rewritten as (X2 _ x + 1) {c (x2 + X + 1) + dx (x + 1) + + b (x + i)} = O. Equating the first factor to zero, we find 1 +. Y3 x=2\"- t-2-· The remaining two roots are found by solving the second quadratic equation. 45. We ~ave the following formula (a + b + X)3 = a3 + b3 + x3 + 3a2 (b + x) + + 3b2 (a + x) + 3x2 (a + b) + 6 ab.r. Using this formula, reduce our equation to the form x3 - (a + b) x2 - (a - b)2 x + (a - b)2 (a + b) = 0. Hence x2 (x - a - b) - (a - b)2 (x - a - b) = 0, (x - a - b) [x 2 - (a - b)2] = 0, (x - a - b) (x + a - b) (x - a + b) = 0. Thus, the given equation has three roots: x = a + b, x = a - b, x = b - a. 46. Rewrite the equation as follows T! 2 a2x2 2ax2 2 2ax2 x + (a+x)2 - a+x =m - a+x . Consequently Hence Solutions to Sec. 6 x2 Put -- = y. Then the equation takes the form a+x y2+2ay-m 2=O, 315 wherefrom we find y and then x. For y we find the following values y = - a ± Va2 + mi. (1) The corresponding values of x are determined by th1l formula (2) Let us take the plus sign in formula (1). In this case the value of y will exceed zero. Computing, by formula (2), the corresponding values of x, we make sure that x has two values: one positive, the other negative. And so, our equa- tion always has at least two real roots, positive and nega- tive. Consider the case when the minus sign is taken in formu- la (1). Now the value of y is negative, and for x to be real it is necessary and sufficient that y2 + 4ay ,? O. And, con- sequently, it must be i.e. y + 4a ~ 0, -a- Va2+m2+4a~0, m2 ,?8a2 • With this condition satisfied, all the four roots will be real. Since ay < 0, we have I V--\"--Y4 2 +-ay I < I ~ I and, consequently, both real roots, found from formula (1) taken with the minus sign, will be negative. Thus, if all the four roots are real, then one of them is positive, the remaining being negative. 47. Put for brevity 5x4 +1Ox2 +1 x4 +10x2 +5 = f (x). Then the equation takes the form f (x) ·f (a) = ax. 316 Solutions Further, we have (x-1)6 x-f (x)= x4 +10x2 +5 ' Dividing the first equation by the second one, we find x-f (x) _ ( x-1 )5 (*) x+f(x) - x+1 .

To find all the solutions of the given system it is neces- sary to consider all possible (27) combinations. Thus, we get 27 systems, each containing three equations linear in the unknowns x, y, and z. If each of these systems is designated by a three-digit number in which the place occupied by a certain digit corresponds to the number of the equation and the digit it- self to the number of the factor in this equation, then the 27 systems will be written as 111, 112, 113, 121, 122, 123, 131, 132, 133, 211, 212, 213, 221, 222, 223, 231, 232, 233, 311, 312, 313, 321, 322, 323, 331, 332, 333. Let us explain, for example, system 213: taken from the first equation is the second factor, from the second- Solutions to Sec. 6 :i19 the first factor and from the third-the third factor. Thus, system 213 will have the following form y + ze + ae 2 = 0, z + x + b = 0, x + ye 2 + ee = 0. Let us decipher some more systems y+z+a=O, z+x+b=O, x+y+e=O; y+ze+ae 2 =0, z+xe 2 +be=0, y+ze2 +ae=0, z+xe 2+be=0, y+z+a=O, z+xe+be 2 =0, and so on. 2° We have x -t- ye + ee2= 0; x+ye 2+ee = 0; x+ye+ee 2 =0 X4 = xyzu + a, y4 = xyzu + b, Z4 = xyzu + e, (111) (232) (333) (122) u4 = xyzu + d. Multiplying these equations and putting xyzu = t, we find t4 = (t + a) (t + b) (t + c) (t + d). Thus, for determining t, we have the following equation (a + b + e + d) t3 + (ab + ae + ... ) t 2 + However, + (abc + aed + ... ) t + abed = 0. a + b + e + d = 0, therefore, for finding t we get a quadratic equation.

We have CII+1 II n-\\-l,T • 320 Solutions Since this IJolynomial is multiplied by the second-degree trinomial (s - 2) x 2 + nx - s, it is clear that the coeffICient of X S in the product will be equal to (s-2) C~-2 +nC~-l-sC~. Carrying out all the necessary transformations, we see that the last expression is equal to Cs - 2 n n . 53. Put x = 1 + a, where a > ° (since x> 1).

Since q > p, we can prove that all the terms of the above expansion are positive [the coefficient of a lt (if k > p) will be equal to pql. Thus, to prove the validity of our asser- tion, it is sufficient to prove that ~ = pC~ - qC; > ° if q > P and k ~ p. We have ~=pq(q-1) ... (q-k+1) _qP(p-1) ...

Solutions to Sec. 6 32i This term must not be less than the two neighbouring terms T k- 1 and Tk+t. Thus, there exist the following inequalities Whence Tk ~ T k- 1, Tk ~ Tk+l' n-k a 1 k+1 ·x~ . The first of them yields k& (n+1) a \"'\" x+a From the second one we get k~(n+1)a 1. ~ x+a First assume the (n+1)a is a whole number.

In this case the inequalities take the form k';;:'[ (n+1)a J+8 k~[ (n+1)a J-(1-8)- '\"<::: x+a ,:;- x+a I t is apparent that in this case there exists only one value of k at which our inequalities are satisfied, namely k=[ (n+1)a J. x+a 322 SolutIOns And when (n +1 l)a is not a whole number, there exists so, x -a only one greatest term T k • 55. Let i and rii be positive integers. We have (x+1)m_xm=mxm-1+ m(~.;1) xm- 2+ ... +mx+1. Heplacing here x by x+l, we get (x +2)m_ (x-t- 1)m = = m (x+ 1)\"'-1 + m (7.; 1) (x+ 1)m-2+ ... + m (x+ 1) + 1.

Multiplying these equalities term by term, we find the required result. 57. 1° We can write our product in the following way n n 2n ~ x 8 ~ xt= ~ Alxl, 8=0 t=o 1=0 wherefrom it follows that Al= ~ 1. 8+,=1 O~s~r, O~t~n First assume l ~ n. Then s can attain the values s = 0, 1,2, ... , l and, consequently, Al = l + 1 if l ~ n. \"If n -< l ~ 2n, then we put l = n + l', where 1 ~ l' ~ n, l' = l - n. In this case s can take only the following values s = l', l' + 1, . . ., n. The total number of values will be n - (l' - 1) = n - (l - n - 1) = 2n - l + 1. And so, Al = 2n + 1 - l if n < l ~ 2n. It is easily seen that A n- k = An+k = n - k + 1.

Thus, A, = 0 for any odd l, i.e. the product contains only even powers of x, and if n is even, then all the coeffi- cients (of even powers) are equal to +1; if n is odd, then half of them is equal to +1, the other half to ~1 Ao = Az = ... = A n- 1 = +1, An+1 = A n+3 = ... = Azn = -1. 3° We have n n 2n ~ (k+1) Xli ~ (s+ 1) X8= ~ A,X'. k=O 8=0 1=0 Hence A , = ~ (k+1)(s+1)= ~ (ks+l+1). 1i+8=1 k+8=1 O~k~n O~k~n O~.~n O~a~n Let us first assume that l ::;;;; n, then k can take on only the following values: 0, 1, 2,' ... , l, the corresponding values of s being l, l - 1, ... , o.

Since the product (x - a) (x - b) is a second-degree trinomial, when divided by it, the polynomial t (x) will necessarily leave a remainder which is a first-degree polyno- mial in x, (Xx + ~. Thus, there exists the following identity t (x) = (x - a) (x - b) Q (x) + (Xx + ~. I t only remains to determine (X and ~. Putting in this iden- tity first x = a and then x = b, we get t (a) = (Xa + ~, t (b) = (Xb + ~. But we know that the remainder from dividing t (x) by x - a is equal to t (a), therefore, t(a) =A, t (b) = B. Thus, for determining (X and ~ we get the fQllowing system of two equations in two unknowns Hence t (X=--(A-B) a-b ' ~_aB-bA - a-b' 74.

To find .1'1' X2' ' •• , X\" it only remains to solve a system of linear eqlla tions. Demonstrated below is the original metbod of solving this system belonging to S. Ramanujan.

Since the quantities at, az, ... , an, an+1! 0 •• , a 2n are known, the last equations enable us to find first B t , B 2 , ••• , Bn and then. At, A 2 , ••• , An. Knowing the quantities Solutions to Sec. 6 353 Ai and Bio we can construct a rational fraction <l> (8) and then expand it into partial fractions. Let, for instance, the following expansion take place <l> (8) ;--1~ + 1 P2 8 + 1 P3 8 + ... + 1 Pn 8 . -qlv -q2 -q3 -qn ThC'n it is clear that XI = PI!

Expanding this fraction into partial ones, we get the following values for the unknowns 3 x=-\"5' p=-1, 18+ Vs Y= 10 ' 18-V5 Z= 10 ' u = __ 8 +\":\",,,V\"\"\",,=-5 2V5 ' 8-VS V= 2V5 97. 1° We have (m, It) = 3+VS q= 2 ' 3-V5 r= 2 ' V5-1 s= 2 • = (i-x) (1-x Z) ...

Adding these equalities termwise, we find (m, 1-t+1)=(I-t, I-t)+x (1-t+1, I-t)+ .. . +x m - Il - 1 (m-1, I-t). (*) 4° It is required to prove that (m, I-t) is a polynomial. We have ( 1) 1-xm 1 + 2+ m-l m, = 1-x = +x x ... + x . Thus, our proposition is true at I-t = 1 and any m. Assuming that (m, k) is a polynomial at k ~ I-t, by virtue of the for- mula (*), we may assert that (m, I-t + 1) is also a polyno- mial. And so, our proposition is proved by the method of mathematical induction. 5° Introduce the notation f (x, m) = 1 - (m, 1) + (m, 2) - (m, 3) + ... + + (_1)m (m, m). Solutions to Sec. 6 First let us prove that f (x, m) = (1 - xm - 1) f (x, m - 2). We have 1 = 1, (m, 1) = (m-1, 1) +xm - 1 , (m, 2) = (m-1, 2)+xm-2 (m-1, 1), (m, 3)=(m-1, 3)+x m - 3 (m-1, 2), (m, m-1) = (m-1, m-1)+x (m-1, m-2), (m, m)=(m-1, m-1). 355 Multiplying these equalities successively by ± 1 and adding the results, we get f (x, m) = (1_xm- 1 ) - (m -1, 1)(1-xm- 2 ) + (m-1, 2) X But X (1_xm- s)_ ... + (_1)m-z (m-1, m-2) (i-x). (1_x m- 2 ) (m-1, 1) = (1_x m - 1)(m_2, 1), (1-x m - s)(m-1, 2)= (1-x m- 1)(m-2, 2), Therefore f(x, m)=(1-xm-l){1-(m-2, 1)+(m-2, 2)- ... + +(-1)m-2(m-2, m-2)}=(1-x m- 1)f(x, m-2). Thus f(x, m)=(1-xm- 1)f(x, m-2), t (x,. m -2) = (1_x m- s) f (x, m-4), First let us assume that m is even. We get f(x, m)=(1_xm-l) (1_x m - s) (1_xm-o) ... (1-x 3) t(x, 2). But 1 f_x2 t(x,2)= -(2,1)+(2,2)=2-· i-x =1-x. Consequently, indeed, t(x, m)=(1_xm- 1) (1_xm- s) '\" (1-x 3 )(1-x) if m is even. 356 Solutions If m is odd, we have t (x, m) = (1_x m- l )(1_x m- a) ... (1-x 2 ) t (x, 1). But t (x, 1) = 0, consequently t (x, m) = ° for any odd m. However, the last fact can be readily established imme- diately from the expression for t (x, m) t(x, m)=1-(m, 1)+(m, 2)--(m, 3)+ ... +(-1)m(m, m). 98. 1° Put n h(h+l) 1+ ~ !1-xn) (i_x n- 1) ••• (i_x n- h+1 ) x-2-zh=F(n).

F (n+ 1)-F (n) = ZXn +1 F (n), F (n+ 1) = (1 + zxn+l) F (n). Therefore Solutions to Sec. 6 F (n) = (1 + zxn) F (n -1), F (n-1) = (1 +zxn - 1) F (n-2), F (3) = (1 + zx 3 ) F (2), F (2) = (1 + zx2 ) F (1), F (1) = 1 + xz. Multiplying these equalities, we actually get F (n) = (1 + xz) (1 + x 2z) ... (1 + xnz). 2° is proved similarly. From 1° it also follows that (1-xn) (1-xn-1) '\" (1_x n- h+1) (1-,x) (1-x 2) ... (1-xh) is a polynomial in x (see Problem 97). 357 From the same equality we can obtain Newton's binomial formula as well. Indeed 1- xn- h+1 1-xh 1 +x+x2+ ... +x n- h 1+x+x2+ ... +x h- 1 Therefore, at x = 1 the last expression attains the value n-k+1 k sion Consequently, we may consider that the expres- (1- xn) (1- xn-1) ... (1- xn-h+1~ (i-x) (1-x 2) ... (1-xh) at x = 1 turns into n (n-1) ... (n-k+1) C~ 1·2 '\" k and formula 1° at x = 1 yields h=n (1 + zt = 1 + ~ C~Zh (Euler). h=1 99.

Making use of Cjln (z) expressed as a sum, we find with the aid of the last identity ChX2k +1 (1- x2n-211) = Ch+1 (1- ;l2IH2h+2) (k=O, 1, 2, ... , n-1). Furthermore, it is obvious that Cn ~= xn2. Putting in the last relation the following values for k in succession: n - 1, n - 2, .... , ° and multi plyi ng the equali ties thus obtained, we find C (1_x2n+2h+2) (1 - x 2n+21'+4) ...

We have to compute the following sum 2n 2n ~ (_1)11 Uk = ~ (_1)k (2n, k)2 q-h(2n- h), h=O 11=0 where (2n, 0) = 1. From Problem 98, 1° we have 2n 11(11+1) (1- qz) (1- q2Z) ...

However, this equality is equivalent to the following b-a c-b or b-a c-b b+c = a+b ' i.e. b2 _ a2 = c2 _ b2 • The last equality follows immediately from the condition of the problem. 2. If an is the nth term and am the mth term of the arithme- tic progression, then we have an = at + d (n - 1), am = at + d (m - 1), where d is the comr,pon difference of the progression 362 .'~ol/l.tions Hence an - am = (n - m) d. By hypothesis, we have the following equalitiE's b - c = (q - r) d, c - a = (r - p) d, a - b = (p - '1) d. ~hiltiplying the first of them by a, the second by b. and the third by c, we ~pt d [(q - r) a + (r - p) b + (p - q) c] = = a (b - c) + b (c - a) + c (a - b)= 0, whpnce (q - r) a + (r - p) b + (p - '1) c = O. 3. We have a p - a q = (p - q) d, where d is the common difference of the progression. Since, by hypothpsis, a p = q, a'l = p, then a p - a q = q - p, therefore and, consequently, q - p CO\" (p - q) d, d =-1 (we assume p - q =1= 0). Further hence am = a p + (m - p) d = '1 - m + p. 4.

It is evident that if a1t az, ... , all form a geometric progression, then (provided k + s = k' + +s') Indeed ak = a1qh-l, as = alq\"-l, ah,= a1qh'-I, as,=alqs'-I.

Now let us assume that this relation takes place. It is required to prove that the numbers ai' a2' ... , an form a geometric progression. In this case all the bracketed expres- sions in the right member of the equality H are equal to zero. But among these expressions there is the following one (alak - a2ak_l)2 (k = 3, 4, ... , n). Therefore we have ~=~ (k=3, 4, ... , n), a't -l al i.e. the numbers at. a2, ... , an really form a geometric progression. 18. 10 I t is known that 8 _ amq- al m- q-1 Let us make up the required sum.

Solutions to Sec. 7 371 Consider the product aka\"k. We have aka\"k = alan - (k - 1)2 d2 + (k - 1) d (an - al) - =ala n - (k - 1)2 d2 + (k - 1) (n - 1) tP. And sO\" aka\"k = alan + tP {(k - 1) (n - 1) - (k - 1)2}.

Let us prove that Indeed qh + q\"-k-1 -1-- qn-1 == (qk -1) + qn-h-1 (1- qk) = = (qk -1) (1- qn-k-l) -< 0, since if q> 1, then qk - 1 ~ 0, 1 - qn-k-l ~ 0, and if q < 1, then qk - 1 ~ 0, 1 - qn-k-l ~ 0. At q = 1 it is clear that the product contained in the left member of our inequality is equal to zero. And so, indeed, qk + qn-k-1 -< 1 + qn-1. The braced expression contains n bracketed expressions each of which does not exceed 1 + qn-l. Therefore qn-1 1+qn-t ~<n 2 ' i.e. which solves the problem. 21. Let the first common term of the progressions be a, and the second b. Then the nth term of the arithmetic pro- gression will be equal to a + (b - a) (n - 1), and the corresponding term of the geometric progression has the form And so, we have to prove that a+(b-a) (n-1) <a ( : r-1, Solutions to Sec. 7 373 in other words, that a+ (b-a) (n-1) -a (~)n-l -<0, or a { ( ! - 1 ) (n - 1) ~ [ ( ! ) n-l - 1 J } -< 0. Let us rewrite the left member of this inequality as fol- lows a ( : _ 1 ) { (n -1) _ [ ( ! ) n- 2 + ( ! ) n - 3 + ... + ( ! ) + 1 ] } . Considering separately the three Cases: ~ > 1, ~ < 1, a a ~ = 1, we easily prove the validity of our inequality. a 22. We have to compute Sn = 1 ·X + 2x2 + 3x3 + ... + nxn. Multiplying both members of this equality by x, we have Snx = 1·x2 + 2x3 + 3x' + ... + (n - 1) xn + nxn+l. It is evident that the right member is equal to Sn - X - x 2 - x3 - ••• - xn + nxn+l. Thus, we have the identity Snx= Sn+ nxn+l_ x(1 + x+ X2+ ... + x n- 1) , S xn-1 n (x-i) = nxM1 _ x-- 1-, x- Sn (x-1)2 = x {nxM1 + 1- (n + 1) xn}. And, finally, we have Sn = (x~ 1)2 {nxMl_ (n + 1) xn+ 1}. 23. We have 374 Solutions Let u~ multiply both members of this equality by q (where q is the ratio of the geometric progression). We obtain n sq= ~ ahuh+1 \"=1 (since u\"q = Uh+l). Subtract s from both members of the last equality. We have n n sq-s= ~ ahU\"+l- ~ a\"uh. 11=1 11=1 Transform the right member as follows n+1 n+1 ~ a\"_lu ,, - ~ a\"u\" - alul + an+1Un+1 =- =2 11=2 n+1 = - h (a\" - a\"-11 u\" - al u l + a n+1Un+1 = \"=2 n+1 = - ~ du\" + an+1Un+1 - alel], \"=2 where d is the Common difference of the arithmetic progres- sion. Thus Finally _ an+1U n+l- a l ul d 1l,,+lQ-1l2 s- q-l - (q-l)2 . 24. The required sum can be rewrit ten in the following way 2+ 4 + 2n 1 1 1 2 x x + ... x +-2+-' + ... +'-2 + n. x x~ X n Summing each of the geometric progressions separately and joining the partial sums thus obtained, we have ( x + ! ) 2 + ( x2 + ;2 ) 2 + ... + ( xn + :n ) 2 = (x2n+2+1) (x2n-l) 2 = (x2-1)x2n + n. Solutions to Sec. 7 375 25. The sum 8 1 is readily computed by the formula for an arithmetic progression. Let us now compute 8 2 • Consider the following identity (x + 1)3 - r = 3x2 + 3x + 1. Putting here in succession x = 1, 2, 3, ... , n and sum- ming up the obtained equalities termwise, we have n n n n ~ (X+1)3- ~ r=3 ~ x2+3 ~ x+n. x=1 x=1 x=1 x=1 Or {23+33+ .. . +n3+(n +1)3}_{f3+2 3 + ... +n 3}_= =38 2 +38 1 +n. And so 382 +38 1 +n=(n+1)3-1. But 8 _ n(n+1) t - 2 . Now we find easily 8 2 =n (n+1)6(2n+1) • The formula for 8 3 is deduced in a similar way. We only have to consider the identity (x + 1)4 - X4 = 4x3 + 6x2 + 4x + 1 and make use of the expressions for Stand 8 2 found before. 26. We have identically (x+ 1)h+1_ XIlH == (k+ 1) Xh + (kt.~ k xJt- 1+ + (k+~).~.(~-1) Xh-2+ ... + (k+ 1) x+ 1. Putting here successively x = 1, 2, 3, ... , n, and sum- ming up, we get the required formula. 376 Solutions ............ . 111 211 3 11 411 ... nil The sum of terms of each line is equal to 1 II + 211 + + ... + nil = Sk (n). Thus, the sum of all the terms of the table will be nS II (n). On the other hand, summing along the broken lines, we get the following expression for the sum of all the terms of the table 111+(111+2.211)+(111+211+3.3k)+(111+211+ 311+4.411) + + ... + (111+211+3 11 + .. , + (n-1)II+ n.n ll ) = = 1 + [Sk (1) + 211+1] + [Sk (2) + 311+1] + [SII (3) + 411+1]+ ... + + [Sk (n-1) + n1l +1] = =SII(1)+Sk(2)+ ... +SII(n-1)+ + (111+1 + 2R+l + 3 11+1 + ... + nll+1 ). And so nSk (n)=SII+I (n)+SII (n-1)+Sk (n-2)+ ... +Sk (2)+S~(1). 28. Both e and 2° are readily obtained from the formu- la of Problem 26. Let us rewrite it as S kS k(k-1)S S So k=-T 11-'- 1.2.3 k-2-\"'- '-k+1+ + (n+k1~~1_1 (.) n2 +n 1 2 1 At k= 1 S,= 1+2+3+ ... +n=-2- -:-T n +Tn. Thus, both propositions (1° and 2°) are valid at k = 1. Suppose they hold true for any value of the subscript less than k and let us prove that they are also valid at the sub- script equal to k. Since, by supposition, Sk-' is a polynomial in n of degree k, Sk-2 a polynomial of degree k - 1, and so on, it is easily seen from the formula (*) that Sk is indeed Solutions to Sec. 7 377 a polynomial of degree k + 1. Further, since Sk_l, Sk-2, ... , So do not contain the term independent of n, it follows ( n+1)k+l_ 1 that S k also does not contain such a term k -1-1 ' when expanded in powers of n, will not contain a constant term). As is evident from the same formula (*), the coef- ficient of the term of the highest power in the expansion of Skin powers of n will be k! 1 . It only remains to prove that the coefficient of the second term, i.e. B, is equal to ~ . In the expansion (*) there exist only two terms contai- ning nit. One of them is contained in - ~ Sk-I, and the (n+1)k+I-1 other in k+1 . From what has been proved we have - ~ S k-I = - ~ { ! nit + ... } = - ~ nit + ... Further (n+1)k+I_1 1 k+l+ k I k-t 1 k+! n n T ... Hence, it is obvious that 1 B=2· As to the structure of the rest of the coefficients (C, ... , L), we may assert the following: the coefficient of n k +1-1 will be equal to 1 A Ck+1k + 1 , where A is independent of k. This proposition is proved using the method of induction with the aid of the formula (*). 29. S, can be computed using, for instance, the formula from Problem 26. However, we may also proceed in the following way. From the result of the previous problem it follows that 1 1 S, =\"5 n 5 +2 n 4 + Cn3 + Dn2 +En. It only remains to determine C, D and E. Since the last equality is an identity, it is valid for all values of n. Put- ting here in succession n = 1, 2, and 3, we get a system of equations in three unknowns C, D and E. Namely, we have 378 Solutions . 3 13 89 C+D:tE=W' 8C+4D+2E=5\" ' 27+C+9D+3E=1O' Hence 1 1 C=3' D=O, E= -30' It only remains to factor the expression n& n' n3 n 5+T+\"\"3-30 and the required result will be found. The remaJning three formulas are obtained similarly. 30. The validity of the identities is established by a direct check, using the expressions for 8n obtained before. 31. Put k = 1. We have (B + 1)2 - B2 = 2, or B2 + 2B, + 1 - B2 = 2. 1 Consequently, B, = 2\"' Then. put k = 2. We get i.e. (B + 1)3 - B3 = 3, 1 B 3+3B 2+3B,+1-B 3 =3, i.e. B2 = \"'6 . Proceeding in the same way, we get the following table 1 1 3617 B 1 =,[, B6= 42' B l1 =O, B 16 = -'51() , 691 B 12 = -2730' 1 B S =-30' B I3 =O, 5 B5 =O, BIO=66 , B 15 =O, Knowing this table, we may easily solve Problem 29, i.e. arrange 8 4 , 8 5 , 8 6 and 8 7 according to powers of n. These numbers play quite an important role in many fields of mathematics and possess a number of interesting properties. They are called Bernoulli's numbers (J. Bernoulli, Ars Conjectandi). We can show that for odd k's exceeding unity Bk will be equal to zero. And Bernoulli's numbers with an Solutions to Sec. 7 379 even subscript will increase rather fast. Let us consider the value of B'9~. If we put B'96 = - ~ , then it turns out that N = 171390, Z =62753 13511 04611 93672 55310 66998 93713 60315 30541 53311 89530 55906 39107 01782 46402 41378 48048 46255 54578 57614 21158 35788 96086 55345 32214 56098 29255 49798 68376 27052 31316 61171 66687 49347 22145 80056 71217 06735 79434 16524 98443 87718 31115 Thus, the numerator of this number contains 215 digits (D. H. Lehmer, 1935). Let us now prove relationship 2°. On the basis of the results obtained in Problem 28 we may put (k+1) (1 11+2 11+3 11+ .. . +n k) = = nll+l + kt 1 n ll+ Cnll- 1 + Dn\"-2+ ... +Ln, where C, D, ... , L are independent of n, but undoubtedly depend on k. Put (k+ 1) (1 11+2 11+3 11+ ... +n\") = nll+1+Ck+,ajnll + +C 2 h-l+ +C\"-' 2+C\" 1I+,a2n . . . k+,ak-l n k+,ak n . We may then write the following symbolic equality (k + 1) (1 h+2h + ... + nk) = (n + a)h+l_ a k+1. On removing the bracket.s in the right member by replacing as by exs (s=O, 1, 2, ... ), we pass over from the symbolic equality to an ordinary one. Since this equality is an identity with respect to n, we may put in it n + 1 instead of n and obtain (k+1) [1h + 2h + ... + (n + 1)h] = (n + 1 + ex)k+l_ exh+1 Subtracting from the last equality the preceding one, we find (k+ 1) (n + 1)h = (n+ 1+ex)h+1 _ (n+ex)h+ 1. Putting here n = 0, we have (ex + 1)1I+1_exk+1 =k+1. 380 Solutions Besides, it should be remembered (see the solution of Prob- lem 28) that ex's are independent of k and that exl = ; . And so, the numbers exk and Bk are determined by one and the same relation, and exl = B I • Therefore exk = Bk for any k. 32. Let d be the common difference of our progression. Then Xk = Xl + d (k - 1). From the first equality we have xI+x n n(n-1) 2 n=a, nXI+d 1.2 =a. On the other hand, xli = X~+2Xld (k-1)+d 2 (k-1)2. Therefore, from the second relation we get n n n ~ xli=nx~+2xtd ~ (k-1)-t d2 ~ (k-1)2=b 2. R=l R=l R=l Hence 21_2 d n (n-1)+d 2 (n-1)n(2n-1)=b 2 nX11 Xt 1.2 6 (1 ) (see Problem 25).

Then our su m takes the form [1- 2 +3-4+ ... - (2m-2)] + (2m-1) = 1 n+ 1 = -(m-1)+2m- = m=-2- Thus, if we put 1-2+3-4 + ... + (_1t-l n =8, then 8 n· f · 8 n+1· f . dd = - 2 I n IS even, = -2- I n IS 0 • However, this result can be obtained in a simpler way.

It is necessary to prove that the arithmetic mean of n positive numbers is not less (» than the geometric mean of these numbers. We are going through several proofs of this proposition. Let us begin with the most elegant one which belongs to Cauchy. Thus, we have to prove that XI+X2+···+Xn ____ n/ n -?v Xj X 2 ••• Xl/' At n = 1 the validity of this inequality is obvious. At n = 2 and n = 3 the proposition was proved in Problems 23 and 24. Let us first show how to prove the validity of our assertion at n = 4. We have But Let us now prove that, in general, if the theorem holds at n=m, then it is valid at n=2m too. Indeed, XI +X2+Xa+··· +X2m-1 +X2m_ 2m - XI+X2 + Xa+X4 + + X2m-I+X2m 2 2 ... 2 m ____ VX1+X2 • X3+ X4 x2m-I+X2m -? 2 2'\" 2 (since we assume that the theorem is valid at n = m). Solutions to Sec. 8 409 Further XI + X2 + X3 + ... + X2rn '- 2m :::=\" And so, assuming that the theorem is valid at n = m, we have proved that it is true at n = 2m as well. And since we proved the validity of the theorem for n = 2, it is valid for n = 4,8,16, ... , i.e. for n equal to any power of two. However, we have to prove that the theorem is true for any whole n. Let us take some value of n. If n is a power of two, then for such a value of n the theorem is valid, if not, then it is always possible to add a certain q to n such that n + q will yield some power of two. Put We then have :I'1+X2+x3+'\" +X n +X n +l+ .,. +x n +q >- n+q ~ n+q/-----------------> V Xj X 2 ••• XnXn+l ••• x n+q for any positive Xi (i=1, 2, ... , n+q). Put We get or 410 Solutions and finally XI +X2+· •• +X n _ n/\" n .;:. V XI X 2 ••• X n • And so, the theorem is valid for any whole n. It is obvious that if XI = X2 = ... = X n , then the sign of equality takes place in our theorem. Let us prove that the sign 0/ equality occurs only when all the quantities XI, X2, ••• , Xn are equal to one another. Suppose at least two of them, say XI and X2, are not equal to each other. Let us prove that in this case only the sign of inequality is possible, i.e. it will be Indeed XI+X2 XI+X2 + + + 2 + 2 X3··· Xn ------------n------------> ~ V ( x11 X2 ) 2 X3 ••• x n • But if XI is not equal to X2, then Xt+ X2 V- 2 > I XI X2, consequently and therefore XI+X2+· •• +x n > n/ n y XI X2 ••• Xn if at least two of the quantities XI, X2, ••• , Xn are not equal to one another. Given below are some more proofs of this theorem. Let us pass over to the second one. Let n be a positive number greater than or equal to unity (n ~ 1). We assume here that a and b are two real positive numbers. Then the follow- ing inequality takes place (an- 1 _b n- 1) (a-b»O. Solutions to Sec. 8 411 Hence an + bTl :>- an-1b + bn-1a. Consider n positive numbers a, b, e, ... , k, l. Let us apply this inequality to all possible pairs of numbers made up of the given n numbers. Adding the inequalities thus obtained, we find (a l1 +b Tl )+(an +e n)+ ... +(an+l l1 )+ + W' + en) + ... + (bn + In) + ... + (kn + In);;;::: ~ (an-1b + bn-1a) + (an-Ie + en-1a) + ... + + (an-Il + In-1a) + ... + (kn-Il + l\"- Ik). Hence we 'have (n-1)(a n +bn+ ... +In);;;::: ;;;:::a (bn-1 + en- 1 + ... + In-l) + b (an- 1 + en- 1 + ... + In-l) + + e (an- 1 + bn- 1 + ... + In-l) + ... + + l (an- 1 + bn- 1 + ... + kn-1). (.) Using this inequality, it is possible to prove our theorem on the relation between the arithmetic and geometric means of n numbers by the method of induction. We have to prove that Put .. -, Then it is sufficient to prove that an+bn+ ... +kn+ln:>-, b kl n :::-- a ... . Let us assume that this inequality is valid at the exponent equal to n - 1, i.e.' bn-1 + ... +kn- 1 +l n-1 ;;;:::(n_1)b.k ... l, an-1 + en- 1 + ... +In-l~(n-1)a.e ... l, 412 Solutions Using the inequality (*), we find (n - 1) (an + bn + ... + kn + In) ~ ~a(n--1)bk ... l+b(n-1)ac ... l+ ... + + l (n -1) ab ... k. Hence (n-1)(a n +b/+ ... +k\"+ln)~(n-1).n.abc ... kl, i.e. Thus, our theorem is proved for the second time. Let us pass over to the third proof of this theorem. It will be carried out using the method of mathematical induction once again. Let there be n positive numbers a, b, ... , k, l. It is required to prove that a+b+ ... +k+l~n;;-ab ... kl. Assuming that the theorem holds true for n - 1 numbers, we have a+b+ ... +k+l~(n-1)n-'yab ... k+l. And so, the theorem will be proved if we prove the inequality (n--1) n-yab ... k+ l~nr;/ ab ... k·l. Thus, we have to prove the inequality ( _1)n-V ab ... kl 1\"'-- V ab '.' kl n In + ~n In' Put ab ... kl = tnln-ll In '\" . Therefore, it is required to prove that (n -1) £\" + 1~n£n-l. And so, to prove our theorem means to prove the inequa- lity Solutions to Sec. 8 413 where ~ is any raal positive number and n is a positive integer. Let us prove this inequality. At ~ = 1 we obviously have the equality. Suppose now ~ > 1. It is required to prove that We have But Therefore ~n-l +~n-2+ •.• + 6+ 1 < n6n- 1, and, consequently, indeed tn_1 \"'~-1 < n6n- 1 • If 6 < 1, we have to prove that sn_1 > tn-l 6- 1 n.., . This result is obtained as in the previous case, and, thus, the theorem is proved. All the considered proofs were carried out using the method of mathematical induction. Therefore, it is desi- rable to get such a proof which would establish immediately that if ai' a2' ... , an are any positive quantities not equal to one another simultaneously. Put ai = x? Then we have to prove that xi' + x~ + ... + x~ > 0 n -XIX2 '\" Xn , i.e. the problem is reduced to finding out that a certain function (form) of n variables Xl, X2' ••• , xn is positive. As is known, n letters Xl, X2 • ••• , Xn can be permutated 4f4 Solutions by nl methods. If f (Xj, X2' .•• , xn) is a function of n 'variables x;, X2' ... , Xn, then the symbol ~f(xj, X2, ... , xn) will denote the sum of n! quantities obtained from f (Xj, X2, ... , xn), using, all possible permutations. For example, ~ XjX2 ... Xn = n! XjX2 ••• Xn• ~ x~ = (n-1)! (x~ + x~ + ' .. +x~). Introduce the notation It is easily seen, that whatever permutation is used, the function C(l (Xh X2' ... , xn) remains unchanged. Therefore we have n! C(l (Xb X2' ... , xn) = = ! ~ (x~+x~+ ••• +x~)-~ XjX2 ..• Xn But ~ x~ + x~ + ... + x~ = n! (x~ + x~ + ... + x~). On the other hand, n+ n+ + n 1 ~ xni. Xi X2 . . .

Since ex, ~ and yare whole positive integers, the radicand may be considered as a product of ex factors equal to h-c I c-a 1 + -a - each, ~ factors equa to 1 + -b - each, and y SolutlOllS to Sec. 8 a-b far tors equal to 1 + -- each.

Raising both members of this inequality to the power a + b + c, we get the required result. 34. We have s s s s=a+ s-b + ... + s-l -------------------~ n V sn s ? '(s-a) (s--b) ...

First of all this inequality can be obtained from Lag- range's identity (see Problem 5, Sec. 1). But we shall pro- ceed in a somewhat different way. Let us set up the following expression (ivai + f.tbl)2 + (lva2 + f.tb 2)2 + ... + (Ivan + f.tbn)2 = = Alv2 + 2BIvf.t + Cf.t2, where A=a~+a;+ ... +a~, C=b~+b;-j- ... +b~, B = alb! + a2b2 + ... + anbn. Since the left member of this inequality represents the sum of squares, we have Alv2 + 2BIvf.t + Cf.t2 ~ o. for all values of Iv and f.t. 118 Solutions Consequently, the trinomial AX2 + 2Bx + C is greater than or equal to zero for all real values of x. The- refore, the roots of this trinomial are either real and equal or imaginary, and its discriminant is less than or equal to zero, i.e. B2 - AC ~ O. Thus (alb, + a2b2 + .... + anbn)2- --(ai+a;+ .:. +a~) (bi+ ... + b~)~O, wherefrom also follows that the equality sign is possible only if at a2 an b;=b;= \"'=b;;' 36. Put bi = b2 = ... = bn = 1 in the inequality of the preceding problem. We then have (at+a2+'\" +an)2~n(a~+a;+ ... +a~). Hence ---V' (2 2 2\\ . a, + az + ... + an'=::::::: n at + a2 + ... + anI . 37.

Consequently (n-1)(x~+x~+ ... +x~)--2q~O. But X~ + x; + ... + x~ = p2 - 2q, wherefrom we get 419 Consider now n - 1 quanti ties (instead of n): XI, X2, ••• , Xi-I' XHI, ••• , Xn, eliminating Xi from the quantities under consideration, and put p - Xi = p', q - (XiXI + Xi X2 + ... + XiXi _I + XiXHI + ... + + XiXn) = q'. Using the deduced inequality, we may assert that '2 2(n-1) p - n-2 q'~O. But q' = q - Xi (XI + X2 + ... + Xi_I + Xi+! + ... +xn) = = q - Xi (p - Xi). :Therefore ( )2 2(n-1)( 2) 0 P-Xi - n-2 q-PXi+Xi;;:::· Consequently nXr-2pXi + 2 (n-1) q- (n-2) p2:::;;;O.

If p > 0, then aP - bP > 0 for a > b; and if p < 0, then aP - bP < < ° for a > b. Therefore we may assert the following: (a P - bP ) (aq - bq ) ,? ° if p and q are of the same sign; (a P - bP ) (aq - bq ) ~ ° if P and q are of different signs and for any real a and b. Let us first consider the case when p and q are of the same sign.

J t is easy to establish that the equality sign is possible only if 47. This proposition is the generalization of the previous theorems (see Problems 30, 45, 46). The proof is carried out in the same way as in the mentioned theorems. Namely, assuming the vali dity of the theorem at n = m, let us prove its validity at n = 2m. We have <p (tl) + <p (t 2) + ... 4- <p (t 2m-l) + <p (t 2m ) 2m (since, by hypothesis, not all of the quantities til t 2 , ••• , t 2m are equal to one another, they can be grouped so that, for instance, tl =1= t2)' Thus, the theorem is valid at n = 2m. Let us put now n + p = 2m. Then m ( tl +t 2+··· +t n + TI+T2+··· +Tp ) 't' n+p - < <P(tI)+· .. +<p(tn)+<P(TI)-t ... +<p(T p) < n+p Solutions to Sec. 8 429 (here t1, t2 , ••• , In are not all equal to one another).

Let us demonstrate this. 1° Let then Further <p (tlH- <p (t2) 2 But cp(t)= -log(1 +t), log (1 + t1) + log (1 + t 2) 2 V(1+t 1)(1+t 2)< 1+ t1t 1+t 2 =1+ t 1-tt 2 (t 1*t 2). Therefore 430 Solutions (the base Of the logarithms being greater than llnity) and -log -V (1 + t l) (1 + t2) > -log ( 1 + tl t t2 ). Thus, the function cp (t) = -log (1 + t) really possesses the following property ( tl + t2 ) < 'P (t l) + 'P (t 2) cp 2 2' and therefore it must be cp ( tl+t2+~ .. +tn ) < 'P(tI)+'P(t2),;-'\" +'P(tn) I.e. -log (1 + tl+t2+~\" +tn ) < < _ log(1+tl)+log(1+t 2)+ ... +log(1+tn) Fa ' log;Y(1+t t )(1+t;) ...

Further V (1 + t l ) (1 +- t2 ) ••• (1 + tn) < < 1+ td···· +tn = n = (1+tl)+(1+t 2)+··· +(1+t n) n Putting 1 + t; = Xii we finally get n/ < XI+X2+'\" +x n -V XI X 2 ••• Xn n Obviously, if we assume the possibility XI = X2 = ... = X n , then it will be 2° If we put cp (t) = t\", Solutions to Sec. 8 then <p ( tltt2 ) = ( tl1t2 t Assuming that the inequality h h ( tltt2 r < tl ~t2 holds true, we get the result of Problem 46. 3° Put <p (t) = log (1 + et ) (the logarithm is taken to the base e> 1). Then Since tl+t2 <p ( tltt2 ) = log (1 +e-2-), cp (tl)~CP (t2) = log V (1 + etl) (1 + et2). l1+t2 V'(1+e tl )(1+e t2) > 1+e-2-, fulfilled for the function <p (t) is the inequality <p( tt~t2 )<CP(tl)~CP(t2) (tl=l=t2). Therefore <p( tl+t2+~ .. +tn )< CP(tl)+.~.+cp(tn) , i.e. Then 7(1 + etl) ... (1+e tn ) = = 7 ( 1 + AI) (1 + 1.,2) .•.

(0< ti < n). Let us prove that -sin t1+t2+ ... + t n, <_ sintl+sint2+.··+sintn n n For this purpose it suffices to prove that (see Problem 47) -sin t 1+t2 <_ sintl+sint2 2 2 Indeed sin t1+sin t2 t1+t2 2 = sin 2 -sin t1+t2 cos tl- t2 2 2 = sin tl+ t2 .2 sin2 tl- t2 > 0 2 4 (in our case cp (t) = - sin t). Thus (if 0 < ti < n). Therefore if al -+- a2 + ... + an = n, then sinal + sin a2 + ... -I- sin an < nsin~ n if ai' a2, ... , an are not equal to one another. On the other hand, if then the sum becomes equal to sin al + ... + sin an . Jt nSlll-. n Solutions to Sec. 8 Thus, indeed, the greatest value of the sum sin at + sin a2 + . . . + sin an will be provided at + a2 + ... + an = n (ai > 0); and this greatest value is attained at 11 cq = a2 = ... = an = n . 49. Let us prove that the differenee x P -1 xq - 1 p q 433 (if x =1= 1 and p > q) exceeds zero. To this end it is suflici- ent to prove that ('). = q (x P -1) - p (xq -1) > o. First let us assume that x > 1. We have ('). ~~ q (x P - 1) - p (xq - 1) = (x - 1) {q (x P - 1 + x P - 2 + ... + +x+1)_p(X'l-1+Xq - 2 + ... +x+1)}=(x-1){q(x P - 1+ + x P - 2 + ... +:x.q)-(p-q) (x q - 1 +x Q - 2 + ... + x+ 1)}. If x> 1, then x P -It x P - 2 + ... + x q > (p - q) x q • Therefore ('). = q (x P - 1) - p (xq - 1) > (x - 1){ q (p - q) x q - - (p- q) qxq- 1 } = qxq - 1 (p-q) (X_1)2 > O. Thus, if x> 1, the theorem is proved. Now let us assume that x < 1. III this case we have xP - 1 + x P - 2 + ... + x q < (p-q) x q , x q - 1 + x q - 2 + ... + x + 1 > qxq - 1 , q(x P - 1 + ... + xq)-(p-q) (x q - 1 + ... +x+1) < < (p-q) qxq -q (p-- q) X'l-l = q (p-q) x q - 1 (x -1). 434 Solutions Consequently /}. > q (p-q) X q - 1 (x-1)2 > 0. However, this proposition can be proved proceerling from the theorem on the arithmetic mean. We have the following inequality (see Problem 40) (1 + a)f.. > 1 + aA (A> 1, rational, a> 0, real). Likewise we can deduce the following inequality (1- a)f.. > 1-aA if 0 < a < 1; A> 1, rational. Csing thpse inequalities, we shall prove that x P -1 p > xq--1 q if p > q (x * 1). Put x q = c, .l!-.- == A. Then we have to proye . q ~ f.. _ 1 > A (s - 1) or ~f.. - 1 - A (~ - 1) > O. First suppose x> 1, ~ > 1. Put S = 1 + a. We then have ~f.. - 1 - A (~ - 1) = (1 + a)f.. - 1 - Aa > o. [f x < 1, then ~ < 1. In this case we put ~ = 1 - a (0 < a < 1). We find easily ~/. - 1 - A (~ - 1) = (1 - a)f.. - 1 - A (-a) > O. 50. Let us first assume that m> 1. Put m = ~ (p > q, q positive integer). We then have (see Problem 49) ~P-1 > £q-1 (~7'= 1). p q 1 Putting sq=x, ~=xq, we get xtn - 1 > m (x - 1). Solutions to Sec. S 435 Replacing in this . l' b 1 lIlequa tty x y ~, we fwd 1 ( 1 ) --1>m --1. xm x Multiplying both members of this inequality by- ;r\"', we get x 111 -1 < mx m - 1 (.r-i). Thus, if m> i, then mxm - 1 (x -1) > xm_·i > m (x-1). (i) Let us assume now that 0< m < 1. Puttillg sq = x, .!L = m, we find p Replacing here x by x m , we fmd xm - 1 < m l x - 1). Replacing in the last inequality x by ~, and performing x all necessary transformations, we find mx\"'-1(x-1) < xllL-i <m(x--1) (O<m<1). (2) Let us now consider negative values of m. Put m = -n, where n > 0, rational. Let' us first prove that if m is nega- tive, then xm-1 > m (x·-i). Since n > 0, it follows'that n + 1> i and we may make use of inequalities (i). Namely, we have xn+l_i < (n+i)xn(x-i). Hence nxn (x - i) > xn - 1. Replacing here n by - m, we find _mx- m (x-i) > x-m-1. Multiplying both members of this inequality by - xm , we get 436 Solutions 1 And if we replace here x by ~, then we find xrll_1 < mxm- I (x--1). Thus, indeed mxm - t (x-i) < xm -1 < m (x-i), if 0 < m < 1, m (x - 1) < xm - 1 < m x m-I (x - 1) if m is any rational number not lying in the interval between o and 1, and x is any real positive number not equal to unity. 51. The inequalities of this problem follow immediately from the results of the preceding problem. 52. Put .!L=m. p Then the inequality is rewritten as follows ( Yt+Y2+' .. +Yn )m::;:::: yf'+yT+.·.+y;:' n -:::: n ' where m > 1, rational. Using the results of Problem 47, it is sufficient to prove that ( tl+t2 .)rIl:::;::: tl.\"+tT 2 \"\"\" 2 for any rational m > 1 and for any real positive tl and t 2. In other words, it is sufficient to prove that ( 2ft )m ( 2t2 )m 2 tl+ t2 + tl+ t2 >. Let us make use of the results of Problem 51 (1+x)m~1+mx (1) if m> 1 is rational and 1 + x > O. We have two inequa- lities r~1+m ( r~1+m( 2tl tl +t2 2t2 tl +t2 -1) , -1). Solutions to Sec. 8 437 Adding the¥1, we get inequality (1) which is the required result. The solution to our problem can be obtained imme- diately froID the inequalities of Problem 51. Let us show that, using this method, we can deduce even a more general inequality. So let us prove that ( Yl+Y2+'\" +Yn )~ /' Y~+Y~+··· +Y~ ~ 1 2 n n n if 'A is a rational number not lying in the interval between zero and unity and ( Yt+Y2+···+Yn )~::>-: Y}+Y}+\"'+Y~ n ~ n if 0 < 'A < 1. To prove the first inequality it is sufficient to prove that But we have (see Problem 51) ( nYi )~ ::;:;, 1 + 'A ( nYi - 1) . Yt+Y2+'\" +Yn Yl +Y2+'\" +Yn Putting here i = 1, 2, ... , n and adding the inequalities thus obtained, we actually get inequality (2). We proceed quite analogously for the case 0 < 'A < 1. 53. Put Xt + X2 + ... + Xn = p, x~ + x; + ... + x; = p'. We have (X-Xt)2+(X-X2)2+ ... +(X-Xn)2= [ 2p P' ] ==nx2-2px+p'=n _x2-nx+n -= =n[(x- ~ r+ ~ - ~:l Our expression can attain the least value only simulta- ) 2 ( I 2 neously with (X- ~ since the quantity : - ~2 is independent of x).

Hence p Xl+'\" +X n X=-= . n n Thus, the sum (X-Xj)2+ (X-X2)2+ ••• + (x-xn)2 attains the least value at 54.

The least value j>i of this sum is equal to zero and is attained at Xj = X2 = ... = X n • But since Xl + X2 + . . . + Xn = C, it follows that Solutions to Sec. 8 439 takes on the least value at C XI = X2 = ... = Xn = n . 55.

On transformation we get the inequality (a + c) (a + b) (b + d) (c + rI) - - (a + b + c + rI) (c + rI) ab - - (a + b + c + d) cd (a + b) ~ 0, or the following one (ad - bC)2 ~ O. SOLUTIONS TO SECTION 9 1. Putting in the basic formula n = 1, we find V2 = 3Vt - 2vo = 3·3 - 2·2 = 5 = 22 + 1. Suppose that Vk = 2k + 1 (k = 1, 2, ... , n), and let us prove that Indeed V n +-! = 3v n - 2vn -t = 3 (2n + 1) - 2 (2 n - 1 + 1) = = 3·2n+3-2n-2= 2n (3-1) + 1 = 2n+1 + 1. 2. Solved as the preceding problem. 3. As is easily seen, the required relation is indeed valid at n = 1. Assuming its validity at the subscript equal to n, let us prove that it is also valid at the subscript equal to n + 1. Solutions to Sec. 9 Indeed But by supposition Therefore IZn+{- VA an+l+ V A 4.

Consider the relationship ak = 3ak-t + 1. Putting here k equal to 2, 3, 4, ... , n, we get n n ~ ak=3 ~ ak_t+n-1. 11=2 k=2 Put We then have S - at = 3 (S - an) + n - 1. Consequently 1 S =\"\"2 {3an - at- n + 1}. It remains to express an in terms of at. We have Hence Therefore an - an-t = 3 (an-t - an-2) = 32 (an-2 - an-3) = 33 (an-3 - an-i) = ... = 3n- 2 (a2 - at) Solutions to Sec. 9 But And so an - an-t = 5 ·3n-2. Putting here n equal to 2, 3, 4, ... , n, we have a2 - at = 5 ·1, aa - a2 = 5 ·3, a, - aa = 5.32 , an - an-t = 5 ·3n - 2 • Adding these equalities termwise, we find an - at = 5 (1 + 3 + 32 + ... + 3n - 2) 453 = ~ (3n - 1 _ 1). Rewrite the expression for S in the following way 1 S =T{3 (an-at) +2at -n+ 1}= =i- {1: (3 n - 1 -1)+4-n+1} ={-{5(3 r1 -1)-2n}. 6. We have Consequently an = kan-t + l, an-t = kan-2 + l. an - an-t = k (an-t - an-2) = k2 (an-2 - an-a) = ... = Hence lh- at = (lh - at), aa- a2 = k (lh -at), a, - aa = k 2 (a2- at), an - an-t = k n - 2 (a2 - at). Adding these equalities, we find 1 kn-t-1 an = kn- at + k-1 l. = k n - 2 (a2 - at). 454 Solutions 7. Rewrite the given relationship in the following manner anH - an - (an - an-i) = 1. Put an - an-l = xn (n = 2, 3, 4, ... ). We then have Putting here n equal to 2, 3, ... , n - 1 and adding, we find Xn - X2 = n - 2. Putting then in the equality n = 3, 4, ... , n and adding, we get an - a2 = Xa + x, + ... + Xn· And so But n n ~ Xk= ~ (x2+k-2)=(n--2)x2+(n-2)+ (n-1) (n-2) + (n-3) + ... + 1 = (n-2) X2+ 2 • Hence _ + ( 2) + (n-1) (n-2)_ an-iZz n- X2 2 - + ( 2) ( )+(n-1) (n-2) =az n- az-al 2 = (n-1) (n-2) 1 2 = 2 +(n-)a2-(n-)al' 8. Put Then the following relationship will take place XnH - 2xn + Xn -l = 1. Solutions to Sec. 9 Using the result of the preceding problem we have (n-1) (n-2) Xn = 2 + (n-1) X2- (n-2) Xl' But it is obvious that n-2 an-~=XI+X2+'\" +Xn-2= ~ Xk' k=l Consequently n-2 an -a2={ ~ (k - 1) (k - 2) + k=l n-2 n-2 455 + X2 ~ (k - 1) - XI ~ (k - 2). k=l Finally (n-1) (n-2) 3 an= 2 a3-(n- )(n-1)a2+ + (n-2) (n-3) + (n-1) (n-2) (n-3) 2 al 6 9. The required formulas can be deduced by the method of mathematical induction. It is evident that they take place at n = 1. Since assuming that the formulas are valid at n-1, let us prove their validity at n. By supposition, we have an-l = a + ~ (b - a) ( 1 - 4;-1 ), bn_,=a+; (b-a)(1+ 2.4n t ). Then an = an-11bn-1 =a+; (b-a)(1-4~) and, consequently, this formula takes place for any whole positive n. It only remains to prove that the formula for bn is true for any whole posi ti ve n as well. 456 Solutions We have b an+bn-t n= 2 and the proof is completed. However, this problem can be solved in quite a different way. It is obvious that an-t + bn- t b _ an-f + 3bn_t an = 2 I n-- 4 • Multiplying both members of these equalities by some factor A, we get an+J...bn = (-} +{ A) an-t+ (-}+ ! A) bn- 1• Let us choose A so that -}+! A= (-}+{A) A. There will be two required values of A, and they will be the roots of the equation A2 - A - 2 = 0, i.e. will be equal to At = 2 and A2 = -1. And so, at these values of A there exists the equality an -+- J...bn = (-} ++ A) (an-t + J...bn - t), which holds true for all whole positive values of n. Put- ting here n consecutively equal to 1, 2, 3, ... , n, we get at+Abt= (; +{-A) (a+Ab), ~ + J...b2 = (i-+{ A) (at + J...bt), an + J...bn = ( ; + {- A) (an-t + J...bn - t ). Multiplying these equalities termwise, we find Solutions to Sec. 9 457 for any whole positive n and at A = 2 and -1. Substitut- ing these values of A, we find an+2bn = a+2b, 1 an - bn =Tn(a-b), wherefrom we have indeed an = a + ~ (b - a) ( 1 - In ) , bn=a+ ; (b-aH 1+ /4n ) . 10. We have Xn = Xn-l + 2 sin2 a Yn-it Yn = 2 cos2 a Xn-l + Yn-l. Multiplying the second equality by A and adding the first one, we get Xn + AYn = (1 + 2A (\"OS2 a) Xn-l + (2 sin2 a -t- A) Yn-l' Let us choose A so that the following equality takes place (2 sin 2 a+A) = A (1 + 2A cos2 a). Hence A= ± tana. We then obtain (xn + AYn) = (1 + 2A cos2 a) (xn-t + AYn-l) or (Xn + AYn) = (1 + 2A cos2 a)n (xo + AyO). Substituting the values of Xo and Yo and putting in succes- sion A = tan a and A = -tan a, we find the following two equalities Hence Xn + Yn ·tan u = (1 + sin 2a)n sin a, xn - Yn ·tan a = - (1 - sin 2a)n sin a. Xn = -} sin a {(1 -I- sin 2a)n - (1- sin 2a)n}, Yn = -} cos a {(1 + sin 2a}n+(1- sin 2at}. 458 Solutions 11. As in the two previous problems, we get xn + AtYn = J.t~ (Xo+AtYo), Xn + ~Yn = J.t~ (Xo + ~Yo), where J.tl = a + A1Y, J.t2 = a + A2Y, Al and A2 being the roots of the quadratic equation (~ + M) = A (a + Ay). If At =F Az, then we have two equations for determining two unknowns Xn and Yn' and the problem is solved. Let us now assume that At = A2• Then J.tt = J.t2 and the two equations coincide. To determine Xn and Yn proceed as follows. We have Substituting the value of Xn into the second of the original equalities, we find Yn = l' ( - A1Yn-t + J.t~-1 (xo + AtYo)] + 6Yn-t. Hence Yn + (1'At -- 6) Yn-l = 1'J.t~-l (xo + AtYo). Put Yn = J.t~zn. Then for Zn we obtain the following relation J.tlZn + (1'At - 6) Zn-t = l' (xo + AtYo) or Zn= c5-YAt Zn_t+...l.(Xo+AtYo), I't 1'1 wherefrom we find Zn (see Problem 6) and then Yn; Xn is found by the formula (.). 12. Rewrite the given relationship in the following way Xn - aXn-t - ~Xn-2 = O. Put a= a+b, ~= -ab (Le. a and b are the roots of the quadratic equation as - Solutions to Sec. 9 - as - ~ = 0). Then we have Put Xn - axn-l - bXn_l + abxn_z = 0, Xn - aXn-t - b (xn-t - axn -2) = O. Xn - axn -l = Yn' The given relationship takes the form Hence Consequently Yn - bYn-l = O. Yn = bYn-l, Yn -1 = bYn -2' Yn = b 7l - 1Yl' For finding Xn we now have Xn - aXn-l = b n - 1Yl' bz,. - aZ n - 1 = Yl or a Yl Zn=T Zn-l +T' Using the result of Problem 6, we find _( a )n-l +(: r- 1 - t Yl Zn- - Zl -. . b ~-t b b Performing simple transformations, we finally obtain an _ bn an-1_ bn-1 Xn = b Xl - ab b xo· a- a- 459 However, this problem can be solved by the method used in the previous problem, if we consider two sequences X~ and Yn defined by the relationships Xn = CUn -l + ~Yn'-l' Yn = 1'X n _l + O'Yn-l' 460 Solutions 13. Solved as the preceding problem. In this case a=1, b=--q-p+q • 14. Considering the two variables Yn and Zn' determined by the relationships Yn = rxYn-l + ~Zn-l' Zn = YYn-l + <')Zn-l, we put Yn -=X n • Zn Then the variable Xn will satisfy the given relationship aX n _l +~ Xn= \" , '\\'Xn-l+ U and the solution of our problem will be reduced to that of Problem 11. For instance, in the given particular case X n_l+ 1 Xn = --:':'~:-n- X n-l+ 3 we have Yn = Yn-l + Zn-l, Zn = Yn-l + 3zn - 1 and so on. The second particular case Xn-l Xn= 2Xn-l+ 1 is readily considered in the following way. Rewrite this relationship as follows 1 :Xn 2Xn-l + 1 = 2 + _1_ • Xn-l Xn-l Then 1 1 ---=2.

It is easily seen that the following relation takes place <Pn+1 (x) = (1- xn+l) <Pn (x) + xn+1. Assuming <Pn (x) = 1, from the last relation we obtain <Pn+l (x) = 1. But since <Pi (x) = 1, it follows that <pn, (x) = 1 for any whole positive n. 18.

Therefore we have /-1 /-1 Vn + Vn-I = ~ C!-k_1 + ~ C!-k-2. k=O k=O Pu t in the second sum k = k' - 1, then /-1 / ~ 11. ~ k'-1 v n +v n _ I =1+ Li Cn -,,--I+ Li Cn - k'-I= k=1 k'=1 /-1 = 1+ ~ (C!-k-l +C~=Ll)+C~-=-LI' k=1 But, as is known, Ck Ck-l Ck n-k-l + n-k-I = n-k' Therefore /-1 / Vn +Vn-I = 1 + ~ C!-k + cl=: = ~ C!-k = Vn+1! k=1 k=O since cl=1 = 1 =cL Likewise we prove that Vn+1 = Vn + Vn-I for odd n's as well. But it is easy to check that VI = UI, V2 = U2' Therefore it is obvious that for any n, Solutions to Sec. 9 473 33. Let us denote the number of whole positive solutions of our equation by N n (m). As is easily seen, NI (m) = 1. Compute N2 (m), Le. the number of solutions to the equation Xl + X2 = m. In this equation Xl can attain the following values: 1,2,3, ... , m - 1 and, consequently, the equation has the following system of solutions (1,m-1), (2,m-2), ... , (m-1,1), Le. N2 (m) = m - 1. Let us now pass over to computing Ns (m), Le. to determin- ing the number of solutions of the equation Xl + X2 + Xs = m. Let Xs attain the values 1, 2, 3, ... , m - 2. It is clear that Ns (m) =N 2 (m-1) +N 2 (m-2) + ... +N 2 (2) = =(m-2)+(m-3)+ . .. +1 =(m-'11.~m-2)=C;'_1:· Using the induction method, we prove that N ()=C n_1 =(m-1)(m-2) ...

The general form of the equations under considera- tion will be k;r; + (k + 1) Y = n - k + 1 (k = 1, 2, ... , n + 1). (*) 474 Solutions Let us rewrite this equation as follows k (x + y + 1) + y = n + 1 and put Then x + y + 1 = z. y = n + 1 - kz, x = (k + 1) z - (n + 2). Whatever z may be these expressions yield solutions to the equation (*). Let us see what values must be attained by z for x and y to be whole and non-negative. And so, the follow- ing inequalities must take place (n + 1) - kz ~ 0, (k + 1) z - (n + 2) ~ O. Hence n+2./ n+1 k+1 \"\",-z:::;;;-k-' and z must be a whole number. If n+ 2 is not divisible by k+1, then z takes on the following values [n+2] k+1 + 1, [ n+2] k+1 +2, ... , [nt1]. Let us denote the number of solutions of the equation (.) by N k. In this case we have Nk=[nt1]_[:t;] . If n+2 is divisible exactly by k+1, then N =[n+1]_n+2+1 k k k+ 1 . But if n + 2 is not divisible by k + 1, then [n+2] [n+1] _ k+1 = k+1 ; and if n+2 is divisible by k+1, then ~!; -1 =[:!~]. Thus in all the cases Nk=[nt1J_[~!:J . Solutions to Sec. 9 475 And so, the total number of solutions is equal to N 1+ N 2 + ... + N n+l = [ n t 1 ] - [ n! 1 ] + + [nt1 J - r nt 1 ] + ... + [n~1 ] - [:!~ ] + + [n+1 J_[!±!\"] = [~J- [n+1 ] =n+ 1. _n+1 _n+2 1 _n+2 However, this result can be obtained in a different way.

(1- qk) (1- qk+l) x=O y=o If we expand the right member of this equality in powers of q, then it is easily seen that the· coeffIcient of qn in this expansion will be equal to N k, Le. to the number of solu- tions of the equation kx + (k + 1) y = n - k + 1. Thus, the quantity NI + N2 + ... + Nn+t will be the coefficient of qn in the following expansion 1 q ~ (1-q)(1- q2)+ (1_q2) (1-q3) + (1-q3) (1- q4) + ... + qn qn+1 + (1-qn+I)(1_qn+2) + (1_qn+2) (1_qn+3) + ... But it is easily seen, that this expansion is equal to 00 1 (1 1) q(1-q) ~ 1_ qk+1 -1_qk+2 = k=O 00 =q(/_q)(1~q-1)= ~(n+1)qn. n=O 476 Solutions Hence Nt + N2 + ... + Nn+t = n + 1. 35. The general form of the equations will be k2x + (k + 1)2 y = I(k + 1)2 - k2] n - k2 (k = 1, 2, 3, ... , n). A direct substitution shows that one of the solutions will be x = - (n + 1), y = n. Then, as is known, all the solutions will be obtained from the expressions x = - (n + 1) + (p + 1)2 t, Y = n - p2t, where p is one of the values attained by k. For x and y to be non-negative it is necessary and suffi- cient that t attains whole values satisfying the inequalities n+1 n (p+1)2 ~t~p2 . Considering then separately two cases (n + 1 is divisible by (p + 1)2 and n + 1 is not divisible by (p + 1)2), we ..come to the desired result. 36. By hypothesis the black balls alternate with the white ones. Therefore, two suppositions are possible: (1) the white balls occupy odd positions, i.e. the first, third, ... , and the black balls even positions; (2) the white balls occupy even positions, and the black balls odd positions. It is easily seen that the white balls numbered 1,2, ... , n can occupy odd positions in n! ways, likewise the black balls can occupy even positions also in n! ways. And so, according to the first assumption, we have (n!)2 ways of arrangement of all the balls. The second assumption yields the same number of arrange- ments. Hence, the total number of arrangements of the balls is 2 (n!)2. 37. Let L~k denote the number of ways in which kn di- stinct objects can be distributed into k groups of n objects in each group. Solutions to Sec. 9 477 In how many ways is it possible to make up the fust group of n objects? It is clear that the total number of the distinct combinations is equal to e~k' and it is obvious that L k en Lk-J nk= nk nk-n' Hence L~k = e~kcrk-l)n ... e~n. 38. Let us consider the number of permutations of n elements in which two definite elements a and b are found side by side. The following cases are possible: (1) a occu- pies the first place, a occupies the second place, ... , finally, a occupies (n - 1)th place, and b is always on its right, i.e. in the second, third, ... , nth place, respectively; (2) b occupies the first place, ... , finally b occupies (n-1)th place, in all cases followed by a. Thus, the total number of cases amounts to 2 (n -1), each case corresponding to (n - 2)1 permutations. Therefore the total number of the permutations in which two definite elements a and b occur side by side will amount to (n - 2)! 2 (n - 1) = 2 (n - 1)!. Consequently, the number of permutations of n elements in which two elements a and b are not found side by side will amount to nl - 2 (n - 1)! = (n - 1)! (n - 2). 39. Let us denote the number of the required permuta- tions by Qn and put nl = P n· Consider the whole totality of the permutations P n. Among them there exist Qn permu- tations in which none of the elements occupies its original position. Let us find the number of the permutations in which only one element retains its original position. U ndoub- tedly, this number will amount to nQn-t. Likewise, the number of permutations with only two definite elements retaining their original position will amount to n (~.-;-1) Qn-2, and so on. Finally, the number of permutations \\\\There all the elements retain the original position is Qo = 1. Thus, we have P n (n-1) n=Qn+nQn-l+ 1.2 Qn-2+ .•. +nQI+QO· 478 Solutions This equality can be written symbolically as P\" = (Q + 1)n. Here after involution all the exponents (superscripts) should be replaced by subscripts, so that Q/l turns into Q/l. Consequently, we can write the following symbolic identity valid for all values of x (p+xt= (Q+ 1 + x)n (since symbolically the power of P can be replaced every- where by the same power of Q + 1). Putting here x = -1, we find Qn= (p_1)n. Passing over from the symbolic equality to an ordinary one, we have n n(n-1) Qn=Pn-TP n- t + 1.2 P n-2 +···+ + (_1)n-l nP t + (-it, ( 1 1 1 (_1)n-l (-1)n) Q-n=n! 21-31+41-'\" + (n-1)1 +-nl- . 40. Consider all such permutations of n letters in which vacant squares may oCCur along with occupied ones. If n = 1, then the number of ways in which one letter can be placed in r squares is equal to r (the first square is occupied by one letter, the rest of the squares being vacant; the second square is occupied by one letter, the rest of the squares being vacant, and so on). All permutations of two letters in r squares are obtained from just considered r permutations by placing the second letter in succession in the first, second, ... , rth square. Thus, the number of permutations of two letters in r squares will amount to r2, and, as is easily seen, the total number of permutations of n letters in r squares will be equal to rn. Let us denote by Ar the number of ways in which n distinct letters can be distributed in r squares so that each square contains at least one letter. The number of such permutations amounts to A r • Then we shall consider all those permutations in which one and only one square is vacant. Their number is equal to rA r _t • Further, the number of permutations where two and only Solutions to Sec. 9 \"two squares are vacant is equal to r (r-1) 1.2 A r- 2 , and so on. Therefore we have Ar+ rAr_ t + r (~~1) Ar-2+ ... +rA t + 1 = rn+ 1. 479 This equality can be written symbolically in the follow- ing way (Le. after expanding the left member All should be through- out replaced by All).

Hence, we can obtain one more proof of divergence of the series Put lim ( 1 + 1. r = e. n-+oo n Solutions to Sec. 10 493 Since the variable (1 + ! ) n tends to e in an increasing manner, we have for any whole positive n.

S a, a2 an n == 10 + 102 + ... + 10n . I t is required to prove that Sn has a limit as n --+ 00. As is easily seen, Sn increases along with an increase in n so that Sn+' ~ Sn. Let us prove that Sn is bounded. We have S at a2 an 9 (1 1 1 ) n = 10 + 102 + ... + 10n ~ 10 + 102 + ... + 10n < < 9 ( 1~ + 1~2 + ... + 1~n + ... ) . And so, Sn < 1 and the series converges. 2° Since (j) lies in the interval between 0 and 1, let us divide this interval into ten equal parts. In this event the number (j) will be found either inside one of the subintervals or at its boundary. Consequently, we can find a whole num- ber a, (0 ~ a, ~ 9), such that a, a, + 1 1O~(j)<-10-' i.e. O a, 1 ~(j)-1O<1O' Thus, the number (j) - :h lies in the interval between 0 1 and 10' Let us divide this interval into ten equal parts. Solutions to Sec. 10 497 Then we shall have Hence This operation can be continued in a similar way. Let us prove that 1. (a, + a2 an ) 1m 10 102 + ... +- 10n = ro. n~oo Here the variable increases but remains all the time less than a'tt i , consequently, it has a limit. Consider the variable It is easily seen that this variable decreases but remains grea ter than ~~ and, consequently, also has a limit. Since the difference tends to zero as n _ 00, both of these variables tend to one and the same limit, which, by virtue of the inequalities will be equal to ro. 3° If the fraction is fmite, then, there is no doubt, it is equal to a rational number. Let us pass over to the case 498 Solutions of periodicity. In this case we have i.e. (i) is a rational number. Likewise we make sure that a mixed periodic fraction (Le. such a fraction whose period begins not with ai' but later) will also be rational. Making use of some arithmetic reasons, we can prove the converse; namely, if a number is rational, then its expansion into a decimal fraction will necessarily be either finite, or periodic (purely periodie, or m!xed periodic). Thus, every non-periodic infinite fraction necessarily yields an irrational number. Z 25. Suppose (i) is rational, Le. (i) =]V' where Z and N are whole ,numbers. We have Z 111 1 1 1 lV=T+V+V+'\" + ln2 + l(n+1)2 +[(n+2)2 + ... Let us multiply both members of the equality by [n2N and transpose the first n terms from the right to the left. We get Zln 2 -N (ln 2_ 1 + [n2 -4 + ... + Zn2-(n-I)2 + 1) = { 1 1 1 } =-]V /2,\\+1 + l~\"-H + 1611+9 + . .. . Solutions to Sec. 10 499 Hence I Zzn2 -N (ln 2-1 + ln2- 4 + ... + 1) 1< 1 { 1 1 1 } t2n+1 <N Z2n+l -+ Z2(2n+1) + Z3(2n+l) +... =N 1 __ 1_' /2n+l And so I Zln 2 -N (ln 2 -1 + ln 2 -4 + ... + 1) 1< N Z2n+11_1 . If n is taken sufficiently large, then the right member can be made infinitely small, whereas the left member is an integer not equal to zero. 2° Proved as 1°. 26. We have 1 1 1 1 e=2+ 2f +3f + ... +nr+ (n+1)! + ... Put z e=F (where Z and N are positive integers).

Thus, e is an irrational number. If e is represented as a deci- mal fraction, then it will be an infinite non-periodic frae- tion. Given below is a value of e accurate to 2 500 decimal places. 500 Solutions e==2.71828 18284 59045 23536 02874 71352 66249 77572 47093 69995 95749 66967 62772 40766 30353 54759 45713 82178 52516 64274 27466 39193 20030 59921 81741 35966 29043 57290 03342 95260 59563 07381 32328 62794 34907 63233 82988 07531 95251 01901 15738 34187 93070 21540 89149 93488 41675 09244 76146 06680 82264 80016 84774 11853 74234 54424 37107 53907 77449 92069 55170 27618 38606 26133 13845 83000 75204 49338 26560 29760 67371 13200 70932 87091 27443 74704 72306 96977 20931 01416 92836 81902 55151 08657 46377 21112 52389 78442 50569 53696 77078 54499 69967 94686 44549 05987 93163 68892 30098 79312 77361 78215 42499 92295 76351 48220 82698 95193 66803 31825 28869 39849 64651 05820 93923 98294 88793 32036 25094 43117 30123 81970 68416 14039 70198 37679 32068 32823 76464 80429 53118 02328 78250 98194 55815 30175 67173 61332 06981 12509 96181 88159 30416 90351 59888 85193 45807 27386 67385 89422 87922 84998 92086 80582 57492 79610 48419 84443 63463 24496 84875 60233 62482 70419 78623 20900 21609 90235 30436 99418 49146 31409 34317 38143 64054 62531 52096 18369 08887 07016 76839 64243 78140 59271 45635 49061 30310 72085 10383 75051 01157 47704 17189 86106 87396 96552 12671 54688 95703 50354 02123 40784 98193 34321 06817 01210 15627 88023 51930 33224 74501 58539 04730 41995 77770 93503 66041 69973 29725 08868 76966 40355 57071 62268 44716 25607 98826 51787 13419 51246 65201 03059 21236 67719 43252 78675 39855 89448 96970 96409 75459 18569 56380 23637 01621 12047 74272 28364 89613 42251 64450 78182 44235 29486 36372 14174 02388 93441 24796 35743 70263 75529 44483 37998 01612 54922 78509 25778 25620 92622 64832 62779 33386 56648 16277 25164 01910 59004 91644 99828 93150 56604 72580 27786 31864 15519 56532 44258 69829 46959 30801 91529 87211 72556 34754 63964 47910 14590 40905 86298 49679 12874 06870 50489 58586 71747 98546 67757 57320 56812 88459 20541 33405 39220 00113 78630 09455 60688 16674 00169 84205 58040 33637 9537{j 45203 04024 32256 61352 78369 51117 88386 38744 39662 53224 98506 54995 88623 42818 99707 73327 61717 83928 03494 65014 34558 89707 19425 86398 77275 47109 62953 74152 11151 36835 06275 26023 26484 72870 39207 64310 05958 41166 12054 52970 30236 47254 92966 69381 15137 32275 36450 98889 03136 02057 24817 65851 18063 03644 28123 14965 50704 75102 54465 01172 72115 55194 86685 08003 68532 28183 15219 60037 35625 27944 95158 28418 82947 87610 85263 98139 55990 06737 64829 22443 75287 18462 45780 36192 98197 13991 47564 48826 26039 03381 44182 32625 15097 48279 87779 96437 30899 70388 86778 22713 83605 77297 88241 25611 90717 66394 65070 63304 52795 46618 55096 66618 56647 09711 34447 40160 70462 62156 80717 48187 78443 71436 98821 85596 70959 10259 68620 02353 71858 87485 69652 20005 03117 34392 07321 13908 03293 63447 97273 55955 27734 90717 83793 42163 70120 50054 51326 38354 40001 86323 99149 07054 79778 05669 78533 58048 96690 62951 19432 47309 95876 55236 81285 90413 83241 16072 26029 98330 53537 08761 38939 63917 79574 54016 13722 36133 Solutions to Sec. 10 501 Let us also give the logarithm of this number to base 10 accurate to 282 decimal places. loglo e=0.43429 44819 03251 82765 11289 18916 60508 22943 97005 80366 65661 14453 78316 58646 49208 87077 47292 24949 33843 17483 18706 1067447663 03733 64167 92871 58963 90656 92210 64662 81226 58521 27086 56867 03295 93370 86965 88266 88331 16360 77384 90514 28443 48666 76864 65860 85135 56148 21234 87653 43543 43573 17247 48049 05993 55353 05 27. It is easily seen, that if lk (beginning with some k) are all equal to one another, then we deal with an infinitely decreasing geometric progression, and w is rational indeed. It remains to prove that if such circumstance (equality of all lk beginning with some k) does not take place, -then (0 is irrational. It can be proved in the same way as in Prob- lem 25. 28.
