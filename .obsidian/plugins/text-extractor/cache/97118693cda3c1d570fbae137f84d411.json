Having such a list of tools can both help you make good use of time—reminding you to move on to other approaches when stuck on one—and suggest solution ideas that may be cleverly hidden from the surface. Here are some techniques to either refresh your memory or augment your arsenal. 1. Modular analysis. Taking mods is probably the ﬁrst method most people learn for proving unsatisﬁability of Diophantine equations. While some easier problems fall immediately to this approach, most olympiad problems use modular analysis only as a ﬁrst step (if at all): indeed, any Diophantine equation with at least one solution will have solutions mod anything! Nonetheless, you might still ﬁnd out that, say, x ≡ 1 (mod 3) and then substitute x = 3y + 1 en route to a solution. One additional point worth mentioning is that the choice of modulus is not typically unmotivated: common tricks include modding out by coeﬃcients or variables (to make terms vanish) or by primes p such that exponents appearing in the equation divide p − 1 (so that the number of possible residues is small). One memorable example involves a mixed cubic and quartic Diophantine equation that turns out to have no solutions mod 13—a seemingly random modulus at ﬁrst glance, but in reality not so! 2. Factorization. The idea here is to perform some algebraic manipulation to convert one or both sides into a product of two or more factors; then, knowledge about prime factors on one side can be leveraged to deduce information about the factors on the other side. A good example—and useful trick in its own right!—is Pythagorean substitution, which characterizes the primitive Pythagorean triples x2 + y2 = z2. Assuming that y and z are odd, we may write y2 = (z + x)(z − x) and use coprimality of the latter two factors to deduce that each must be a square; thus, we ﬁnd x = (r2 − s2)/2, y = rs, and z = (r2 + s2)/2 for odd, coprime r, s. FIX THIS! Usually we instead take r, s to have opposite parity and substitute r2 − s2, 2rs, and r2 + s2. Conversely, all such pairs r, s produce primitive Pythagorean triples. 1 3. Inequalities. Although talk of inequalities may seem odd in the context of Diophan- tine equations, much Diophantine analysis relies on bounding expressions in order to use the simple but critical facts that the integers are discrete and ordered—as opposed to the reals! (In contrast, the previous two methods made use of even spacing and unique prime factorization, respectively.) Two general approaches that fall into this category are sandwiching integral expressions between consecutive integers and bounding the sizes of equal quantities (often factors). 4. Quadratic techniques. The case of quadratics deserves special mention because of its popularity and the sizable number of special techniques tailored to it. • First, the quadratic formula is always good to keep in mind: while low-brow, it can come in surprisingly handy. • Second, descent—i.e., using a given solution to derive the existence of a so- lution that is “smaller” in some well-deﬁned way—is a common approach to medium and harder problems. When descent is possible from every solution, this approach proves unsatisﬁability of the Diophantine equation and is known as inﬁnite descent. Sometimes, however, the descent breaks down for small enough solutions; in these cases, all that remains is to enumerate the small so- lutions by brute force and then reverse the descent process to reconstruct all solutions (usually an inﬁnite family). • Third, it is worth knowing at least the basic theory of Pell’s equation x2 − dy2 = 1 (where d is nonsquare: in the square case, clearly no nontrivial solutions exist). The most important fact to commit to memory is that this equation always has an inﬁnite family of solutions. It is also good to know that this family is generated by a fundamental solution (p, q) via “exponentiation,” in the sense that (p + q√ 3.
