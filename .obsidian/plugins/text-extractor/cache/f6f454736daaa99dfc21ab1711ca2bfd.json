Let n be a given integer greater than 2. We wish to label each side and each diagonal of a regular n-gon P1P2 · · · Pn with a positive integer less than or equal to r so that (a) every integer between 1 and r occurs as a label; (b) in each triangle PiPjPk two of the labels are equal and greater than the third. Given these conditions: (1) Determine the largest positive integer r for which this can be done. (2) For that maximum value of r, how many such labelings are there? 2. In an m × n rectangular board of mn unit squares, two squares are adjacent if they share a common edge. A path is a sequence of squares in which any two consecutive squares are adjacent. Each square of the board can be colored black or white. Let N denote the number of coloring schemes of the board such that there exists at least one black path from the left edge of the board to its right edge, and let M denote the number of coloring schemes in which there exist at least two non-intersecting black paths from the left edge to the right edge. Prove that N 2 ≥ M · 2mn. 3. A k-coloring of a graph G is a coloring of its vertices using k possible colors such that the end points of any edge have diﬀerent colors. We say a graph G is uniquely k-colorable if on the one hand it has a k-coloring, but on the other hand there do not exist vertices u and v such that u and v have the same color in one k-coloring and u and v have diﬀerent colors in another k-coloring. Prove that if a graph G with n vertices (n ≥ 3) is uniquely 3-colorable, then it has at least 2n − 3 edges. 4. Let a1, a2, . . . , a8 be eight distinct points on the circumference of a circle such that no three chords, each joining a pair of points, are concurrent. Every four of the eight points form a quadrilateral which is called a quad. If two chords, each joining a pair of the eight points, intersect, the point of intersection is called a bullet. Suppose some of the bullets are colored red. For each pair (i, j), with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 8, let r(i, j) be the number of quads containing ai, aj as vertices and whose diagonals intersect at a red bullet. Determine the smallest positive integer n such that it is possible to color n of the bullets red so that r(i, j) is a constant for all pairs (i, j). 5. Points P1, P2, . . . , Pn, with no three collinear, are given in the plane. Each point is colored in eaither red or blue. A nonempty set S of the triangles with P1, P2, . . . , Pn as their vertices is called good if for every pair of segments PiPj and PuPv, the number of triangles in S containing side PiPj is equal to the number of triangles in S containing side PuPv. A triangle is called monochromatic if all its vertices are of the same color. Determine the minimum value of n such that there are always two monochromatic triangles in any good set. 6. There is a set of n coins with distinct integer weights w1, w2, . . . , wn. It is known that if any coin with weight wk, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, is removed from the set, the remaining coins can be split into two groups of the same weight. (The number of coins in the two groups can be diﬀerent.) Find all n for which such a set of coins exists. 1 MOSP 2011 Black Joshua Nichols-Barrer 7. Can we tile a 13 × 13 table from which we remove the central unit square using only 1 × 4 or 4 × 1 rectangles? 8. In the Cartesian corrdinate plane deﬁne the strip Sn = {(x, y) : n ≤ x ≤ n + 1} for every integer n. Assume that each strip Sn is colored either red or blue, and let a and b be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side lengths a and b such that its vertices have the same color. 9. A (simple and ﬁnite) graph is called balanced if it has n edges, and it is possible to assign each of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n to an edge (one number per edge) in such a way that teh sum of the numbers assigned to the edges connecting to each vertex is the same. Determine if every balanced graph is connected. 10. Find all positive integers n, for which the numbers in the set S = {1, 2, . . . , n} can be colored red and blue, with the following condition being satisﬁed: the set S × S × S contains exactly 2007 ordered triples (x, y, z) such that (i) x, y, z are of the same color and (ii) the integer x + y + z is divisible by n. 11. Every positive integer is colored in either red or blue. Prove that there exists an inﬁnite sequence a1 < a2 < · · · such that the sequence a1, a1 + a2 2 , a2, a2 + a3 2 , a3, a3 + a4 2 , . . . is a monochromatic integer sequence. 12. A collection of n2+n 2 mathematicians are arranged in a series of piles. A move consists in taking one mathematician from each pile and forming a new pile from these. (A pile whose last element has been removed is no longer a pile.) Prove that after some number of moves, the piles will have sizes 1, 2, . . . , n. 13. Given a square board of size n × n, where n is an integer greater than 1, we label some of the squares by distinct numbers from the set {1, 2, . . . , n2}. What is the largest number of board squares we can label in this way without creating a diﬀerence of n or higher between any two labels on neighboring squares on the board? 14. Determine the minimum positive integer n satisfying the following condition: If each of the vertices of an n-sided regular polygon is colored in one of the three colors (say, red, green, and blue), then there is a monochromatic isosceles trapezoid. (Note that a parallelogram is not a trapezoid). 15. For a given prime p, ﬁnd the greatest positive integer n with the following property: the edges of the complete graph on n vertices can be colored with p + 1 colors so that: (a) at least two edges have diﬀerent colors; (b) if A, B and C are any three vertices and the edges AB and AC are of the same color, then BC has the same color as well. 2 MOSP 2011 Black Joshua Nichols-Barrer 16. Every integer is marked with one of 100 colors so that there is at least one number of each color. If [a, b] and [c, d] are two intervals of the same length such that a and c have the same color and also b and d have the same color, then a + x and c + x have the same color for each x ∈ [0, b − a]. Prove that −2001 and 2001 have diﬀerent colors. 17. For what values of n is it possible to color every square in an n × n grid red, blue, yellow, green, or orange, so that for all i, j, k between 1 and n with i ̸= j and j ̸= k, the square in row i and columnj is assigned a diﬀerent color from the square in row j and column k? 18. Let a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ ak and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bm be nonnegative integers such that min(a1, d) + min(a2, d) + · · · + min(ak, d) ≥ b1 + b2 + · · · + bd for all d ≤ m and min(b1, d) + min(b2, d) + · · · + min(bm, d) ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + ad for all d ≤ k. Prove that we can mark some of the squares of a k × m table so that the numbers of marked squares in the rows are exactly a1, a2, . . . , ak and in the columns are exactly b1, b2, . . . , bm. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
