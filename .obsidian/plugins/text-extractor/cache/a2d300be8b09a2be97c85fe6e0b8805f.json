In contests, we typically encounter problems involving divisibility and factorization. In this lecture we will let p1, p2, . . . represent the prime numbers in ascending order so that pn is the nth prime number. We let gcd(p, q) represent the greatest common denominator and let lcm(p, q) the least common multiple of integers p and q. 1 Divisibility and Factoring The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that any positive integer n can be represented in exactly one way as the product of prime numbers, so that the factorizations of p and q are identical if and only if p = q. The number f divides n if and only if none of the powers of the primes in the factorization of f are greater than those of n. Speciﬁcally, f divides n k times if and only if there is no prime p is the factorization of f that appears more than 1 k times as often as it appears in the factorization of n. On a related note, if some integer f divides integers p and q, then f divides mp + nq, where m and n are any integers. Quick question: How many times does 3 divide 28!? We reason that the answer is the sum of how many times 3 divides each of 1, 2, . . . , 28. Of the numbers 1 through 28, exactly ⌊ 28 3 ⌋ a multiples of 3, ⌊ 28 32 ⌋ are multiples of 3 2, etc. (where ⌊x⌋ is the ﬂoor function and represents the greatest integer less than or equal to x). To count the total number of p’s appearing in their factorizations, we compute 9+3+1+0+0+0+· · · = 13. The generalized result: Theorem : A prime number p divides n! exactly ∞∑ i=1 ⌊ n pi ⌋ times. This fact enables us to determine how many 0’s appear at the end of n!. Because there are more 2’s than 5’s in the factorization of n!, the number of 0’s at the end of n! is the 1 number of 5’s in its factorization. Quick question: How many factors does 120 have? We factor 120 and ﬁnd that 120 = 2 3 · 3 1 · 5 1. Therefore, any m = 2 m1 · 3 m2 · 5 m3 that divides 120 must satisfy 0 ≤ m1 ≤ 3, 0 ≤ m2 ≤ 1, 0 ≤ m3 ≤ 1. There are 4 possible m1, 2 possible m2, and 2 possible m3, meaning that there are 4 · 2 · 2 = 16 positive integers that divide 120. Moreover: Theorem : n = pn1 1 pn2 2 · · · pnk k has (n1 + 1)(n2 + 1) · · · (nk + 1) factors. The greatest common divisor of m and n is deﬁned to be the largest integer that divides both m and n. Two numbers whose largest common divisor is 1 are called relatively prime even though neither m nor n is necessarily prime. There are two notable ways to compute gcd(m, n). • Factoring - Let m = pm1 1 ·pm2 2 · · · and n = pn1 1 ·pn2 2 · · · such that m1, m2, . . . , n1, n2, . . . ≥ 0. Then gcd(m, n) is the positive integer whose prime factorization contains pi exactly min(mi, ni) times for all positive integers i. Remark - This is useful if the factorizations of m and n are readily available, but if m and n are large numbers such as 4897, they will be diﬃcult to factor. • Euclidean Algorithm - Let n > m. If m divides n, then gcd(m, n) = m. Oth- erwise, gcd(m, n) = gcd(m, n − m · ⌊ n m⌋). Remark - This is useful when factoring fails. For example, ﬁnding gcd(4897, 1357). 1357 does not divide 4897, so ⌊ 4897 1357 ⌋ = 3, 4897 − 3 · 1357 = 826 and gcd(4897, 1357) = gcd(1357, 826). 826 does not divide 1357, so gcd(1357, 826) = gcd(826, 531). 531 does not divide 826 so gcd(862, 531) = gcd(531, 295). Continuing this process, gcd(531, 295) = gcd(295, 236) = gcd(236, 59) = 59. The least common multiple of m and n is deﬁned to be the least number that is divisible by both m and n. Other than listing multiples of m and n, we can determine the lcm by the formula: lcm(m, n) = mn gcd(m,n). Note that because gcd(m, n) ≥ 1, we have lcm(m, n) ≤ mn. The Euler Phi function, ϕ(n), denotes the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. If we let p1, p2, . . . , pk denote all of the distinct prime numbers that divide p, then: ϕ(n) = n · ( 1 − 1 p1 ) ( 1 − 1 p2 ) · · · (1 − 1 pk ) 2 Modulo Trickery The division algorithm states that when dividing n by p ̸= 0, there is exactly one integer q such that n = pq + r, where 0 ≤ r < |p|. We deﬁne n modulo p (or simply m mod p) to be 2 r in this equation. We use the notation r ≡ n (mod p) when solving equations. There are a number of theorems that apply to modulos, some of which are outlined here: • k · n + c ≡ c (mod n), for any integers k, n, and c. This follows from the deﬁnition of modulos. • (k · n + c) m ≡ cm (mod n), for any integers k, n, and c, and any positive integer m. This is the result of binomial expansion of the left side. • ap−1 ≡ 1 (mod p), for relatively prime integers a and p, where p is prime. A result known as Fermat’s Little Theorem. • aϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n), for any relatively prime integers a and n, where ϕ(n) is the Euler Phi function. This is Euler’s Generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem. • (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p), for any prime p. This is Wilson’s Theorem. Whenever the word remainder appears, you should immediately think modulos. Likewise, determining the last few digits of a number should make you consider modulos. The above theorems are merely suppliments to the algebra that can be performed on modular equations, which we outline here. The rules of modular arithmetic can be summa- rized as follows: 1. The only numbers that can be divided by m in modulo n are those that are multiples of gcd(m, n). 1 2. When multiplying by m in modulo n, the only numbers that can result are multiples of gcd(m, n). 2 3. Taking the square root of both sides is “normal” only in prime modulos. (For example, the solutions to n2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) are not only n ≡ ±1 (mod 8) but more completely n ≡ ±1, ±3 (mod 8).) 4. When solving for integer solutions in modulo n, any integer multiple of n can be added to or subtracted from any number. (This includes adding multiples of n to square roots of negative numbers.) 5. All other operations behave normally according to the standard rules of algebra over the integers. Consider, for example, solving for all positive n ≤ 100 for which n2 + n + 31 is divisible by 43. Of course we set up n2 + n + 31 ≡ 0 (mod 43). We apply the quadratic formula and ﬁnd that n ≡ −1±√−123 2 (mod 43). Because −123 ≡ −123 + 43k (mod 43), we replace -123 with −123 + 5 · 43 = 49 and continue: n ≡ −1±7 2 (mod 43), so n ≡ 3, −4 (mod 43). Therefore, all such n are 3, 39, 46, 82, and 89. 1Each of which leaves gcd(m, n) diﬀerent residues. 2There are gcd(m, n) distinct residues that all lead to the same number when multiplied by m. 3 3 Practice All of the following problems can be solved with the techniques enumerated above. 1. How many factors does 800 have? 2. How many times does 7 divide 100!? 3. What is the smallest positive integer n for which n−6 5n+17 is non-zero and reducible? 4. In Mathworld, the basic monetary unit is the Jool, and all other units of currency are equivalent to an integral number of Jools. If it is possible to make the Mathworld equivalents of $299 and $943, then what is the maximum possible value of a Jool in terms of dollars? 5. What are the last three digits of 3 2004? 6.
