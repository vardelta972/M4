{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/OlympiadQPs/Miscellaneous/Olympiad Dark Arts - Adam Goucher/Chp3 Combinatorics 2.pdf","text":"Combinatorics II This chapter discusses Ramsey theory, graph theory and topology. The principal principle of Ramsey theory is that ‘sufficiently large objects contain arbitrarily large homogeneous objects’. For example, Ramsey’s theorem in graph theory states that one can find arbitrarily large monochromatic cliques in a sufficiently large complete graph coloured with c colours. Gallai-Witt theorem \u0000 Suppose we have a d-dimensional hypercube divided into gd elements, each of which is coloured with one of c colours. If g \u0000 G\u0000d, c\u0000, where G is a function of d and c, then there exists some monochromatic (irregular) d-simplex homothetic to \u0000\u00000, 0, 0, …, 0\u0000, \u00001, 0, 0, …, 0\u0000, \u00000, 1, 0, …, 0\u0000, \u00000, 0, 1, …, 0\u0000, …, \u00000, 0, 0, …, 1\u0000\u0000. [Lemma 1] Proof: To prove this, we induct on the number of dimensions. For d \u0000 1, this is trivially true by the pigeonhole principle: G\u00001, c\u0000 \u0000 c \u0000 1, as any set of c \u0000 1 elements must contain two of the same colour. We can use this as a starting point for proving the case for d \u0000 2. Firstly, we can guarantee the existence of things like this, known as \u00001, c, 1\u0000- objects: We assume that the top vertex is a different colour to either of the bottom vertices of the triangle, since otherwise we are done. We consider a strip of squares, each of size G\u00001, c, 1\u0000 \u0000 G\u00001, c\u0000. They must each contain at least one \u00001, c, 1\u0000-object, like so: Moreover, each square can only have cG\u00001,c,1\u00002 possible states. Consider a row of G\u00001, cG\u00001,c,1\u00002\u0000 such squares. At least two of them must be identical, so we can guarantee the existence of things like this, known as \u00001, c, 2\u0000- objects: All three rows of points must necessarily have different colours. We define G\u00001, c, 2\u0000 \u0000 G\u00001, cG\u00001,c,1\u00002\u0000 G\u00001, c, 1\u0000 to be an upper bound on the size of a box containing such an object. We then repeat the argument, considering a row of G\u00001, cG\u00001,c,2\u00002\u0000 boxes of size G\u00001, c, 2\u0000: This gives us G\u00001, c, f \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 G\u00001, cG\u00001,c, f \u00002\u0000 G\u00001, c, f \u0000. Now consider \u00001, c, c\u0000-objects. They must have c \u0000 1 rows of points, two of which must be the same colour by the pigeonhole principle. This means that we have a monochromatic isosceles right-angled triangle: In other words, G\u00002, c\u0000 \u0000 G\u00001, c, c\u0000. Now that we have tackled the two-dimensional case, we can begin work on three dimensions. We use the two-dimensional result G\u00002, c, 1\u0000 \u0000 G\u00002, c\u0000 as a base case, and perform an identical \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 inductive argument. Firstly, we can guarantee the existence of \u00002, c, 1\u0000-objects within a box of side length G\u00002, c, 1\u0000. Now, consider a plane of G\u00002, cG\u00002,c, f \u00003\u0000 such boxes. They must necessarily contain an isosceles right-angled triangle of identical boxes, by the theorem for G\u00002, c\u0000, so we can guarantee a \u00002, c, 2\u0000-object. Proceeding in this manner, we can guarantee the existence of a \u00002, c, c\u0000-object, therefore a monochromatic tetrahedron. By repeating this argument and inducting on the number of dimensions, we can find upper bounds for G\u0000d, c\u0000 for all integers d and c. This concludes the proof of Lemma 1. \u0000 Suppose we colour the elements of \u0000n with c colours. Then, given a set of d \u0000 1 vectors \u00000, a1, a2, …, ad\u0000 \u0000 \u0000n, we can find an integer \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 and vector v \u0000 \u0000n such that the points \u0000v, v \u0000 \u0000 a1, v \u0000 \u0000 a2, …, v \u0000 \u0000 ad\u0000 are monochromatic. [Gallai-Witt theorem] This theorem also holds if \u0000n is replaced with \u0000n or \u0000n. To prove the Gallai-Witt theorem, we ‘project’ Lemma 1 from d dimensions onto a n-dimensional subplane by using a degenerate affine transformation. For example, the existence of the monochromatic triangle in the diagram above proves the existence of a set of reals homothetic to \u00000, a, b\u0000 on the line below. This argument generalises very easily to prove the Gallai-Witt theorem. 1. Suppose c and n are integers. Prove that there exists an integer w \u0000 W \u0000c, n\u0000 such that any c-colouring of the integers \u00001, 2, …, w\u0000 contains a monochromatic arithmetic progression of length n. [Van der Waerden’s theorem] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these c subsets has a ‘density’ \" \u0000 1 c . A generalised version of van der Waerden’s theorem states that if s \u0000 S\u0000\", n\u0000, then any subset A \u0000 \u00001, 2, …, s\u0000 with A \u0000 \" s must contain an arithmetic progression of length n. This is known as Szemeredi’s theorem. Allowing s to approach infinity, we can apply this to the set of positive integers and obtain the following theorem: \u0000 If some subset of the positive integers has a non-zero asymptotic density, then it contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Some other subsets of the positive integers contain arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Ben Green and Terence Tao proved that the prime numbers exhibit this property, despite having zero asymptotic density due to the prime number theorem. An unproven conjecture by Paul Erd\u0000s is that any set \u0000a1, a2, a3, …\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 such that 1 a1 \u0000 1 a2 \u0000 1 a3 \u0000 … diverges to infinity contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. Of course, Szemeredi’s theorem and the Green-Tao theorem are both special cases of this conjecture, since the prime harmonic series 1 2 \u0000 1 3 \u0000 1 5 \u0000 … diverges (albeit very slowly). Our argument gives very weak upper bounds for the van der Waerden numbers (minimal values of W \u0000c, n\u0000). By considering Szemeredi’s theorem, Tim Gowers currently has the tightest known upper bound, which is W \u0000c, n\u0000 \u0000 22c 22n\u00009 . The lower bounds are merely exponential, so very little is known about the asymptotics of van der Waerden numbers. Hales-Jewett theorem Observe that in no part of our proof of Lemma 1 did we use the entire \u0000n. For the two-dimensional case, we only used a set of points corresponding to approximations to a fractal known as the Sierpinski triangle. The Sierpinski triangle is generated by beginning with a single point, then repeatedly placing three copies of it at the vertices of an equilateral triangle and scaling by 1 2 . Repeating this process four times, we obtain the order-4 approximation to the Sierpinski triangle, with 34 \u0000 81 points (shown below). The Sierpinski triangle is the limit, when this process is repeated infinitely. We can associate points in the order-3 Sierpinski triangle with words of length 3 from the alphabet \u0000A, B, C\u0000, like so: \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 AAAAAB AAC ABAABB ABC ACAACB ACC BAABAB BAC BBABBB BBC BCABCB BCC CAACAB CAC CBACBB CBC CCACCB CCC Suppose we introduce an additional symbol, \u0000, which is considered to be a ‘variable’. A word containing at least one asterisk is known as a root. The root A B A \u0000 \u0000 C corresponds to the three words A B A A A C, A B A B B C and A B A C C C, where \u0000 successively takes on each of the three possible values. This set of three words is known as a combinatorial line. Note that combinatorial lines correspond to (upright) equilateral triangles of points in the Sierpinski triangle. More generally, we can associate points in the order-h Sierpinski \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-simplex with words from # h, where # is an alphabet of n symbols. \u0000 Let # be an alphabet of n symbols. We colour each word of #h with one of c colours. If h \u0000 H\u0000n, c\u0000, then there exists a monochromatic combinatorial line. [Hales-Jewett theorem] So, it is equivalent to the following alternative formulation. \u0000 Suppose we colour the vertices of an order-h Sierpinski \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-simplex with c colours. If h \u0000 H\u0000n, c\u0000, there exists a monochromatic (upright) equilateral \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-simplex. [Hales-Jewett theorem] Proof: The proof of Lemma 1 requires some slight refinement before it can be applied to prove Hales-Jewett. If we choose two generic points on the base of the Sierpinski triangle, then we cannot guarantee that there is a third vertex capable of completing the equilateral triangle. For example, B A B and A B A do not belong to a combinato- rial line. So, we cannot merely apply the pigeonhole principle to the 2h points on the base of the Sierpinski triangle. Instead, however, we can apply it to the h \u0000 1 points corresponding to ‘powers of two’. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 If we select any two of the h \u0000 1 circled vertices, there is a third point capable of completing the equilateral triangle. Applying the Pigeonhole principle, we can let h \u0000 c and there must be two circled vertices of the same colour. This proves the existence of \u00001, c, 1\u0000-objects, i.e. equilateral triangles with two vertices of the same colour. The remainder of the argument is identical to that of Lemma 1, so there is no need to repeat it here. The Hales-Jewett theorem has a generalisation. If we allow roots with two variable symbols, such as \u0000 and \u0000, then we can create a combinatorial 2-plane by considering the set of n2 words formed by replacing each variable with each of the letters in #. For example, if # \u0000 \u0000A, B\u0000, the root A \u0000 B B \u0000 A \u0000 would correspond to the combina- torial 2-plane \u0000A A B B A A A, A B B B A A B, A A B B B A A, A B B B B A B\u0000. More generally, if we have roots with p variable symbols, then we generate a combinatorial p-plane of n p words. 2. Let # be a finite alphabet of n symbols, and colour the words of # j with c colours. Prove that if j \u0000 J \u0000n, c, p\u0000, then there exists a monochromatic combinatorial p-plane. [Generalised Hales-Jewett] Here is an example of a combinatorial 2-plane on the order-4 Sierpinski triangle: Just as van der Waerden’s theorem has a stronger ‘density’ version (namely Szemeredi’s theorem), so does the Hales-Jewett theorem and its generalisation. Using rather advanced methods, Furstenberg and Katznelson proved the theorem in 1991. More recently, a large collaborative effort (the Polymath project) led by Gowers resulted in an elementary combinatorial proof of the theorem, and thus Szemeredi’s theorem and its multidimensional extension (the density version of Gallai-Witt). \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Noughts and crosses Effectively, the ordinary Hales-Jewett theorem states that in a c-player, h-dimensional game of tic-tac-toe on a board of size n, where h \u0000 H \u0000n, c\u0000, the game cannot terminate in a draw. Hence, one player has a winning strategy. The second player cannot have a winning strategy, as the first player can play randomly on the first move and emulate the winning strategy of the second player, knowing that owning an extra square cannot possibly be detrimental. This means that the first player can always win if the dimension is sufficiently large. For ordinary ‘noughts and crosses’ where c \u0000 2, n \u0000 3 and h \u0000 2, it is well known that neither player has a winning strategy. A typical drawing pattern is displayed above. It has been proved that H \u00003, 2\u0000 \u0000 4, so it is impossible to draw in a four-dimensional game of tic-tac-toe. This does not necessarily mean that three-dimensional games terminate in a draw; certain diagonal lines are not considered to be combinatorial lines. 3. Does the first player have a winning strategy for c \u0000 2, n \u0000 3 and h \u0000 3? [Three-dimensional noughts and crosses] 4. A game is played between two players on a 1 by 2010 grid. Taking it in turns, they place either an S or an O in an empty square. The game ends when three consecutive squares spell out S O S, at which point the player who has just played wins. If the grid fills up without this happening, the game is a draw. Prove that the second player has a winning strategy. [Advanced Mentoring Scheme, November 2010, Question 2] Ramsey’s theorem Colour each of the edges of the complete graph Kn either red or blue. Let R2\u0000r, b\u0000 be the smallest value of n such that there must be either a red Kr or blue Kb contained within the graph. For example, R2\u00003, 3\u0000 \u0000 6, as all colour- ings of K6 contain a monochromatic triangle, whereas the following colouring of K5 does not: \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 5. Prove that R2\u0000r \u0000 1, b \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 R2\u0000r \u0000 1, b\u0000 \u0000 R2\u0000r, b \u0000 1\u0000. [Bicoloured Ramsey’s theorem] This argument generalises. If we colour the edges of Kn red, blue and green, where n \u0000 R2\u0000r, g, b\u0000, then there must be either a red Kr, a green Kg or a blue Kb. A further generalisation is by considering hypergraphs instead of graphs. Edges can be considered to be unordered pairs of vertices; if, instead, we colour unordered sets of k vertices, we obtain a complete k-hyper- graph. It transpires that Ramsey’s theorem generalises to hypergraphs. \u0000 Let \u0000C1, C2, …, Cc\u0000 be a set of c colours. Colour each unordered k-tuple of \u00001, 2, 3, …, n\u0000 with one of \u0000C1, C2, …, Cc\u0000. Then, if n \u0000 Rk\u0000a1, a2, …, ac\u0000, there is some 1 \u0000 i \u0000 c and some subset of ai vertices, all k-tuples of which are coloured with Ci. [Generalised Ramsey’s theorem] Proof: We induct on the value of k. For k \u0000 1, this reduces to the pigeonhole principle: R1\u0000a1, a2, …, ac\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 \u0000a1 \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a2 \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 … \u0000 \u0000ac \u0000 1\u0000. Suppose we are trying to prove the existence of Rk\u0000a1, a2, …, ac\u0000. Let n \u0000 1 \u0000 Rk\u00001\u0000Rk\u0000a1 \u0000 1, a2, …, ac\u0000, Rk\u0000a1, a2 \u0000 1, …, ac\u0000, …, Rk\u0000a1, a2, …, ac \u0000 1\u0000\u0000. Select an arbitrary vertex V . By Ramsey’s theorem for \u0000k \u0000 1\u0000-hypergraphs, we can guarantee that there must be, for some colour Ci, a set of b \u0000 Rk\u0000a1, a2, …, ai \u0000 1, …, ac\u0000 vertices \u0000W1, W2, …, Wb\u0000 such that every unordered k- tuple containing V and k \u0000 1 elements of \u0000W1, W2, …, Wb\u0000 is coloured with Ci. Amongst those b vertices, there must either be a set of a j vertices, all k-tuples of which are coloured with C j (in which case we are done), or a set of ai \u0000 1 vertices, all k-tuples of which are coloured with Ci. Consider those ai \u0000 1 vertices together with V . All k- tuples of those ai vertices are coloured with Ci, so the inductive step is complete. As the base case Rk\u00000, a2, …, ac\u0000 is trivial, we are done. 6. Prove that, for every n \u0000 3, there exists an integer k \u0000 K\u0000n\u0000 such that every set S of k points in the plane in general position must contain a convex n-gon formed from n points of S. [Happy ending problem] This problem is so named as it lead to the eventual marriage of George Szekeres and Esther Klein. Klein was responsible for discovering that K\u00004\u0000 \u0000 5, and the result was generalised by Erd\u0000s and Szekeres. Dilworth’s theorem The case of Ramsey’s theorem for two colours and ordinary graphs gives exponential bounds on the number of vertices. With the base case of R\u00002, n\u0000 \u0000 n, it is evident that R\u0000n, m\u0000 is bounded above by the binomial coefficient \u0000n\u0000m\u0000\u0000 n\u0000 m\u0000 . If we make additional constraints on how the edges are allowed to be coloured, then we obtain a much stronger (indeed, optimal) bound. \u0000 Suppose we define a relation \u0000 on the elements of a set S, such that, for all a, b, c \u0000 S: \u0000 a \u0000 a; [Reflexivity] \u0000 If a \u0000 b and b \u0000 a then a \u0000 b; [Antisymmetry] \u0000 If a \u0000 b and b \u0000 c then a \u0000 c; [Transitivity] Then, \u0000 is known as a partial order on the elements of S. [Definition of partial order] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Common examples of partial orders include the relation a b on the set of positive integers and the relation a \u0000 b on the set of real numbers. \u0000 If neither a \u0000 b nor b \u0000 a, then a and b are said to be incomparable. A set \u0000c1, c2, …, cn\u0000 \u0000 S such that c1 \u0000 c2 \u0000 … \u0000 cn is known as a chain of length n. A set \u0000a1, a2, …, am\u0000 \u0000 S such that ai and a j are incomparable for all i ! j is known as an antichain of length m. [Definition of chains and antichains] We can interpret the elements of S as the vertices of a complete graph, joined with a blue edge if the elements are incomparable and a red edge otherwise. Then, Ramsey’s theorem guarantees that if S \u0000 R\u0000n, m\u0000 \u0000 \u0000n\u0000m\u0000\u0000 n\u0000 m\u0000 , there must be either a chain of length n or an antichain of length m. However, it is possible to prove much tighter bounds than those applicable to general graphs. 7. Prove that if S \u0000 \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000m \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 1, then there is either a chain of length n or antichain of length m. [Dilworth’s theorem] In general, \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000m \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 1 is much smaller than \u0000n\u0000m\u0000\u0000 n\u0000 m\u0000 . Note that Dilworth’s theorem cannot be improved upon, as it is easy to define sets of \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000m \u0000 1\u0000 elements where the longest chain is length n \u0000 1 and the longest antichain is length m \u0000 1. For example, here is a partially ordered set of 20 elements where there are no chains of length 6 or antichains of length 5. 8. Show that a sequence of length n m \u0000 n \u0000 m has either a monotonically increasing subsequence of length n or a monotonically decreasing subsequence of length m. [Erd\u0000s-Szekeres theorem] Turán’s theorem Suppose we have a graph G of n vertices. If there exists a set of k vertices K \u0000 \u0000A1, A2, …, Ak\u0000 \u0000 G such that every pair of vertices Ai A j is connected by an edge, then K is described as a k-clique. For example, the following graph contains a 5-clique: What is the maximum number of edges G can have such that there are no \u0000r \u0000 1\u0000-cliques? For r \u0000 1, there can be no edges, since an edge is a 2-clique. For r \u0000 n \u0000 1, there can be n 2 \u0000 1 edges, since we can delete a single edge \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 from the complete graph Kn. For other r, it turns out that the maximum number of edges is uniquely achieved by the Turán graph T\u0000n, r\u0000, which is constructed by partitioning the n vertices into r subsets of almost equal size (differing by at most 1) and joining two vertices if and only if they inhabit different subsets. For instance, the tetrahedron-free graph on 10 vertices with the most edges is shown below: 9. 21 apples are placed on the unit circle. Show that there are at least 100 line segments of length \u0000 3 with Rosaceae endpoints. [Ross Atkins, Trinity 2012] Again, this bound is attained by the configuration equivalent to the Turán graph, by separating the 21 apples into two groups of roughly equal size, situated near diametrically opposite points on the unit circle. 10. Given nine points in space, no four of which are coplanar, find the minimal natural number n such that for any colouring with red or blue of n edges drawn between these nine points there always exists a monochromatic triangle. [IMO 1992, Question 3] Planar graphs We describe a graph as planar if it can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing. For example, the complete graph K4 is planar, whereas K5 and the complete bipartite graph K3,3 are not. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 planar non\u0000planar non\u0000planar Indeed, a graph is planar if and only if it contains either K5 or K3,3 as a minor, i.e. can be reduced to one of these graphs by a combination of deleting edges, deleting vertices and contracting edges. For example, the (non-planar) Petersen graph below can be reduced to K5 by contracting the five ‘shortest’ edges. A planar graph divides the plane into well-defined regions (or faces). The following graph has five faces, four of which are bounded. We have used four colours such that neighbouring faces are different colours; in general, this is possible with any planar graph. Indeed, it is best to append a point at infinity (this will become familiar to you later when we explore inversion) to convert the plane into a topological sphere. In this case, our planar graph is equivalent to the triangular prism. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 There is a useful invariant applying to graphs drawn on some surface. Suppose we have the following two elementary operations: \u0000 A: inserting a vertex somewhere on an edge; \u0000 B: drawing an edge between two vertices, ensuring the graph remains planar. We are also allowed their inverse operations, A\u00001 and B\u00001. The value of $ \u0000 V \u0000 F \u0000 E (where V , F, E are the numbers of vertices, faces and edges, respectively) is referred to as the Euler characteristic, and is unaffected by these elementary operations. As we can obtain all planar graphs (or, equivalently, polyhedra with no holes) from these operations, then the Euler characteristic is constant. It is a trivial exercise to verify for a simple polyhedron (such as the tetrahedron, with \u0000V , F, E\u0000 \u0000 \u00004, 4, 6\u0000), that the Euler characteristic must be 2. Assuming no ‘funny business’ such as faces containing holes, the Euler characteristic is constant for all graphs drawn on a particular surface. Equivalently, it is constant for all polyhedra with a certain number of holes. For example, the Euler characteristic of a torus is 0. Every new hole decreases the Euler characteristic by 2, so by induction we have $ \u0000 2 \u0000 2 H , where H is the number of holes. More remarkably, an unbounded surface can be identified simply by its Euler characteristic and orientability (whether indirect isometries exist). For instance, the torus and Klein bottle are the orientable and unorientable surfaces, respectively, with an Euler characteristic of zero. 11. The Klein quartic is a surface topologically equivalent to a multi-holed torus, which can be tiled by 24 heptagons, where three heptagons meet at each vertex. What is its Euler characteristic, and thus how many holes does it have? This description of the Klein quartic may remind you of the \u00007, 3\u0000 tiling of hyperbolic space. Indeed, it is obtained by ‘rolling up’ a finite patch of the hyperbolic tiling into a surface in the same way that a chessboard (finite patch \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 of the square tiling \u00004, 4\u0000) can be rolled up into an ordinary torus as in the diagram. Similarly, the Platonic solids are obtained by rolling up a finite patch (namely all) of a spherical tiling into a sphere. The Klein quartic has a symmetry group of order 336, far exceeding that of the most symmetrical Platonic solids (the icosahedron and dodecahedron, with 120 symmetries). \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. This is a trivial corollary of Gallai-Witt in one dimension. 2. As the base case, J\u0000n, c, 1\u0000 \u0000 H \u0000n, c\u0000. For the inductive step, we let j \u0000 J \u0000n, cnJ\u0000n,c,k\u0000, 1\u0000. This means that there must be a monochromatic line of identical objects, each of which must contain a monochromatic k- plane. In total, this gives us a monochromatic \u0000k \u0000 1\u0000-plane. Note that this is a ridiculously fast-growing function. 3. Yes. Place a ‘nought’ in the central cube. Assume the opponent plays a ‘cross’ in a cube C. Choose a cube A which is not collinear with C, and place a ‘nought’ in the cube diametrically opposite to A. This forces your opponent to place a ‘cross’ in A. As the two ‘crosses’ are non-collinear, you now have a free move. Place a ‘nought’ in a position coplanar with your existing two ‘noughts’. This creates two partial lines; your opponent can only block one of them. 4. Define an ‘unsafe move’ to be one that results in the opponent winning on the subsequent move. The only unsafe move for placing an O is S _ _ \u0000 S O _. Define an ‘unsafe square’ to be one where placing either an S or an O is an unsafe move. The only unsafe squares are of the form S _ _ S, which occur in pairs due to the bilateral symmetry. Hence, there is always an even number of unsafe squares. So, if there is a nonzero number of unsafe squares, the second player has a winning strategy as her opponent must eventually place a letter in an unsafe square, resulting in a win for the second player. To force a win, therefore, she must simply create an arrangement of the form S _ _ S. Immediately after the first player moves, the second player places a S sufficiently far from the first move. If the first player tries to block by playing close to the S, simply place another S on the opposite side, resulting in S _ _ S. As soon as the first player makes an unsafe move (which he inevitably will), the second player can immediately win. 5. Consider a vertex V from the graph. It must have either at least R\u0000r, b \u0000 1\u0000 red edges or R\u0000r \u0000 1, b\u0000 blue edges connected to it. Assume, without loss of generality, that the former is true. Consider the set S of R\u0000r, b \u0000 1\u0000 vertices connected to V via red edges. The subgraph on the vertices of S must then either contain a blue Kb\u00001 (in which case we are done) or a red Kr. V is connected to each of the vertices of the Kr by a red edge, resulting in a red Kr\u00001. 6. It is straightforward to show that K\u00004\u0000 \u0000 5, i.e. that every set of five points contains a convex quadrilateral, by considering all possible diagrams. This acts as a ‘base case’ to apply Ramsey’s theorem for K\u0000n\u0000. Colour each 4-tuple of points blue if they are convex, or red if they are non-convex. By Ramsey’s theorem for R4\u00005, n\u0000, there must be either a set of n points that form a convex polygon or a set of 5 points, no 4 of which form a convex polygon. Due to the base case, the latter is impossible, so the former must invariably be true. 7. Let f : S \u0000 \u0000\u0000 be a function mapping each element of S to the length of the longest chain terminating in S. If there are no n-chains, then the values may only range from 1 to n \u0000 1. Similarly, if there are no m- antichains, then only m \u0000 1 elements are allowed to take each value. So, there are at most \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000m \u0000 1\u0000 elements in S. 8. Consider the sequence \u0000a1, a2, …, an m\u0000n\u0000m\u0000. For each ai and a j, we say that ai \u0000 a j if both i \u0000 j and ai \u0000 a j. Then, Dilworth’s theorem guarantees that either a chain (increasing subsequence) or antichain (decreasing subsequence) exists. 9. Let G be the graph on 21 vertices, where two vertices share an edge if and only if they are separated by a distance greater than 3 . As any three apples must form the vertices of a triangle, and one angle must be at most \u0000 3 , we can use the sine rule to deduce that one of the edges must be less than or equal to 3 . Hence, G is triangle-free and has at most 110 edges by Turán’s theorem. As we have a total of 21 2 \u0000 210 pairs of apples, there are at least 210 \u0000 110 \u0000 100 line segments of length \u0000 3 . \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 10. To prove that n \u0000 32, consider the Turán graph above on nine vertices containing no 6-cliques. It has 32 edges. We call the five subsets of vertices A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, and join vertices X \u0000 Ai and Y \u0000 A j with a red edge if \u0000i \u0000 j\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000mod 5\u0000, a blue edge if \u0000i \u0000 j\u0000 \u0000 \u00002 \u0000mod 5\u0000, and no edge if i \u0000 j. To prove that n \u0000 33, note that all graphs with 33 edges must contain a 6-clique by Turán’s theorem. This 6-clique must contain a monochromatic triangle by Ramsey’s theorem. 11. Each vertex is adjacent to three heptagons, and each heptagon has seven vertices. Hence, there must be 24 \u0000 7 \u0000 56 vertices. Similarly, each heptagon has seven edges, and each edge is adjacent to two heptagons, so there are 84 edges. The Euler characteristic is 24 \u0000 56 \u0000 84 \u0000 \u00004, so the Klein quartic is topologically a three-holed torus. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
