Let a, b, c, d be positive real numbers such that abcd = 1 and a + b + c + d > a b + b c + c d + d a . Prove that a + b + c + d < b a + c b + d c + a d . 2. In an acute triangle ABC, segments BE and CF are altitudes. Two circles passing through the points A and F are tangent to the line BC at the points P and Q so that B lies between C and Q. Prove that the lines P E and QF intersect on the circumcircle of triangle AEF . 3. For every n ∈ N, let d(n) denote the number of (positive) divisors of n. Find all functions f : N → N with the following properties: (a) d(f (x)) = x for all x ∈ N; (b) f (xy) divides (x − 1)yxy−1f (x) for all x, y ∈ N. 1 1 Solutions 1. (IMO 2008 Short list, A5) We will prove that 2a + 2b + 2c + 2d ≤ ∑ cyc ( a b + b a ) . (1) This is clearly suﬃcient. Using abcd = 1 to homogenize, (1) becomes 2a 3 4 b 1 4 c 1 4 d 1 4 + 2b 3 4 a 1 4 c 1 4 d 1 4 + 2c 3 4 a 1 4 b 1 4 d 1 4 + 2d 3 4 b 1 4 c 1 4 a 1 4 ≤ ∑ cyc ( a b + b a ) Using AM-GM, we get a b + a b + b c + a d ≥ 4a 3 4 b 1 4 c 1 4 d 1 4 , and a d + a d + d c + a b ≥ 4a 3 4 b 1 4 c 1 4 d 1 4 . Adding these inequalities cyclically, we get the desired result. 2. (IMO 2008 Short list, G4) A B C E F PQ R We claim that AEP Q is a cyclic quadrilateral. Let a, b, c denote the angles of △ABC. By power of a point, BP 2 = BF · BA = BQ2. Therefore, CP · CQ = (CB + BQ) · (CB − 2 BP ) = CB2 − BF · BA = CB2 − (CB · cos b) · ( CB sin c sin a ) = CB2 · ( sin(b+c)−(cos b)(sin c) sin a ) = CB2 · (cos c)(sin b) sin a = (CB cos c) · ( CB sin b sin a ) = CE · CA. This proves AEP Q is cyclic by power of a point. Now, ∠F RE = ∠QRP = 180◦ − ∠RP Q − ∠RQP = ∠QAC − ∠QAB. Here, we used the fact that AEP Q is cyclic and the circumcircle of AF Q is tangent to BC at Q. Therefore, ∠F RE = ∠BAC = ∠F AE, which completes the proof. Remark: Here is another way to prove AEP Q is cyclic. Let H be the orthocentre of ABC. Note that AF HE is cyclic. By power of a point, BP 2 = BQ2 = BF · BA = BH · BE, so the circumcircle of QEH is tangent to line BC. Likewise, the circumcircle of P EH is tangent to line BC. Now invert around C, preserving circle AF HE. The circles passing through AF tangent to line BC goes to the circle passing through EH tangent to line BC, so P and Q go to each other. 3. (IMO 2008 Short list, N5) Recall that if the prime factorization of n is pe1 1 · pe2 2 · · · pem m , then d(n) = (e1 + 1)(e2 + 1) · · · (em + 1). Now, if p is a prime, then by above there must exist a prime q such that f (p) = qp−1. Suppose q ̸= p. Taking x = q, y = p gives f (pq)|(q − 1)ppq−1f (q). There exists some prime r with f (q) = rq−1, so there are at most q − 1 factors of q in (q − 1)ppq−1f (q), and hence also in f (pq). Taking x = p, y = q gives f (pq)|(p − 1)qpq−1f (p) = (p − 1)qpq+p−2, and since there are at most q − 1 factors of q in f (pq), we get f (pq)|(p − 1)qq−1. Now, d(p − 1) ≤ p − 1 < p, and d(qq−1) = q, so d(f (pq)) ≤ d((p − 1)qq−1) ≤ d(p − 1)d(qq−1) < pq, which contradicts condition (a) for pq. Hence, f (p) = pp−1 for all primes p. Now let n be a positive integer, and let p be the smallest prime dividing n. Taking x = p, y = n p , we get f (n)|(p − 1) · ( n p )n−1 f (p). Now, since p is the smallest prime dividing n and d(f (n)) = n, the exponent of any prime dividing f (n) must be at least (p − 1). Suppose a prime power rk divides f (n) but not n. Then r doesn’t divide ( n p )n−1 f (p), so rk divides p − 1. But k ≥ p − 1, and so rk ≤ p − 1 ≤ k, which is impossible. So all primes dividing f (n) must divide n. In particular, it follows immediately that if n = pk is a prime power, then f (n) = pn−1. We claim that if n = pe1 1 · p e2 2 · · · pem m , then f (n) = p pe1 1 −1 1 · ppe2 2 −1 2 · · · pp em−1 m m . We proceed by induction on n. d(f (1)) = 1, so f (1) = 1. Now assume it is true for all numbers less than n. If n is a prime power, then we’ve already proven the claim. So assume n has at least 2 3 prime factors. Let r be a prime dividing f (n), and let p ̸= r be a prime dividing n. Taking x = n p , y = p, we get f (n)| ( n p − 1 ) pn−1f ( n p ) . We know r must divide n, so it doesn’t divide ( n p − 1) pn−1, and hence it divides f ( n p ). By our induction claim, the exponent of r dividing f (n) is bounded by rk − 1, where rk||n. Hence, f (n) divides ppe1 1 −1 1 · p pe2 2 −1 2 · · · ppem−1 m m . The claim now follows from the fact that d(f (n)) = n. It’s straightforward to check this f actually satisﬁes the two conditions. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
