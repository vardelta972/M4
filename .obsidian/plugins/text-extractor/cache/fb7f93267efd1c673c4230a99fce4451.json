(Lithuania team contest 2000, #3) Solve the equation √−3x2 + 18x + 37 + √−5x2 + 30x − 41 = √ x2 − 6x + 109. Solution: After setting t = (x − 3)2, the equation reduces to √64 − 3t + √4 − 5t = √t + 100. t = 0 is one solution, and the left-hand side is decreasing in t while the right-hand side is increasing in t. Therefore, t = 0 (and hence x = 3) is the unique solution. 2. (Ukraine 10th grade 2008, #2) Let ABCD be a parallelogram with ̸ BCD > 90◦. Extend line BC to K so that DK = DC, and extend line DC to L so that BL = BC. Let the bisectors of ̸ CDK and ̸ CBL meet at point Q. If ̸ BQD = α and KL = a, express the circumradius of triangle AKL in terms of a and α. Solution: ADLB and ADKB are isosceles trapezoids, so K, L lie on the circumcircle of △ABD. ̸ BAD = ̸ LCK = 180 ◦ −̸ BQD since BQ and QD are perpendicular to LC and CK. Therefore, ABLQKD is a cyclic hexagon. Now, ̸ LAK = ̸ LAQ + ̸ KAQ = ̸ LDQ + ̸ KBQ = 180 ◦ − 2α. Applying the extended sine law, we have the radius is a 2 sin 2α . 3. (Japan junior math olympiad 2008, #10) Consider a board consisting of 9 squares of length 1, arranged in 3 rows and 3 columns as in the ﬁgure below. Let us number squares as indicated in the ﬁgure. 1 2 3 8 4 7 6 5 Let A, B, C, D be points chosen from the interior (not on the boundary) of the square 1, 3, 5, 7, respectively. Denote by X the sum of the areas of the intersection of the quadrilateral ABCD with the squares 1, 3, 5, and 7. Denote also by Y the sum of the areas of the intersections of the quadrilateral ABCD with the squares 2, 4, 6, and 8. Prove that X < Y . Solution: Suppose that ABCD intersects the boundary of square i and square i + 1 at point Xi, and that Xi is distance xi from the central square. Then, the area of ABCD within square 2i is exactly x2i−1+x2i 2 , so Y = 1 2 ∑8 i=1 xi. Now let Yi and Zi denote the outer and inner corners of square i for i = 1, 3, 5, 7. Then, the area of ABCD within square 2i − 1 is less than the area of quadrilateral X2i−2Y2i−1X2i−1Z2i−1, which is exactly 1 − 1−x2i−2 2 − 1−x2i−1 2 = x2i−2+x2i−1 2 . Therefore, X < 1 2 ∑8 i=1 xi = Y . 4. (Lithuania team contest 2000, #10) A positive integer n is said to be reducible if there exist positive integers m and d such that n = m + 1 d + 1 + m + 2 d + 2 . How many reducible numbers are there from the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2000}? Solution: m+1 d+1 + m+2 d+2 = (m+1)(d+2)+(m+2)(d+1) (d+1)(d+2) . For this to be an integer, we must have (m + 2)(d + 1) ≡ 0 (mod d + 2) =⇒ m + 2 ≡ 0 (mod d + 2) and (m + 1)(d + 2) ≡ 0 (mod d + 1) =⇒ m + 1 ≡ 1 0 (mod d + 1). Equivalently m ≡ d (mod lcm(d + 1, d + 2)). Since d + 1 and d + 2 are relatively prime, it follows that m = C(d + 1)(d + 2) + d, which gives n = C(2d + 3) + 2. Clearly, n = 2 can be expressed in this form but n = 1 cannot. For n > 2, the condition is equivalent to requiring that n − 2 have an odd divisor greater than 3. This fails only for n = 2 + 2k and n = 2 + 3 · 2 k. Altogether, that gives only 1 + 11 + 10 numbers that are not reducible, so the answer is 1978. 5. (Japan math olympiad ﬁnal 2008, #5) Does there exist a positive integer n satisfying the following condition? Condition: For an arbitrary rational number r, there exists an integer b and nonzero integers a1, a2, . . . , an such that r = b + 1 a1 + . . . + 1 an . Solution: No. We prove by induction on n that for each integer n and rational number q, there exists a rational number q′ < q such that no number in the interval (q′, q) can be expressed in this form. For n = 1, the claim is trivial. Now suppose the claim has been proven for n − 1. Fix an arbitrary q, and let f denote the fractional part of q (except if q is an integer, we take f = 1). Then, if we are to express some number y ∈ (q − f 2 , q) in the required form, we must have some 1 ai ≥ f 2 =⇒ ai ≤ 2 f . This leaves only a ﬁnite number of options for ai. Once ai is ﬁxed to some value u, we have reduced the problem to the n − 1 case, so by the inductive hypothesis, there exists q′ u such that no number in (q′ u, q) can be achieved, given that ai = u. The inductive step follows from taking q′ = max(q − f 2 , maxu q′ u). 2 2 Mock IMO Day 1 1. (Ukraine 11th grade 2008, #3) A point O is placed inside triangle ABC so that ̸ BOC = 90 ◦ and ̸ BAO = ̸ BCO. If M and N are the midpoints of the segments AC and BC respectively, prove that ̸ OM N = 90 ◦. Solution: Let P be the midpoint of OC. N is the circumcenter of right triangle BOC since it is the midpoint of the hypoteneuse, so ̸ BCO = ̸ N CP = ̸ N OP . Since M P is parallel to AO and M N is parallel to AB, we have ̸ N M P = ̸ BAO = ̸ BCO = ̸ N OP . Therefore, OM P N is a cyclic quadrilateral and ̸ OM N = ̸ OP N = ̸ BOC = 90 ◦. 2. (Japan math olympiad ﬁnal 2008, #4) Determine all real-valued functions f deﬁned on the real line, which satisfy f (x + y)f (f (x) − y) = xf (x) − yf (y). for all real numbers x and y. Solution: Taking y = 0 gives f (x)f (f (x)) = xf (x), so f (x) = 0 or f (f (x)) = x. Taking y = f (x) gives f (x + f (x))f (0) = xf (x) − f (x)f (f (x)) = 0. Taking y = −x gives 0 = f (0)f (f (x) + x) = xf (x) + xf (−x), which implies f (−x) = −f (x) for x ̸= 0. Now suppose f (x) = 0 and y, f (y) ̸= 0. Then, f (x+y)f (−y) = −yf (y) = yf (−y) =⇒ f (x+y) = y. In particular, f (x + y) ̸= 0 so f (f (x + y)) = x + y, and f (y) = x + y (*). If x ̸= 0, then f (−x) = 0 also and the same argument implies f (y) = −x + y, which is impossible. Therefore, if f (x) = 0 for some x ̸= 0, then f (x) = 0 for all x ̸= 0. It is easy to check any such function is a solution. Otherwise, f (x) ̸= 0 for all x = 0. Then f (0)f (f (0)) = 0 implies f (0) = 0, and (*) implies that in this case, f (y) = y for all y. This, in turn, is easily checked to be a valid solution. 3. (Bulgarian math olympiad team selection test 2008, #1) The number -1 is written at k of the vertices of a regular 2009-gon and the number 1 is written at the remaining 2009 − k vertices. A vertex is said to be good if, starting from this vertex and running around the polygon in either direction, every partial sum is positive. Find the largest number k such that there exists a good vertex for any arrangement of the 1’s and -1’s. Solution: Let p be the number of positive vertices, and n the number of negative vertices. If p ≤ 2n, put all positive vertices together. Then, any positive vertex can reach the n negative vertices after going through at most n positive vertices, so it is bad. Conversely, if p > 2n, then for each positive vertex, there must exist a minimal interval with it as an endpoint and sum 0. The opposite endpoint is negative, and each negative point is endpoints to two such intervals. Therefore, some vertex is good. k = 669. 3 3 Mock IMO Day 2 4. (IMO short list 2008, N1) Let n be a positive integer and let p be a prime number. Prove that if a, b, c are integers (not necessarily positive) satisfying the following equations a n + pb = bn + pc = c n + pa, then a = b = c. Solution: If two values are equal, the claim is trivial. Otherwise, multiply the equations an − b n = p(c − b) to get a n−b n a−b · bn−c n b−c · cn−an c−a = −p 3. If n is odd, a n − b n has the same sign as a − b, and the left-hand side is positive, which is impossible. Otherwise, two of a, b, c are the same parity, and in this case, the corresponding a n−bn a−b term is even, which implies p = 2. The original equation now implies a, b, c must all be the same parity, and hence an−b n a−b is even (as above). Since the product of these terms is −23, each such term is ±2. Comparing with the original equation, we have a − b = ±(b − c). If a − b, b − c, c − a are all the same sign, they are all equal, but their sum is 0 so then a = b = c. Otherwise, a − b = c − b or some shift thereof, and two values are equal. Either way, we have a contradiction. 5. (Ukraine 11th grade 2008, #7) Prove that the inequality x √x2 + y + z + y √ x + y2 + z + z √x + y + z2 ≤ √3 holds for any non-negative real numbers x, y, z satisfying x2 + y2 + z2 = 3. Solution: The given condition implies x+y +z ≤ x2 +y2 +z2 = 3, and hence x(1+y+z)+y(1+z+x)+z(1+x+y) (x+y+z)2 ≤ 1. By Cauchy-Schwarz, 1 x2+y+z ≤ 1+y+z (x+y+z)2 , so therefore, x x2+y+z + y x+y2+z + z x+y+z2 ≤ 1. The result now follows from x + y + z ≤ 3 and Cauchy-Schwarz. 6. (Romanian master in mathematics 2008, #4) Prove that from among any (n + 1)2 points inside a square of side length positive integer n, one can pick three determining a triangle with area at most 1 2 . Solution: If three of the N = (n + 1)2 points are collinear, the problem is trivial. Otherwise, let H denote the convex hull of the points, and let k denote the number of points on the boundary of H. Then, H has area at most n2 and perimeter at most 4n. We ﬁrst triangulate H. This uses exactly 2(N − 1) − k triangles, so one triangle has area at most n2 2(N −1)−k . Next, there must exist consecutive sides of H with lengths a, b such that a+b 2 ≤ 4n k . The area of the triangle with these two sides is at most 1 2 · ab ≤ 1 2 · ( a+b 2 )2 ≤ 8n2 k2 . Therefore, some triangle has area at most X = min ( n2 2(N −1)−k , 8n2 k2 ). The ﬁrst term is increasing in k, and the second is decreasing, so X is maximized when n2 2(N −1)−k = 8n2 k2 , or equivalently k = 4n. In this case, X = 1 2 , and the result follows. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
