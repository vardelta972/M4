Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Given circles ω1 and ω2 intersecting at points X and Y , let ℓ1 be a line through the center of ω1 intersecting ω2 at points P and Q and let ℓ2 be a line through the center of ω2 intersecting ω1 at points R and S. Prove that if P , Q, R, and S lie on a circle then the center of this circle lies on line XY . 2. Let n be a positive integer. Determine the size of the largest subset of {−n, −n + 1, . . . , n − 1, n} which does not contain three elements a, b, c (not necessarily distinct) satisfying a + b + c = 0. 3. We define a chessboard polygon to be a simple polygon whose sides are situated along lines of the form x = a or y = b, where a and b are integers. These lines divide the interior into unit squares, which are shaded alternately grey and white so that adjacent squares have different colors. To tile a chessboard polygon by dominoes is to exactly cover the polygon by non-overlapping 1 × 2 rectangles. Finally, a tasteful tiling is one which avoids the two configurations of dominoes and colors shown on the left below. Two tilings of a 3 × 4 rectangle are shown; the first one is tasteful, while the second is not, due to the vertical dominoes in the upper right corner. Distasteful tilings Prove that (a) if a chessboard polygon can be tiled by dominoes, then it can be done so tastefully, and (b) such a tasteful tiling is unique. 4. For n ≥ 2, let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive real numbers such that (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) ( 1 a1 + 1 a2 + · · · + 1 an ) ≤ (n + 1 2 )2 . Prove that max (a1, . . . , an) ≤ 4 min (a1, . . . , an). 5. Trapezoid ABCD, with AB ∥ CD, is inscribed in circle ω and point G lies inside triangle BCD. Rays AG and BG meet ω again at points P and Q, respectively. Let the line through G parallel to AB intersect BD and BC at points R and S, respectively. Prove that quadrilateral P QRS is cyclic if and only if BG bisects ∠CBD. 6. Let s1, s2, s3, . . . be an infinite, nonconstant sequence of rational numbers, meaning it is not the case that s1 = s2 = s3 = . . . .

Problem statement Given circles ω1 and ω2 intersecting at points X and Y , let ℓ1 be a line through the center of ω1 intersecting ω2 at points P and Q and let ℓ2 be a line through the center of ω2 intersecting ω1 at points R and S. Prove that if P , Q, R, and S lie on a circle then the center of this circle lies on line XY . Let r1, r2, r3 denote the circumradii of ω1, ω2, and ω3, respectively. O1 O2 O X Y P Q R S We wish to show that O3 lies on the radical axis of ω1 and ω2. Let us encode the conditions using power of a point. Because O1 is on the radical axis of ω2 and ω3, Powω2(O1) = Powω3(O1) =⇒ O1O2 2 − r2 2 = O1O2 3 − r2 3. Similarly, because O2 is on the radical axis of ω1 and ω3, we have Powω1(O2) = Powω3(O2) =⇒ O1O2 2 − r2 1 = O2O2 3 − r2 3. Subtracting the two gives (O1O2 2 − r2 2) − (O1O2 2 − r2 1) = (O1O2 3 − r2 3) − (O2O2 3 − r2 3) =⇒ r2 1 − r2 2 = O1O2 3 − O2O2 3 =⇒ O2O2 3 − r2 2 = O1O2 3 − r2 1 =⇒ Powω2(O3) = Powω1(O3) as desired. 3 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2009/2, proposed by Kiran Kedlaya, Tewordos Amdeberhan Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1485139. Problem statement Let n be a positive integer. Determine the size of the largest subset of {−n, −n + 1, . . . , n − 1, n} which does not contain three elements a, b, c (not necessarily distinct) satisfying a + b + c = 0. The answer is n with n even and n + 1 with n odd; the construction is to take all odd numbers. To prove this is maximal, it suffices to show it for n even; we do so by induction on even n ≥ 2 with the base case being trivial. Letting A be the subset, we consider three cases: (i) If |A ∩ {−n, −n + 1, n − 1, n}| ≤ 2, then by the hypothesis for n − 2 we are done. (ii) If both n ∈ A and −n ∈ A, then there can be at most n − 2 elements in A \\ {±n}, one from each of the pairs (1, n − 1), (2, n − 2), . . . and their negations. (iii) If n, n − 1, −n + 1 ∈ A and −n /∈ A, and at most n − 3 more can be added, one from each of (1, n − 2), (2, n − 3), . . . and (−2, −n + 2), (−3, −n + 3), . . . . (In particular −1 /∈ A. Analogous case for −A if n /∈ A.) Thus in all cases, |A| ≤ n as needed. Remark. A few examples of equality cases: • All odd numbers • All numbers with absolute value at least n/2 • For n even, the set {1, 2, . . . , n} This list isn’t exhaustive e.g. for n = 4, the set {−3, 2, 3, 4} achieves the optimum. 4 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2009/3, proposed by Sam Vandervelde Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1485321. Problem statement We define a chessboard polygon to be a simple polygon whose sides are situated along lines of the form x = a or y = b, where a and b are integers. These lines divide the interior into unit squares, which are shaded alternately grey and white so that adjacent squares have different colors. To tile a chessboard polygon by dominoes is to exactly cover the polygon by non-overlapping 1 × 2 rectangles. Finally, a tasteful tiling is one which avoids the two configurations of dominoes and colors shown on the left below. Two tilings of a 3 × 4 rectangle are shown; the first one is tasteful, while the second is not, due to the vertical dominoes in the upper right corner. Distasteful tilings Prove that (a) if a chessboard polygon can be tiled by dominoes, then it can be done so tastefully, and (b) such a tasteful tiling is unique. ¶ Proof of (a) : This is easier, and by induction. Let P denote the chessboard polygon which can be tiled by dominoes. Consider a lower-left square s of the polygon, and WLOG is it white (other case similar). Then we have two cases: • If there exists a domino tiling of P where s is covered by a vertical domino, then delete this domino and apply induction on the rest of P. This additional domino will not cause any distasteful tilings. • Otherwise, assume s is covered by a horizontal domino in every tiling. Again delete this domino and apply induction on the rest of P. The resulting tasteful tiling should not have another horizontal domino adjacent to the one covering s, because otherwise we could have replaced that 2 × 2 square with two vertical dominoes to arrive in the first case. So this additional domino will not cause any distasteful tilings. Remark. The second case can actually arise, for example in the following picture. Thus one cannot just try to cover s with a vertical domino and claim the rest of P is tile-able. So the induction is not as easy as one might hope. One can phrase the solution algorithmically too, in the following way: any time we see a 5 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 distasteful tiling, we rotate it to avoid the bad pattern. The bottom-left corner eventually becomes stable, and an induction shows the termination of the algorithm. ¶ Proof of (b) : We now turn to proving uniqueness. Suppose for contradiction there are two distinct tasteful tilings. Overlaying the two tilings on top of each other induces several cycles of overlapping dominoes at positions where the tilings differ. Henceforth, it will be convenient to work with the lattice Z2, treating the squares as black/white points, and we do so. Let γ be any such cycle and let s denote a lower left point, and again WLOG it is black. Orient γ counterclockwise henceforth. Restrict attention to the lattice polygon Q enclosed by γ (we consider points of γ as part of Q). In one of the two tilings of (lattice points of) Q, the point s will be covered by a horizontal domino; in the other tiling s will be covered by a vertical domino. From now on we will focus only on the latter one. Observe that we now have a set of dominoes along γ, such that γ points from the white point to the black point within each domino. Now impose coordinates so that s = (0, 0). Consider the stair-case sequence of points p0 = s = (0, 0), p1 = (1, 0), p2 = (1, 1), p3 = (2, 1), and so on. By hypothesis, p0 is covered by a vertical domino. Then p1 must be covered by a horizontal domino, to avoid a distasteful tiling. Then if p2 is in Q, then it must be covered by a vertical domino to avoid a distasteful tiling, and so on. We may repeat this argument as long the points pi lie inside Q. (See figure below; the staircase sequence is highlighted by red halos.) s a b The curve γ by definition should cross y = x − 1 at the point b = (1, 0). Let a denote the first point of this sequence after p1 for which γ crosses y = x − 1 again. Now a is tiled by a vertical domino whose black point is to the right of ℓ. But the line segment ℓ cuts Q into two parts, and the orientation of γ has this path also entering from the right. This contradicts the fact that the orientation of γ points only from white to black within dominoes. This contradiction completes the proof. Remark. Note the problem is false if you allow holes (consider a 3 × 3 with the middle square deleted). 6 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2009/4, proposed by Titu Andreescu Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1485147. Problem statement For n ≥ 2, let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive real numbers such that (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) ( 1 a1 + 1 a2 + · · · + 1 an ) ≤ ( n + 1 2 )2 . Prove that max (a1, . . . , an) ≤ 4 min (a1, . . . , an). Assume a1 is the largest and a2 is the smallest. Let M = a1/a2. We wish to show M ≤ 4. In left-hand side of given, write as a2 + a1 + · · · + an. By Cauchy Schwarz, one obtains ( n + 1 2 )2 ≥ (a2 + a1 + a3 + · · · + an) ( 1 a1 + 1 a2 + 1 a3 + · · · + 1 an ) ≥ (√ a2 a1 + √ a1 a2 + 1 + · · · + 1)2 ≥ (√1/M + √M + (n − 2) )2 . Expanding and solving for M gives 1/4 ≤ M ≤ 4 as needed. 7 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2009/5, proposed by Zuming Feng Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1485200. Problem statement Trapezoid ABCD, with AB ∥ CD, is inscribed in circle ω and point G lies inside triangle BCD. Rays AG and BG meet ω again at points P and Q, respectively. Let the line through G parallel to AB intersect BD and BC at points R and S, respectively. Prove that quadrilateral P QRS is cyclic if and only if BG bisects ∠CBD. Perform an inversion around B with arbitrary radius, and denote the inverse of a point Z with Z∗. A B CD Q G R S P B R∗ S∗ G ∗ D∗ C ∗ Q ∗ A∗ P ∗ After inversion, we obtain a cyclic quadrilateral BS∗G∗R∗ and points C∗, D∗ on BS∗, BR∗, such that (BC∗D∗) is tangent to (BS∗G∗R∗) — in other words, so that C∗D∗ is parallel to S∗R∗. Point A∗ lies on line C∗D∗ so that A∗B is tangent to (BS∗G∗R∗). Points P ∗ and Q∗ are the intersections of (A∗BG∗) and BG∗ with line C∗D∗. Observe that P ∗Q∗R∗S∗ is a trapezoid, so it is cyclic if and only if it isosceles. Let X be the second intersection of line G∗P ∗ with (BS∗R∗). Because ∡Q ∗P ∗G∗ = ∡A∗BG∗ = ∡BXG∗ we find that BXS∗R∗ is an isosceles trapezoid. If G∗ is indeed the midpoint of the arc then everything is clear by symmetry now. Conversely, if P ∗R∗ = Q∗S∗ then that means P ∗Q∗R∗S∗ is a cyclic trapezoid, and hence that the perpendicular bisectors of P ∗Q∗ and R∗S∗ are the same. Hence B, X, P ∗, Q∗ are symmetric around this line. This forces G∗ to be the midpoint of arc R∗S∗ as desired. 8 USAMO 2009 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2009/6, proposed by Gabriel Carroll Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1485204. Problem statement Let s1, s2, s3, . . . be an infinite, nonconstant sequence of rational numbers, meaning it is not the case that s1 = s2 = s3 = . . . . Suppose that t1, t2, t3, . . . is also an infinite, nonconstant sequence of rational numbers with the property that (si − sj)(ti − tj) is an integer for all i and j. Prove that there exists a rational number r such that (si − sj)r and (ti − tj)/r are integers for all i and j. First we eliminate the silly edge case: Claim — For some i and j, we have (si − sj)(ti − tj) ̸= 0. Proof. Assume not. WLOG s1 ̸= s2, then t1 = t2. Now select i such that ti ̸= t1 = t2. Then either ti − s1 ̸= 0 or ti − s2 ̸= 0, contradiction. So, WLOG (by permutation) that n = (s1 − s2)(t1 − t2) ̸= 0. By shifting and scaling appropriately, we may assume s1 = t1 = 0, s2 = 1, t2 = n. Thus we deduce siti ∈ Z, sitj + sjti ∈ Z ∀i, j. Claim — For any index i, ti ∈ Z, si ∈ 1 n Z. Proof. We have siti ∈ Z and ti + nsi ∈ Z by problem condition. By looking at νp of this, we conclude nsi, ti ∈ Z (since if either as negative p-adic value, so does the other, and then siti /∈ Z). Last claim: Claim — If d = gcd t•, then dsi ∈ Z for all i. Proof. Consider a prime p | n, and let e = νp(tj). We will show νp(si) ≥ −e for any i. This is already true for i = j, so assume i ̸= j. Assume for contradiction νp(si) < −e. Then νp(ti) > e = νp(tk). Since νp(sk) ≥ −e we deduce νp(sitk) < νp(skti); so νp(sitk) ≥ 0 and νp(si) ≥ −e as desired. 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
