Two circles Γ and Σ, with centres O and O′, respectively, are such that O′ lies on Γ. Let A be a point on Σ and M the midpoint of the segment AO′. If B is a point on Σ diﬀerent from A such that AB is parallel to OM , show that the midpoint of AB lies on Γ. Solution: Let C be the reﬂection of O′ with re- spect to O. Then in triangle O′AC, the midpoints of the segments O′A and O′C are M and O, re- spectively. This implies AC is parallel to OM , and hence B lies on AC. Let the line AC inter- sect Γ again at N . Since O′C is a diameter of Γ it follows that ∠O′N C = 90 ◦. Since O′A = O′B, we can now conclude that N is the midpoint of the segment AB. 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial where a and b are real numbers. Suppose ⟨P (−1)2, P (0) 2, P (1) 2⟩ is an arithmetic progression of integers. Prove that a and b are integers. Solution: Observe that P (−1) = 1 − a + b, P (0) = b, P (1) = 1 + a + b. The given condition gives 2b 2 = (1 − a + b)2 + (1 + a + b) 2 = 2(1 + b)2 + 2a 2 = 2 + 4b + 2b2 + 2a 2. Hence a 2 + 2b + 1 = 0. Observe 1 + a2 + b2 + 2a + 2b + 2ab = (1 + a + b)2 ∈ Z. But 1, b 2, 2a 2 + 4b are all integers. Hence 4a + 4ab ∈ Z. This gives 16a 2(1 + b) 2 is an integer. But a 2 = −(2b + 1). Hence 16(2b + 1)(1 + b) 2 is an integer. But 16(2b + 1)(1 + b) 2 = 16(1 + 4b + 5b 2 + 2b 3). Hence 16b(4 + 2b 2) is an integer. If b = 0, then b is an integer. Otherwise, this shows that b is a rational number. Because b2 ∈ Z, it follows that b is an integer. Since a 2 = −(2b + 1), we get that a 2 is an integer. Now 4a(1 + b) ∈ Z. If b ̸= −1, then a is rational and hence a is an integer. If b = −1, then we see that P (−1) = −a, P (0) = b = −1 and P (1) = a. Hence a 2, 1, a 2 is an AP. This implies that a 2 = 1 and hence a = ±1. 3. Show that there are inﬁnitely many triples (x, y, z) of integers such that x3 + y4 = z31. Solution: Choose x = 2 4r and y = 2 3r. Then the left side is 2 12r+1. If we take z = 2 k, then we get 212r+1 = 2 31k. Thus it is suﬃcient to prove that the equation 12r + 1 = 31k has inﬁnitely many solutions in integers. Observe that (12 × 18) + 1 = 31 × 7. If we choose r = 31l + 18 and k = 12l + 7, we get 12(31l + 18) + 1 = 31(12l + 7), for all l. Choosing l ∈ N, we get inﬁnitely many r = 31l + 18 and k = 12l + 7 such that 12r + 1 = 31k. Going back we have inﬁnitely many (x, y, z) of integers satisfying the given equation. 4. Suppose 36 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? Solution: One can choose 3 objects out of 36 objects in (36 3 ) ways. Among these choices all would be together in 36 cases; exactly two will be together in 36 × 32 cases. Thus three objects can be chosen such that no two adjacent in (36 3 ) − 36 − (36 × 32) ways. Among these, furthrer, two objects will be diametrically opposite in 18 ways and the third would be on either semicircle in a non adjacent portion in 36 − 6 = 30 ways. Thus required number is (36 3 ) − 36 − (36 × 32) − (18 × 30) = 5412. 5. Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Γ and incentre I. Let the internal angle bisectors of ∠A, ∠B and ∠C meet Γ in A′, B′ and C ′ respectively. Let B′C ′ intersect AA′ in P and AC in Q, and let BB′ intersect AC in R. Suppose the quadrilateral P IRQ is a kite; that is, IP = IR and QP = QR. Prove that ABC is an equilateral triangle. Solution: We ﬁrst show that AA′ is perpendicular to B′C ′. Observe ∠C ′A′A = ∠C ′CA = ∠C/2; ∠A′C ′C = ∠A′AC = ∠A/2; and ∠CC ′B′ = ∠CBB′ = ∠B/2. Hence ∠C ′AP + ∠AC ′P = ∠C ′AB + ∠BAP + ∠AC ′P = ∠C 2 + ∠A 2 + ∠B 2 = 90 ◦. It follows that ∠AP C ′ = ∠A′P C ′ = 90 ◦. Thus ∠IP Q = 90 ◦. Since P IRQ is a kite, we observe that ∠IP R = ∠IRP and ∠QP R = ∠QRP . This implies that ∠IRQ = 90 ◦. Hence the kite IRQP is also a cyclic quadrilateral. Since ∠IRQ = 90 ◦, we see that BB′ ⊥ AC. Since BB′ is the bisector of ∠B, we conclude that ∠A = ∠C. We also observe that the triangles IRC and IP B′ are congruent triangles: they are similar, since ∠IRC = ∠IP B′ = 90 ◦ and ∠ICR = ∠C/2 = ∠IB′P (= ∠BCC ′); besides IR = IP . Therefore IC = IB′. But B′I = B′C. Thus IB′C is an equilateral triangle. This means ∠B′IC = 60 ◦ and hence ∠ICR = 30 ◦. Therefore ∠C/2 = 30◦. Hence ∠A = ∠C = 60 ◦. It follows that ABC is equilateral. 6. Show that there are inﬁnitely many positive real numbers a which are not integers such that a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) 2 Solution: We show that for each integer n ≥ 0, the interval (n, n + 1) contains a such that a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. Put a = n + f , where 0 < f < 1. Then (n + f )(n − 2f ) must be an integer. This means 2f 2 + nf must be an integer. Since 0 < f < 1, we must have 0 < 2f 2 + nf < 2 + n. Hence 2f 2 + nf ∈ {1, 2, 3, . . . , n + 1}. Taking 2f 2 + nf = 1, we get a quadratic equation: 2f 2 + nf − 1 = 0. Hence f = −n + √n2 + 8 4 , and a = n + −n + √n2 + 8 4 . Thus we see that each a in the set { n + −n + √n2 + 8 4 : n ∈ N } is a real number, which is not an integer, such that a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. Remark: Each interval (n, n + 1) contains n + 1 such numbers, for n ≥ 0, n an integer. ———-000———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
