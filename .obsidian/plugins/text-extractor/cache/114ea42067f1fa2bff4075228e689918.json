Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a2 + b2 + c2 + (a + b + c)2 ≤ 4. Prove that ab + 1 (a + b)2 + bc + 1 (b + c)2 + ca + 1 (c + a)2 ≥ 3. 2. An integer is assigned to each vertex of a regular pentagon so that the sum of the five integers is 2011.

(The amount m and the vertices chosen can vary from turn to turn.)

Problem statement Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a2 + b2 + c2 + (a + b + c)2 ≤ 4. Prove that ab + 1 (a + b)2 + bc + 1 (b + c)2 + ca + 1 (c + a)2 ≥ 3. The condition becomes 2 ≥ a2 + b2 + c2 + ab + bc + ca. Therefore, ∑ cyc 2ab + 2 (a + b)2 ≥ ∑ cyc 2ab + (a2 + b2 + c2 + ab + bc + ca) (a + b)2 = ∑ cyc (a + b)2 + (c + a)(c + b) (a + b)2 = 3 + ∑ cyc (c + a)(c + b) (a + b)2 ≥ 3 + 3 3 v u u √ ∏ cyc (c + a)(c + b) (a + b)2 = 3 + 3 = 6 with the last line by AM-GM. This completes the proof. 3 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2011/2, proposed by Sam Vandervelde Available online at https://aops.com/community/p2254765. Problem statement An integer is assigned to each vertex of a regular pentagon so that the sum of the five integers is 2011. A turn of a solitaire game consists of subtracting an integer m from each of the integers at two neighboring vertices and adding 2m to the opposite vertex, which is not adjacent to either of the first two vertices. (The amount m and the vertices chosen can vary from turn to turn.) The game is won at a certain vertex if, after some number of turns, that vertex has the number 2011 and the other four vertices have the number 0. Prove that for any choice of the initial integers, there is exactly one vertex at which the game can be won. Call the vertices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 in order. First, notice that the quantity N1 +2N2 +3N3 +4N4 (mod 5) is invariant, where Ni is the amount at vertex i. This immediately implies that at most one vertex can win, since in a winning situation all Ni are 0 except for one, which is 2011. Now we prove we can win on this unique vertex. Let ai, xi denote the number initially at i and xi denote ∑ m over all m where vertex i gains 2m. WLOG the possible vertex is 0, meaning a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 + 4a4 ≡ 0 (mod 5). Moreover we want 2011 = a0 + 2x0 − x2 − x3 0 = a1 + 2x1 − x3 − x4 0 = a2 + 2x2 − x4 − x0 0 = a3 + 2x3 − x0 − x1 0 = a4 + 2x4 − x1 − x2. We can ignore the first equation since its the sum of the other four. Moreover, we can WLOG shift x0 → 0 by shifting each xi by a fixed amount. Then x4 = 2x2 + a2 and x1 = 2x3 + a3. We let p and q denote x2 and x3 (noting that p, q ∈ Z =⇒ x1, x4 ∈ Z). Anyways the system now expands as 2p − 3q = 2a3 + a1 − a2 and 2q − 3p = 2a2 + a4 − a3 whence we have a two-var system, easy! We compute p − q = 1 5 [a1 − 3a2 + 3a3 − a4] . Since a1 − 3a2 + 3a3 − a4 ≡ a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 + 4a4 ≡ 0 (mod 5) it follows that p − q is an integer, hence so are p and q. This completes the proof. 4 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2011/3, proposed by Gabriel Carroll Available online at https://aops.com/community/p2254803. Problem statement In hexagon ABCDEF , which is nonconvex but not self-intersecting, no pair of opposite sides are parallel. The internal angles satisfy ∠A = 3∠D, ∠C = 3∠F , and ∠E = 3∠B. Furthermore AB = DE, BC = EF , and CD = F A. Prove that diagonals AD, BE, and CF are concurrent. We present the official solution. We say a hexagon is satisfying if it obeys the six conditions; note that intuitively we expect three degrees of freedom for satisfying hexagons. Main idea: Claim — In a satisfying hexagon, B, D, F are reflections of A, C, E across the sides of △ACE. (This claim looks plausible because every excellent hexagon is satisfying, and both configuration spaces are three-dimensional.) Call a hexagon of this shape “excellent”; in a excellent hexagon the diagonals clearly concur (at the orthocenter). Set β = ∠B, δ = ∠D, ϕ = ∠F . Now given a satisfying hexagon ABCDEF , construct a “phantom hexagon” A′B′C′D′E′F ′ with the same angles which is excellent (see figure). This is possible since β +δ +ϕ = 180◦. β δ φ β δ φ βφ δ A′ C ′ E′ B′ D′ F ′ AB C D E F Then it would suffice to prove that: Lemma A satisfying hexagon is uniquely determined by its angles up to similarity. That is, at most one hexagon (up to similarity) has angles β, δ, γ as above. Proof. Consider any two satisfying hexagons ABCDEF and A′B′C′D′E′F ′ (not neces- sarily as constructed above!) with the same angles. We show they are similar. To do this, consider the unit complex numbers in the directions −−→ BA and −−→ DE respectively and let ⃗x denote their sum. Define ⃗y, ⃗z similarly. Note that the condition AB ̸∥ DE implies ⃗x ̸= 0, and similarly. Then we have the identities AB · ⃗x + CD · ⃗y + EF · ⃗z = A′B′ · ⃗x + C′D′ · ⃗y + E′F ′ · ⃗z = 0. 5 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 So we would obtain AB : CD : EF = A′B′ : C′D′ : E′F ′ if only we could show that ⃗x, ⃗y, ⃗z are not multiples of each other (linear dependency reasons). This is a tiresome computation with arguments, but here it is. First note that none of β, δ, ϕ can be 90◦, since otherwise we get a pair of parallel sides. Now work in the complex plane, fix a reference such that ⃗A − ⃗B has argument 0, and assume ABCDEF are labelled counterclockwise. Then • ⃗B − ⃗C has argument π − β • ⃗C − ⃗D has argument −(β + 3ϕ) • ⃗D − ⃗E has argument π − (β + 3ϕ + δ) • ⃗E − ⃗F has argument −(4β + 3ϕ + δ) So the argument of ⃗x has argument π−(β+3ϕ+δ) 2 (mod π). The argument of ⃗y has argument π−(5β+3ϕ+δ) 2 (mod π). Their difference is 2β (mod π), and since β ̸= 90◦, it follows that ⃗x and ⃗y are not multiples of each other; the other cases are similar. Then the lemma implies ABCDEF ∼ A′B′C′D′E′F and we’re done. Remark. This problem turned out to be known already. It appears in this reference: Nikolai Beluhov, Matematika, 2008, issue 6, problem 3. It was reprinted as Kvant, 2009, issue 2, problem M2130; the reprint is available at http: //kvant.ras.ru/pdf/2009/2009-02.pdf. Remark. The vector perspective also shows the condition about parallel sides cannot be dropped. Here is a counterexample from Ryan Kim in the event that it is. A C0 E B0 D0 F CB D By adjusting the figure above so that the triangles are right isosceles (instead of just right), one also finds an example of a hexagon which is satisfying and whose diagonals are concurrent, but which is not excellent. 6 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2011/4, proposed by Sam Vandervelde Available online at https://aops.com/community/p2254810. Problem statement Consider the assertion that for each positive integer n ≥ 2, the remainder upon dividing 22n by 2n − 1 is a power of 4. Either prove the assertion or find (with proof) a counterexample. We claim n = 25 is a counterexample. Since 225 ≡ 20 (mod 225 − 1), we have 2 225 ≡ 2 225 mod 25 ≡ 2 7 mod 225 − 1 and the right-hand side is actually the remainder, since 0 < 27 < 225. But 27 is not a power of 4. Remark. Really, the problem is just equivalent for asking 2 n to have odd remainder when divided by n. 7 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2011/5, proposed by Zuming Feng, Delong Meng Available online at https://aops.com/community/p2254841. Problem statement Let P be a point inside convex quadrilateral ABCD. Points Q1 and Q2 are located within ABCD such that ∠Q1BC = ∠ABP, ∠Q1CB = ∠DCP, ∠Q2AD = ∠BAP, ∠Q2DA = ∠CDP. Prove that Q1Q2 ∥ AB if and only if Q1Q2 ∥ CD. If AB ∥ CD there is nothing to prove. Otherwise let X = AB ∩ CD. Then the Q1 and Q2 are the isogonal conjugates of P with respect to triangles XBC and XAD. Thus X, Q1, Q2 are collinear, on the isogonal of XP with respect to ∠DXA = ∠CXB. 8 USAMO 2011 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2011/6, proposed by Sid Graham Available online at https://aops.com/community/p2254871. Problem statement Let A be a set with |A| = 225, meaning that A has 225 elements. Suppose further that there are eleven subsets A1, . . . , A11 of A such that |Ai| = 45 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 11 and |Ai ∩ Aj| = 9 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 11. Prove that |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ . . . ∪ A11| ≥ 165, and give an example for which equality holds. Ignore the 225 — it is irrelevant. Denote the elements of A1 ∪ · · · ∪ A11 by a1, . . . , an, and suppose that ai appears xi times among Ai for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n (so 1 ≤ xi ≤ 11). Then we have 11∑ i=1 xi = 11∑ i=1 |Ai| = 45 · 11 and 11∑ i=1 (xi 2 ) = ∑ 1≤i<j≤11 |Ai ∩ Aj| = ( 11 2 ) · 9. Therefore, we deduce that ∑ xi = 495 and ∑ i x2 i = 1485. Now, by Cauchy Schwarz n (∑ i x2 i ) ≥ (∑ xi)2 which implies n ≥ 4952 1485 = 165. Equality occurs if we let A consist of the 165 three-element subsets of {1, . . . , 11} (plus 60 of your favorite reptiles if you really insist |A| = 225). Then we let Ai denote those subsets containing i, of which there are (10 2 ) = 45, and so that |Ai ∩ Aj| = (9 1 ) = 9. 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
