Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABC be a triangle. Let B′ denote the reﬂection of B in the internal angle bisector ℓ of ∠A. Show that the circumcentre of the triangle CB′I lies on the line ℓ, where I is the incentre of ABC. 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial where a is real and b is rational. Suppose P (0) 2, P (1) 2, P (2) 2 are integers. Prove that a and b are integers. 3. Find all integers a, b, c such that a 2 = bc + 4, b 2 = ca + 4. 4. Suppose 40 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? 5. Two circles Γ and Σ intersect at two distinct points A and B. A line through B intersects Γ and Σ again at C and D, respectively. Suppose that CA = CD. Show that the centre of Σ lies on Γ. 6. How many integers m satisfy both the following properties: (i) 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000; (ii) [√m ] = [√m + 125] ? (Here [x] denotes the largest integer not exceeding x, for any real number x.) ———-0000———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
