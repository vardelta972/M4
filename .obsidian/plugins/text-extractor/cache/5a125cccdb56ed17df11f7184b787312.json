{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/OlympiadQPs/Miscellaneous/Olympiad Dark Arts - Adam Goucher/Chp12 Diophantines.pdf","text":"Diophantine equations So far, we have considered solutions to equations over the real and complex numbers. This chapter instead focuses on solutions over the integers, natural and rational numbers. There is no algorithm for solving a generic Diophantine equation, which is why they can be very difficult to solve. In fact, many open problems such as the Riemann hypothesis can be embedded in questions about Turing machines, which can in turn be converted to hideously complicated Diophantine equations. Even proving the non-existence of positive integer solutions to the innocuous-looking equation xn \u0000 yn \u0000 zn \u0000n \u0000 3\u0000 (Fermat’s last theorem) occupied mathematicians for three centuries before finally being settled by Andrew Wiles. We will adopt a geometric approach to the problem, locating points in \u0000n, \u0000n and \u0000n lying on some particular curve. The simplest curve is a straight line (or plane, or hyperplane), corresponding to a linear Diophantine equation. Linear Diophantine equations are easy. Let’s consider the example 3 x \u0000 5 y \u0000 1. \u00004 \u00002 2 4 \u00004 \u00002 2 4 We can see that this has integer solutions, such as \u0000x, y\u0000 \u0000 \u00002, \u00001\u0000. In general, any linear Diophantine equation with coprime coefficients has infinitely many solutions in the integers, which can be found using the Chinese remainder theorem. If the coefficients are not coprime, such as 6 x \u0000 4 y \u0000 5, there may be (as in this case) no solutions. If there are no solutions, a simple proof exists using modular arithmetic. \u0000 A point \u0000x, y\u0000 is rational if and only if both x and y are rational. 1. Let * be a conic with rational coefficients, and let A be a rational point on *. If B is another point on *, show that B is rational if and only if A B has rational gradient. This theorem enables us to find all integer solutions to a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2, known as Pythagorean triples as they correspond to right-angled triangles with integer side lengths such as the famous \u00003, 4, 5\u0000 triangle used as a set square by the Ancient Egyptians. We can apply the geometrical concept of stereographic projection. 2. Show that all rational points on the unit circle can be obtained by inverting the rational line, as shown above. 3. Find all rational solutions to x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 1. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 4. Hence find all integer solutions to a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2, where gcd\u0000a, b, c\u0000 \u0000 1. [Elementary Pythagorean triples] 5. Show that there exists an infinite set S of points, no three of which are collinear, such that the distance between any two points is rational. Vieta jumping Suppose we are attempting to determine whether or not a certain quadratic equation in two variables has integer solutions. This can be visualised as a conic section, which is either an ellipse, parabola or hyperbola. As an ellipse is finite, we need only check a few pairs of values for integer solutions. To deal with the parabola, we can change the coordinate system by applying an affine transformation to convert it into a simpler equation. For the hyper- bola, however, it is necessary to adopt a more sophisticated technique such as Vieta jumping. For example, consider the equation a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000, where k is a fixed positive integer. 6. Find all integer solutions to the equation a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000 for the cases where k \u0000 1 and k \u0000 2. We will now consider the cases where k \u0000 3. 7. Show that there are no integer solutions to a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000 where k \u0000 3 and one of a, b is negative and the other is positive. 8. Sketch the curve * described by the equation x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 k\u0000x y \u0000 1\u0000, for k \u0000 3. \u00004 \u00002 2 4 \u00004 \u00002 2 4 9. Suppose that P \u0000 \u0000a, b\u0000 is a positive integer solution, and draw a vertical line through P. Show that it meets * again at another non-negative integer point, Q \u0000 \u0000a, c\u0000. Also, if b \u0000 a, then show that c \u0000 b. This is the principle behind Vieta jumping. We start with some (hypothetical) solution, then use it as the basis to construct a smaller solution until we reach a contradiction. Fermat employed this process of infinite descent to prove that there are no solutions in the positive integers to x4 \u0000 y4 \u0000 z4. Euler later refined the approach to apply to the equation x 3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 10. If a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000 (for some k \u0000 3) has a solution in the integers, then show that there is a solution where b \u0000 0. 11. Let a and b be positive integers. Prove that if a2\u0000b2 a b\u00001 is a positive integer, then it is a perfect square. [IMO 1988, Question 6] 12. Let a and b be positive integers. Prove that if a2\u0000b2\u00001 a b is a positive integer, then it equals 3. Pell equations Vieta jumping is primarily useful for proving the non-existence of solutions to hyperbolic equations. What if, instead, we want to find an infinite family of solutions? The idea is to create new solutions from old by some form of recurrence relation. Firstly, consider equations of the form x2 \u0000 n y2 \u0000 1, where n is not a perfect square. These are known as Pell equations, even though Pell had absolutely nothing to do with them. Basically, someone wanted to solve these equations, so told Euler that Pell was working on them. Consequently, Euler solved the equations, but attributed them to Pell. 13. Consider the complex numbers z \u0000 a \u0000 b \u0000n and w \u0000 c \u0000 d \u0000n . Prove that \u0000a2 \u0000 n b2\u0000 \u0000c2 \u0000 n d2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a c \u0000 b d n\u00002 \u0000 n\u0000a d \u0000 b c\u00002. [Brahmagupta’s identity] Brahmagupta’s identity can also be verified algebraically, so is true even when n is negative. This gives us the related identity \u0000a2 \u0000 n b2\u0000 \u0000c2 \u0000 n d2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a c \u0000 b d n\u00002 \u0000 n\u0000a d \u0000 b c\u00002. 14. Show that we can generate infinitely many solutions (in positive integers) to x2 \u0000 n y2 \u0000 1 (where n 6 \u0000) from one known solution. 15. Hence prove that there are infinitely many square triangular numbers. As x and y can be very large, we obtain very good rational approximations x y \u0000 n in this manner. These rational approximations can also be generated by analysing the continued fraction expansion of n , i.e. the unique expression of n of the following form: x \u0000 1 1 1 a4\u0000… \u0000a3 \u0000 a2 \u0000 a1 We write this as \u0000a1; a2, a3, a4, …\u0000. The sequences of all quadratic irrationals (solutions to quadratic equations in integer coefficients) are eventually periodic, and the converse also holds. For example, the sequence \u00001; 1, 1, 1, 1, …\u0000 corresponds to \u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 5 2 , and truncating the sequence produces the approximations Fn\u00001 Fn , where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number. Every Pell equation has infinitely many solutions. This is not true in general of the negative Pell equation, x2 \u0000 n y2 \u0000 1 (where n 6 \u0000); the negative Pell equation has solutions if the contin- ued fraction has an odd period length. The continued fraction for \u0000 is somewhat chaotic: \u00003; 7, 15, 1, 292, …\u0000. Truncating before the 292 yields the approximation \u00003; 7, 15, 1\u0000 \u0000 \u00003; 7, 16\u0000 \u0000 355 113 , which agrees with the actual value of \u0000 to six decimal places. \u0000 has a very regular continued fraction expansion of \u00002; 1, 2, 1, 1, 4, 1, 1, 6, 1, 1, 8, 1, …\u0000. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Sums of squares Brahmagupta’s identity, in the case where n \u0000 1, provides the identity \u0000a2 \u0000 b2\u0000 \u0000c2 \u0000 d2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a c \u0000 b d\u00002 \u0000 \u0000a d \u0000 b c\u00002 as a special case. In other words, if S is the set of numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two squares (of integers, or, more generally, of rationals), then S is closed under multiplication. Using Hamiltonian quaternions, we can produce an analogous formula for four squares: \u0000 \u0000a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2 \u0000 d2\u0000 \u0000e2 \u0000 f 2 \u0000 g2 \u0000 h2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a e \u0000 b f \u0000 c g \u0000 d h\u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000a f \u0000 b e \u0000 c h \u0000 d g\u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000a g \u0000 b h \u0000 c e \u0000 d f \u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000a h \u0000 b g \u0000 c f \u0000 d e\u0000 2 [Euler’s four-square identity] Using even more bizarre eight-dimensional numbers called octonions, there is a similar identity for eight squares. However, there are no identities beyond this, as doubling the number of dimensions causes the numbers to lose their useful properties. Quaternions are non-commutative, i.e. x y ! y x in general. Octonions are even worse, since they also lose associativity: x\u0000y z\u0000 ! \u0000x y\u0000 z. Beyond this, the numbers have no useful properties remaining, and the 2n-square identity breaks down. It is interesting to see when an integer can be expressed as the sum of n squares of integers. Clearly, if N can be expressed as the sum of squares of n integers, then it can also be expressed as the sum of squares of n \u0000 1 integers, as we can set one of those equal to zero. This gives a nested hierarchy: \u0000 A positive integer N can be expressed as the sum of one square if and only if it is a perfect square, i.e. N \u0000 a2 for some a \u0000 \u0000. [Trivial one-square theorem] \u0000 A positive integer N can be expressed as the sum of two squares if and only if it can be expressed as N \u0000 a2 2k \u0000 p1 p2 … pn\u0000, where each pi is a prime congruent to 1 (modulo 4) and a and k are non-negative integers. [Fermat’s Christmas theorem] \u0000 A positive integer N can be expressed as the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form 4k \u00008 m \u0000 7\u0000. [Legendre’s three-square theorem] \u0000 Any positive integer can be expressed as the sum of four squares. [Lagrange’s four-square theorem] 16. Generalise each of the above theorems to determine when a rational number is expressible as the sum of one, two, three or four squares of rationals. Sam Cappleman-Lynes technique Consider the Diophantine equation x3 \u0000 y6 \u0000 z7. If we have a solution to the equation a3 \u0000 b6 \u0000 c (which is trivial), then we can multiply all terms by c6 to obtain a3 c6 \u0000 b6 c6 \u0000 c7, which is a solution to the original equation. This enables us to create infinitely many distinct solutions in this manner. This idea, known as the Sam Cappleman-Lynes technique, is applicable in many problems. 17. Show that there are infinitely many solutions to x4 \u0000 y6 \u0000 z10 in the positive integers. More generally, if a, b, c are pairwise coprime, then xa k \u0000 yb k \u0000 zc k has infinitely many solutions in the positive integers when k \u0000 1 or k \u0000 2. A consequence of Fermat’s last theorem is that there are no solutions for k \u0000 3. 18. Let A be the set of all integers of the form a2 \u0000 13 b2, where a and b are integers and b is non-zero. Prove that there are infinitely many pairs of integers x, y such that x13 \u0000 y13 \u0000 A but x \u0000 y 6 A. [Mongolian TST] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 19. Determine whether there exists a set S of 2012 positive integers such that the sum of elements in each subset of S is a non-trivial power of an integer. [IMO 1992 shortlist] A large proportion of the problems solved using the Sam Cappleman-Lynes technique reduce to this (very general) theorem, which is proved first by applying linear algebra to the simultaneous equations followed by a similar approach to the last question. \u0000 Suppose we have a system of m equations in n variables \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000 of the following form, where m \u0000 n: \u0000 r\u00001,1\u0000 x1a1 \u0000 r\u00001,2\u0000 x2a2 \u0000 … \u0000 r\u00001,n\u0000 xnan \u0000 0; \u0000 r\u00002,1\u0000 x1a1 \u0000 r\u00002,2\u0000 x2a2 \u0000 … \u0000 r\u00002,n\u0000 xnan \u0000 0; \u0000 … \u0000 r\u0000m,1\u0000 x1a1 \u0000 r\u0000m,2\u0000 x2a2 \u0000 … \u0000 r\u0000m,n\u0000 xnan \u0000 0. Suppose that the following conditions are also true: \u0000 All of the coefficients, r\u0000i, j\u0000, are rational (not necessarily all non-zero); \u0000 All of the exponents, ai, are positive integers; \u0000 det r\u00001,1\u0000 r\u00001,2\u0000 \u0000 r\u00001,m\u0000 r\u00002,1\u0000 r\u00002,2\u0000 \u0000 r\u00002,m\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 r\u0000m,1\u0000 r\u0000m,2\u0000 \u0000 r\u0000m,m\u0000 ! 0; \u0000 For all i \u0000 m and i \u0000 j \u0000 n, ai is coprime with a j; \u0000 There is at least one solution in the positive real numbers. In that case, there are infinitely many solutions in the positive integers. [Generalised Sam Cappleman-Lynes theorem] The invertibility of the matrix enables us to apply elementary row operations to reduce it to a diagonal matrix in a process known as Gauss-Jordan manipulation. We then have m equations of the form xiai \u0000 q\u0000i,m\u00001\u0000 xm\u00001am\u00001 \u0000 q\u0000i,m\u00002\u0000 xm\u00002am\u00002 \u0000 … \u0000 q\u0000i,n\u0000 xnan (one equation for each 1 \u0000 i \u0000 m), and a real solution to the equations. This is a linear equation in xiai (for all 1 \u0000 i \u0000 n), so can be represented by a \u0000n \u0000 m\u0000-dimensional hyperplane in n-dimensional space (which passes through the origin, like a projective \u0000n \u0000 m \u0000 1\u0000-hyperplane). The single real solution means that this hyperplane intersects the positive quadrant, so we can set initial rational values for each of the free variables \u0000xm\u00001, xm\u00002, …, xn\u0000. This forces every xiai to be positive and rational. We then apply the Sam Cappleman-Lynes technique to the equations, relying on the coprimality of various exponents. After all variables have been rationalised, we multiply out by a large power of the lowest common multiple of the denominators of the variables, turning them into integer solutions. Elliptic curves 20. Let * be a non-singular cubic curve with integer coefficients. Suppose we have a line \u0000 which meets * at three points, A, B and C. Prove that if A and B are rational, then C is also rational. For example, the curve y2 \u0000 x3 \u0000 4 x \u0000 1 has rational points \u00000, 1\u0000 and \u00004, 7\u0000. We then draw the line through the two points, namely y \u0000 3 x \u0000 1. This intersects the curve at a third point, which is the solution of the cubic equation \u0000 3 2 x \u0000 1\u0000 2 \u0000 x3 \u0000 4 x \u0000 1, which simplifies to x3 \u0000 9 4 x2 \u0000 7 x \u0000 0. We can factorise this, as we already know two of the roots, obtaining x\u0000x \u0000 4\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 7 4 \u0000 \u0000 0. This gives us a third rational point on the elliptic curve, namely \u0000\u0000 7 4 , \u0000 13 8 \u0000. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u00002 2 4 \u00002 2 4 6 8 One of the great unsolved problems in mathematics, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture, is concerned with counting the number of integer points on an elliptic curve modulo p. Elliptic curves also featured prominently in Andrew Wiles’ proof of the Tanayama-Shimura conjecture and Fermat’s last theorem. Specifically, Wiles showed that every elliptic curve could be associated with a ‘modular form’, a complex function with the same hyperbolic symmetries as the Ford circles. Even the simplest, most elementary proof of Poncelet’s porism involves elliptic curves. We define a binary operation \u0000 on the points on the cubic curve, such that A \u0000 B \u0000 C \u0000 0 for any three collinear points A, B, C \u0000 *. In other words, C \u0000 \u0000\u0000A \u0000 B\u0000. Let O \u0000 0 be one of the points of inflection, so the line passing through C and O meets * again at C ' \u0000 A \u0000 B. It is trivially obvious that this operation is commutative, but proving associativity is a little more difficult. 21. Let X , Y , Z be three non-collinear points on *. Show that \u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000 \u0000 Z \u0000 X \u0000 \u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000, where addition is defined as in the last paragraph. [Associativity of elliptic curve operation] After proving associativity, parentheses can be omitted from expressions without ambiguity. For example, we can refer to the last expression simply as X \u0000 Y \u0000 Z. Addition of elements forms a group operation. We can then multiply by an integer n, by defining n X \u0000 X \u0000 X \u0000 … \u0000 X . It is difficult to compute n from the points n X and X , so can form the basis of a cryptosystem similar to RSA using the group \u0000*, \u0000\u0000 instead of \u0000\u0000 p q, \u0000\u0000. Elliptic curve cryptography is considered to be more secure than RSA. Again, it is susceptible to attacks from quantum computers. 22. Let A, B, C be three collinear points on *. If A and B are both points of inflection, then show that C is also a point of inflection. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 In the above diagram, a line is drawn through the three real points of inflection of a cubic curve. A general cubic curve on the complex projective plane has nine points of inflection lying on twelve lines in what is known as the Hesse configuration. It is a remarkable fact that this cannot be embedded in the real projective plane due to the Sylvester-Gallai theorem: if there is a finite set S of points such that no line contains exactly two points, then all points are collinear. Hence, a cubic curve has at most three real points of inflection. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. Clearly, if A B has irrational gradient, then A is the only rational point on *. If A B has rational gradient, then we can express it as a linear equation in rational coefficients. By solving this simultaneously with the equation for *, we obtain a quadratic equation in rational coefficients for x (the abscissa). As one root of this (the coordinates of A) is rational, then the other root must also be. Repeating this process for y (the ordinate), it is evident that B \u0000 \u00002. 2. Inverting about a rational point A on the unit circle transforms the circle into a line by stereographic projection. All lines with rational slopes through A clearly correspond to the entire set of rational points on the real line. 3. This is the three-dimensional analogue of the problem. We want to transform a point O A on the horizontal plane into a vector O B on the unit sphere by inverting about a sphere with centre C \u0000 \u00000, 0, 1\u0000 and radius 2 . We have that C A and C B are parallel, and the product of their lengths is 2. Hence, this gives us the formula C B \u0000 2 C A C A 2 . If we let A have coordinates \u0000 p q , r q , 0\u0000, where p, q and r are coprime, then we obtain C B \u0000 2 \u0000 p q , r q ,\u00001\u0000 \u0000 p q \u0000 2\u0000\u0000 r q \u0000 2\u00001 . This simplifies to C B \u0000 2 \u0000 p q,r q,\u0000q2\u0000 p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 . Now, O B \u0000 O C \u0000 B C \u0000 \u00002 p q,2 r q, p2\u0000r2\u0000q2\u0000 p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 , giving us the complete set of solutions; x \u0000 2 p q p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 , y \u0000 2 r q p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 , z \u0000 p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 p2\u0000q2\u0000r2 , where p, q, r \u0000 \u0000, q \u0000 0 and gcd\u0000p, q, r\u0000 \u0000 1. 4. a and b cannot both be odd; assume without loss of generality that a is even. Hence, b is odd as otherwise a, b and c would all be even. Using the previous question (and setting r \u0000 0), the solutions to \u0000 a b \u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000 a c \u0000 2 \u0000 1 are a c \u0000 2 p q p2\u0000q2 and b c \u0000 p2\u0000q2 p2\u0000q2 . If p and q are both odd then c is even, so one of p and q must be even. Hence, p2 \u0000 q2 and p2 \u0000 q2 are coprime (by applying Euclid’s algorithm to obtain 2 p2 and 2 q2, which only share 2 as a common factor). This gives us the irreducible general solution; \u0000a, b, c\u0000 \u0000 \u00002 p q, p2 \u0000 q2, p2 \u0000 q2\u0000, where p and q are coprime integers. 5. Let A B be the base of a semicircle with unit radius. A point C on the curved edge of the semicircle belongs to S if and only if both A C and B C are rational. (The previous question guarantees infinitely many choices of C.) If we have two such points, C1 and C2, (such that A, C1, C2, B appear in that order) then C1 C2 \u0000 A B \u0000 C1 B\u0000C2 A \u0000 C1 A \u0000C2 B (by Ptolemy’s theorem), and thus C1 C2 is rational. 6. For k \u0000 2, the equation a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 2 a b \u0000 2 simplifies to the \u0000a \u0000 b\u00002 \u0000 2, which clearly has no integer solutions. For k \u0000 1, a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 1 \u0000 a b is an ellipse. As a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 2 a b, then a b \u0000 1. Also, a b \u0000 \u00001, since otherwise a2 \u0000 b2 would be negative. It is a simple matter to check all combinations of a, b \u0000 \u0000\u00001, 0, 1\u0000 and deduce that the solutions \u00000, 1\u0000, \u00001, 0\u0000, \u00000, \u00001\u0000, \u0000\u00001, 0\u0000, \u00001, 1\u0000 and \u0000\u00001, \u00001\u0000 are the only solutions. 7. If one of a, b is negative and the other is positive, then a b \u0000 0. Hence, a b \u0000 \u00001 and thus k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 0. However, a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000 is strictly positive. 8. If we apply the substitution z \u0000 x \u0000 y, w \u0000 x \u0000 y then we obtain a hyperbola in standard position. Hence, the original curve is a hyperbola with centre \u00000, 0\u0000 and an axis of symmetry y \u0000 x, which does not intersect the hyperbola on the real plane. 9. As a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 k\u0000a b \u0000 1\u0000, b is a root of the quadratic z2 \u0000 k a z \u0000 \u0000a2 \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 0. By Vieta’s formulas, we have b \u0000 c \u0000 k a, and thus c \u0000 k a \u0000 b. This is obviously an integer point. As b \u0000 a, P is on the upper branch of the hyperbola, so Q must be on the lower branch and therefore c \u0000 b. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 10. Assume that P \u0000 \u0000a, b) is a positive integer solution and that b \u0000 a. We can generate a smaller solution in the non-negative integers by choosing the other intersection point Q \u0000 \u0000a, c\u0000 of the line x \u0000 a and curve *. By reflecting in the line y \u0000 x, we obtain a solution P' \u0000 \u0000c, a\u0000, where a \u0000 c. This process will generate continually smaller solutions until one of the coordinates is zero. 11. Let a2\u0000b2 a b\u00001 \u0000 k. If k \u0000 2, then there are trivially no solutions. Otherwise, if k \u0000 3 and we have an integer solution \u0000a, b\u0000, we can generate a solution where b \u0000 0. So, there is a solution in the positive integers if and only if there is a value k such that a2 1 \u0000 k, which only occurs when k is a perfect square. 12. Consider the equation a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 1 \u0000 a b k. This can be algebraically manipulated to \u0000a \u0000 b\u00002 \u0000 1 \u0000 \u0000k \u0000 2\u0000 a b; hence, it is obvious that k \u0000 3. We now fix the value of k. As there are no solutions for a \u0000 0 or b \u0000 0, and every solution \u0000a, b\u0000 yields alternative solutions \u0000\u0000a, \u0000b\u0000 and \u0000b, a\u0000, the curve must be a hyperbola with centre \u00000, 0\u0000 and diagonal lines of symmetry. Moreover, the hyperbola is contained entirely within the first and third quadrants. Using Vieta jumping, we can get from a solution \u0000a, b\u0000 to \u0000b k \u0000 a, b\u0000. If \u0000a, b\u0000 lies to the right of the stationary point of the hyperbola, then this will generate a smaller (in terms of a \u0000 b) solution. We can then reflect in the line a \u0000 b and repeat the process until \u0000a, b\u0000 lies to the left of this stationary point and below (or on) the line a \u0000 b. By considering the discriminant of a2 \u0000 b k a \u0000 b2 \u0000 1 \u0000 0, the stationary point can be located as k k2\u00004 , 2 k2\u00004 . The only integer point lying to the left of this such that a \u0000 b is \u00001, 1\u0000, which clearly is only a solution when k \u0000 3. The graph below is the hyperbola for k \u0000 5. \u00002 \u00001 1 2 \u00002 \u00001 1 2 13. This is simply the equation z 2 w 2 \u0000 z w 2. 14. If we have two solutions (not necessarily distinct), \u0000a, b\u0000 and \u0000c, d\u0000, then a2 \u0000 n b2 \u0000 1 and c2 \u0000 n d2 \u0000 1. We can multiply them together and use Euler’s identity to obtain \u0000a c \u0000 b d n\u00002 \u0000 n\u0000a d \u0000 b c\u00002 \u0000 1, which is a strictly larger solution to the equation. Repeating the process from some initial solution \u0000b, a\u0000, we expand \u0000a2 \u0000 n b2\u0000 k using Euler’s identity recursively to obtain infinitely many solutions, one for each k \u0000 \u0000. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 15. For every triangular number T, 8 T \u0000 1 is square and the converse also holds. Hence, we want to solve the Pell equation x 2 \u0000 8 y2 \u0000 1. A preliminary solution is that 36 is both square and triangular, or 172 \u0000 8 \u0000 6 2 \u0000 1, from which we generate an infinitude. 16. Suppose we have a rational a b , where a and b are coprime. Squaring it results in a2 b2 , where a2 and b2 are still coprime. Hence, squares of rationals (or sums of one square) have both a square numerator and denominator when expressed in lowest terms. Suppose a \u0000 c2 d2 \u0000 e2 f 2 \u0000 c 2 f 2\u0000e2 d2 d2 f 2 is expressible as the sum of two rational squares. Then, it is expressible as a square of a rational multiplied by the sum of squares of two integers, therefore of the form N \u0000 t2 2k \u0000p1 p2 … pn\u0000, where each pi is a prime congruent to 1 (modulo 4), k is an integer and t is a non-negative rational. For sums of three squares of rationals, we can express it as a square of a rational multiplied by the sum of squares of three integers. Hence, it is something that cannot be expressed as 4k \u00008 m\u00007\u0000 t2 , where t is an odd integer, k is an integer and m is a non-negative integer. Any rational can be expressed as the sum of four squares of rationals. 17. We begin with a solution to a 2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2, i.e. a Pythagorean triple. Multiplying by a2 gives us a4 \u0000 b2 a2 \u0000 c2 a2. Then multiply by b4 a4, giving us b4 a8 \u0000 b6 a6 \u0000 c2 b4 a4. Finally, multiply by c48 b96 a96, resulting in c 48 b 100 a 104 \u0000 c48 b102 a102 \u0000 c50 b100 a100. This is clearly a solution to the equation x4 \u0000 y6 \u0000 z10. 18. If x \u0000 1 (mod 4) and y \u0000 2 (mod 4), then clearly x \u0000 y 6 A. All numbers of the form 13 b2 are in A, so if we can find infinitely many solutions satisfying x13 \u0000 y13 \u0000 13 b2 and the modulo-4 congruences then we are done. Start with a solution to w 13 \u0000 z13 \u0000 13 u, where w \u0000 1 and z \u0000 2 (mod 4). We note that u must be congruent to 1 (mod 4), as w 13 \u0000 1 and z13 \u0000 0. We multiply by u13 to give a solution \u0000u w\u000013 \u0000 \u0000u z\u000013 \u0000 13 \u0000u7\u0000 2, without changing the congruence class of any of the variables. We can start with w \u0000 13 \u0000 52 k and z \u0000 26, generating a solution for every k \u0000 \u0000. As these solutions can become arbitrarily large, there must be infinitely many. 19. For each 1 \u0000 j \u0000 22012 \u0000 1, consider the Diophantine equation of the form \u0000ai2 \u0000 b j p j, where ai (1 \u0000 i \u0000 2012) is included in the sum if and only if the ith binary digit of j is 1, and p j is the jth odd prime. We then apply the Sam Cappleman-Lynes technique to all equations simultaneously starting from the 22011 \u0000 1 equations of the form \u0000xi2 \u0000 y j. We initially set xi \u0000 i, and then multiply all equations by an appropriate power of y j2 p1 p2 … p j\u00001. This preserves the perfect-power property of all previous equations, and we can do this until the jth equation is also converted to the desired form. Repeating for all 22012 \u0000 1 equations gives us a solution to the original Diophantine equations. Then just take S \u0000 \u0000a12, a22, …, a22012\u000012\u0000. 20. The line passes through two rational points, so must have rational gradient. Hence, we can express y as a linear function of x with rational coefficients. Let a, b, c be the abscissae of A, B, C, respectively. The intersection of the cubic curve and the line is a cubic equation with rational coefficients and roots a, b, c. Due to Vieta's formulas, a \u0000 b \u0000 c is one of the rational coefficients. Hence, the rationality of a and b implies that of c. 21. Let 7 be the union of the lines \u0000Y , \u0000\u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000, X \u0000, \u0000\u0000\u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000, O, Y \u0000 Z\u0000 and \u0000Z, X \u0000 Y , \u0000\u0000\u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000 \u0000 Z\u0000\u0000. Similarly, let 8 be the union of the lines \u0000Y , \u0000\u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000, Z\u0000, \u0000\u0000\u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000, O, X \u0000 Y \u0000 and \u0000X , Y \u0000 Z, \u0000\u0000X \u0000 \u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000\u0000\u0000. The three cubic curves *, 7 and 8 intersect in eight points, namely \u0000X , Y , Z, \u0000\u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000, \u0000\u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000, X \u0000 Y , Y \u0000 Z, 0\u0000, so must intersect in the ninth point by Cayley-Bacharach. Hence, \u0000\u0000\u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000 \u0000 Z\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000X \u0000 \u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000\u0000, and thus \u0000X \u0000 Y \u0000 \u0000 Z \u0000 X \u0000 \u0000Y \u0000 Z\u0000. 22. The tangent lines passing through A and B do so with multiplicity 3, so we have 3 A \u0000 3 B \u0000 0. We then have 3 C \u0000 \u00003 \u0000A \u0000 B\u0000 \u0000 0, so C is also a point of inflection. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
