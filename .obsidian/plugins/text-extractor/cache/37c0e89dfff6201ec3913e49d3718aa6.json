For each positive integer n > 1 there is a prime p such that n < p < 2n. This theorem was veriﬁed for all numbers less than three million for Joseph Bertrand (1822-1900) and was proved by Pafnutii Chebyshev (1821-1894). 2 The ﬂoor function Deﬁnition 1. Let x be a real number such that n ≤ x < n + 1. Then we deﬁne ⌊x⌋ = n. This is called the ﬂoor function. ⌊x⌋ is also called the integer part of x with x − ⌊x⌋ being called the fractional part of x. If m − 1 < x ≤ m, we deﬁne ⌈x⌉ = m. This is called the ceiling function. In this tutorial we will make use of the ﬂoor function. Two useful properties are listed in the following propo- sitions. Proposition 2. 2⌊x⌋ ≤ ⌊2x⌋ ≤ 2⌊x⌋ + 1. Proof. Proving such inequalities is easy (and it resembles problems with the absolute value function). You have to represent x in the form x = ⌊x⌋ + a, where 0 ≤ a < 1 is the fractional part of x. Then 2x = 2⌊x⌋ + 2a and we get two cases: a < 1/2 and a ≥ 1/2. In the ﬁrst case we have 2⌊x⌋ = ⌊2x⌋ < 2⌊x⌋ + 1 and in the second 2⌊x⌋ < ⌊2x⌋ = 2⌊x⌋ + 1. Proposition 3. let a, b be positive integers and let us divide a by b with remainder a = qb + r 0 ≤ r < b. Then q = ⌊a/b⌋ and r = a − b⌊a/b⌋. Proof. We simply write a b = q + r b and since q is an integer and 0 ≤ r/b < 1 we see that q is the integer part of a/b and r/b is the fractional part. Example 1. ⌊x⌋ + ⌊x + 1/2⌋ = ⌊2x⌋. 1 3 Prime divisors of factorials and binomial coeﬃcients We start with the following Lemma 4. Let n and b be positive integers. Then the number of integers in the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} that are multiples of b is equal to ⌊n/b⌋. Proof. Indeed, by Proposition 2 the integers that are divisible by b will be b, 2b, . . . , ⌊m/b⌋ · b. Theorem 5. Let n and p be positive integers and p be prime. Then the largest exponent s such that ps | n! is s = ∑ j≥1 ⌊ n pj ⌋ . (1) Proof. Let mi be the number of multiples of pi in the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. Let t = m1 + m2 + . . . + mk + . . . (2) (the sum is ﬁnite of course). Suppose that a belongs to {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}, and such that p j | a but p j+1 ∤ a. Then in the sum (2) a will be counted j times and will contribute i towards t. This shows that t = s. Now (1) follows from Lemma 1 since mj = ⌊n/p j⌋. Theorem 6. Let n and p be positive integers and p be prime. Then the largest exponent s such that ps | (2n n ) is s = ∑ j≥1 (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) . (3) Proof. Follows from Theorem 2. Note that, due to Proposition 1, in (3) every summand is either 0 or 1. Corollary 7. Let n ≥ 3 and p be positive integers and p be prime. Let s be the largest exponent such that p s | (2n n ). Then (a) ps ≤ 2n. (b) If √2n < p, then s ≤ 1. (c) If 2n/3 < p ≤ n, then s = 0. Proof. (a) Let t be the largest integer such that p t ≤ 2n. Then for j > t (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) = 0. Hence s = t∑ j=1 (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) ≤ t. since each summand does not exceed 1 by Proposition 1. Hence p s ≤ 2n. (b) If √2n < p, then p2 > 2n and from (a) we know that s ≤ 1. (c) If 2n/3 < p ≤ n, then p2 > 2n and s = (⌊ 2n p ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n p ⌋) As 1 ≤ n/p < 3/2, we se that s = 2 − 2 · 1 = 0. 2 4 Two inequalities involving binomial coeﬃcients We all know the Binomial Theorem: (a + b)n = n∑ k=0 (n k )a n−kbk. (4) Let us derive some consequences from it. Substituting a = b = 1 we get: 2 n = n∑ k=0 (n k ) . (5) Lemma 8. (a) If n is odd, then ( n (n + 1)/2 ) ≤ 2n−1. (b) If n is even, then ( n n/2 ) ≥ 2 n n . Proof. (a) From (5), deleting all terms except the two middle ones, we get ( n (n − 1)/2 ) + ( n (n + 1)/2 ) ≤ 2 n. The two binomial coeﬃcients on the left are equal and we get (a). (b) If n is even, then it is pretty easy to prove that the middle binomial coeﬃcient is the largest one. In (5) we have n + 1 summand but we group the two ones together and we get n summands among which the middle binomial coeﬃcient is the largest. Hence n( n n/2 ) ≥ n∑ k=0 (n k ) = 2 n, which proves (b). 5 Proof of Bertrand’s Postulate Finally we can pay attention to primes. Theorem 9. Let n ≥ 2 be an integer, then ∏ p≤n p < 4 n, where the product on the left has one factor for each prime p ≤ n. Proof. The proof is by induction over n. For n = 2 we have 2 < 4 2, which is true. This provides a basis for the induction. Let us assume that the statement is proved for all integers smaller than n. If n is even, then it is not prime, hence by induction hypothesis ∏ p≤n p = ∏ p≤n−1 p < 4 n−1 < 4n, 3 so the induction step is trivial in this case. Suppose n = 2s + 1 is odd, i.e s = (n − 1)/2. Since ∏ s+1<p≤n p is a divisor of ( n s+1), we obtain ∏ p≤n p = ∏ p≤s+1 p · ∏ s+1<p≤n p < 4 s+1 · ( n s + 1 ) < 4 s+12 n−1 using the induction hypothesis for n = s + 1 and Lemma 2(a). Now the right-hand-side can be presented as 4 s+12 n−1 = 2 2s+22 n−1 = 2 4s+2 = 4 2s+1 = 4 n. This proves the induction step and, hence, the theorem. Proof of Bertrand’s Postulate. We will assume that there are no primes between n and 2n and obtain a contra- diction. We will obtain that, under this assumption, the binomial coeﬃcient (2n n ) is smaller than it should be. Indeed, in this case we have the following prime factorisation for it: ( 2n n ) = ∏ p≤n p sp , where sp is the exponent of the prime p in this factorisation. No primes greater than n can be found in this prime factorisation. In fact, due to Corollary 1(c) we can even write ( 2n n ) = ∏ p≤2n/3 p sp . Let us recap now that due to Corollary 1 psp ≤ 2n and that sp = 1 for p > √2n. Hence (2n n ) ≤ ∏ p≤√2n psp · ∏ p≤2n/3 p. We will estimate now these product using the inequality p sp ≤ 2n for the ﬁrst product and Theorem 4 for the second one. We have no more that √2n/2 − 1 factors in the ﬁrst product (as 1 and even numbers are not primes), hence (2n n ) < (2n) √2n/2−1 · 42n/3. (6) On the other hand, by Lemma 2(b) (2n n ) ≥ 22n 2n = 4 n 2n . (7) Combining (6) and (7) we get 4n/3 < (2n) √n/2. Applying logs on both sides, we get 2n 3 ln 2 < √ n 2 ln(2n) or √8n ln 2 − 3 ln(2n) < 0. (8) Let us substitute n = 2 2k−3 for some k. Then we get 2 k ln 2 − 3(2k − 2) ln 2 < 0 or 2 k < 3(2k − 2) which is true only for k ≤ 4 (you can prove that by inducton). Hence (8) is not true for n = 2 7 = 128. Let us consider the function f (x) = √8x ln 2 − 3 ln(2x) deﬁned for x > 0. Its derivative is f (x) = √2x · ln 2 − 3 x . let us note that for x ≥ 8 this derivative is positive. Thus (8) is not true for all n ≥ 128. We proved Bertrand’s postulate for n ≥ 128. For smaller n it can be proved by inspection. I leave this to the reader.
