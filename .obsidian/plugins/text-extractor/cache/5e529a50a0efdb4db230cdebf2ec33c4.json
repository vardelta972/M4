Then it can be written as an(x−r1)(x−r2) · · · (x−rn) uniquely up to reordering the factors, where the ri are the roots of p. Comparing coeﬃcients, the kth symmetric sum of the roots is equal to (−1) kan−k/an. • Intermediate Value Theorem (polynomials are continuous functions). • Division algorithm: Let a(x) and b(x) be polynomials. There exist unique polynomials q(x) and r(x) with deg(r) < deg(d) and such that a(x) = b(x)q(x) + r(x). • Rational root theorem: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. If p(x) has a rational root r s with r, s ∈ Z and (r, s) = 1 then r | a0 and s | an. • A polynomial with of degree n has at most n roots. • Gauss’s Lemma: If p(x) ∈ Z[x] factors in Q[x], then it factors in Z[x]. • Eisenstein’s Criterion: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, and let q be a prime that divides a0, a1, · · · , an−1 but not an. If q2 ∤ a0 then p(x) is irreducible over the integers (and thus also over the rationals, by Gauss’s lemma). • Descartes’ Rule of Signs: Let p(x) = anxn + · · · + a0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients, and let V be the number of sign changes in the coeﬃcient list an, . . . , a0 where we ignore zero coeﬃcients. If p(x) has N positive roots (counted by multiplicity) then N = V − 2k for some non-negative integer k. (Use this for p(−x) to get the statement for negative roots of p(x). • Rolle’s Theorem: Let p(x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Between any two zeroes of p(x) lies a zero of p′(x). • Lagrange Interpolation: A polynomial of degree at most n with p(ak) = bk, 0 ≤ k ≤ n is given by p(x) = n∑ k=0 bk(x − a0)(x − a1) · · · (x − ak−1)(x − ak+1) · · · (x − an) (a − a0)(a − a1) · · · (a − ak−1)(a − ak+1) · · · (a − an) . 1 MOP 2011, Blue/Green Group Polynomials June 14, 2010 • Newtonian interpolation (ﬁnite diﬀerences): A polynomial p of degree at most n with p(k) = bk, 0 ≤ k ≤ n, is given by p(x) = n∑ k=0 ∆ kp(0)(x k ), where ∆p(x) = p(x + 1) − p(x) and ∆kp(x) = ∆(∆ k−1p(x)). • Chebyshev Polynomials: The nth Chebyshev polynomial is deﬁned so that Tn(cos θ) = cos(nθ). They satisfy the recurrence Tn+1(x) = 2xTn(x) − Tn−1(x) n ≥ 1 with T0(x) = 1 and T1(x) = x. (There are also Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind which satisfy Un(cos θ) = sin(n+1)θ sin θ and have a recurrence of the same form. These are much less common, though.) Examples 1. Let A1, A2, . . . , An be points in the plane, and BC a segment of length 2. Prove that there exists a point M on BC such that M A1 · M A2 · · · M An ≥ 1 2n−1 . 2. Show that xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1 is irreducible. General Problems 3 (St. Petersburg). Find all polynomials P (x, y) in two variables such that for any x and y, P (x + y, y − x) = P (x, y). 4 (Putnam). Let f be a polynomial with positive integer coeﬃcients. Prove that if n is a positive integer, then f (n) divides f (f (n) + 1) if and only if n = 1. 5 (IMO 1993). Let n > 1 be an integer, and let f (x) = xn + 5xn−1 + 3. Prove that there do not exist polynomials g(x), h(x) each having integer coeﬃcients such that f (x) = g(x)h(x). 6. A point in the Cartesian coordinate plane is called a mixed point if one of its coordinates is rational and the other is irrational. Find all polynomials with real coeﬃcients whose graphs do not contain any mixed point. 7. Determine all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x) 2+P (1/x) 2 = P (x) 2P (1/x) 2 for all x ̸= 0. 8 (MOP ’08). Let Pn be a polynomial of degree n with real coecients, and let t be a real number with t ≥ 3. For integers n ≥ 0, show that max 0≤k≤n+1 |t n − Pn(k)| ≥ 1 9 (Putnam). Let P (x) = cnxn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose that r is a rational number such that P (r) = 0. Show that the n numbers cnr, cnr2 + cn−1r, cnr3 + cn−1r2 + cn−2r, . . . , cnrn + cn−1rn−1 + · · · + c1r are integers. 2 MOP 2011, Blue/Green Group Polynomials June 14, 2010 10. Let p, q, r be polynomials with real coeﬃcients, such that at least one of the polynomials has degree 2 and at least one of the polynomials has degree 3. Assume that p2 + q2 = r2: Show that at least one of the polynomials both has degree 3 and has 3 (not necessarily distinct) real roots. 11 (USAMO 2002). Prove that any monic polynomial (a polynomial with leading coeﬃcient 1) of degree n with real coeﬃcients is the average of two monic polynomials of degree n with n real roots. 12 (MOP 01). Let P (x) be a real-valued polynomial with P (n) = P (0). Show that there exist at least n distinct (unordered) pairs of real numbers {x, y} such that x − y is a real number and P (x) = P (y). What do these problems have in common? 13 (Vietnam). Find all polynomials P (x) with integer coeﬃcients such that the polynomial Q(x) = (x2 + 6x + 10) · P 2(x) − 1 is the square of a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. 14. Let {Pn(x)}∞ n=1 be a sequence of polynomials such that P1(x) = x2 − 1, P2(x) = 2x2(x2 − 1), and Pn−1(x)Pn+1(x) = (Pn(x)) 2 − (x2 − 1) 2. Let Sn denote the sum of the absolute values of the coeﬃcients of Pn(x). For each positive integer n ﬁnd the largest non-negative integer kn such that 2 k divides Sn. 15 (MOP ’03). Let k be a positive integer. Prove that √k + 1 − √k is not the real part of a complex number z such that zn = 1 for some positive integer n. 16 (IMO Shortlist 2003). The sequence a0, a1, a2, . . . is deﬁned as follows: a0 = 2, ak+1 = 2a2 k − 1 for k ≥ 0. Prove that if an odd prime p divides an, then 2 n+3 divides p2 − 1. 17 (IMO Shortlist 2003). Let R+ be the set of all positive real numbers. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ that satisfy the following conditions: • f (xyz) + f (x) + f (y) + f (z) = f ( √xy)f ( √yz)f ( √zx) for all x, y, z ∈ R+; • f (x) < f (y) for all 1 ≤ x < y. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
