We come across more than one deﬁnitions and several properties of this number; and more often than not we are left confused by thinking how there can be so many diﬀerent approaches to the same number. In this article, we seek connections between those various results involving the number e. 1 Introduction The number e is seen in several places in Calculus, for example e = lim n→∞ (1 + 1 n )n (1) e = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + . . . (2) lim x→0 ex − 1 x = 1 (3) d dx (ex) = ex (4) ex = 1 + x + x2 2! + x3 3! + . . . (5) Among these, (1), (2), (5) are directly deﬁning e. And (3), (4) are properties of e; but they can also be used to deﬁne e : a = e is the unique number for which lim x→0 ax − 1 x = 1 and d dx(ax) = ax. (6) Now, its natural to ask, how are the diﬀerent deﬁnitions give the same e ? And how the above equations relate to one another? In this article, we are going to settle down these questions. 1 2 Deﬁning e I think the ﬁrst time one encounters with e is while learning logarithms, where textbooks introduce e as an ‘irrational’ number deﬁned by e = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · . (7) And then they say log to the base e is called the ‘natural’ logarithm. Now, for obvious reasons we are left confused with questions like “why irrational?” , “why natural?”. We shall resolve these questions later. Before that, let us begin by deﬁning e using that series. But for that, we should ﬁrst ensure that the above series ‘converges’. Deﬁne sn = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · + 1 n! for n ≥ 1. We know, the series in (7) converges if and only if the sequence {sn}n≥1 converges. Observe that the sequence sn is increasing. And using the inequality n! = 2 · 3 · 4 · . . . n ≥ 2 n−1 (for every n ≥ 2) we get 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · + 1 n! ≤ 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 22 + · · · + 1 2n−1 < 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 22 + · · · = 3. Thus, the sequence sn is increasing and bounded, hence converges to some real number. We name that real number to be e : e := lim n→∞ sn = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + · · · . Next, we shall see another famous deﬁnition of e, with a historical story. Jacob Bernoulli discovered this constant in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest: An account starts with $1.00 and pays 100% interest per year. If the interest is credited once, at the end of the year, the value of the account at year-end will be $2.00. What happens if the interest is computed and credited more frequently during the year? If the interest is credited twice in the year, the interest rate for each 6 months will be 50%, so the initial $1 is multiplied by 1.5 twice, yielding $1.00 × 1.5 2 = $2.25 at the end of the year. Compounding quarterly yields $1.00 × (1 + 1/4) 4 = $2.4414..., and compounding monthly yields $1.00 × (1 + 1/12) 12 = $2.613035... If there are n compounding intervals, the interest for each interval will be 100/n % and the value at the end of the year will be $1.00(1 + 1/n) n. Bernoulli noticed that if we make n larger and larger (and hence the compound- ing intervals get smaller and smaller), then this sequence approaches a limit - with continuous compounding, the account value will reach $2.7182818... . This gives an alternate deﬁnition of e: we write e = lim n→∞(1 + 1/n) n. We shall ﬁrst establish that this limit exists or not. But there is a new problem: even if we show that the limit exists, we can not redeﬁne e; rather we have to show the two deﬁnitions are equivalent. So we need to show that lim n→∞ (1 + 1 n )n = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + . . . . (8) 2 Let us write tn = (1 + 1 n ) n for n ≥ 1. The Binomial Theorem gives (1 + 1 n )n = n∑ k=0 ( n k ) 1 nk = n∑ k=0 1 k! n(n − 1) . . . (n − k + 1) nk = n∑ k=0 1 k! (1 − 1 n )(1 − 2 n )(1 − k − 1 n ) This gives us a motivation for (8) to be true: when n gets larger and larger, the last sum gets closer and closer to the sum ∑n k=1 1/k!. That is, (1 + 1 n )n = n∑ k=0 1 k! ( 1 − 1 n )(1 − 2 n )(1 − k − 1 n ) ≈ n∑ k=0 1 k! for large n. This was just a motivation. Let us do everything rigorously now : Note that, tn = (1 + 1 n )n = n∑ k=0 1 k! (1 − 1 n )(1 − 2 n )(1 − k − 1 n ) ≤ n∑ k=0 1 k! = sn Therefore, for every n ≥ 1 we have tn ≤ sn. On the other hand, for n ≥ m, n∑ k=0 1 k! (1 − 1 n )(1 − 2 n )(1 − k − 1 n ) ≥ m∑ k=0 1 k! (1 − 1 n )(1 − 2 n )( 1 − k − 1 n ) . . . (∗) ≥ m∑ k=0 1 k! (1 − 1 m )(1 − 2 m )(1 − k − 1 m ). This gives tn ≥ tm whenever n ≥ m. Thus, the sequence tn is increasing and tn ≤ sn < 3 (we showed sn < 3 earlier), hence tn converges. Say t = lim n→∞ tn. Now, tn ≤ sn tells us that t ≤ e. And letting n → ∞, (∗) tells us that t ≥ sm. Then, letting m → ∞, we get t ≥ e. Combining these two, we obtain t = e, as required. Next, let us establish why e is irrational. Let, if possible, e be rational, say e = p/q where p, q are positive integers. So, we have p q = 1 + 1 1! + 1 2! + 1 3! + . . . . Multiplying both sides of last equation with q!, we get p · (q − 1)! = q!(1 + + 1 1! + 1 2! + · · · + 1 q! ) + q!( 1 (q + 1)! + 1 (q + 2)! + . . . ) Thus, x = q!( 1 (q + 1)! + 1 (q + 2)! + . . . ) = 1 (q + 1) + 1 (q + 2)(q + 1) + . . . must be an integer. But, 1 (q + 1) + 1 (q + 2)(q + 1) + · · · ≤ 1 (q + 1) + 1 (q + 1)2 + · · · = 1 1 − 1/(1 + q) − 1 = 1 q which shows that 0 < x < 1, so x can’t be an integer. This contradiction proves that e must be irrational. 3 3 The Big Trap Let me present it in the form of a conversation: Teacher: How to show d dx(e x) = e x ? Student 1: We have d dx (ex) = lim h→0 e x+h − ex h = e x lim h→0 eh − 1 h = ex. Teacher: Tell me how to prove lim h→0 e h − 1 h = 1. Now student 1 has no answer. Then, another student says: Student 2: Why not show d dt log t = 1 t directly from deﬁnition! We have d dx (log x) = lim h→0 log(x + h) − log x h = lim h→0 log(1 + h/x) h = 1 x lim u→0 log(1 + u) u = 1 x . Teacher: Okay, then tell how to show lim u→0 log(1 + u) u = 1 ? Student 2: We substitute 1 + u = ez. As u → 0, ez = 1 + u → 1 so z → 0. Hence lim u→0 log(1 + u) u = lim z→0 z ez − 1 = 1. Teacher: So both of you are using lim h→0 eh − 1 h = 1. But how to prove this one ? After a little silence, another student says Student 3: We know, eh = 1 + h + h 2 2! + h 3 3! + . . . , hence lim h→0 e h − 1 h = lim h→0 ( h 2! + h 2 3! + . . . ) = 0. Teacher: And how do you establish that series ? Student 3: That’s the Taylor Series for ex. We have, for f (x) = ex, eh = f (h) = f (0) + hf ′(0) + h 2 2! f ′′(0) + · · · = 1 + h + h 2 2! + · · · . Teacher: And how do you get f ′(0) = 1 ? Student 3: Because f ′(x) = e x. Student 1: But to prove f ′(x) = ex, we needed that limit; and you are proving that limit using f ′(x) = ex !!! Teacher: Correct. This is the trap! 4 4 Escaping from the trap To escape the trap, we take a somewhat reverse route. We deﬁne L(x) = ∫ x 1 1 t dt for x > 0. We shall deduce that it is same as our familiar loge x, i.e. L(x) = loge x or, eL(x) = x for all x > 0. (Note that we can not directly evaluate the integral, because we don’t know how to diﬀerentiate loge x, for now.) Note: we are using the convention that ∫ a b f = − ∫ b a f if a < b. 4.1 Showing L(x) = loge x First we show that, L(xy) = L(x) + L(y) for all x, y > 0. L(xy) − L(y) = ∫ xy y dt t = ∫ x 1 du u (substituting t = yu) . In the intermediate step, the substitution is justiﬁed, because the functions f (t) = 1/t and g(s) = ys are nice (continuous, diﬀerentiable, bijective in required domains). Thus, for every x, y > 0, we have L(xy) = L(x) + L(y). Using this, we get L(x2) = 2L(x), which yields L(x3) = L(x) + L(x2) = 3L(x) and so on. Inductively, we get L(xn) = nL(x) for all x > 0 and for every natural number n. Next, observe that, using the substitution t = 1/z, L ( 1 x ) = ∫ 1/x 1 dt t = ∫ x 1 z −dz z2 = ∫ x 1 −dz z = −L(x) Combining this with L(xn) = nL(x) and using that L(x0) = L(1) = 0, we obtain L(xn) = nL(x) for all x > 0, for all integer n. Next, for any rational number α = p/q where p, q are integers, q ̸= 0, note that qL(xα) = L(xqα) = L(xp) = pL(x) ⇒ L(xp/q) = p q L(x). Hence, L(xα) = αL(x) for all rational number α. Next, take any real number α. There exists a sequence of rational numbers (an)n≥1 with lim an = α. Now, from continuity of exponential the function1, L(xα) = L( lim n→∞ xan) = lim n→∞ L(xan) = lim n→∞ anL(x) = αL(x). 1Continuity of exponential functions (a x) is not something that can be proved, because it is what deﬁnes the exponentiation. How to deﬁne 2 3 is clear to us : it is simply 2 times 2 times 2. But how does one deﬁne 2 √ 2? Following is the story of how to deﬁne a x: First we deﬁne a n for any real number a and natural number n, by saying a n is a × a × . . . (n times). Then we deﬁne a n for all integer n, by saying a −n = 1/a n for any natural number n and a 0 = 1; but this time we have to exclude a = 0. Because 0 −1 is undeﬁned. Next, we deﬁne a n for all rational n by saying a p/q is the q-th root of a p. But this time we have to exclude all the negative a’s because (−1) 1/2 is not a real number. (It can shown that for any a > 0 and natural number q, a 1/q exists and is unique). Finally, we deﬁne a x for all a > 0 and x real by taking limit of a xn where xn is any sequence of rational numbers tending to x. For instant, 2 √ 2 is the limit of 2 xn where (xn) is any sequence that tends to √ 2. So, continuity is what deﬁnes exponentiation, for arbitrary real exponents. 5 Thus, we have shown that L(xα) = αL(x) for all x > 0 and for all α ∈ R. Next, we shall show that L(e) = 1. We know, the sequence xn = (1 + 1/n) n tends to e as n → ∞. And note that L(x) is a continuous function, by Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. So continuity of L tells us that L(xn) tends to L(e) as n → ∞. L(e) = lim n→∞ L(1 + 1 n )n = lim n→∞ nL (1 + 1 n ) = lim n→∞ n ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt t Now, for t ∈ [1, 1 + 1/n], we have 1 1 + 1/n ≤ 1 t ≤ 1. Hence, 1/n 1 + 1/n = ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt 1 + 1/n ≤ ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt t ≤ ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt = 1 n which gives 1 1 + 1/n ≤ n ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt t ≤ 1. Now, letting n → ∞, we get L(e) = lim n→∞ n ∫ 1+1/n 1 dt t = 1. Finally, observe that, for every x > 0, L(x) = L(e loge x) = (loge x)L(e) = loge x (as L(e) = 1). 4.2 Derivatives of log x, e x and the limit lim h→0 eh − 1 h First we shall show that d dx (log x) = 1/x for all x > 0. The integrand f (t) = 1/t is continuous in (1, ∞). Hence, Fundamental Theorem of Calculus tells us that L(x) = ∫ x 1 f (t)dt is diﬀerentiable in (1, ∞) with L′(x) = f (x) = 1/x for all x > 1. For x < 1, we can use L(x) = −L(1/x) to arrive at L′(x) = d dx ( −L ( 1 x )) chain rule = − 1 1/x · d dx ( 1 x ) = (−x)−1 x2 = 1 x Now we are left with only L′(1). For this, we rewrite L(x) as L(x) = ∫ x 0.5 dt/t − ∫ 1 0.5 dt/t = ∫ x 0.5 dt/t + some constant. Then, continuity of 1/t in [0.5, ∞) ensures L is diﬀerentiable in (0.5, ∞), with L ′(x) = f (x) = 1/x for all x > 0.5. In particular, we have L′(1) = 1. Next, we shall ﬁnd the derivative of ex. Observe that, the function h : R → (0, ∞), h(x) = e x is a bijective function with inverse h −1(x) = log x (because y = e x implies x = log y). To put it in another way, e x is the inverse of the diﬀerentiable function log x and the derivate of log x (which is 1/x) is non-zero for x ∈ (0, ∞). Hence e x is diﬀerentiable. 6 Diﬀerentiating both sides of x = log(ex) w.r.t. x (using chain-rule for the RHS), 1 = d dx(log(e x)) = 1 ex · d dx (e x) =⇒ d dx(e x) = e x. Finally, we have ex = d dx(ex) = lim h→0 e x+h − e x h = e x lim h→0 eh − 1 h =⇒ lim h→0 eh − 1 h = 1. 4.3 Alternate ways to deﬁne e Using ax = e x log a we obtain lim x→0 ax − 1 x = lim x→0 e x log a − 1 x = log a lim x→0 e x log a − 1 x log a = log a, and d dx(ax) = d dx (e x log a) = (ex log a) log a = ax log a. Hence we can say that a = e is the unique number for which lim x→0 ax − 1 x = 1 and d dx(ax) = ax holds. Also, notice that ∫ a 1 1 t dt = ∫ e 1 1 t dt + ∫ a e 1 t dt = 1 + ∫ a e 1 t dt tells us ∫ a 1 1 t dt = 1 if and only if a = e. At this point, I can attempt give you a possible answer of the question: Why do we call loge x to be the natural logarithm of x? One can guess that the derivative of ax (w.r.t. x) is proportional to itself 1. Now, think about guessing that propor- tionality constant. Well, we might do one thing - set some number as standard and measure the proportionality constant with respect to that. Hence we seek whether there is a number a for which that proportionality constant becomes 1. Quite dra- matically, it turns out that this number is none other than e. Not only that, it is the unique choice for a which makes both the limit lim x→0 (ax − 1)/x and the area ∫ a 1 1 xdx to be 1. Due to these reasons, in calculus (which comprises of limit, derivatives and area) we set this number as the standard one. In other words, the number e is the most natural constant in calculus. 4.4 The Series e x = 1 + x + x2 2! + x3 3! + · · · Once we know that the derivative of ex is itself, the above series is just the Taylor series of ex. The error after truncating the series at the n-th term, is of the form e ξnxn/n! where 0 < |ξn| < |x|. We have 0 < e ξn ≤ 1 + e x, so this part of the error is bounded. Hence the conclusion will follow once we show lim n→∞ xn/n! = 0. To prove this, consider the series ∑∞ n=1 xn/n!. By ratio-test, this series converges (for any real number x), hence the n-th term of the series must tend to 0 as n → ∞. This completes the proof that ex = 1 + x + x2 2! + x3 3! + · · · . 1Watch 3blue1brown’s video at https://youtu.be/m2MIpDrF7Es 7 However, the proof above gives us no motivation how a seemingly diﬀerent series relates with e. Let me give that motivation now. Observe that, d dx (1 + x + x2 2! + · · · + xn−1 (n − 1)! + xn n! ) = (1 + x + x2 2! + · · · + xn−1 (n − 1)! ). So, the derivative of (1 + x + x2 2! + · · · + xn n! ) is almost like itself, with the last term being erased! Now, what if we continue adding all such terms (making a power series)? We expect that d dx ( 1 + x + x2 2! + x3 3! + · · · + xn n! + . . . ) = (1 + x + x2 2! + · · · + xn−1 (n − 1)! + . . . ) (⋆) Since there is no last term, the derivative of the series is just itself. And this is a property the function e x enjoys! Of course, ex is not the only one having this property: for every c ∈ R, the function ce x has the same property. But, after all, its natural to ask, is that series related to e x ? And the answer turns out to be ‘yes’, because the series happens to be nothing but the Taylor series expansion for e x. (We proved that the series converges to ex, for any real number x.) The reader might get a bit disgusted if I give no explanation for diﬀerentiating the series in (⋆) term-by-term. Note that the in (⋆) is a power series (around 0), which converges for any real number x, as seen by ratio-test. So the radius of convergence of the power series is R = +∞ and we can diﬀerentiate a power series (around 0) term-by-term within (−R, R). Thus, the term-by-term diﬀerentiation in (⋆) is justiﬁed. 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
