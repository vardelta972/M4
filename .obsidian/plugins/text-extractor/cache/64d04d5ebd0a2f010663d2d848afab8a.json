We begin by summarizing some of the common approaches used in dealing with integer polynomials. • Looking at the coeﬃcients ◦ Bound the size of the coeﬃcients ◦ Modulos reduction. In particular, a − b | P (a) − P (b) whenever P (x) ∈ Z[x] and a, b are distinct integers. • Looking at the roots ◦ Bound their location on the complex plane. ◦ Examine the algebraic degree of the roots, and consider ﬁeld extensions. Minimal polynomials. Many problems deal with the irreducibility of polynomials. A polynomial is reducible if it can be written as the product of two nonconstant polynomials, both with rational coeﬃcients. Fortunately, if the origi- nal polynomial has integer coeﬃcients, then the concepts of (ir)reducibility over the integers and over the rationals are equivalent. This is due to Gauss’ Lemma. Theorem 1 (Gauss). If a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients is reducible over Q, then it is reducible over Z. Thus, it is generally safe to talk about the reducibility of integer polynomials without being pedantic about whether we are dealing with Q or Z. Modulo Reduction It is often a good idea to look at the coeﬃcients of the polynomial from a number theoretical standpoint. The general principle is that any polynomial equation can be reduced mod m to obtain another polynomial equation whose coeﬃcients are the residue classes mod m. Many criterions exist for testing whether a polynomial is irreducible. Unfortunately, none are powerful enough to be universal. One of the most well-known criteria is Eisenstein’s criterion. Theorem 2 (Eisenstein). Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that p | ai for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, p ∤ an and p 2 ∤ a0. Then f (x) is irreducible. Proof. Suppose that f = gh, where g and h are nonconstant integer polynomials. Consider the reduction mod p (i.e., apply the ring homomorphism Z[x] → Fp[x]), and let ¯f , ¯g, ¯h denote the residues of f, g, h (i.e. the coeﬃcients are residues mod p). We have ¯f (x) = a0xn. Since Fp[x] is a unique factorization domain, we see that the only possibilities for ¯g and ¯h are cx k for some integers c and k ≥ 1. Then, the constant terms of g and h are both divisible by p, so p 2 | a0. Contradiction. The most typical example for the application of Eisenstein’s criterion is to show that the cyclotomic polynomial Φp(x) is irreducible for prime p: Problem 1. Let p be a prime number. Show that f (x) = xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1 is irreducible. 1 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Solution. The polynomial f (x) is irreducible if and only if f (x + 1) is irreducible. We have f (x + 1) = (x + 1)p − 1 (x + 1) − 1 = xp−1 + ( p 1 )x p−2 + (p 2 )xp−3 + · · · + ( p p − 2 )x + p. Note that f (x + 1) fails the Eisenstein criterion for the prime p. Therefore f (x) is irreducible. Note that the proof of Eisenstein’s criterion extends to other rings with similar properties. For instance, to show that x4 + 5x + 5 is irreducible over the Gaussian integers Z[i], we can simply apply Eisenstein with the Gaussian prime 2 + i. The proof of Eisenstein’s Criterion can be slightly generalized to the following. The proof is more or less the same, and so it’s left as exercise. Theorem 3 (Extended Eisenstein). Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that p | ai for 0 ≤ i < k, p ∤ ak and p2 ∤ a0. Then f (x) has an irreducible factor of degree greater than k. We give one more result that relates to looking at the modulo reduction of polynomials, known as Hensel’s lemma. Theorem 4 (Hensel). Let a0, a1, . . . , ak be integers, and let P (x) = anxk +· · · a1x+a0, and let P ′(x) denote the derivative of P (x). Suppose that x1 is an integer such that P (x1) ≡ 0 (mod p) and P ′(x1) ̸≡ 0 (mod p). Then, for any positive integer k, there exists an unique residue x (mod p k), such that P (xk) ≡ 0 (mod pk) and x ≡ x1 (mod p). The proof of Hensel’s lemma closely mimics Newton’s method of ﬁnding roots. We work up the powers of p, and ﬁnd the a zero of P (x) mod p k for k = 2, 3, . . . . The details of the proof are omitted here. Root Hunting When working with integer polynomials, it is often not enough to stay in Z. We have to think outside the box and move our scope to the complex numbers. A lot can be a said about a polynomial if we know something about its complex zeros. Many irreducibility problems hinge on placing bounds on the zeros of the polynomial in the complex plane. We begin with a familiar example. Problem 2. Let f (x) = anxn + an−1x n + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, such that |a0| is prime and |a0| > |a1| + |a2| + · · · + |an|. Show that f (x) is irreducible. Solution. Let α be any complex zero of f . Suppose that |α| ≤ 1, then |a0| = |a1α + · · · + anαn| ≤ |a1| + · · · + |an|, a contradiction. Therefore, all the zeros of f satisﬁes |α| > 1. Now, suppose that f (x) = g(x)h(x), where g and g are nonconstant integer polynomials. Then a0 = f (0) = g(0)h(0). Since |a0| is prime, one of |g(0)|, |h(0)| equals 1. Say |g(0)| = 1, and let b be the leading coeﬃcient of g. If α1, . . . , αk are the roots of g, then |α1α2 · · · αk| = 1/|b| ≤ 1. However, α1, . . . , αk are also zeros of f , and so each has an magnitude greater than 1. Contradiction. Therefore, f is irreducible. Next, we present a Perron’s criterion, which has a similar statement but a much more diﬃcult proof compared with the previous result. Theorem 5 (Perron). Let P (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with a0 ̸= 0 and |an−1| > 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|. Then P (x) is irreducible. 2 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Again, the idea is to put bounds on the modulus of the roots of f . The key lies in the following lemma. Lemma 1. Let P (x) = xn + an−1x n−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with |an−1| > 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|. Then exactly one zero of P satisﬁes |z| > 1, and the other n − 1 zeros of P satisfy |z| < 1. Let us see how we can prove Perron’s criterion if we have this lemma. Suppose that P (x) = f (x)g(x), where f and g are integer polynomials. Since P has only one zero with modulus not less than 1, one of the polynomials f , g, has all its zeros strictly inside the unit circle. Suppose that z1, . . . , zk are the zeros of f , and |z1|, . . . , |zk| < 1. Note that f (0) is a nonzero integer, and |f (0)| = |z1 · · · zk| < 1, contradiction. Therefore, f is irreducible. Now, let us prove Lemma 1. We oﬀer two proofs. The ﬁrst proof is an elementary proof that uses only the triangle inequality. The second proof invokes theorems from complex analysis, but it is much more intuitive and instructive. First proof of the Lemma 1. (due to Laurentiu Panaitopol) Let us suppose wolog that a0 ̸= 0 since we can remove any factors of the form x k . Let’s ﬁrst prove that there is no root α of P (x) with |α| = 1. Suppose otherwise, then we have that −an−1αn−1 = αn + an−2αn−2 + · · · + a1α + a0, thus |an−1| = |an−1αn−1| = |αn + an−2αn−2 + · · · + a1α + a0| ≤ |αn| + |an−2αn−2| + · · · + |a1α| + |a0| = 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|. This contradicts the given inequality. Therefore, no zero of f (x) lies on the unit circle. Let’s denote with α1, α2, . . ., αn be the zeros of P . Since |α1α2 · · · αn| = a0, it follows that at least one of the roots is larger than 1 in absolute value. Suppose that |α1| > 1 and let Q(x) = x n−1 + bn−2xn−2 + · · · + b1x + b0 be the polynomial with roots α2, α3, . . ., αn. Then, P (x) = (x − α1)Q(x) = xn + (bn−2 − α1)xn−1 + (bn−3 − bn−2α1)xn−2 + · · · + (b0 − b1α1)x − b0α1 It follows that bn−1 = 1, a0 = −b0α1, and ak = bk−1 − bkα1 for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Then, using the given inequality, we have |bn−2 − α1| = |an−1| > 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0| = 1 + |bn−3 − bn−2α1| + · · · + |b0α1| ≥ 1 + |bn−2||α1| − |bn−3| + |bn−3||α1| − |bn−4| + · · · + |b1||x1| − |b0| + |b0||x1| = 1 + |bn−2| + (|α1| − 1) (|bn−2| + |bn−3| + · · · + |b1| + |b0|) . On the other hand, |bn−2 − α1| ≤ |bn−2| + |α1|, so |bn−2| + |α1| > 1 + |bn−2| + (|α1| − 1) (|bn−2| + |bn−3| + · · · + |b1| + |b0|) and therefore |bn−2| + |bn−3| + · · · + |b1| + |b0| < 1. 3 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Then, for any complex number α with |α| ≥ 1, we have |Q(α)| = |αn−1 + bn−2αn−2 + bn−3αn−3 + · · · + b1α + b0| ≥ |αn−1| − |bn−2αn−2| − |bn−3αn−3| − · · · − |b1α| − |b0| ≥ |α|n−1 − |α|n−1 (|bn−2| + |bn−3| + · · · + |b1| + |b0|) = |α|n−1 (1 − |bn−2| − |bn−3| − · · · − |b1| − |b0|) > 0 And so α cannot be a root. It follows that all the zeros of Q lie strictly inside the unit circle. This completes the proof of the lemma. In the polynomial P , the second term xn−1 is “dominating,” in the sense that the absolute value of its coeﬃcient is greater than the sum of the absolute values of all the other coeﬃcients. In the above proof, we managed to construct a new polynomial Q, whose leading term is dominating. While exactly one zero of P is outside the unit circle, none of the zeros of Q is outside the unit circle. This observation generalizes to the following result. Proposition 6. Let P (z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0 be a polynomial with complex coeﬃcients, and such that |ak| > |a0| + |a1| + · · · + |ak−1| + |ak+1| + · · · + |an| for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Then exactly k zeros of P lie strictly inside the unit circle, and the other n − k zeros of P lie strictly outside the unit circle. This is indeed true. The easiest way to prove this result is to invoke a well-known theorem in complex analysis, known as Rouch´e’s theorem. Theorem 7 (Rouch´e). Let f and g be analytic functions on and inside a simple closed curve C. Suppose that |f (z)| > |g(z)| for all points z on C. Then f and f + g have the same number of zeros (counting multiplicities) interior to C. The proof of Rouch´e’s theorem uses the argument principle. It can be found in any standard complex analysis textbook. In practice, for polynomials, Rouch´e’s theorem is generally applied to some circle, and is useful when one term is very big compared to the other terms. Proposition 6 becomes very easy to prove with the aid of Rouch´e’s theorem. Indeed, let us apply Rouch´e’s theorem to the functions akzk and P (z) − akzk with the curve being the unit circle. The given inequality implies that |akzk| > |P (z) − akzk| for all |z| = 1. It follows that P has the same number of zeros as akzk inside the unit circle. It follows that P has exactly k zeros inside the unit circle. Also, it is not hard to show that P has no zeros on the unit circle (c.f. ﬁrst proof of Lemma 1). Thus we have proved Proposition 6. Second proof of Lemma 1. Apply Proposition 6 to k = n − 1. While we’re at it, let’s look at couple of neat applications of Rouch´e’s theorem, just for fun. These are not integer polynomial problems, but they contain useful ideas. Problem 3. (Romania ??) Let f ∈ C[x] be a monic polynomial. Prove that we can ﬁnd a z ∈ C such that |z| = 1 and |f (z)| ≥ 1. Solution. Let deg P = n. Suppose that |f (z)| < 1 for all z on the unit circle. Then |f (z)| < |zn| for all z on the unit circle. So, by Rouch´e’s theorem, f (z) − zn has n roots inside the unit circle, which is impossible, since f (z) − zn has degree n − 1. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra is also an easy consequence of Rouch´e’s theorem. Theorem 8 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra). Any polynomial P (x) ∈ C[x] of degree n has exactly n complex zeros. 4 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Proof. Let P (x) = anxn + · · · + a1x + a0. For a suﬃciently large real number R, we have |an|Rn > |an−1|Rn−1 + · · · + |a1|R + a0. Apply Rouch´e’s theorem to the functions anxn and P (x) − anxn on the circle |z| = R, we ﬁnd that P (x) has exactly n zeros inside the circle. Also, since we may choose R arbitrarily large, so there are no additional zeros. Note that the above proof also gives a bound (although rather weak) for the zeros of a polynomial. This bound is attributed to Cauchy. Finally, the following result is a slightly stronger version of Rouch´e’s theorem. Theorem 9 (Extended Rouch´e). Let f and g be analytic functions on and inside a simple closed curve C. Suppose that |f (z) + g(z)| < |f (z)| + |g(z)| for all points z on C. Then f and g have the same number of zeros (counting multiplicities) interior to C. There are many ways of bounding polynomial zeros on the complex plane. The following result is worth mentioning, as it has proven useful quite a few times. Proposition 10. Let P (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, where 0 < a0 ≤ a1 ≤ · · · ≤ an are real numbers, then any complex zero of the polynomial satisﬁes |z| ≤ 1. Proof. If |z| > 1, then, since z is a zero of (1 − x)P (x), we get a0 + (a1 − a0)z + · · · + (an − an−1)zn − anzn = 0. Thus, |anzn| = |a0 + (a1 − a0)z + · · · + (an − an−1)zn| ≤ a0 + (a1 − a0)|z| + · · · + (an − an−1)|zn| < a0|z| n + (a1 − a0)|z| n + · · · + (an − an−1)|z|n = a0|z| n − a0|z| n + a1|z| n − a1|z|n + · · · + an|z|n = |anzn| contradiction. Therefore, |z| ≤ 1. It follows as a simple corollary that for any polynomial with positive real coeﬃcients, P (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, all its zeros lie in the annulus min 1≤k≤n ak−1 ak ≤ |z| ≤ max 1≤k≤n ak−1 ak Finally, we present one more irreducibility criterion, known as Cohn’s criterion. Essentially, it says that if f (x) has nonnegative integer coeﬃcients, and f (n) is prime for some n greater than all the coeﬃcients, then f is irreducible. Theorem 11 (Cohn’s Criterion). Let p be a prime number, and b ≥ 2 an integer. Suppose that pnpn−1 · · · p1p0 is the base-b representation of p, with 0 ≤ pi < b for each i and pn ̸= 0, then the polynomial f (x) = pnxn + pn−1xn + · · · + p1x + p0 is irreducible. The following proof is due to M. Ram Murty 1. As before, we begin with a lemma bounding the complex zeros of the polynomial. 1M. Ram Murty, Prime Numbers and Irreducible Polynomials, Amer. Math. Monthly. 109 (2002) 452–458 5 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Lemma 2. Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 belong to Z[x]. Suppose that an ≥ 1, an−1 ≥ 0, and |ai| ≤ H for i = 0, 1, . . . , n − 2, where H is some positive constant. Then any complex zero α of f (x) either has nonpositive real part, or satisﬁes |α| < 1 + √1 + 4H 2 Proof. If |z| > 1 and Re z > 0, we observe that \f \f \f \f f (z) zn \f \f \f \f ≥ \f \f \fan + an−1 z \f \f \f − H ( 1 |z|2 + · · · 1 |z|n ) > Re (an + an−1 z ) − H |z|2 − |z| ≥ 1 − H |z|2 − |z| = |z| 2 − |z| − H |z|2 − |z| ≥ 0 whenever |z| ≥ 1 + √1 + 4H 2 . It follows that α cannot be a zero of f if |α| ≥ 1+√1+4H 2 and Re α > 0. To prove Theorem 11 for the case b ≥ 3, we notice that Lemma 2 implies if α is a zero of f (x), then |b − α| > 1. Suppose that f (x) = g(x)h(x), where g and h are nonconstant integer polynomials. Since f (b) is prime, one of |g(b)|, |h(b)| is 1. Say |g(b)| = 1, and the zeros of g are α1, . . . , αk. We have |g(b)| = |b − α1| · · · |b − αk| > 1, contradiction. Therefore, f is irreducible. The b = 2 case is special, and requires more analysis. Lemma 3. Let f (x) = xn + an−1xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 with ai ∈ {0, 1} for each i. Then all the zeros of f lie in the half plane Re z < 3 2 . Proof. The cases n = 1 and 2 can be veriﬁed by hand. Assume that n ≥ 3. Then, for z ̸= 0, we have \f \f \f \f f (z) zn \f \f \f \f ≥ \f \f \f1 + am−1 z + am−2 z2 \f \f \f − ( 1 |z|3 + · · · + 1 |z|m ) > \f \f \f1 + am−1 z + am−2 z2 \f \f \f − 1 |z|2(|z| − 1) . If z satisﬁes | arg z| ≤ π/4, then we have Re(1/z2) ≥ 0, and we get \f \f \f \f f (z) zn \f \f \f \f > 1 − 1 |z|2(|z| − 1) . If |z| ≥ 3 2 , then |z| 2(|z| − 1) ≥ ( 3 2 )2 ( 3 2 − 1) = 9 8 > 1, and so f (z) ̸= 0. On the other hand, if z is a zero of f with | arg z| > π/4, and suppose that Re z > 0, then from Lemma 2 we have |z| < 1+√5 2 , and thus Re z < 1+ √5 2 √2 < 3 2 . It follows that all zeros of f lie in the half-plane Re z < 3 2 . To ﬁnish oﬀ the proof, suppose that f (x) = g(x)h(x), where g and h are integer polynomials. Since f (2) is prime, one of |g(2)|, |h(2)| is 1. Say |g(2)| = 1. By Lemma 3, all the zeros of f lie in the half plane Re z < 3 2 , which means that they satisfy |z − 2| > |z − 1|. Thus, if α1, . . . , αk are the zeros of g, we have |g(2)| = |2 − α1| · · · |2 − αk| > |1 − α1| · · · |1 − αk| = |g(1)| ≥ 1. So |g(2)| > 1, contradiction. 6 MOP 2007 Black Group Integer Polynomials Yufei Zhao Problems 1. If q is a rational number and cos qπ is also rational, show that cos qπ ∈ {0, ± 1 2 , ±1}. 2.

(IMO Shortlist 1996) For each positive integer n, show that there exists a positive integer k such that k = f (x)(x + 1)2n + g(x)(x2n + 1) for some polynomials f, g with integer coeﬃcients, and ﬁnd the smallest such k as a function of n. 29. (Romania TST 1998) show that for any n ∈ N, the polynomial P (x) = (x2 + x) 2n + 1 is irreducible over the integers. 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
