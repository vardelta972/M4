Write I and I ′ for the intervals [a, b] and (a, b) respectively. A function f is said to be convex on I if and only if λf (x)+(1−λ)f (y) ≥ f (λx + (1 − λ)y) for all x, y ∈ I and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Conversely, if the inequality always holds in the opposite direction, the function is said to be concave on the interval. A function f that is continuous on I and twice diﬀerentiable on I ′ is convex on I if and only if f ′′(x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ I (Concave if the inequality is ﬂipped.) Let x1 ≥ x2 ≥ · · · ≥ xn; y1 ≥ y2 ≥ · · · ≥ yn be two sequences of real numbers. If x1 + · · · + xk ≥ y1 +· · ·+yk for k = 1, 2, . . . , n with equality where k = n, then the sequence {xi} is said to majorize the sequence {yi}. An equivalent criterion is that for all real numbers t, |t − x1| + |t − x2| + · · · + |t − xn| ≥ |t − y1| + |t − y2| + · · · + |t − yn| We use these deﬁnitions to introduce some famous inequalities. Theorem 1 (Jensen) Let f : I → R be a convex function. Then for any x1, . . . , xn ∈ I and any nonnegative reals ω1, . . . , ωn with positive sum, ω1f (x1) + · · · + ωnf (xn) ≥ (ω1 + · · · + ωn) f ( ω1x1 + · · · + ωnxn ω1 + · · · + ωn ) If f is concave, then the inequality is ﬂipped. Theorem 2 (Weighted Power Mean) If x1, . . . , xn are nonnegative reals and ω1, . . . , ωn are nonnegative reals with a postive sum, then f (r) := ( ω1xr 1 + · · · + ωnxr n ω1 + · · · + ωn ) 1 r is a non-decreasing function of r, with the convention that r = 0 is the weighted geometric mean. f is strictly increasing unless all the xi are equal except possibly for r ∈ (−∞, 0], where if some xi is zero f is identically 0. In particular, f (1) ≥ f (0) ≥ f (−1) gives the AM-GM-HM inequality. Theorem 3 (H¨older) Let a1, . . . , an; b1, . . . , bn; · · · ; z1, . . . , zn be sequences of nonnegative real numbers, and let λa, λb, . . . , λz positive reals which sum to 1. Then (a1 + · · · + an) λa(b1 + · · · + bn) λb · · · (z1 + · · · + zn) λz ≥ a λa 1 bλb 1 · · · zλz 1 + · · · + a λz n bλb n · · · zλz n This theorem is customarily identiﬁed as Cauchy when there are just two sequences. Theorem 4 (Rearrangement) Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nonde- creasing sequences of real numbers. Then, for any permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a1bπ(1) + a2bπ(2) + · · · + anbπ(n) ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 with equality on the left and right holding if and only if the sequence π(1), . . . , π(n) is decreasing and increasing respectively. 1Thanks to Thomas Mildorf for writing the lecture on Inequalities, available online at http://web.mit.edu/ tmil- dorf/www/Inequalities.pdf, as well as for generously providing me with the .tex ﬁle for said lecture so that I did not have to recopy all of the theorems. In addition, many example problems are also taken from his lecture. 1 Theorem 5 (Chebyshev) Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an; b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers. Then a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn n ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n · b1 + b2 + · · · + bn n ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 n Theorem 6 (Schur) Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals and r > 0. Then a r(a − b)(a − c) + br(b − c)(b − a) + c r(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if a = b = c or some two of a, b, c are equal and the other is 0. Remark - This can be improved considerably. (See the problems section.) However, they are not as well known (as of now) as this form of Schur, and so should be proven whenever used on a contest. Theorem 7 (Majorization) Let f : I → R be a convex on I and suppose that the sequence x1, . . . , xn majorizes the sequence y1, . . . , yn, where xi, yi ∈ I. Then f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + · · · + f (yn) Theorem 8 (Muirhead) Suppose the sequence a1, . . . , an majorizes the sequence b1, . . . , bn. Then for any positive reals x1, . . . , xn, ∑ sym x a1 1 x a2 2 · · · x an n ≥ ∑ sym x b1 1 x b2 2 · · · x bn n where the sums are taken over all permutations of n variables. Remark - Although Muirhead’s theorem is a named theorem, it is generally not favorably regarded as part of a formal olympiad solution. Essentially, the majorization criterion guarantees that Muir- head’s inequality can be deduced from a suitable application of AM-GM. Hence, whenever possible, you should use Muirhead’s inequality only to deduce the correct relationship and then explicitly write all of the necessary applications of AM-GM. For a particular case this is a simple matter. Also note the Trivial Inequality, which states that x2 ≥ 0. 2 Techniques One valuable technique, known as dumbassing, involves clearing all of the dominators and then employing AM-GM, Schur, and sometimes other inequalities. It should be avoided if possible while practicing, but during a contest, if you can ﬁnd a dumbass solution there is no real reason not to use it. Another technique is called homogenization. Here the idea is that, if all terms have an equal degree (the inequality is homogenous), then one can scale all of the variables until some inhomoge- nous condition (say, for example, abc = 1) holds. Smoothing is where you show (rigorously!) that the inequality is “least” true (closest to the equality case) when two variables are equal, oftentimes while holding something, such as the sum of the two variables, ﬁxed). Substitutions can also help to simplify inequalities. In particular, x = 1 y can be useful to clear denominators, and a = x y , b = y z , c = z x can be used if abc = 1, or to guarantee that abc = 1. 2 3 Problems The only way to get better at Inequalities is to do lots of problems. Here are some to start you oﬀ (in all cases you may assume that variables are positive reals): 1. (a + b)(b + c)(c + a) ≥ 8abc. 2. Given abc = 1, then a + b + c ≥ 3. 3. a3 ≥ 3a − 2. 4. (a2 + 1)(b2 + 1) ≥ (a + b)2. 5. a3 + b3 + c3 + 3abc ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a + ab2 + bc2 + ca2. 6. (TMildorf) a + b + c ≤ a2 + b2 + c2 given abc = 1. 7. ∑ sym a5b2c ≥ ∑ sym a3b3c2. 8. (Tony Liu) x2 + 2 x ≥ 3. 9. Given abc ≥ a + b + c, then abc ≥ 3√3. 10. (Titu Andreescu) a2 b2 + b2 c2 + c2 a2 ≥ b a + c b + a c . 11. (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) ≥ (a + b + c)3. 12. (USAMO 04/5) (a5 − a2 + 3)(b5 − b2 + 3)(c5 − c2 + c) ≥ (a + b + c)3. 13. (MOP) Given a1 + . . . an = 1, then n∏ i=1 1 − ak i ak i ≥ (nk − 1) n for any positive integer k. 14. (Aaron Pixton) Given abc = 1, then 5 + a b + b c + c a ≥ (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c). 15. (TMildorf) Given a1 . . . an = 1, then 1 1 + a1 + . . . + 1 1 + an ≤ a1 + . . . + an + n 4 . 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
