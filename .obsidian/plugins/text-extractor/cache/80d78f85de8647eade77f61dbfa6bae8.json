Prove that 1 − 1 n < an < 1. Solution: The expression ak = ak−1 + a2 k−1 n (1) seems rather hard to work with so let us think about how we can rewrite it. If we multiply both sides by n and factor out ak−1 on the right side, we get: nak = ak−1(n + ak−1) ⇔ ak ak−1 = n + ak−1 n (2) and if we divide (1) by akak−1, we get: 1 ak−1 = 1 ak + ak−1 ak · 1 n (3) Substituting (2) into (3) and rearranging, we have: 1 ak−1 − 1 ak = 1 n + ak (4) which is much simpler. If we add (4) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n we get: 1 a0 − 1 an = n∑ k=1 1 n + ak ⇔ 1 an = 2 − n∑ k=1 1 n + ak (5) Thus now it suﬃces to show n−2 n−1 < ∑n k=1 1 n+ak < 1. The second inequality is easy - using (1) and a0 > 0 we have 0 < a0 < a1 < . . . < an, so n + ak > n for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. To prove the ﬁrst inequality we note that since an < 1, it follows that ak < 1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ n and thus 1 n+ak > 1 n+1 , so ∑n k=1 1 n+ak > n n+1 > n−2 n−1 and we are done. Comment: Let us try to explain some motivation for (4). Using just (1) and the fact that a0 = 0, it is diﬃcult to get much further than 0 < a0 < a1 < . . . < an - because of the order 2 terms a2 k n present, and it is not clear how to get a bound on them. How can we get rid of the order 2 terms? Divide both sides by akak−1 to get (3). We now have an expression for 1 ak−1 − 1 ak (which gives a telescoping sum), and it is equal to ak−1 ak · 1 n . While this is enough to give us an < 1 (check this yourself), we realize that more is needed to prove an > 1 − 1 n . At this point we make use of (1) again to get (2), and then (4). 1 Winter Camp 2012 Sequences Alexander Remorov Warm-up Problem 2: The sequence {an}∞ n=1 satisﬁes a1 = 1 and for n ≥ 1, a2n = an + 1; a2n+1 = 1 a2n Prove that every positive rational number occurs in the sequence exactly once. Solution: Let us start by writing out the ﬁrst few terms in the sequence. They are 1, 2, 1 2 , 3 2 , 2 3 , 5 3 , 3 5 . We notice that starting from the second term, the even-numbered terms are greater than 1, while the odd-numbered ones are less than 1. Proving this rigorously is straightforward with induction. Now, every positive rational number can be written as a b where a, b are positive integers with gcd(a, b) = 1. We will use double induction on a, b. The base case is a = b = 1 and is clear since a1 = 1. Assume now for positive integers a, b, satisfying gcd(a, b), we want to show a b ∈ {an}∞ n=1 and we know c d ∈ {an}∞ n=1 for all positive integers c, d satisfying c ≤ a − 1, d ≤ b or c ≤ a, d ≤ b − 1. We can assume a ̸= b (or else a = b = 1 and this case is already done.) If a > b, then a b > 1, so by our ﬁrst observation, we want to prove that a b = a2n for some n. But a2n = an + 1, so we want to prove an = a−b b for some n - which we know is true by the induction assumption. If b > a, then a b < 1, so by our ﬁrst observation, we want to prove a b = a2n+1 for some n. But a2n+1 = 1 a2n so we want to prove b a = a2n for some n - which we already know how to do - since an = b−a a for some n by the induction assumption. The induction step is complete, so every positive rational number occurs in the sequence at least once. Finally, we need to prove that no two terms in the sequence are the same. Assume we have am = an for some m ̸= n and m + n minimal. It is clear that m ̸= 1 and n ̸= 1 (as ak ̸= 1 for k > 1). Then by our ﬁrst observation m and n are both even, in which case a m 2 = a n 2 , or m and n are both odd, in which case am−1 = an−1. Thus in both cases we get a contradiction to the fact that m + n is minimal. Comment: We see the initial observation that for n ≥ 1, an > 1 if n is even, and an < 1 if n is odd, pretty much solved the problem. Playing around with the ﬁrst few terms in the sequence is always a good idea, especially if they are reasonably nice small numbers. Induction is another thing to keep in mind when faced with these types of problems (although its application is often more tricky than in this problem.) Problems on sequences come in all kinds of shapes and sizes. Solving these problems usually involves noticing some non-trivial facts about the sequence and then combining them to prove the desired property. Here are a few things you should consider when doing a problem on sequences: • Prove the sequence is increasing/decreasing/non-increasing/non-decreasing. • Prove the elements in the sequence are pairwise distinct. • Show the terms in the inﬁnite sequence take on ﬁnitely many values. Then you can ﬁnd two terms in the sequence that are equal to each other. • If you have a non-decreasing sequence of integers that is bounded, then it is eventually constant. • Prove that the sequence is periodic. 2 Winter Camp 2012 Sequences Alexander Remorov • (Usually does not work for non-trivial problems, but still worth a try) Write down the ﬁrst few terms in the sequence and try to see some kind of pattern. Then maybe use induction to prove this pattern holds. • Often you are required to prove a certain property about the nth term in the sequence. Using induction on n may do the trick. • Often a sequence is deﬁned recursively using a certain expression. It is often useful to play around with this expression and possibly rewrite it in another form. • Construct a new sequence from the given one. • Consider some term in the sequence satisfying a speciﬁc property. • (If it is possible) Look at the largest or smallest element in the sequence - especially useful if you are trying to show the sequence is constant. The problems below are approximately arranged in increasing order of diﬃculty. For sequence problems, where solutions are often short but somewhat ”random”, diﬀerent people may have very diﬀerent opinions about how diﬃcult a particular problem is. So I cannot guarantee that you will ﬁnd, say, problem 5, easier than problem 20. Hints are available at the end of the handout. Look at them only if you have worked on a problem for over an hour and still think you are stuck. There are a lot of problems, so it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to ﬁnish them all during the session (or before the end of the camp.) I strongly recommend to still try some problems you don’t get to today on your own time later this year. The best way to get good at solving sequence problems (considering that heavy machinery is rarely used) is to just do a lot of practice. Enjoy! 1 Problems 1.
