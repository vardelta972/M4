The two pairs of consecutive natural numbers (8, 9) and (288, 289) have the following property: in each pair, each number contains each of its prime factors to a power not less than 2. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many such pairs of consecutive natural numbers. 2. Suppose that N is a positive integer such that there are exactly 2005 ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers satisfying 1 x + 1 y = 1 N . Prove that N is a perfect square. 3. Find all quadruples (a, b, p, n) of positive integers such that p is prime and a3 + b3 = pn. 4. Does there exist a function f : N → N such that f (f (n)) = n 2 for all values of n? 5. Let f (n) = 1 + n + n2 + · · · + n 2010. Prove that for every integer m with 2 ≤ m ≤ 2010, there is no non-negative integer n such that f (n) is divisible by m. 6. An integer m is a perfect power if there exist positive integers a and n with n > 1 such that m = an. (a) Prove that there exist 2011 distinct positive integers such that no subset of them sums to a perfect power. (b) Prove that there exist 2011 distinct positive integers such that every subset of them sums to a perfect power. 7. Let p be a prime, and let q(x) be a polynomial with integer co-eﬃcients such that q(0) = 0, q(1) = 1, and q(n) is congruent to 0 or 1 mod p for all n ∈ N. Show that the degree of q is at least p − 1.
