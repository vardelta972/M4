Exercise 1: Factor each of the following polynomials over Z; x3 − y3, x4 + x2 + 1, x4 + 2x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1, 4x3 + 6x2 + 4x + 1, x5 + x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1. We recall a very elementary, yet important fact about ﬁnding linear factors of polynomials. Rational Roots Theorem: Let f (x) ∈ Z[x] and f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, with an ≥ 0. If f (r/s) = 0 for r, s ∈ Z, gcd(r, s) = 1. Then (sx − r) is a factor of f . Furthermore, if f (r/s) = 0, then r divides a0 and s divides an. If f (r/s) ̸= 0 for all r, s ∈ Z such that gcd(r, s) = 1 and r | a0 and s | an, then f has no linear factors. (Of course, f can still have non-linear factors, say, quadratic factors.) Deﬁnition: We say that a polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] is irreducible over Z if f (x) = g(x)h(x) implies at least one of g, h is a constant polynomial in Z[x]. We deﬁne irreducibility over R[x] and C[x] similarly. Fundamental Theorem of Algebra All polynomials f (x) ∈ R[x] factors completely and uniquely (up to order of factors) over C[x]. For all f (x) ∈ R[x] with degree n, we have f (x) = (x − α1) · · · (x − αn). for some α1, · · · , αn ∈ C. (The proof is omitted as it is diﬃcult to prove.) If α = a + bi with b ̸= 0 is a root of f , then α = a − bi, the conjugate of α is also a root of f . i.e. a polynomial always has an even number of non-real roots, where the non-real roots come in pairs in the form of conjugates. Irreducibility over R[x]: All polynomials f (x) ∈ R[x] factors over R[x] into linear and quadratic polynomials, where the roots of each quadratic polynomial are non-real and are conjugates of each other. Recall ax2 + bx + c = 0, a ̸= 0 is irreducible over R[x] if b2 − 4ac < 0. Exercise 2: Let f (x) ∈ R[x] be a polynomial such that f (x) ≥ 0 for all x ∈ R. Prove that f (x) can be written as the sum of two squares of real polynomials. i.e. f (x) = g(x) 2 + h(x) 2 for some a, b ∈ R[x]. (Hint: Recall Brahmagupta’s identity, which is (a2 + b2)(c2 + d2) = (ac + bd)2 + (ad − bc)2. ) 1 IMO 2009 Training: Polynomials 2 Irreducibility over Z[x]: It is in general diﬃcult to determine whether a polynomial in Z[x] is irreducible over Z[x]. Let a, b, c, d ∈ Z. • ax2 + bx + c, a ̸= 0 is irreducible over Z[x] if and only if b2 − 4ac is not a perfect square. • ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, a ̸= 0: If f (m/n) ̸= 0 for all m, n ∈ Z, n ̸= 0 and m|d and n|a, then f (x) is irreducible over Z[x]. For higher degree polynomials, it is in general diﬃcult to determine whether a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients is irreducible over Z[x]. We demonstrate a few irreducibility criterion in these notes. Keep in mind that these criterions only provide suﬃcient conditions for irreducibility, but not necessary conditions. Eisenstein’s Criterion: Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 ∈ Z[x]. Suppose there is a prime number p such that p ∤ an, p|ai for all i = 0, 1, 2, · · · , n − 1 and p2 does not divide a0. Then f (x) is irreducible. Proof: Suppose f (x) = g(x)h(x). Let g(x) = r∑ i=0 bix i and h(x) = s∑ j=0 cjx j where br, cs ̸= 0. Since p divides b0c0 but p2 does not, exactly one of b0, c0 is divisible by p. Without loss of generality, suppose b0 is divisible by p. Let t be the smallest index such that p ∤ bt. This must hold and 0 ≤ t < r since p ∤ an which implies p ∤ br. Since p ∤ c0, we have that p ∤ btc0 + bt−1c1 + · · · + b0ct since p divides all terms except btc0. But this right-hand term is the coeﬃcient of xt in f (x), which is divisible by p. This is a contradiction. Therefore, f is irreducible. i.e. f (x) = x3 + 9x2 − 6x + 3 is irreducible over Z[x]. Exercise 3: Let p be a prime. Prove that xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + 1 is irreducible over Z[x]. (Hint: Replace x with x + 1). We say that α ∈ C is algebraic if there exists a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that f (α) = 0. Otherwise, α is said to be transcendental. It is true (but diﬃcult to prove) that e and π are transcendental. Another fact that is important but non-trivial to prove is that if α and β are algebraic, then α + β and αβ are also algebraic. Suppose α ∈ C be an algebraic element and let f (x) be the polynomial of minimum degree such that f (α) = 0. Then f (x) is unique. We call this polynomial the minimal polynomial over α. 2 IMO 2009 Training: Polynomials 3 Examples: • If α = a/b ∈ Q, then bx − a is the minimal polynomial of a/b • If α = a + b√D where a, b ∈ Q and D is not a perfect square, then x2 − 2a + (a2 − bD2) = 0 is the minimal polynomial of α. • Let α = cis(2π/p), which is a root of xp − 1. Then by Exercise 3, the minimal polynomial of α is xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + x + 1. Exercise 4: Find the minimal polynomial for √2 + √3. Important Fact About Minimal Polynomials: Let α ∈ C be an algebraic element with minimal polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x]. Then if g ∈ Z[x] with g(α) = 0, then f (x) divides g(x). Note that this generalizes a part of the Rational Roots Theorem. Lagrange Interpolation: Recall that n + 1 distinct pairs (ai, bi) (with ai distinct) determine a unique polynomial f ∈ R[x] with f (ai) = bi. It is determined by the polynomial f (x) = n+1∑ i=1 ∏ j̸=i (x − aj) ∏ j̸=i (aj − ai) · bi. It is easy to check that f (ai) = bi in this equation. This is called Lagrange Interpolation. Exercise 5: Let f (x) be a polynomial with degree 2008 such that f (n) = 2n for n = 0, 1, · · · , 2008. Find f (2009). Suppose α1, · · · , αn are the roots of a polynomial. (We are allowing repeated roots.) We can con- struct the polynomial of degree n that has α1, · · · , αn as roots. (This polynomial is of course unique up to a non-zero constant multiple.) Exercise 6: Let f (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 and α1, · · · , αn be the roots of this polynomial. Prove that (a) α1 + α2 + · · · + αn = (−1) · an−1 (b) α1α2 · · · αn = (−1)na0. (c) Let t be an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ n. Prove that ∑ S⊆{1,···,n},|S|=t (∏ i∈S ai ) = (−1) tαn−t. Let ft(α1, · · · , αn) be the expression on the left-hand side of c. This expression is called the degree 3 IMO 2009 Training: Polynomials 4 t elementary symmetric polynomials on n variables. For example, the degree 1, 2, 3 elementary symmetric functions on α1, α2, α3 are α1 + α2 + α3, α1α2 + α2α3 + α3α1, α1α2α3, respectively. Fundamental Theorem of Elementary Symmetric Polynomials: Every symmetric polynomial with n variables α1, · · · , αn can be written as a combination (via addition and multiplication) of the elementary symmetric polynomials on n variables. For example, the symmetric polynomial x3 + y3 + z3 and be written as x3 + y3 + z3 = (x + y + z)3 − 3(x + y + z)(xy + yz + zx) + 3xyz. The point of this theorem is not to know the proof, but rather knowing that you can write any symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric polynomials. These elementary symmet- ric polynomials reveal the polynomial whose roots are the n variables. Try solving the following equations, particularly 7(b). Exercise 7a: Solve the following system of equations: (Note that solutions are in C) x + y + z = 6 xy + yz + zx = 11 xyz = 6 . Exercise 7b: Solve the following system of equations: x + y + z = 3 x2 + y2 + z2 = 3 x3 + y3 + z3 = 3 . We ﬁnish oﬀ this section by presenting three other irreducible criterion. We will prove one of them. We will simply state the remaining two since the proofs of these criterion are long. 4 IMO 2009 Training: Polynomials 5 Polynomials with Constant Terms Which Are Prime and Large Compared With Other Coeﬃcients, are Irreducible. Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that |a0| is prime and |a0| > |a1| + |a2| + · · · + |an|. Then f is irreducible. Proof: We ﬁrst prove that if α ∈ C is a root of f , then |α| > 1. Suppose |α| ≤ 1. Then f (α) = 0 implies that a0 = −(anαn + an−1αn−1 + · · · + a1α). Hence, |a0| = |anαn + · · · + a1α| ≤ |anαn| + · · · + |a1α| < |αn| + · · · + |α1| which contradicts the statement in the problem. Therefore, |α| > 1 for all roots α of f . Finally, suppose f = gh where g, h are non-constant polynomials. Since |a0| is prime, we have that one of the constant terms of g, h is equal to ±1. Without loss of generality, suppose the constant term of g is ±1. Let b be the leading coeﬃcient of g. Let α1, · · · , αt be the roots of g. Since the constant term of g is 1 and the leading coeﬃcient of g is b, we have that |α1α2 · · · αt| = 1/|b| ≤ 1. This implies that |αi| ≤ 1 for some i. But αi is also a root of f and we proved that |αi| > 1. This is a contradiction. Therefore, f is irreducible. □ Perron’s Criterion - Second Coeﬃcient is Large Compared of a Monic Polynomial with Other Coeﬃcients Let f (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients with a0 ̸= 0 and |an−1| > 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|. Then f (x) is irreducible. Cohn’s Criterion - Prime Numbers in Base b Representation Form Irreducible Poly- nomials Let p be a prime number and b ≥ 2 be an integer. Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients where p = anan−1 · · · a0, is the base-b representation of p. i.e. 0 ≤ ai < p such that p = n∑ i=0 aipi. Then f (x) is irreducible. Finally, onto the problem set. Warm-Up Problems The following are a list of facts about polynomials that you need to know oﬀ the top oﬀ your head and how to prove them. 1.

Let n be a positive integer. We deﬁne the set Zn = {0, 1, 2, · · · , n − 1} where addition and multiplication are performed modulo n. We can also deﬁne polynomials over Zn[x]. For example, x2 − 1 ≡ x2 + 4 mod 5 since −1 ≡ 4 mod 5. Formally, we say that two poly- nomials f (x), g(x) are congruent modulo n if their corresponding coeﬃcients diﬀer by a multiple of n. We will primarily focus on the case when n = p, a prime. An interesting thing occurs when we con- sider irreducible polynomials modulo p. We know that x2 +1 is irreducible over Z[x]. However, note that we can factor x2 +1 over Z5[x]. This is because x2 +1 = x2 −4 = (x−2)(x+2) = (x+3)(x+2). (Remember everything is taken modulo 5. So 5 is equal to 0 modulo 5.) In the following exercise, we see the even though irreducible polynomials over Z[x] can factor over Zp[x] for some primes p, it is possible that these polynomials remain irreducible over Zp[x] for other primes p. Exercise 8: Let p be a prime number. Prove that x2 + 1 is irreducible over Zp[x] if and only if p ≡ 3 mod 4. You may ask at this point why we are more interested in polynomials modulo primes rather than simply positive integers. There are certain properties that make factorization over Zp[x] easier if p is prime. For example, a version of the Rational Roots Theorem remain true when factorization is done over Zp[x]. Rational Roots Theorem for Polynomials Modulo p: Let p be a prime and f be a polynomial in Zp[x]. Suppose f (a) = 0 for some a ∈ Zp. Then (x − a) is a factor of f . Polynomials factor uniquely over Zp[x]. We can also say something about the number of roots of a polynomial in Zp[x]. Unique Factorization for Polynomials Modulo p: Let p be a prime and f be a polynomial in Zp[x]. Then f factors uniquely (up to order) into irreducible polynomials over Zp[x]. Lagrange’s Theorem For Roots of Polynomials Modulo p: Let p be a prime, n be a non-negative integer and f be a non-zero polynomial in Zp[x] of degree n. Then f contains at most n roots in Zp. Note that Unique Factorization and Lagrange’s Theorem does not hold if over Zn[x] if n is com- posite. For example, consider x2 − 1 over Z8[x]. Note that x 2 − 1 = (x − 1)(x − 7) = (x − 3)(x − 5). Furthermore, note that x = 1, 3, 5, 7 are all roots of x2 − 1. So this polynomial has degree 2 but has four roots in Z8. Make sure you are working over Zp before you apply Lagrange’s Theorem and 10 IMO 2009 Training: Polynomials 11 Unique Factorization, the latter fact we often take for granted. Solve the following exercise and keep Fermat’s Little Theorem in mind when you are solving it. Exercise 9: Let p be a prime number. (a) What are all p roots of the polynomial xp − x over Zp[x]? (b) What are all p − 1 roots of the polynomial xp−1 − 1 over Zp[x]? (c) From (b), use a previous exercise to prove Wilson’s Theorem, i.e. (p − 1)! ≡ −1 mod p. (d) Given 1 ≤ t < p, prove that ft(1, 2, · · · , p − 1) is divisible by p. Speciﬁcally, prove that the sum of all pairwise products from the set {1, 2, · · · , p − 1} is divisible by p. Exercises: 1. Let p be a prime. Prove the existence of a primitive root modulo p, i.e. there exists a positive integer g such that p − 1 is the smallest positive integer such that gp−1 ≡ 1 mod p. 2. (USA TST 2005) Let n be a positive integer. Consider the set S of all monic polynomials f (x) of degree n, whose coeﬃcients are chosen from {1, 2, 3, , · · · , n!}. Find the number of polyno- mials in S with the property that for every integer k > 1, the sequence f (1), f (2), f (3), · · · contains inﬁnitely many integers relatively prime to k. 3. (China TST 2009) Let p be an odd prime number. Prove that the number of positive integers n such that p divides n! + 1 is at most cp2/3 where c is a constant independent of p. 4. (USA TST 2008) Let n be a positive integer. Given a polynomial f (x) with integer coeﬃcients, deﬁne its signature modulo n to be the ordered sequence f (1), f (2), · · · , f (n) modulo n.
