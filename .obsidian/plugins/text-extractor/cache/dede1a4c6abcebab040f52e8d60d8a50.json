For which values, if any, of the positive integer n is n(4n + 1) a perfect square? 2. A square ABCD with sides of length 1 is labeled with A in the lower left corner, and proceeding counter- clockwise. A horizontal line segment EW (E at the left), and a vertical line segment N S (N at the top), both of length 1/2 lie entirely inside the square, and intersect at a point X. What is the sum of the areas of the triangles EDN , SEA, W SB and N W C? 3. Let A be a subset of {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2010} having the property that the diﬀerence of any two elements of A is not a prime number. What is the largest possible number of elements of A? (Note, 1 is not a prime number). 4. In △ABC, ∠CAB = 2∠ABC. Let the side lengths of BC, CA and AB be a, b and c respectively. Prove that a2 = b(b + c). 5. Let x and y be two integers such that x2 + 2y is a perfect square. Prove that x2 + y is a sum of two perfect squares. 6. At a certain math camp there were four times as many boys as girls (sad, but true). One day, all the students sat down around a circular table. One of the adults noticed that among the pairs of students sitting next to each other there were three times as many pairs of the same sex as there were pairs of opposite sexes. What is the smallest possible number of students who were attending the camp? Senior Division 1. Let k be a positive integer. Show that the number of powers of 2 that have k digits in decimal notation is at least three and at most four. Given that the largest power of 2 which is less than 10 2009 is 26673, for how many k between 1 and 2009 inclusive, are there four powers of 2 that have k digits? 2. Let a, b, c and d be integers. Show that the equation x2 + ax + b = y2 + cy + d has inﬁnitely many integer solutions (x, y) if and only if a 2 − 4b = c2 − 4d. 3. Let A, B, C, D, E, F and G be seven consecutive vertices of a regular dodecagon. Segments AF and BG intersect at point P , lines AC and GE meet at point Q, and lines AB and GF meet at point R. Show that P is the orthocentre, and Q is the circumcentre, of triangle ARG. [A triangle’s orthocentre is the point of intersection of its altitudes, and its circumcentre is the centre of the circumscribed circle.] 4. Let a number x ̸= 0, 1, and a positive integer n be given. A sequence of numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . , an is deﬁned by: a0 = x, a1 = 1 − x, and ak = 1 − ak−1(1 − ak−1) for k = 2, 3, . . . , n. Prove that: a0a1 · · · an ( 1 a0 + 1 a1 + · · · + 1 an ) = 1. 5. Let ABC be a triangle, and let Γ be its circumcircle. Suppose that a circle with centre O is tangent to the segment BC at a point P , and to the circle Γ at Q which lies in the arc of Γ determined by BC not containing A. Finally suppose that ∠BAO = ∠CAO. Prove that ∠P AO = ∠QAO. 6. There were 20 players at a chess tournament. Each player played every other player exactly once, and either one of them won, or the game was a draw. It so happened that if a game ended in a draw, then each of the other 18 players beat at least one of the two players involved in the draw. At least two games ended in a draw. Show that it is possible to order the players as P1, P2, . . . , P20 so that Pk beat Pk+1 for each k from 1 to 19 inclusive.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
