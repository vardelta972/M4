For which values, if any, of the positive integer n is n(4n + 1) a perfect square? Solution Suppose that n(4n + 1) were a perfect square. Since n and 4n + 1 have no common factors, it would be the case that for some integers x and y, n = x 2, 4n + 1 = y2. But then 4n = 4x 2 = (2x) 2 is also a perfect square, and so we have two perfect squares which diﬀer by 1. However, the minimum diﬀerence between positive perfect squares is 3 so this is impossible. Alternatively, without using the condition about common factors, since n(4n + 1) > (2n) 2, if it were a perfect square it would have to be the square of a number greater than or equal to 2n + 1. But, (2n + 1) 2 = 4n2 + 4n + 1 > 4n2 + n = n(4n + 1). Hence, n(4n + 1) can never be a perfect square. 2. A square ABCD with sides of length 1 is labeled with A in the lower left corner, and proceeding counter- clockwise. A horizontal line segment EW (E at the left), and a vertical line segment N S (N at the top), both of length 1/2 lie entirely inside the square, and intersect at a point X. What is the sum of the areas of the triangles EDN , SEA, W SB and N W C? Solution Consider the diagram below. The quadrilateral N ESW has area 1/8 since it divides the indicated square into four triangles, each paired with a congruent triangle to form the entire square. The sum of the areas of triangles DN C and BSA is 1/4 since each has base of length 1 and their altitudes sum to 1/2. Similarly, the sum of the areas of triangles DAE and BW C is also 1/4. The four triangles whose areas we wish to sum form the remainder of the square ABCD after the previously mentioned ﬁgures have been removed and the sum of their areas is therefore: 1 − 1/8 − 1/4 − 1/4 = 3/8. 3. Let A be a subset of {1, 2, 3, . . . , 2010} having the property that the diﬀerence of any two elements of A is not a prime number. What is the largest possible number of elements of A? (Note, 1 is not a prime number). Solution Suppose that a ∈ A. Then none of a + 2, a + 3, a + 5, a + 7 can belong to A, and among a + 1, a + 4 and a + 6 at most one can belong to A. So, of the eight numbers from a to a + 7 inclusive, at most 2 belong to A. Therefore, the maximum number of elements possible in A is not more than the integer part of 2010/4 plus 1, namely 503. And, it is easy to ﬁnd such a set, for instance {1, 5, 9, 13, . . . , 2009}. 4. In △ABC, ∠CAB = 2∠ABC. Let the side lengths of BC, CA and AB be a, b and c respectively. Prove that a 2 = b(b + c). Solution Let D be the point of intersection of the angle bisector of ∠BAC with BC. Consider the ﬁgure below Since ∠DAB = (1/2)∠CAB = ∠ABC, AD = BD = x (say). Let CD = y. Since ∠DAC = ∠ABC and ∠CDA = ∠DBA + ∠BAD = 2∠ABC = ∠CAB, the two triangles ABC and DAC are similar. So c/x = b/y = a/b. Therefore b(b + c) = b2 + cb = ay + ax = a 2 as required. 5. Let x and y be two integers such that x 2 + 2y is a perfect square. Prove that x 2 + y is a sum of two perfect squares. Solution Let x 2 + 2y = z2. Then y = (z2 − x 2)/2, so x 2 + y = x 2 + z2 2 . Now x 2 + z2 2 = (x + z) 2 + (x − z) 2 4 = ( x + z 2 )2 + ( x − z 2 )2 . Since z2 − x 2 = 2y is even, z and x are either both even or both odd, so this ﬁnal expression is a sum of two perfect squares. 6. At a certain math camp there were four times as many boys as girls (sad, but true). One day, all the students sat down around a circular table. One of the adults noticed that among the pairs of students sitting next to each other there were three times as many pairs of the same sex as there were pairs of opposite sexes. What is the smallest possible number of students who were attending the camp? Solution Let the number of girls be g, so the number of boys is 4g. If there are x opposite sex pairs, then there are 4x pairs all together. But, the number of pairs is also equal to the total number of students. So 5g = 4x. Therefore, g must be a multiple of 4 and the least potential number of students is 20. But, if that were indeed possible there would be 5 opposite sex pairs. However, the number of opposite sex pairs must always be even, since one occurs between each block of girls and boys, and reading around the circle there are an even number of blocks all together (since the number of girl blocks is the same as the number of boy blocks). That leaves us with a smallest possibility of 40 students including 8 girls, and needing 10 opposite sex pairs, i.e. 5 blocks of boys and girls respectively (so one possibility would be (4G)BGBGBGBG(28B).) Senior Division 1. Let k be a positive integer. Show that the number of powers of 2 that have k digits in decimal notation is at least three and at most four. Given that the largest power of 2 which is less than 102009 is 26673, for how many k between 1 and 2009 inclusive, are there four powers of 2 that have k digits? Solution For the ﬁrst part, note that the ﬁrst power of 2 that has k digits lies between 10k−1 and 2 × 10k−1. Denote this power of 2 by pk. Then all three of pk, 2pk and 4pk have k digits. The number 8pk might have k or k + 1 digits, but the number 16pk > 10k and so it certainly does not have k digits. So, either three or four powers of two have k digits. For the second part, from the given information, there are 6674 powers of 2 having 2009 or fewer digits. Since 6674 = 3 × 2009 + 647 there must be 647 values of k between 1 and 2009 for which there are four powers of 2 with k digits. 2. Let a, b, c and d be integers. Show that the equation x 2 + ax + b = y2 + cy + d has inﬁnitely many integer solutions (x, y) if and only if a 2 − 4b = c 2 − 4d. Solution If a 2 − 4b = c 2 − 4d then a and c are either both even or both odd. In either case, (a − c)/2 is an integer. Given any integer x, we can deﬁne y = x − (a − c)/2, so y − c/2 = x − a/2 and thus: x 2 + ax + b = (x − a/2) 2 − (a 2 − 4b)/4 = (y − c/2) 2 − (c 2 − 4d)/4 = y2 + cy + d. Conversely, suppose that the equality does not hold and set k = (a 2 − 4b) − (c 2 − 4d). Then, for any solution to the given equation we get (after multiplying by four and completing the squares): (2x + a) 2 − (a 2 − 4b) = (2y + c) 2 − (c 2 − 4d) (2x + a) 2 − (2y + c) 2 = (a 2 − 4b) − (c 2 − 4d) (2x + 2y + a + c)(2x − 2y + a − c) = k. But k has only ﬁnitely many diﬀerent factorizations, and every such factorization determines at most one solution to the equation, so the equation has only ﬁnitely many solutions. 3. Let A, B, C, D, E, F and G be seven consecutive vertices of a regular dodecagon. Segments AF and BG intersect at point P , lines AC and GE meet at point Q, and lines AB and GF meet at point R. Show that P is the orthocentre, and Q is the circumcentre, of triangle ARG. [A triangle’s orthocentre is the point of intersection of its altitudes, and its circumcentre is the centre of the circumscribed circle.] Solution Consider the diagram below. Both ∠ABG and ∠GF A are right, since AG is the diameter of a circle on which both B and F lie. Hence P is the intersection of two of the altitudes of △ARG, and so is its orthocentre. To show that Q is its circumcenter we will compute the angles AQG and ARG. Since ∠AGQ = ∠AGE and arc AE subtends one third of the circle, ∠AGQ = 60 ◦. By symmetry, or the same argument ∠GAQ = 60 ◦, and so ∠AQG = 60 ◦ also. Similary, ∠BAG and ∠RGA are each (5/12)×180◦ and hence ∠ARG = (2/12)×180◦ = 30 ◦. Clearly Q lies on the perpendicular bisector of AG, and as the angle subtended there by AG is twice the angle subtended at R, it must be the center of the circumcircle of ARG. 4. Let a number x ̸= 0, 1, and a positive integer n be given. A sequence of numbers a0, a1, a2, . . . , an is deﬁned by: a0 = x, a1 = 1 − x, and ak = 1 − ak−1(1 − ak−1) for k = 2, 3, . . . , n. Prove that: a0a1 · · · an ( 1 a0 + 1 a1 + · · · + 1 an ) = 1. Solution Rewriting the deﬁnition of ak we have 1 − ak = ak−1(1 − ak−1) = ak−1ak−2(1 − ak−3) · · · = ak−1ak−2 · · · a1(1 − a1) = ak−1ak−2 · · · a1a0 That is, ak = 1 − a0a1 · · · ak−1. Now we will actually prove that for all 1 ≤ k ≤ n, a0a1 · · · ak ( 1 a0 + 1 a1 + · · · + 1 ak ) = 1. This is certainly true for k = 1 since x(1 − x) ( 1 x + 1 1 − x ) = 1. Suppose that it is true for some value j of k. Then, for k = j + 1 we have: a0a1 · · · aj+1 ( 1 a0 + 1 a1 + · · · + 1 aj+1 ) = a0a1 · · · aj ( 1 a0 + 1 a1 + · · · + 1 aj ) aj+1 + a0a1a2 · · · aj = aj+1 + a0a1a2 · · · aj = 1 as claimed. In particular the result holds for k = n which is what we wanted to prove. 5. Let ABC be a triangle, and let Γ be its circumcircle. Suppose that a circle with centre O is tangent to the segment BC at a point P , and to the circle Γ at Q which lies in the arc of Γ determined by BC not containing A. Finally suppose that ∠BAO = ∠CAO. Prove that ∠P AO = ∠QAO. Solution We assume that AB ̸= AC (because in that case, the two angles we are concerned with are both 0 ◦). In the diagram below, M is the midpoint of arc BC, O′ is the centre of Γ (this is almost on AC as it happens, but it’s a tough diagram to get right without some coincidences!), and P ′ is the other end of the diameter of Γ through M . Since ∠CAO = ∠BAO, the extension of AO must meet the circle Γ at the midpoint of arc BC, i.e. at M . Thus AOM are collinear. Also QOO′ are collinear since the two circles share a common tangent at Q. We claim further that P ′P Q are collinear. To see this, denote temporarily by R the intersection of of P ′Q and the smaller circle (we aim to show that R = P ). Then ∠M P ′R = ∠0′P ′Q = ∠O′QR = ∠OQR = ∠ORQ, where the ﬁrst and third of these equalities simply arise from taking diﬀerent points on the corresponding rays, and the second and fourth from the fact that any triangle with two vertices on a circle and the third at its centre is isosceles. But this implies that OR is parallel to M P ′. But M P ′ is perpendicular to BC, and so R must coincide with P the point of tangency of the small circle with BC. Now, for the same reasons as above we get: ∠QP ′M = ∠QP ′0′ = ∠O′QP ′ = ∠OQP = ∠QP O and also ∠QP ′M = ∠QAO as they both subtend QM on Γ. So ∠QAO = ∠QP O. Therefore, QOAP are concyclic, hence ∠P QO = ∠P AO. But, ∠P QO = ∠QP O = ∠QAO, and we get ∠P AO = ∠QAO as required. 6. There were 20 players at a chess tournament. Each player played every other player exactly once, and either one of them won, or the game was a draw. It so happened that if a game ended in a draw, then each of the other 18 players beat at least one of the two players involved in the draw. At least two games ended in a draw. Show that it is possible to order the players as P1, P2, . . . , P20 so that Pk beat Pk+1 for each k from 1 to 19 inclusive. Solution We ﬁrst show that each contestant took part in at most one draw. Suppose otherwise and that A drew with both B and C. Since A drew with B, C must beat either A or B, but drew with A, so beat B. But now B beat neither A nor C who drew with one another, so the conditions of the problem aren’t satisﬁed. Thus, each player can play in at most one draw. Now consider the longest possible sequence of players P1, P2, . . . , Pt with Pk losing to Pk+1 for k from 1 to t − 1 inclusive. We aim to show that t = 20. So, for the sake of contradiction, suppose otherwise, and let A be a player who is not in the sequence. Then P1 cannot have beaten A or we could add A at the beginning of the sequence (contradicting the fact that it was “longest possible”). If A beat P1, then A did not draw with P2 (since P1 lost to both). If A beat P1 and lost to P2, we could add A between P1 and P2 (again a contradiction). So, if A beat P1, then A beat P2 as well. But the same argument now applies showing that A must beat P3, then P4 etc., and hence that A can be added at the end of the sequence, yet another contradiction. So, the only remaining possibility is that A drew with P1. But P1 drew with at most one player, so we must have t = 19 (otherwise we could choose a diﬀerent player B not belonging to the sequence, who would also have to draw with P1 for a contradiction.) If A beat P2 we can repeat the argument above to show that A could be added at the end of the sequence. So A lost to P2, and indeed must have lost to all of P2 through P19. But, there were at least two draws – there must be a draw between Pi and Pj for some i, j ≥ 2. However, A beats neither of these, ﬁnally contradicting one of the conditions of the problem. We conclude that we must have a sequence of players of the type required.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
