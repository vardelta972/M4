Bezout’s theorem, Modular inverse, Wilson’s theorem 3. Chinese Remainder Theorem Notation: a^b denotes a to the power b. Problems we discussed: Example 1. Find all prime p such that p^2 divides . First note that p cannot be 5. phi(p^2) = p^2 - p. By Euler’s theorem, 5^phi(p^2) = 1 (mod p^2) => 5^(p^2 -p) = 1(mod p^2) (as phi(p^2)=p^2-p) => 5^(p^2) = 5^p (mod p^2) => -1 = 5^p (mod p^2) => p | 5^p +1 But p | 5^p - 5. So, we get p | 6 => p = 2 or 3. Now check for p = 2 or 3. If p = 2, 5^4 + 1 = 1+1 = 2 (mod 4). If p = 3, 5^9 + 1 = (-1)^3 + 1 = 0 (mod 9). Ans: p = 3. Example 2. Prove that there exists infinitely many composite numbers of the form , where n is a positive integer. If we can find some prime p such that this is divisible by p for infinitely many n, then we are through. For any odd prime p, (4^(p-1) +1)^2 +4 = (1+1)^2 +4 = 8 (mod p). But we want it to be 0 mod p, which is possible only if p=2. So this attempt fails! Lets try with n=p-1+a. By Fermat's theorem, 4^(p-1+a)=4^a(mod p) => (4^(p-1+a)+1)^2 + 4 = (4^a + 1)^2 + 4 = 0 (mod p) (We want) Note that for a=1, (4^a + 1)^2 + 4 = 29, so just take p=29. Fix p=29. Note that for n=(p-1)k +1, Fermat’s theorem gives 4^n = 4^((p-1)k+1) = 4^1 (mod p). => (4^n +1)^2 +4 = (4+1)^2 + 4 = 29 = 0 (mod p). Thus, we get infinitely such n, namely n=(p-1)k+1, where k is any non-negative integer. 5 p 2 + 1 (2 2n + 1) 2 + 4 Suppose a and n are coprime. Then ax + ny = 1 for some x, y. This gives ax = 1 (mod n). Such an x is called an inverse of a modulo n. This x will be unique modulo n. Why? Say ax = 1 = ay (mod n). This implies x = y (mod n) since a and n coprime. ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Example 3. Does there exist any natural number n for which the set {n+1, n+2,..., n+2010} can be partitioned into two subsets, say A and B, such that the product of elements of A and B are equal? Note that 2011 is a prime. Since these are 2010 many consecutive integers, at most one of them can be divisible by 2011. Case 1: One of them is divisible by 2011. Then exactly one among A or B gets 2011, say A (w.l.o.g). Then product of A is divisible by 2011, while product of B is not. So for such n, such a partitioning is not possible. Case 2: None of them is divisible by 2011. Then, mod 2011 they are just a permutation of 1,2,...,2010. So the product of the numbers = 2010! = -1 (mod 2011), by Wilson’s theorem. Product of all of them = Prod(A) Prod(B) = Prod(A)^2 = x^2 (say) This gives x^2 = -1 (mod 2011) Is it possible? No, because 2011 is a prime of the form -1 (mod 4). Conclusion: Such a partitioning is not possible, for any n. ———————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————— Chinese Remainder Theorem Suppose we want to find an integer x satisfying x = a (mod m) and x = b (mod n) Where m, n are coprime. How to find one such x? Is the solution unique? Way 1: x = a + mk = b - nl => mk + nl = b - a = c (say). Find integers k, l such that mk + nl = c. But how? Since m, n are coprime, we know how to find integers y, z such that my + nz = 1. Then, m(cy) + n(cz) = c (where c = b-a). Required x = a + mk = b - nl. Example: x = 4 (mod 7), x = 2 (mod 9). First step, find y, z such that 7y + 9z = 1. One solution: y = 4, z = -3. (by inspection/by Euclidean Algo.) Second step. x = 4 + 7k = 2 + 9l. So we want 7k - 9l = -2. 7*4 - 9*3 = 1 => 7*(-8) - 9*(-6) = -2. Take k = -8, l= -6. Our required x = 4 + 7(-8) = 2 + 9(-6) = -52 General solution: x = -52 + 7*9k = -52 + 63k. Way 2: Using modular inverses. Since m, n are coprime, each of them have modular inverse w.r.t the other. Means, mm’ = 1 (mod n) and nn’ = 1 (mod m) for some integers m’, n’. mod m mod n mm’ 0 1 nn’ 1 0 we want a b Take x = ann’ + bmm’. That will be a valid solution. General solution: x = x_0 + mn*k = ann’ + bmm’ + mn*k, k any integer. Chinese Remainder Theorem (basic version) Suppose we want to find an integer x satisfying x = a (mod m) and x = b (mod n) The theorem says that it has a solution when m, n are coprime, and the solution is unique modulo mn. x = a (mod m), x = b (mod n), x = c (mod k) x = x_0 (mod mn) , x = c (mod k) x = x_new (mod mnk). General solution: x = x_new + mnk*q, q integer. For general version of CRT, see K.Conrad’s note. Example 4. Show that for any natural number n, there exists a block of n consecutive integers, none of which is the power of a prime number. (Need not be power of the same prime number.) Can you tell any easy way to ensure a number is not the power of a prime? If you show that it is divisible by at least two primes, then we are done. Desired set: N+1, N+2, ... , N+n. Can we ensure that each N+j is divisible by two different primes? Lets start with 2n distinct primes. Say p_1, p_2, ... , p_2n. We want N + j to be divisible by p_{2j-1}, p_{2j}. We want p_1p_2 | N+1 => N = -1 (mod p_1 p_2) p_3p_4 | N+2 => N = -2 (mod p_3 p_4) . . . p_(2n-1) p_(2n) | N+n => N = -n (mod p_(2n-1) p_(2n)) By CRT, there exists such N. Hence we are done. Example 5. Let a and b be natural numbers such that a^n + n divides b^n + n for every natural number n. Prove that a = b. First, note that a ≤ b. Let, if possible a < b. Let us start with some prime p. (We will see what conditions need to put on p). Note, a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) if p does not divide a. Similar for b. Suppose p does not divide a and b. a^n = ?? (mod p) Say n = (p-1)k + r. a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) => a^n = a^r (mod p). Special case: r=1, i.e. p-1 | n-1. Then a^n = a (mod p). Same holds for b. a^n + n = n + a (mod p), b^n + n = n + b (mod p). If p | n+a, then p | a^n +n | b^n +n => b = a (mod p). What are the conditions we have put on p? (i) p does not divide a and b. (ii) Since b - a > 0, we can choose a prime p that does not divide b - a as well. What are the conditions we have put on n? (i) p | n + a, (ii) p - 1 | n - 1. Such n exists by CRT. Neat Solution: First, note that a ≤ b. Let, if possible a < b. Since b - a > 0, we can choose a prime p that does not divide a, b or b-a. Next, we find a natural number n such that n = 1 (mod p-1) and n = -a (mod p). By CRT, there exists such a natural number n. Now, by Fermat’s theorem, a^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) => a^(n-1) = 1 (mod p) => a^n + n = a + n = 0 (mod p). So, p divides a^n +n, and a^n +n divides b^n +n. Therefore, b^n +n = 0 (mod p). But, on the other hand, b^(p-1) = 1 (mod p) => b^(n-1) = 1 (mod p) => b^n +n = b + n (mod p). So, p | b+n and p | a+n => p | b-a, which is a contradiction! Therefore we conclude that b > a is not possible.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
