Let F be a collection of subsets A1, A2, . . . of {1, . . . , n}, such that for each i ̸= j, Ai ∩ Aj ̸= ∅. Prove that F has size at most 2 n−1. 2. Suppose that F above has size exactly 2n−1. Must there be a common element x ∈ {1, . . . , n} which is contained by every Ai? 3. Let F be a family of sets, each of size exactly 3, such that: (a) Every pair of sets intersects in a single element. (b) Every pair of elements in the ground set X = ⋃ L∈F S is contained in a unique set L ∈ F. Suppose that F has more than one set. Prove that the ground set X has exactly 7 elements, and show that such a family F exists. 2 Designs 1. (TST 2005/1.) Let n be an integer greater than 1. For a positive integer m, let Xm = {1, 2, . . . , mn}. Suppose that there exists a family F of 2n subsets of Xm such that: (a) each member of F is an m-element subset of Xm; (b) each pair of members of F shares at most one common element; (c) each element of Xm is contained in exactly 2 elements of F. Determine the maximum possible value of m in terms of n. 2. (USAMO 2011/6.) Let X be a set with |X| = 225. Suppose further that there are eleven subsets A1, . . . , A11 of X such that |Ai| = 45 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 11 and |Ai ∩ Aj| = 9 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 11. Prove that |A1 ∪ · · · ∪ A11| ≥ 165, and give an example for which equality holds. 3. A collection of subsets L1, . . . , Lm in the universe {1, . . . , n} is called a projective plane if: (a) Every pair of sets (called “lines”) intersects in a single element. (b) Every pair of elements in the ground set X = ⋃ L∈F S is contained in a unique set L ∈ F. Actually, there are two families of degenerate planes which satisfy the two conditions above, but are not considered to be projective planes. They are: (a) L1 = {1, . . . , n}, L2 = {1}, L3 = {1}, L4 = {1}, . . . (b) L1 = {2, 3, . . . , n}, L2 = {1, 2}, L3 = {1, 3}, L4 = {1, 4}, . . . , Ln = {1, n}. 1 It is well-known that for every projective plane, there is an N (called the “order” of the plane) such that: (a) Every line contains exactly N + 1 points, and every point is on exactly N + 1 lines. (b) The total number of points is exactly N 2 + N + 1, which is the same as the total number of lines. 4. For every prime power p n, there exists a projective plane of that order. 5. (Open.) What are the possible orders of projective planes? All known projective planes have prime power order, but it is unknown whether, for example, there is a projective plane of order 12. 3 Graphs and partitioning 1. Construct a bipartite graph in which all degrees are equal, and every pair of vertices on the same side has exactly 1 common neighbor. Show that this must achieve the maximum possible number of edges in any C4-free bipartite graph with the same number of vertices. 2. Construct a non-bipartite graph in which all degrees are equal, and every pair of vertices has exactly 1 common neighbor. Show that this must achieve the maximum possible number of edges in any C4-free graph with the same number of vertices. 3. Let n be odd. Partition the edge set of Kn into n matchings with n−1 2 edges each. 4. Let n be even. Partition the edge set of Kn into n − 1 matchings with n 2 edges each. 5. Find (nontrivial) inﬁnite families of t and n for which it is possible to partition the edges of Kn into disjoint copies of edges corresponding to Kt. 4 Extremal set theory 1. (Erd˝os-Ko-Rado.) Let n ≥ 2k be positive integers, and let C be a collection of pairwise-intersecting k-element subsets of {1, . . . , n}, i.e., every A, B ∈ C has A ∩ B ̸= ∅. Prove that |C| ≤ (n−1 k−1). Remark. This corresponds to the construction which takes all subsets that contain the element 1. 2. (Non-uniform Fisher’s inequality.) Let C = {A1, . . . , Ar} be a collection of distinct subsets of {1, . . . , n} such that every pairwise intersection Ai ∩ Aj (i ̸= j) has size t, where t is some ﬁxed integer between 1 and n inclusive. Prove that |C| ≤ n. 5 Combinatorics and geometry 1. (Happy ending problem.) Given any 5 distinct points in the plane, no 3 collinear, show that some 4 are in convex position, i.e., forming the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. 2. (Erd˝os-Szekeres.) For every integer n, there is some ﬁnite N such that the following holds. Given any N distinct points in the plane, no 3 collinear, some n are in convex position. Remark. It is conjectured that N = 1 + 2n−2 suﬃces for all n ≥ 3, and known that N ≥ 1 + 2 n−2 is required. The best known upper bound is of order 4n/√n. 3. (Caratheodory.) A convex combination of points xi is deﬁned as a linear combination of the form∑ i αixi, where the αi are non-negative coeﬃcients which sum to 1. Let X be a ﬁnite set of points in Rd, and let cvx(X) denote the set of points in the convex hull of X, i.e., all points expressible as convex combinations of the xi ∈ X. Show that each point x ∈ cvx(X) can in fact be expressed as a convex combination of only d + 1 points of X. 2 4. (Radon.) Let A be a set of at least d + 2 points in Rd. Show that A can be split into two disjoint sets A1 ∪ A2 such that cvx(A1) and cvx(A2) intersect. 5. (Helly.) Let C1, C2, . . . , Cn be sets of points in Rd, with n ≥ d + 1. Suppose that every d + 1 of the sets have a non-empty intersection. Show that all n of the sets have a non-empty intersection. 6 Bonus problems 1. (From Peter Winkler.) The 60 MOPpers were divided into 8 teams for Team Contest 1. They were then divided into 7 teams for Team Contest 2. Prove that there must be a MOPper for whom the size of her team in Contest 2 was strictly larger than the size of her team in Contest 1. 2. (MOP 2008.) Let F be a collection of 2 n−1 subsets A1, A2, . . . of {1, . . . , n}, such that for each i ̸= j ̸= k, Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak ̸= ∅. Prove that there is a common element x ∈ {1, . . . , n} that is contained in every Ai. 3. (Sperner capacity of cyclic triangle, also Iran 2006.) Let A be a collection of vectors of length n from Z3 with the property that for any two distinct vectors a, b ∈ A there is some coordinate i such that bi = ai + 1, where addition is deﬁned modulo 3. Prove that |A| ≤ 2n. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
