Theorems that Are good to know A lot of mileage can be gotten from the basic fact that the square of a real number a is non-negative. For instance, (a + b) 2 ≥ 0 → a 2 + b2 ≥ 2ab and we immediately derive the basic Am-Gm inequality. Likewise, consider the famous Cauchy − Schwartz − Inequality : ( n∑ i a 2 i )( n∑ i=1 b 2 i ) ≥ ( n∑ i=1 aibi) 2 To prove the inequality, just note that we can rewrite the RHS-LHS as n∑ i=1 n∑ j=1(aibj − ajbi) 2 which, being a sum of squares, is clearly positive. Another way to generalize the Am-Gm inequality is the following Am-Gm revised: xi ≥ 0 → x1 + x2 + ... + xn n ≥ ( n∏ i=1 xi) 1 n This generalized Am-Gm inequality can be deduced from the classical one easily for n a power of 2. For example, applying the classical Am-Gm twice, we get: a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 ≥ 2(a 2b2 + c 2d2) ≥ 4abcd which yields the case of n = 4. For powers of 2 one can repeat the same trick. For non-powers of 2, the best way to understand the above is by a special case of the equally useful Jensen’s inequality Suppose f(x) is a continuos function satisfying f (x)+f (y) 2 ≥ f ( x+y 2 ) for all x,y. Then for all xi, n∑ i=1 f (xi) ≥ nf ( x1 + x2 + ... + xn n ). The condition f (x) + f (y) ≥ 2f ( x+y 2 ) is known as convexity, and we say that f is a convex function. To become proﬁcient at Jensen’s, it’s good to know a bunch of convex functions. Here are 2 very useful examples. Note that if f (x) is convex, than cf (x) is convex as long as c ≥ 0. Negative c aren’t allowed!!! 1. x n for n ≥ 1 or n ≤ 0 and x ≥ 0 2. −sin(x) for 0 ≤ x ≤ π 1 Here are some more useful generalizations of Am-Gm. Weighted Am-Gm for wi ≥ 0 and xi ≥ 0, n∑ i=1 wixi ≥ n∏ i=1 x wi i Remark The weighted Am-Gm inequality is in some sense the most natural and convenient phras- ing of Am-Gm. Try proving it (or at least getting the idea of the proof, which is at leas as important) by ﬁrst doing the case of rational weights wi, and then deducing it for reals by continuity. Holders inequality for ai, bi, α, β ≥ 0, ( n∑ i=1 ai) α( n∑ i=1 bi) β ≥ ( n∑ i=1 a α α+β i b β α+β i ) α+β It is easy to get discouraged by the the generality of Holder’s inequality, but in prac- tise it very clean and intuitive, so it’s good to play around with examples so as to get comfortable with it. For example, use Holders to prove the following Excercise: Prove (a1 + a2)(b1 + b2)(c1 + c2) ≥ ((a1b1c1) 1 3 + (a2b2c2) 1 3 ) 3, if all variables are positive. Power-Mean inequality If x ≥ y > 0,and a1, a1, ., an ≥ 0, then ( a x 1 +a x 2 +...+a x n n ) 1 x ≥ ( a y 1 +a y 2 +...+a y n n ) 1 y This is actually a generalization of AM-GM, in the limiting case of x = 1, y = 0 No inequality toolbox is complete without knowing Schur’s inequality, which is a nice bridge from the Jensen-type inequalities we’ve been studying to rearrangement inequalities. Schur’s Inequality If a, b, c ≥ 0, then a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 3abc ≥ a 2b + b2a + a 2c + c 2a + b2c + c 2b An indication that Schur’s is powerful is that it cannot be deduced from Am-Gm, due to the ’weak’ term abc on the LHS. It is very instructive to go through the proof of Schur’s. To start, break symmetry by saying WLOG, a ≥ b ≥ c. The equation then rearranges as a(a − b)(a − c) + b(b − c)(b − a) + c(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 which we can then rearrange to (a − b)(a(a − c) − b(b − c)) + c(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 but this is clearly true, since every term on the LHS is positive(convince yourself of this!) The proof is very short, but these sort of proofs are tricky to come up with, since by ordering the variables the symmetry is lost. There are a few general inequalities based on the idea of ordering the variables. 2 Rearrangement inequality if a1 ≤ a2 ≤ ... ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bn and π is any permutation of 1, 2, ..., n then n∑ i=1 aibi ≥ n∑ i=1 aibπ(i) Chebychev’s inequality With same assumptions as above, then n∑ i=1 aibi ≥ (a1 + a2 + ... + an)(b1 + b2.. + bn) n Chebychev can of course be deduced with n applications of the rearrangement inequal- ity. One of the reasons that the above are so powerful is they make no assumptions on positivity! PROBLEMS 1. Prove for x ≥ 0, we have x 2 − 3 ≥ − 2 x 2.
