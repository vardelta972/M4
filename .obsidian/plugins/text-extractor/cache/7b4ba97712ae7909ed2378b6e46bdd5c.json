We shall begin this lecture with an introduction to polynomials, taken from the up- coming free and open source OMC Number Theory book. Note that about half of this lecture was taken from the book and the other half will probably be added to the book. This lecture goes from basic to intermediate and is good for a student of any level. I plan to write and release a more rigorous, advanced lecture that builds from this one and extends to domains that aren’t as standard as seen here. 1 Introductory Stuﬀ Deﬁnition 1.1: An integer polynomial, the only type we will deal with unless noted otherwise, is a function, P (x), of the form: P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + .... + a1x + a0 where an, an−1, . . . , a0 are integers. Deﬁnition 1.2: We can evaluate a polynomial for any number, y, by substituting y for x. P (y) = anyn + an−1yn−1 + .... + a1y + a0 For example, given that P (x) = x2 + 1, calculate P (2). P (2) = 22 + 1 = 5. Deﬁnition 1.3: A zero (or root) of a polynomial is a number t such that P(t)=0 For example, given P (x) = x2 − 1, ﬁnd the zeros (roots) of P (x). If t is a root of P (x), we have the following relationship: P (t) = t 2 − 1 = 0. So, we may simply solve the equation t 2 − 1 = 0. t 2 − 1 = 0 =⇒ t 2 = 1 =⇒ t = ±1. Note that =⇒ symbolizes the word “implies” OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 Deﬁnition 1.4: Factors of an integer polynomial, P (x), are integer polynomials, Q(x), such that P (x) can be expressed in terms of Q(x) and another integer polynomial, R(x), as P (x) = Q(x) · R(x). For example, let P (x) = x3 + x2 − x − 1. Since x3 + x2 − x − 1 = (x2 + 2x + 1)(x − 1) both x2 + 2x + 1 and x − 1 are factors of x3 + x2 − x − 1. Deﬁnition 1.5: An irreducible integer polynomial P is one whose only integer polynomial factors are ±1 and ±P . For example, let P (x) = x2 + x + 1. Since the only integer polynomial factors of x2 + x + 1 are ±(x2 + x + 1) and ±1, it is irreducible. Deﬁnition 1.6: The factorization of an integer polynomial, P (x), is the expression of P (x) as a product of irreducible integer polynomials. For example, let P (x) = x3 + x2 − x − 1. The factorization of P (x) is: P (x) = x3 + x2 − x − 1 = (x + 1)2(x − 1). Proposition 1.7: The zeros of the irreducible integer polynomials that an integer poly- nomial factors into are the zeros of that polynomial. Earlier we found that the zeros of x2 − 1 are ±1. The factorization of x2 − 1 is (x + 1)(x − 1). The zero of x + 1 is −1 and the zero of x − 1 is +1, giving us ±1. Theorem 1.8 (The Rational Root Theorem): Given the polynomial anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, all rational roots are in the form ± p q , where p is an integer factor of a0 and q is an integer factor of an. This theorem will help us ﬁnd the zeros of polynomials! Let’s try an example! Find the zeros of P (x) = 3x2 + 4x + 1. Applying the Rational Root Theorem, we have that the possible zeros of this polyno- mial are: ± 1 1,3. This means our possible roots are 1 1, − 1 1, 1 3, and − 1 3. We substitute these values for x in the polynomials to see which ones yield values of zero. We have that −1 and − 1 3 are the roots since P (−1) = 0 and P (− 1 3) = 0. Proposition 1.9 (The Relationship Between Roots and Factors in an Integer Polyno- mial): Given a root m n , gcd (m, n) = 1 (the fraction is completely reduced), of a polyno- mial, P (x), there is an irreducible integer polynomial factor of P (x) in the form (nx−m). 2 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 In the last example, we found that the zeros of P (x) = 3x2 + 4x + 1 are −1 and − 1 3. We treat −1 as − 1 1 and apply the relationship above: −1 1 is a root =⇒ (x + 1) is an irreducible integer factor of P (x) −1 3 is a root =⇒ (3x + 1) is an irreducible integer factor of P (x) Multiplying the two factors, we have (3x + 1) · (x + 1) = 3x2 + 4x + 1. We know that the product of all of the irreducible integer polynomial factors of a polynomial yields the polynomial. We also intuitively see that P (x) has at most two irreducible inte- ger polynomial factors as the highest powered term is x2 and the product of more than two irreducible integer polynomial factors will yield a highest powered term of at least x3. We know that P (x) = 3x2 + 4x + 1 and that P (x) = A(3x + 1) · (x + 1) for some nonzero constant A; a quick check would show that the second statement is true A = 1, so the proposition checked out positive! Deﬁnition 1.10: Given the polynomial P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + .... + a1x + a0, we deﬁne the degree of P (x) to be n, the highest power of any x term. If a polynomial is of 1st degree (highest powered term is a1x1), it is called monic. (The following theorem and examples are from Holden Lee’s January 29th, 2011 lec- ture on OMC concerning Polynomials.) Theorem 1.11 (Vieta’s Formula): Let r1, . . . , rn be the roots of P (x) = ∑n i=0 aixi, and let sj = ∑ 1≤i1<...<ij ≤n ri1 · · · rij . Then sj = (−1) j an−j an . Proof. We can factor the polynomial as P (x) = an(x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn). Dividing by an gives (xn + an−1 an xn−1 + · · · + a1 an x + a0 an ) = (x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn). In the expansion of the right-hand side, the terms containing xn−j are of the form (−ri1) · · · (−rij )xn−j—they contain a product of j roots. Summing them up, the co- eﬃcient of xn−j is (−1)jsj. Setting this equal to the coeﬃcient on the left-hand side, an−j an , gives the desired result. Example 1.12: Let r1, r2 be the roots of the quadratic ax2 + bx + c = 0. Find 1. r1 + r2 3 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 2. r2 1 + r2 2 3. r3 1 + r3 2 Solution. 1. From Vieta’s formula, r1 + r2 = − b a . 2. Also from Vieta’s formula, r1r2 = c a . We need to combine these two expressions in some way to form r2 1 + r2 2. The following identity does the trick. r2 1 + r2 2 = (r1 + r2) 2 − 2r1r2. Thus r2 1 + r2 2 = ( − b a )2 − 2 ( c a ) = b2−2ac a2 . 3. Noting the cube, we ﬁrst cube r1 + r2 to get r3 1 + 3r2 1r2 + 3r1r2 2 + r3 2. We need to get rid of 3r2 1r2 + 3r1r2 2. But we are in luck, since this equals 3r1r2(r1 + r2). Hence r3 1 + r3 2 = (r1 + r2) 3 − 3r1r2(r1 + r2). (Another way to see this is to use the factorization r3 1 +r3 2 = (r1+r2)(r2 1 −r1r2+r2 2) = (r1 + r2)((r1 + r2) 2 − 3r1r2).) We get r3 1 + r3 2 = ( − b a)3 − 3 ( c a ) ( − b a ) = −b3+3abc a3 . 1.1 Problems 1.

(Hint: Use Vieta’s formula) 4 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 2 Some Theorems of Irreducibility Let us begin with one incredibly powerful theorem of irreducibility discovered indepen- dently by both Schonemann and Eisenstein. Theorem 2.1 (Eisenstein’s/Sch¨onemann’s Criterion): Suppose we have the following polynomial with integer coeﬃcients: P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + .... + a1x + a0. If there exists a prime number p such that: 1. p divides each ai for i ̸= n, 2. p does not divide an, and 3. p2 does not divide a0, then P (x) is irreducible over the rationals. For example, prove that x7 + 5x4 + 35 is irreducible. We take p to be 5. Notice that 5 does not divide the coeﬃcient x7 and that 5 divides the coeﬃcients of x6, . . . , x0, which are (0, 0, 5, 0, 0, 0, 35). Finally, we check whether p2, 25, divides a0, 35, or not. We see that 25 does not divide 35 and that the function satisiﬁes Eisenstein’s Criterion for p = 5, so we are done. The polynomial is irreducible! This next irreducibility criterion is just as interesting! Theorem 2.2 (Cohn’s Irreducibility Criterion): Given a prime, p, whose base 10 repre- sentation is an10 n + an−110 n−1 + . . . + a110 1 + a010 0 where 0 ≤ ai ≤ 9, the polynomial P (x) = anxn + · · · + a1x1 + a0 is irreducible. Remark 2.3: The theorem also holds for any base besides 10. For example, prove that x3 + 7x2 + 3x + 3 is irreducible. We notice that 1733 is prime. 1733 = 1 · 10 3 + 7 · 10 2 + 3 · 10 1 + 3 · 10 0. We are done. One last result that might come in handy is the following: Theorem 2.4: For any t ∈ R, f (x) = (x − t)g(x) + f (t). 2.1 Problems 1. (Shri Ganeshram) Find the minimum a such that P (x) = x3 + 2x2 + a has real roots. 5 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 2. (Shri Ganeshram) Suppose d dx P (x) = (6x + 5). If P (x) is a reducible, integer polynomial, ﬁnd with proof all possible polynomials P (x). 3. (Classical) Show that f (x + 1) is irreducible, given that f (x) = xp−1 + ... + x + 1, p is prime. (Hint: Eisenstein) 4. (Easy) Show that a quadratic polynomial with odd coeﬃcients is irreducible in Z. 5. Let f (x) be an integer polynomial. Show that if f (0) and f (1) are both odd, then f (x) is irreducible in Z. 3 A Sneak Peek of What’s Coming Up in the Next Lecture Before we see more theorems, we shall deﬁne the division and the modulus of polynomi- als. (Recall that the modulus is the remainder when dividing.) Dividing polynomials is very similar to dividing integers. Let us learn through an example. Calculate 3x3+4x2−1 2x+1 . Solution. When dividing polynomials, we look at the highest powered term in the divisor. We have 2x + 1. We notice that 3 2x2 · 2x = 3x3. So, we write down 3 2x2, and multiply 3 2x2 and 2x + 1 (the divisor) and subtract from 3x3 + 4x2 − 1 (the quotient). (3x3 + 4x2 − 1) − 3 2x2 · (2x + 1) = 1 2 x2 − 1 3x3 + 4x2 − 1 2x + 1 = 5 2 x2 + 5 2x2 − 1 2x + 1 . So now we must divide 5 2 x2−1 2x+1 . We take 2x again and notice that the product of 2x and 5 4x gives us 5 2x2, the highest powered term in the dividend. So, we take the product of 2x + 1 and 5 4x subtract it from 5 2x2 − 1. ( 5 2 x2 − 1 ) − 5 4x · (2x + 1) = −5 4 x − 1 3x3 + 4x2 − 1 2x + 1 = 3 2 x2 + 5 4 x + − 5 4x − 1 2x + 1 . Finally, we have the division − 5 4 x−1 2x+1 . We see that − 5 8 multiplied with 2x yields − 5 4x and do as we did before. ( −5 4x − 1 ) − (−5 8 ) · (2x + 1) = −3 8 3x3 + 4x2 − 1 2x + 1 = 3 2 x2 + 5 4 x − 5 8 − 3 8 2x + 1 . 6 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 We are done as the highest powered term of 2x + 1 is greater in power than the highest powered term of − 3 8. Finding the modulus. In the above problem, we were dividing by 2x+1 and our remain- der was − 3 8, which means 3x3+4x2−1 mod 2x + 1 = − 3 8. Since we are modding by 2x+1, anything of the form (− 3 8 +P (x)(2x+1)) mod 2x + 1 = (3x3 +4x2 −1) mod 2x + 1 = − 3 8, where P (x) is an integer polynomial. Polynomials mod p. An integer polynomial, P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ Z[x], is equivalent to (an mod p)xn + (an−1 mod p)xn−1 + · · · + (a0 mod p) ∈ Z/pZ[x] (the integers mod p where p ∈ Z is prime). For example, given P (x) ∈ Z, P (x) = 35xn + 7xn−1 + 6x + 1, ﬁnd P (x) ∈ Z/7Z such that P (x) is in a simpler form. Solution. Consider the coeﬃcients modulo 7. Since (35, 7, 6, 1) mod 7 = (0, 0, 6, 1) = (0, 0, −1, 1), P (x) mod 7 = 0xn + 0xn−1 + 6x + 1 = −x + 1 Theorem 3.1: Given P (x) ∈ Z[x], if P (x) is irreducible (non-factorable) modulo p for some prime p ∈ Z, then P (x) is irreducible in Z. The above theorem is advanced and isn’t of much use to us now. I just included this early to show oﬀ the power of considering Z/pZ. This theorem will be explained in more depth in a later, follow up lecture. Theorem 3.2: Given P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ Z[x], P (x) is irreducible if |a0| > |a1| + · · · + |an| when |a0| is prime. This theorem shows up in many problems and can kill those problems. More impor- tant the theorem is the proof, which will be included in a later, more advanced lecture. (Try proving it yourself.) As without the proof, this claim will not be useful in contest mathematics, and the ideas behind the proof can be used in more general situations. Theorem 3.3: (Perron’s Criterion) Given P (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 ∈ Z[x], P (x) is irreducible if |an−1| > |a0| + |a1| + · · · + |an−2| + 1 and a0 ̸= 0. This theorem is also highly useful and can kill many high level problems. Though the proof is super important, so we shall discuss this in more detail in a further lecture. 3.1 problems(-s) (MOP 2007) Show that for any f with integer coeﬃcients that is nonconstant there are inﬁnitely many integers n such that f + n is irreducible in Z. (See how easily this hard USA MOP problem can be killed with the above techniques? Get pumped for the second part of this lecture!) 7 OMC 2011 Basic Polynomials and Irreducibility Lecture 16 4 Closing Remarks There will be a follow up lecture to this one in n weeks, where ∞ ≫ n > 0. (It is highly dependent on how quickly I become more proﬁcient at working with irreducibility and abstract algebra, which will be a focus for the next segment (into AMSP 2011) of my life) I hope you enjoyed the lecture; if you spot any errors, email me: shrig94@gmail.com. I would like to ﬁx this up as the majority of it will become part of the OMC Number Theory Book! (and also because I dislike lectures with lots of mistakes) The nature of this lecture, given my experience, can lead to many foul mistakes, so please report them so that I can ﬁx them. :) Thanks, Shri Ganeshram 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
