Discussion The canonical method for solving systems of equations is elimination by substitution. That is, successively solving for a variable and substituting it into the other equations. As an example, consider the system x + y + z = 6 x + 2y + z = 8 x + y + 3z = 12. We would begin the elimination by isolating x in the ﬁrst equation as x = 6 − y − z, then substitute x in the other equations: (6 − y − z) + 2y + z = 6 + y = 8 (6 − y − z) + y + 3z = 6 + 2z = 12, discovering the values y = 2 and z = 3. Backsubstituting then gives x = 6−y−z = 6−2−3 = 1, and we have the solution. This strategy is fairly reliable for simple systems of equations, but becomes tedious for large ones. It also fails when we are required to manipulate in more exotic ways; perhaps we cannot even solve for an isolated variable. This lecture is about combining equations more eﬀectively. • Identities. It is imperative that we are comfortable with some basic factorizations. For any complex numbers1 x and y, we have x2−y2 = (x−y)(x+y), x3−y3 = (x−y)(x2+xy+y2), x3+y3 = (x+y)(x2−xy+y2). 1That is, numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i = √−1 is the imaginary unit. If you are not familiar with them, you should read about how they multiply in polar form, and how they provide two additional (non-real) solutions to x 3 = 1. 1 Example. (HMMT 2007/2) Two reals x and y are such that x−y = 4 and x3−y3 = 28. Compute xy. Answer: −3. We have 28 = x3 −y3 = (x−y)(x2 +xy +y2) = (x−y)((x−y) 2 +3xy) = 4 · (16 + 3xy), from which xy = −3. • Symmetric polynomials. Deﬁne Ik to be the set of all k-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}. For variables x1, . . . , xn, the kth elementary symmetric polynomial is de- ﬁned by σk := ∑ I∈Ik ∏ i∈I xi, that is, the sum over all k-term products consisting of terms from {x1, . . . , xn}. It can be shown that if P (x1, . . . , xn) is any symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn, then there exists a polynomial Q(y1, . . . , yn) such that P (x1, . . . , xn) = Q(σ1, . . . , σn). In particular, if sk denotes the sum of the kth powers of x1, . . . , xk, then s1 = σ1 s2 = σ2 1 − 2σ2 s3 = σ3 1 − 3σ1σ2 + 3σ3 s4 = σ4 1 − 4σ2 1σ2 + 2σ2 2 + 4σ1σ3 − 4σ4, and so on. The ability to work with symmetric polynomials is so important that we have included it twice. Example. (HMMT 2007/5) A convex quadrilateral is determined by the points of intersection of the curves x4 + y4 = 100 and xy = 4; determine its area. Answer: 4 √17. By symmetry, the quadrilateral is a rectangle having x = y and x = −y as axes of symmetry. Let (a, b) with a > b > 0 be one of the vertices. Then the desired area is (√2(a − b) )·(√2(a + b) ) = 2(a 2−b2) = 2 √a4 − 2a2b2 + b4 = 2 √100 − 2 · 42 = 4 √17. Note how we did not need to ﬁnd the exact coordinates of the rectangle. In fact, we could solve for them, but this is a waste of time. In many contests, including the AMC, economy of computation is important in several ways. It is quicker, but it also reduces the drain of a problem and keeps the likelihood of silly errors low. • Iteration. Consider solving for f (a) given that f obeys some equation f (x) + f (g(x)) = h(x), . 2 where g and h are given. It is impossible to ﬁnd f (a) unless g(k)(a) = a for some positive integer k, where g(k+1)(x) = g(g(k)(x)) (one just recovers an unbound system of equations.) Virtually any problem of this form must be solvable by iteration of one sort or another. Example. (HMMT 2007/8) Let A := Q \\ {0, 1} denote the set of all rationals other than 0 and 1. A function f : A → R has the property that for all x ∈ A, f (x) + f (1 − 1 x ) = log |x|. Compute the value of f (2007). 2 Answer: log (2007/2006) . Let g : A → A be deﬁned by g(x) := 1 − 1/x; the key property is that g(g(g(x))) = 1 − 1 1 − 1 1− 1 x = x. The given equation rewrites as f (x) + f (g(x)) = log |x|. Substituting x = g(y) and x = g(g(z)) gives the further equations f (g(y)) + f (g (g(y))) = log |g(x)| and f (g (g(z))) + f (z) = log |g(g(x))|. Setting y and z to x and solving the system of three equations for f (x) gives f (x) = 1 2 · (log |x| − log |g(x)| + log |g(g(x))|) . For x = 2007, we have g(x) = 2006 2007 and g(g(x)) = −1 2006 , so that f (2007) = log |2007| − log \f \f 2006 2007 \f \f + log \f \f −1 2006 \f \f 2 = log (2007/2006) . • Factorization. The fundamental theorem of algebra holds that any nonconstant polynomial with complex coeﬃcients has a complex root. In particular, we may write p(x) = xn + a1xn−1 + · · · + an = n∏ i=1(x − xi), (∗) where x1, . . . , xn are the roots of p. Considering the distributive property, we recover Vieta’s formula σk = (−1) kak, where σk is the kth symmetric polynomial in x1, . . . , xn. There are many general oper- ations on polynomials: reversing the coeﬃcients, negating every other coeﬃcient, etc. These can analyzed in (*). You might try substituting to eliminate the second highest order term, which can have the eﬀect of forcing a subtle decomposition to become more clear. 2If you’ve never seen log before, you should investigate it at some point. For now, know that log x deﬁned to be the real exponent to which 10 may be raised to equal x (it doesn’t exist if x ≤ 0.) It has various properties, chief among them log a + log b = log(ab). 3 Problems 1. (AMC10B 2006/12) The lines x = y/4 + a and y = x/4 + b intersect at the point (1, 2). What is a + b? 2.
