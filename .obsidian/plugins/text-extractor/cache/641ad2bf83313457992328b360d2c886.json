Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90◦. Let I be the incentre of ABC. Let AI extended intersect BC at F . Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect AC at E. Prove that IE = IF . 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a 1 + b + b 1 + c + c 1 + a = 1. Prove that abc ≤ 1/8. 3. For any natural number n, expressed in base 10, let S(n) denote the sum of all digits of n. Find all natural numbers n such that n3 = 8S(n)3+6nS(n)+1. 4. How many 6-digit natural numbers containing only the digits 1,2,3 are there in which 3 occurs exactly twice and the number is divisible by 9? 5. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let AD be the bisector of ∠A with D on BC. Let the circumcircle of triangle ACD intersect AB again in E; and let the circumcircle of triangle ABD intersect AC again in F . Let K be the reﬂection of E in the line BC. Prove that F K = BC. 6. Show that the inﬁnite arithmetic progression ⟨1, 4, 7, 10, . . .⟩ has inﬁnitely many 3-term subsequences in harmonic progression such that for any two such triples ⟨a1, a2, a3⟩ and ⟨b1, b2, b3⟩ in harmonic progression, one has a1 b1 ̸= a2 b2 . ———-00———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
