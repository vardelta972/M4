For real numbers x and y prove that [2x] + [2y] ≥ [x] + [y] + [x+y]. 2. Find the number of zeros at the end of 2005!. 3. Show that m!n!(m+n)! divides (2m)!(2n)! for any natural numbers m, n. 4. Show that {√123456789} lies between 1/10 and 1/9. 5. Show that [x + 1/2] = [2x] - [x] for any real number x. Hence prove that . 6. Show that for any real number x, where n is a positive integer. 7. Consider the sequence of positive integers that are not perfect squares: 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11,···. Show that the n-th term in this sequence is given by the formula: . 8. Determine the number of distinct integers in the sequence   Hints 1. Split x and y as: x = m + f, y = n + g, where m = [x], n = [y]. 2. Find the largest power of 2 and 5 that divides 2005! Using Legendre’s formula. Ans: 500. 3. Use Legendre’s formula and problem 1. 4. Evaluate 11^2, 111^2, 1111^2, ···. 5. Note that the infinite sum is actually a finite sum. You can use the identity [x + 1/2] = [2x] - [x] to convert it into a telescoping sum. 6. There is some 1 ≤ i ≤ n such that {x} lies between (i-1)/n and i/n. 7. Let [√n + 1/2] = k. Show that k^2 ≤ n+k < (k+1)^2. 8. What is ? Ans: 500 + 1004 = 1504. All of these problems are taken from 104 Number Theory Problems. If you are stuck, you can look up the book for complete solution (pages 52-70). Also try the problems given in Excursion (chapter 1). [ x + 1 2 ] + [ x + 2 2 2 ] + [ x + 2 2 2 3 ] + ⋯ = [x] [x] + [ x + 1 n ] + [ x + 2 n ] + ⋯ + [ x + n − 1 n ] = [n x] n + [ n + 1 2 ] [ 1 2 2005 ] , [ 2 2 2005 ] , … , [ 2005 2 2005 ] .
