I have not made any signiﬁcant changes since, or even proofread them completely (so some information may be outdated, and errors may remain), mostly just corrected some typos. If you spy any more errors, or have suggestions, please let me know. The main sources used in the preparation of these notes were Zagier’s notes in The 1-2-3 of Modular Forms, Kilford’s book on modular forms, Cogdell’s Fields Institute notes on automorphic forms and representations, and my brain. I’ve since written up course notes on modular forms (which don’t cover automorphic forms, at least yet), if you want to start studying these things in detail. 1 Modular Forms Let H = {z ∈ C|Im(z) > 0} denote the upper half-plane. Imbued with the metric ds2 = dx2+dy2 y2 , this is a standard model for the hyperbolic plane. We do not need a great understanding of the geometry of H to say what modular forms are, but for your peace of mind here are some basic facts: 1. The distance between any two points in H is ﬁnite. 2. Angles in H are given by Euclidean angles. 3. The distance from any point in H to the point at inﬁnity i∞ is inﬁnite. 4. The distance from any point in H to any point on the real line R is inﬁnite. In fact the “points at inﬁnity” for H are precisely R ∪ {i∞}. 5. The straight lines, or geodesics, in H are precisely the Euclidean vertical lines and semicircles with center on R that meet R orthogonally. 6. Any γ = (a b c d ) ∈ SL2(R) deﬁnes an isometry of H given by z 7→ γz = az + b cz + d . (1) Note ( −1 0 0 −1 ) z = −z −1 = z, i.e., −I acts trivially on H. In fact, PSL2(R) = SL2(R)/ {±I} is the group of all orientation-preserving isometries of H. 1 In number theory, the most important groups of isometries are the congruence (or modular) subgroups Γ0(N ) = {( a b c d ) ∈ PSL2(Z)|c ≡ 0 mod N } , for N ∈ N. (We view elements of PSL2(R) or PSL2(Z) as 2 × 2 matrices in SL2(R) or SL2(Z), up to a ± sign.) We call N the level of Γ0(N ). Note the congruence subgroup of level 1, Γ0(1) = PSL2(Z), which is called the full modular group. The Γ0(N ) equivalence classes of the points at inﬁnity Q ∪ {i∞} are called the cusps of Γ0(N ). The number of cusps will always be ﬁnite. For N = 1, there is only one cusp, which we denote i∞. Deﬁnition 1.1. Let f : H → C be a holomorphic function and k ∈ N ∪ {0}. We say f is a (holomorphic) modular form of weight k and level N if f (γz) = (cz + d)kf (z) for z ∈ H, γ = (a b c d ) ∈ Γ0(N ), (2) and f is “holomorphic at each cusp” of Γ0(N ). Denote the space of modular forms of weight k and level N by Mk(N ). We will not explain precisely the notion of being holomorphic at a cusp, but simply say that it means there is a reasonable (in fact polynomial) growth condition on f (z) as z tends to a point at inﬁnity for H. One may also deﬁne more general spaces of modular forms by generalizing the modular trans- formation law (2). Precisely, one may consider modular forms for an arbitrary discrete subgroup Γ of PSL2(Z) by replacing Γ0(N ) with Γ in (2). One may also consider modular forms with character χ as satisfying f (γz) = χ(d)(cz + d)kf (z) for z ∈ H, γ = (a b c d ) ∈ Γ0(N ), where χ is a Dirichlet character modulo N . Fourier expansion Let f ∈ Mk(N ). Note T = ( 1 1 0 1 ) ∈ Γ0(N ) for all N . Then (2) with γ = T simply says f (z + 1) = f (z), i.e., f is periodic. Hence it has a Fourier expansion f (z) = ∑ n∈Z ane 2πinz. We put q = e2πiz and F (q) = f (z). Note as z → i∞, q → 0. Hence the Fourier expansion (or q-expansion) f (z) = F (q) = ∑ anqn may be alternatively viewed as a “power series” expansion of F (q) at q = 0, i.e., it is a “power series” expansion of f (z) at the cusp z = i∞. Here “power series” is in quotes because we allow negative exponents n also. In fact, a priori, from the Fourier expansion an may be nonzero for inﬁnitely many negative n. However, the condition that f (z) is holomorphic at the cusp z = i∞ means that an = 0 for n < 0. Thus the q-expansion above is indeed the power series expansion for f (z) at z = i∞. 2 As mentioned above, in the case N = 1, z = i∞ is the only cusp of Γ0(1) = PSL2(Z). But for higher levels N , Γ0(N ) has multiple cusps and there is a similar Fourier or q-expansion ∑ n≥0 anqn about each cusp. Deﬁnition 1.2. Let f ∈ Mk(N ). We say f is a cusp form if f vanishes at each cusp, i.e., if a0 = 0 in the q-expansion f (z) = ∑ n≥0 anqn about any cusp of Γ0(N ). The space of cusp forms in Mk(N ) is denoted Sk(N ). Cusp forms are the most interesting modular forms, and their Fourier coeﬃcients provide arith- metic information, as we will see below. Algebraic structure Note that if f, g ∈ Mk(N ) and c ∈ C, then cf + g ∈ Mk(N ). Hence Mk(N ) is a C-vector space. An important fact is that for ﬁxed k, N , the space Mk(N ) is ﬁnite dimensional. If f ∈ Mk(N ) and g ∈ Mℓ(N ), then it is easy to see f · g ∈ Mk+ℓ(N ). Note that if M |N , then Γ0(N ) ⊆ Γ0(M ). So if f ∈ Mk(M ), the modular transformation law (2) for Γ0(M ) automatically gives the transformation law for Γ0(N ), i.e., we also know f ∈ Mk(N ). Hence we always have dim Mk(N ) ≥ Mk(M ). All of the above remarks apply equally to the space of cusp forms: Sk(N ) is a ﬁnite dimensional C-vector space; the product of two cusp forms is a cusp form whose weight is a sum of the individual weights; and Sk(M ) ⊆ Sk(N ) for M |N . When studying Sk(N ), one is often most interested in forms which don’t come from a smaller level n in this trivial way. These “new forms” can be deﬁned as follows. One can make Sk(N ) a Hilbert space with the Petersson inner product ⟨f, g⟩ = ∫ ∫ Γ0(N )\\H f (z)g(z)y2k−2dxdy. Let Sold k (N ) be the subspace of Sk(N ) spanned by elements of Sk(M ) with M |N, M ̸= N . Using the Petersson inner product, we can deﬁne Snew k (N ) to be its orthogonal complement, so that Sk(N ) = Sold k (N ) ⊕ Snew k (N ). Forms in Sold k (N ) are called old forms and forms in Snew k (N ) are called new forms. Examples in level 1 For k ≥ 4 even, the Eisenstein series (of weight k and level 1) Ek(z) = 1 2 ∑ c,d∈Z gcd(c,d)=1 1 (cz + d)k ∈ Mk(1). It has Fourier expansion Ek(z) = (2πi)k ζ(k)(k − 1)! ( − Bk 2k + ∞∑ n=1 σk−1(n)qn) , 3 where Bk is the k-th Bernoulli number and σk−1 is the divisor function σk−1(n) = ∑ d|n dk−1. Fact: Any modular form of level 1, i.e., for PSL2(Z), is a polynomial in E4 and E6. Further dim Mk(1) =  | | ⌊k/12⌋ k ≡ 2 mod 12 ⌊k/12⌋ + 1 k ≡ 0, 4, 6, 8, 10 mod 12 0 k odd. In particular, dim M8(1) = 1. But both E2 4 , E8 ∈ M8(1) so they must be scalar multiples of each other. Comparing the ﬁrst Fourier coeﬃcient shows in fact E2 4 = E8. Consequently all their Fourier coeﬃcients are equal, and this yields the following relation among divisor functions n−1∑ m=1 σ3(m)σ3(n − m) = σ7(n) − σ3(n) 120 . We also remark that because Eisenstein series are not cusp forms (the zero-th Fourier coeﬃcient is nonzero), and the ﬁrst cusp form does not occur until the ﬁrst instance where dim Mk(1) = 2, namely k = 12. One can check that ∆(z) = 1 1728 (E4(z)3 − E6(z) 2) ∈ S12(1) (and is nonzero). One can do similar Eisenstein series constructions in higher level as well. Next, consider Jacobi’s theta function θ(z) = ∑ n∈Z qn2 = 1 + 2q + 2q4 + 2q9 + · · · , q = e2πiz. One can check that this is a modular form of “weight 1 2 ” and level 1. (Though we haven’t de- ﬁned forms of half-integral weight, you can interpret this as θ2 is a modular form of weight 1.) Combinatorially it is easy to see that θ(z)2k = ∑ n≥0 r2k(n)qn, i.e., θ2k ∈ Mk(1) and the Fourier coeﬃcients an = r2k(n) are precisely the number of ways one can write n as a sum of 2k squares. Now one can compute a basis for Mk(1) in terms of Eisenstein series, and express θ2k in terms of this basis simply by check the ﬁrst few Fourier coeﬃcients of θ2k (how many depends upon the dimension of Mk(1)). For example, one can show r4(n) = 8 (σ1(n) − 4σ1(n/4)) = 8 ∑ d|n 4∤d d. (Here we interpret σ(n/4) to be 0 if n ̸≡ 0 mod 4.) Hecke operators 4 For each m ∈ N, Hecke deﬁned a linear operator on the space Mk(N ). If f ∈ Mk(N ) with f (z) = ∑ anqn, then the m-th Hecke operator Tm acts as (Tmf )(z) = ∑ bnqn where bn = ∑ d| gcd(m,n) d k−1amn/d2. Note that T1f = f , and for a prime p, (Tpf )(z) = ∑ n : p∤n apn + ∞∑ n : p|n (apn + p k−1an/p)qn. One can check that Hecke operators Tm, Tn commute when m and n are relatively prime to the level N . It is a theorem that Sk(N ) has a basis of Hecke eigenforms {f }, meaning that for each such f , we have Tmf = λmf for some λm ∈ C for all m ∤ N . Looking at the ﬁrst Fourier coeﬃcient, we see b1 = am = λma1. In particular a1 ̸= 0, and we may normalize f by assuming a1 = 1, i.e., replace f with f /a1. Then for m ∤ N , the Hecke operator Tm simply acts as Tmf = amf , where am is the m-th Fourier coeﬃcient of f . One can then conclude that the Fourier coeﬃcients of f are multiplicative, i.e., for m, n relatively prime to each other and N , we have aman = amn. This is what makes Hecke eigenforms so nice. L-functions Let f (z) = ∑ anqn ∈ Sk(N ). We deﬁne its L-function (or L-series) to be L(s, f ) = ∞∑ n=1 an ns . Note the similarity to the Riemann zeta function ζ(s) = ∑∞ 1 1 ns . By Hecke’s bound an = O(nk/2), one can show L(s, f ) converges for Re(s) > k 2 + 1. Furthermore, it extends uniquely to an entire function on C and satisﬁes the functional equation L(s, f ) = i kN k/2−s(2π) 2s−k Γ(k − s) Γ(s) L(k − s, g) where g(z) = N −k/2z−kf (−1/N z). (If N = 1, i.e., Γ = SL2(Z), then g = f .) So far this is analogous to the Riemann zeta function (except that ζ(s) has a pole at s = 1), but ζ(s) has another very important feature, the Euler product expansion, ζ(s) = ∏ p 1 1 − p−s , which is valid for Re(s) > 1. In order to do the same trick for L(s, f ), we would want the Fourier coeﬃcients an to be multiplicative. Well, they are if f is a Hecke eigenform, and we know such elements span Sk(N ). In this case, there is an Euler product expansion L(s, f ) = ∏ p∤N 1 1 − app−s + pk−1−2s · ∏ p|N (“bad factors”). 5 Like the Riemann zeta function, L-functions occupy a central role in modern number theory. For one, L-functions allow you to compare objects of diﬀerent types: for an elliptic curve E, we can also associate an L-function L(E, s) = ∑ bn ns where the bn’s are essentially the number of points on the elliptic curve mod n (at least for n prime). Then we can say E and f are correspond if L(E, s) = L(f, s). The fact that every elliptic curve (over Q) corresponds to a modular form (of weight 2) (the Taniyama–Shimura conjecture1, or now, Modularity Theorem) was one of the most spectacular mathematical accomplishments of the 20th century. (It’s still not known in general for elliptic curves over other number ﬁelds). Moreover, the analytic properties of L(f, s) give important information on the an’s. Another important feature is that the values L(f, s) at certain special values of s (e.g., the central value L(f, k/2)) carry interesting arithmetic information (e.g., about the an’s). A useful variant that is often studied is the twisted L-function. If χ is a Dirichlet character, one can consider the twist L(f, s; χ) = L(f ⊗ χ, s) = ∑ χ(n)an ns . This is a sort of hybrid between Dirichlet’s L-functions and L(f, s). Generalizations. One can generalize the notion of modular forms to functions on higher-dimensional analogues of the upper-half plane H. There are diﬀerent ways to do this, and one ends up with diﬀerent kinds of generalized modular forms such as Hilbert modular forms, Siegel modular forms and Jacobi forms. Additionally, one can consider “anti-holomorphic” analogues of modular forms called Maass forms. To diﬀerentiate the original notion of modular forms from these generalizations, one sometimes calls the modular forms we’ve deﬁned elliptic modular forms (this terminology does not mean they all correspond to elliptic curves, however). 2 Automorphic Forms Classical automorphic forms Recall the group of orientation-preserving isometries of H is G = PSL2(R) (and the action was given above). Let K be the subgroup of G stabilizing i ∈ H. It is easy to see that K = SO(2)/ {±I}. Since G acts transitively on H, we may in fact identify H with the quotient space H = G/K. Let f ∈ Mk(N ) and Γ = Γ0(N ). Since f : H → C we may lift f : G → C, and f satisﬁes f ((a b c d ) g) = (cz + d)kf (g), ( a b c d ) ∈ Γ. Consider the function ϕ : G → C given by ϕ ((a b c d )) = (cz + d)−kf ((a b c d )) . 1A way to construct elliptic curves from weight 2 modular forms with integral Fourier coeﬃcients was known earlier by Eichler–Shimura. The Taniyama–Shimura conjecture essentially says one gets all elliptic curves this way. 6 It is evident that ϕ(γ) = f (1) is constant for γ ∈ Γ. Moreover, one can check that (i) [automorphy] ϕ(γg) = ϕ(g) for γ ∈ Γ; and (ii-a) ϕ(gkθ) = ekπiθϕ(g) for kθ = ( cos θ sin θ − sin θ cos θ ) ∈ K if Γ = PSL2(Z). If Γ ̸= PSL2(Z), the analogue of (ii-a) is more complicated, but can abstractly be described as (ii) [K-ﬁniteness] the vector-space ⟨ϕk(g) := ϕ(gk)|k ∈ K⟩ ⊂ C∞(G) is ﬁnite dimensional. Note that (ii-a) implies the vector-space ⟨ϕk(g)|k ∈ K⟩ is 1-dimensional, so (ii) is a generalization of (ii-a). Deﬁnition 2.1. Let Γ ⊂ G be a discrete subgroup, e.g., Γ = Γ0(N ). An automorphic form for Γ is a smooth function ϕ : G → C satisfying conditions (i) and (ii) above, as well as (iii) a diﬀerential condition and (iv) “moderate growth” condition. We will not worry about the details of (iii) and (iv), but just remark that they essentially correspond to the conditions of (iii’) holomorphy of f on H and (iv’) holomorphy of f at the cusps. In fact (iii) is more general that (iii’), so that the non-holomorphic analogues of modular forms, Maass forms, are included in the deﬁnition of automorphic forms. Note that any modular form f corresponds to an automorphic form ϕ, and what is going on is the following. We may view f as a function on G which is invariant under K and satisﬁes some transformation property for Γ. We can exchange f for a function ϕ which is invariant under Γ and satisﬁes some transformation property for K. Often ϕ is more convenient to work with than f , and automorphic forms generalize more naturally than modular forms, and are amenable to study with adèles (and therefore a local-global approach) and representation theory. One can deﬁne classical automorphic forms for symmetric spaces G/K (generalizations of H) as follows. Let G be an algebraic group2 over R, which you can think of a group of matrices deﬁned by polynomial equations. For example G = GLn(R), SLn(R), SO(n) or Sp2n(R) = {g ∈ SL2n(R) : tg ( I −I ) g = ( I −I )} . This latter example is called the symplectic group of rank n. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G, and Γ a discrete subgroup of G. Then ϕ ∈ C∞(G) is an automorphic form for Γ if (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) hold. Siegel modular forms are (essentially) automorphic forms on Sp4(R) (or more generally Sp2n(R)). They are important in the theory of quadratic forms. Adelic automorphic forms There are basically two ways of looking at automorphic forms, the classical way described above, and the adelic approach. The adelic approach, while considerably more involved, has a number of advantages. For a number ﬁeld F , recall the adèles of F are the ring AF = { (xv) ∈ ∏ v Fv|xv ∈ OFv for almost all (ﬁnite) places v } , where {v} is the set of places of F and Fv denotes the completion of F with respect to v. Let G be an algebraic group over F , e.g., G = GL(n), G = PSL(n), G = SO(n) or G = Sp(n). For example if G = GL(n), then G(F ) denotes GLn(F ) and G(AF ) means GLn(AF ). 2For those who know about algebraic groups, we assume aﬃne, connected, reductive here. 7 Deﬁnition 2.2. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup of G(AF ). A smooth function ϕ : G(AF ) → C is a (K-ﬁnite) automorphic form if (i) [automorphy] ϕ(γg) = ϕ(g) for all γ ∈ G(F ) (ii) [K-ﬁniteness] the space ⟨ϕ(gk)|k ∈ K⟩ is ﬁnite dimensional (iii) ϕ satisﬁes a diﬀerential condition (iv) ϕ is of moderate growth. One also looks at larger classes of smooth automorphic forms or L2 automorphic forms, depending on the application and/or tools one wants to use. Example: classical modular forms Let f ∈ Mk(1). Then we saw above this can be transformed into a classical automorphic form ϕ on PSL2(R), ϕ : Γ\\PSL2(R) → C where Γ = SL2(Z). Let F = Q, G = GL(2) and Z ≃ GL(1) denote the center of G. A maximal compact open subgroup of G(AQ) is K = Kf × SO(2), where Kf = ∏p<∞ G(Zp). One has the isomorphism Z(A)G(Q)\\G(A)/Kf ≃ Γ\\PSL2(R), from whence it follows that ϕ lifts to a (smooth) function on ϕ : G(A) → C which is left-invariant under G(Q), i.e., ϕ satisﬁes the automorphy condition (i) above. As you might guess, it satisﬁes (ii)–(iv) also, and this provides the passage from modular forms of level 1 to adelic automorphic forms. The passage for modular forms of level N is similar: it follows because there is a subgroup KN ⊂ Kf such that Z(A)G(Q)\\G(A)/KN ≃ Γ0(N )\\PSL2(R). One generalization of classical modular forms is that of Hilbert modular forms. They are easier to describe in adelic language than classical language: namely, they are just automorphic forms on GL2(AF ) where F is a totally real number ﬁeld. Cusp forms The notion of a classical cusp form generalizes naturally to automorphic forms. We will skip the motivation and explain how things work for G = GL(n). We call a subgroup P ⊂ G a parabolic subgroup if, up to conjugation, it is of the form P =  ||| |||      g1 ∗ · · · ∗ 0 g2 · · · ∗ ... ... 0 · · · · · · gr  | | |  |gi ∈ GL(ni)  |||‖ ||| where n1 + · · · + nr = n. We can decompose P = M N where M ≃ GLn1 · · · GLnr is the Levi subgroup and N is the unipotent subgroup U =  ||| |||      In1 ∗ · · · ∗ 0 In2 · · · ∗ ... ... 0 · · · · · · Inr  | | |   |||‖ ||| . 8 For example, if G = GL(2), then up to conjugation there is one proper parabolic subgroup with corresponding Levi and unipotent P = {( ∗ ∗ ∗ )} , M = {( ∗ ∗ )} , N = {( 1 ∗ 1 )} . (Technically P = G is also a parabolic subgroup, in which case M = G and U = I.) If G = GL(3), then up to conjugation there are two proper parabolic subgroups P1 =     ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗    ‖  , M1 =      ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗    ‖  , N2 =     1 0 ∗ 0 1 ∗ 1    ‖  . and P2 =     ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗ ∗    ‖  , M2 =      ∗ ∗ ∗    ‖  , N2 =     1 ∗ ∗ 1 ∗ 1    ‖  . Note P2 ⊂ P1, so P1 is called a maximal parabolic. One can similarly deﬁne parabolic and unipotent subgroups for other algebraic groups G. Deﬁnition 2.3. Let G be an algebraic group and ϕ be an automorphic form on G(AF ). We say ϕ is a cusp form if ∫ N (F )\\N (A) ϕ(n)dn = 0 for all nontrivial unipotent subgroups N ⊂ G.3 Note the integral over the quotient N (F )\\N (A) makes sense since ϕ is left invariant by any g ∈ G(F ), hence n ∈ N (F ). Furthermore N (F )\\N (A) is compact, so the integral necessarily converges. Automorphic representations Let G be an algebraic group over F and A(G(F )\\G(AF )) be the space of automorphic forms on G(AF ). It is essentially true that G(AF ) acts on A(G(F )\\G(AF )) by right translation.4 Namely, (g · ϕ)(x) = ϕ(xg). (This is true for L2 automorphic forms, but there are some technicalities at the inﬁnite places for K-ﬁnite or smooth automorphic forms. So if you want the statements to be more-or-less technically correct, just assume that we are talking about L2 automorphic forms.) For each ϕ, we can consider the representation (πϕ, Vϕ) where Vϕ = G(AF ) · ϕ. These are automorphic representations of G(AF ). They are in general inﬁnite dimensional. If ϕ is cuspidal, we say πϕ is a cuspidal automorphic representation. One way to think of this is that we can decompose the space of cusp forms Acusp(G(F )\\G(AF )) as Acusp(G(F )\\G(AF )) = ⊕ π Vπ, 3By this, I mean all N appearing in the decomposition of a proper parabolic P = M N , not arbitrary subgroups of unipotent matrices. Technically these N are called unipotent radicals of parabolics. 4One typically mods out by the center (possibly with a character) if the center is not compact, but for simplicity I’ll ignore this. 9 where the Vπ’s are the irreducible constituents under the action of G(AF ). Then the cuspidal auto- morphic representations are these Vπ’s. (A similar statement is true for the non-cuspidal represen- tations.) Looking at automorphic representations is essentially the same as looking at automorphic forms, and it allows for the use of representation theory. In this business, one typically wants to decompose global (adelic) objects into products of lo- cal objects. If π is an automorphic representation, then it decomposes into a product of local representations π = ⊗vπv where πv is a representation of G(Fv). Note if G = GL(1), then G(F )\\G(AF ) = GL1(F )\\GL1(AF ) = F ×\\A× F = CF , the idèle class group of F ! Hence automorphic forms on G are just functions on CF , and automorphic representa- tions are precisely the idèle class characters χ for F , which can be decomposed into a tensor product of local representations χv : Fv → C×. If G = GL(2), F = Q, and ϕ comes from a classical modular eigenform f ∈ Sk(N ), consider the associated automorphic representation π = πϕ. In the decomposition π = ⊗vπv = ⊗pπp ⊗ π∞, one can determine π∞ just from the weight k of f , and πp is determined by the eigenvalue λp of the Hecke operator Tp acting on f : Tpf = λpf . Local representations To study the automorphic representation π = ⊗vπv above, one wants to understand the local representations πv. Assume v is ﬁnite, so Kv = G(OFv ) is a maximal compact subgroup of G(Fv). Each πv is an admissible representation of G(Fv), meaning πv|Kv has a ﬁnite-dimensional invariant subspace. Further πv is unramiﬁed for almost all v, meaning πv|Kv as a 1-dimensional invariant subspace, i.e., there is a vector ϕv ∈ πv which is ﬁxed under the action of Kv. To understand the local representations πv, one ﬁrst wants a classiﬁcation of the irreducible admissible representations of G(Fv). Let us suppose G = GL(2). The simplest way to construct representations of GL2(Fv) is via principal series. Namely, let χ1 and χ2 be two characters of F × v . Then one can deﬁne a character of the standard parabolic subgroup P by ( a b ) ( 1 x 1 ) 7→ χ1(a)χ2(b). Let π(χ1, χ2) be the induction of this character from P to GL2(Fv), which is called a principal series representation. The irreducible admissible representations of GL2(Fv) are • 1-dimensional representations — these never occur as local components πv • special representations — an irreducible component of π(χ, χ| · |±1), which is not irreducible • irreducible principal series — π(χ1, χ2) where χ1 ̸= χ2| · |±1 • supercuspidal representations — irreducible representations not occurring in any principal series The special and supercuspidal representations are ramiﬁed, and the irreducible principal series may be ramiﬁed or unramiﬁed (π(χ1, χ2) is unramiﬁed if χ1 and χ2 are). All of these types of representations occur as local components πv of an automorphic representation, and they are all 10 inﬁnite dimensional. (This does not mean every irreducible principal series occurs as the component of a global automorphic representation, but it is a theorem that all special and supercuspidals do.) The classiﬁcation for GL(n) is similar, but is more complicated for other groups. The way to deﬁne L-functions for automorphic representations π = ⊗πv is to deﬁne local L- functions L(s, πv) for each πv, and set L(s, π) = ∏ L(s, πv), which will converge in some right-half plane. To deﬁne L(s, π) and prove it has the desired prop- erties (e.g., meromorphic continuation, functional equation) is much more complicated than for L-functions of classical modular forms, even for G = GL(2). The case of G = GL(1) is done in Tate’s thesis, which gives one a good indication of what needs to be done for the case of GL(2). In the case of unramiﬁed principal series, for GL2(Fv), one associates to πv = π(χ1, χ2) the Satake parameters tv = (av, bv) = (χ1(ϖ), χ2(ϖ)) where ϖ is a uniformizer for OFv . (E.g., if Fv = Qp, then one can take ϖ = p.) Then the local L-function is deﬁned to be L(s, πv) = 1 (1 − avq−s)(1 − bvq−s) where q is the size of the residue ﬁeld OFv /ϖOFv . Functoriality Langlands proposed the general theory of automorphic representations as a way solve many problems in number theory and geometry. Two main conjectures in the Langlands program are (i) modularity, that Galois representations should correspond to automorphic representations, and (ii) functoriality. We will just say a little bit about functoriality. The naive idea is that if there is a homomorphism from G into H, then automorphic representations of G should transfer to automor- phic representations of H. A less naive (and more correct) idea is that if there is a homomorphism from the dual group of G to the dual group of H, automorphic representations of G transfer to H. However in our examples, each group will be its own dual, so we can temporary delude ourselves into believing the more naive idea. Let G = GSp(4) = {g ∈ GL(4) : tg ( I −I ) g = λ(g) ( I −I ) for some λ(g) ∈ GL(1) } and H = GL(4). Siegel modular forms, in addition to being viewed as automorphic representations of Sp4(AF ), maybe viewed as automorphic representations of GSp4(AF ), which is in some ways a nicer group to work with. (Unlike GSp(4), Sp(4) is not its own dual group, rather its dual group is SO(5).) Here functoriality says that embedding GSp(4) ,→ GL(4) should yield a transfer of automorphic representations π of GSp4(AF ) to automorphic representations of GL4(AF ). This transfer is known, by Asgari and Shahidi (2006), for generic representations π, but is still not known for all non-generic π.5 A consequence of this transfer would be that one can apply results about GL(4) (which are easier to prove) to representations of GSp(4). Similarly, transfer of generic representations of classical groups (e.g., SO(n), Sp(2n)) to an appropriate GL(n) is known (Cogdell, Kim, Piatetski-Shapiro and Shahidi, 2004). There are several applications of these cases of functoriality. 5Update: it’s essentially known now by Arthur, at least for π with trivial central character. 11 Another interesting case of functoriality of a diﬀerent ﬂavor comes from the symmetric power lifts. Take G = GL(2). Take a 2-dimensional vector space V = ⟨v, w⟩ so GL(2) ≃ GL(V ) is the group of linear isomorphisms of V with itself. Any g ∈ GL(2) acting on V also acts on the 3-dimensional vector space Sym 2(V ) = ⟨v ⊗ v, v ⊗ w, w ⊗ w⟩, i.e, we can view g ∈ GL(Sym2(V )) ≃ GL(3). The map Sym 2 : GL(2) → GL(3) obtained in this way is called the symmetric square representation of GL(2). Similarly there is a symmetric n-th power representation Sym n : GL(2) → GL(n + 1), for each n ∈ N. Here functoriality predicts that Sym n induces a transfer, called the symmetric power lift, of automorphic representations π of GL2(AF ) to automorphic representations, denoted Sym n(π), of GLn+1(AF ). This is known for n = 2, 3, 4. (It is easy to see what the local components of Sym n(π) = ⊗Sym n(πv) should be, but the diﬃculty lies in showing the tensor product on the right actually occurs as an automorphic representation.) Suppose π corresponds to a classical eigen cusp form f (z) = ∑ anqn of weight k. Then Ramanujan conjectured |ap| ≤ 2p(k−1)/2. This was proved by Deligne (1974, for k ≥ 2) but generalizations, such as to Maass forms or Hilbert modular forms, are still not known. However, it would follow from knowing functoriality of all symmetric powers for GL(2). What can be currently shown is |ap| ≤ 2p(k−1)/2+7/64 using Sym 4 (for classical modular forms and the analogue for Maass forms and Hilbert modular forms). These bounds on Fourier coeﬃcients have many applications in number theory. It is perhaps worth mentioning two other important cases of functoriality: base change and automorphic induction. Suppose π is an automorphic representation of GLn(AF ) and E/F is a Galois extension of degree d. Then base change says π should lift to an automorphic representation of GLn(AE). Conversely, if π′ is an automorphic representation of GLn(AE), automorphic induction says π′ should lift to an automorphic representation of degree GLnd(AF ). These are known if E/F is cyclic of prime degree. Base change and automorphic induction can be used to show certain Galois representations are modular, e.g., the Langlands–Tunnell Theorem, which played a key role in Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. 12","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
