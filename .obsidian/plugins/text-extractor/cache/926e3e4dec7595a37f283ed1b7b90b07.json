Generally if one wants a nice theory for this sort of thing, one takes S to be a subring of C. We’ll call this a “diophantine equation over S” although the terminology may not be standard. The diﬃculty of this depends upon what S is: • S = C. • S = R; decidable but painful. • S = Q; this is where most of the nice mathematical theories are; we don’t know whether this is decidable or not. • S = Z; this is undecidable in general. Reductions: Diophantine problemss over Q can be reduced to Diophantine problems over Z. Homogeneous diophantine problems over Z are equivalent to the same problems over Q. If you want to know more about this, look at Bjorn Poonen’s website. If you want to know more about undecidability for Z, ask Paul Valiant. Of course, there are rings other than Z. For example, Z/n = Z/nZ = {integers mod n}. Finite rings are ﬁnite, but still: • S = Z/pZ: see Josh’s handout. • S = Z/pnZ: see my handout. Also Hensel’s lemma. • S = Z/nZ: CRT! Cool stuﬀ commented out: (Brief p-adics interlude. There are rings called Zp and Qp that I won’t talk about in class. Here’s why. A diophantine problem has a solution over Zp iﬀ it has a solution over Z/pn for all n. Diophantine problems over Qp can be reduced to diophantine equations over Zp, likewise to Q and Z.) Also you can do diophantine problems in polynomial rings; you saw one on Aaron’s handout and there’s another one below. 1 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 2 Techniques and Heuristics But all is not lost! With persistence and ingenuity, our intrepid mathematicians can rescue many equations from the depths of unsolvedness! • Sandwiching: e.g. if you want to prove that some expression X cannot be a perfect kth power, show that nk < X < nk+1 for some n. This method generalizes. • If you’re looking to construct a solution, try clever algebraic specializations/substitutions. Always remember that linear is better than quadratic is better than cubic, etc. But it’s nice to make things factor! (Or at least have singularities.) • Pythagorean triples. • Pythagoras plus: how to get a general formula for rational solutions to ax2 + by2 = cz2 if you already have a single solution. WARNING: this method does not work for integer solutions. • Pell’s equation/recurrences. • Inﬁnite descent. Generally happens when your equation has a lot of symmetries, which generally happens with Pell-type equations. • Quadratic Reciprocity and another reciprocity-ish law. Quadratic reciprocity can be stated in the following form: let P (x) = x2 +(−1) (p−1)/2p. Then if q ̸= p is a prime, q divides P (a) for some integer a if and only if q is a square mod p. Let Φn(x) be the nth cyclotomic polynomial. If q is a prime not dividing n, q divides P (a) for some integer a if and only if q is 1 mod n. Exercises: Prove the statements above. Cool optional stuﬀ: Let ζn be an nth root of unity. Let G be a subgroup of Z/nZ ∗ and αG = ∑ g∈G ζ g n. Let fG(x) be the minimal polynomial of α. Then for all primes p not dividing some discriminant (which should be something like n; what is it?) fG has a root mod p (which is equivalent to f has n roots mod p?) if and only if the reduction of p is an element of α. Cool optional stuﬀ: Example: G is the subgroup of quadratic residues. Exercise: fG = x2 ± p, where the sign depends upon what p is mod 4. cool optional stuﬀ: Example: G = {1, −1}, n = 7. Then the polynomial is x3 + x2 − 2x − 1, which has root ζ7 + ζ −1 7 . • Look beyond Z: factorizations in Z[i] and Z[ω]. 3 Examples 1 (TST 2002). Find in explicit form all ordered pairs of positive integers m, n such that mn − 1 divides m2 + n2. 2 (IMO Shortlist 2002). classic specialization problem. also on Team Contest. Is there an integer m such that the equation 1 a + 1 b + 1 c = m a+b+c has inﬁnitely many solutions in positive integers a, b, c? 2 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 3. reciprocity. IMO shortlist. Move to example. Find all integer solutions of the equation x7 − 1 x − 1 = y5 − 1. 4 (IMO Shortlist 2002). classic example of sandwiching Let P be a cubic polynomial given by P (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, d are integers and a ̸= 0. Suppose that xP (x) = yP (y) for inﬁnitely many pairs x, y of integers with x ̸= y. Prove that the equation P (x) = 0 has an integer root. 4 Problems 5 (IMO Shortlist 2001). Consider the system x + y = z + u, 2xy = zu. Find the greatest value of the real constant m such that m ≤ x/y for any positive integer solution (x, y, z, u) of the system, with x ≥ y. 6. Let λ be a complex number. Show that if a(x) is a rational function with complex coeﬃcients such that a(x)(a(x) − 1)(a(x) − λ) is the square of a rational function, then a(x) is a constant function. Descent by 2-isogeny; why can’t I do this? 7.

Sequence {an} satisﬁes: a1 = 3, a2 = 7, a2 n + 5 = an−1an+1, n ≥ 2. If an + (−1) n is prime, prove that there exists a nonnegative integer m such that n = 3 m. 11 (MOP 2000?). Suppose p, N, D are positive integers such that p = x2 1 + Dy2 1 N p = x2 2 + Dy2 2 for some integers x1, y1, x2, y2. Then show that there are integers x, y such that N = x2 + Dy2. 3 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 12 (MOP 2007, Ramanujan?). Show that there exist inﬁnitely many positive integers n such that n = a3 + b3 = c3 + d 3 with for positive integers a, b, c, d with {a, b} ̸= {c, d}. 13 (MOP 02). Show that there are inﬁnitely many ordered quadruples of integers (x, y, z, w) such that all six of xy + 1, xz + 1, xw + 1, yz + 1, yw + 1, zw + 1 are perfect squares. 14 (IMO Shortlist 2003). An integer n is said to be good if |n| is not the square of an integer. Determine all integers m with the following property: m can be represented, in inﬁnitely many ways, as a sum of three distinct good integers whose product is the square of an odd integer. 15 (MOP 98). Let p be a prime congruent to 3 mod 4, and let a, b, c, d be integers such that a 2p + b2p + c2p = d 2p. Show that p divides abc. 5 Problems from the real world These are diophantine equations over Q that I found in published math papers; they were con- structed as examples of diophantine equations with certain properties (generally failure of local- to-global), but their solutions are elementary. 16 (Reichardt-Lind). Show that there are no rational solutions to the equation x4 − 17y4 = 2z2. 17 (Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer).
