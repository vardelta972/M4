{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/Calculus/Handouts/calc_test_2.pdf","text":"November, 2020 Instructor: Aditya Ghosh Ramanujan School of Mathematics Class Test 2 on Calculus Time allotted: 1.5 hours Total points: 35 Attempt all the questions. You can use any result discussed in the class, but you have to state it properly. Since it is a ‘take-home’ exam, I can only request you to give the test honestly and abide by the time limit. Do not cheat to yourself. All the best! 1. (5+5 points) Let a1, a2, . . . , an be any n positive real numbers. Calculate the following limits: (i) lim x→0 (ax 1 + ax 2 + · · · + ax n n )1/x , (ii) lim x→∞ (ax 1 + ax 2 + · · · + ax n n )1/x . (The answers might involve a1, . . . , an, of course!) 2. (5 points) Let P (x) be any polynomial with positive real coeﬃcients. De- termine, with proof, the following limit: lim x→∞ ⌊P (x)⌋ P (⌊x⌋) where ⌊x⌋ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x. 3. (10 points) Suppose that f : [1, 2] → R is a continuous function that satisﬁes f (x) = ∞∑ n=1 f (x 1/n) 2n for every x ∈ [1, 2]. Show that f must be a constant function. 4. (10 points) Find all values of θ > 0 for which the following series converges: ∞∑ n=1 ( θ√ nθ + 1 − n cos 1 nθ/2 )θ. (You may use this result: ∑∞ n=1 n−β converges iﬀ β > 1. You need not prove it here.)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
