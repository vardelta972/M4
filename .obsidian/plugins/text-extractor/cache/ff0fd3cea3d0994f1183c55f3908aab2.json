Attempt all the questions. Answers without proper explanations will fetch zero. Show all your rough work – partial solutions may be rewarded. You can use any theorem/result without proving it again; but you have to state it properly. 1. Suppose that f : R → R is a continuous function such that f (x) ̸= x for every x ∈ R. Is it possible that there exists some c ∈ R such that f (f (c)) = c? 2. Let f : [0, 1] → R be a function satisfying f (2x) = 3f (x) for every 0 ≤ x ≤ 1/2. If f is bounded, show that lim x→0+ f (x) = f (0). 3. Determine, with proof, whether the following statements are true or false: (If true then provide a proof, else provide a counter-example) (a) If lim x→0 f (x) = c then lim x→0 f (sin x) = c. (b) If lim x→0 f (sin x) = c then lim x→0 f (x) = c. 4. Determine, with proof, the value of the following limit lim n→∞ tan n ( π 4 + 1 n ) . 5. Let f, g : R → R be continuous functions such that given any two points x1 < x2, there exists a point x3 between x1 and x2 such that f (x3) = g(x3). Show that f (x) = g(x) for every x ∈ R. Do not cheat to yourself. All the best! Teacher: Aditya Ghosh","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
