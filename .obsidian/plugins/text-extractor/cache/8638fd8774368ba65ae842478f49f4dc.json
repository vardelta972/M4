(We allow the sets I or J to be empty; in this case the corresponding sum is 0.) If there are several such partitions, one is chosen arbitrarily. Then we set Ak+1 = (y1, . . . , yn), where yi = xi + 1 if i ∈ I, and yi = xi − 1 if i ∈ J. Prove that for some k, the sequence Ak contains an element x such that |x| ≥ n 2 .
