In particular we prove Fermat’s theorem on primes of the form 4n + 1. 2 Congruences First a short summary of some facts about congruences. An excellent reference for this section’s results is Richard Courant and Herbert Robbins’ What is Mathematics? (Section 2, Supplement to Chapter 1). Let m be an integer. We write a ≡ b (mod m), and say that a is congruent to b modulo m, if a and b have the same remainder on division by m. Equivalently, a ≡ b mod m if and only if a − b is divisible by m. The following facts about congruences will be used without explicit mention, and can be easily proved: 1. If a ≡ b mod m and c ≡ d mod m, then a + c ≡ b + d mod m. 2. If a ≡ b mod m and c ≡ d mod m, then ac ≡ bd mod m. Lemma 1. Let p be a prime. Then for every positive integer a such that 0 < a < p there exists a unique positive integer b such that ab ≡ 1 mod p and 0 < b < p. The number b will be called the inverse of a modulo p. Proof. Let us consider the numbers 1 · a, 2 · a, . . . , (p − 1) · a or rather their remainders on division by p. These remainders must be all diﬀerent. For if i · a ≡ j · a (mod p) for some integers 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p − 1 and j, then i · a − j · a = (i − j)a must be divisible by p, which is impossible as i − j and a are both smaller than p. Therefore (Pigeonhole Principle!) one of these remainders must be 1. Thus k · a ≡ 1 mod p for some integer k such that 0 < k < p − 1, and we can set b = k. Suppose that this inverse is not unique; that is, that there is another positive integer c such that 0 < c < p and ac ≡ 1 mod p. Then we can consider the product bac, for which we will have bac = (ba)c ≡ 1 · c = c (mod p), bac = b(ac) ≡ b · 1 = b (mod p). Hence b ≡ c mod p, which implies b = c. Theorem 2 (Wilson). Let p be a prime. Then (p − 1)! ≡ −1 mod p. 1 Proof. Modulo p, the residues 1 and p − 1 are their own inverses. We claim there are no other such residues. Indeed, if x2 ≡ 1 mod p, for some 0 < x < p, then x2 − 1 ≡ 0 mod p. That is, x2 − 1 = (x − 1)(x + 1) is divisible by p, which means either x − 1 or x + 1 is divisible by p. Thus x = 1 or x = p − 1. This means that all numbers 2, 3, . . . , p − 2 can be split into pairs so that in each pair the integers are mutual inverses. Hence (p − 2)! ≡ 1 (mod p). So (p − 1)! = (p − 2)!(p − 1) ≡ p − 1 ≡ −1 (mod p). and Wilson’s theorem follows. 3 Fermat’s theorem Lemma 3. Let n > 1 be a positive integer. Then for every positive integer u there exist integers x, y,not both zero, such that 0 ≤ |x| ≤ √n and 0 ≤ |y| ≤ √n and xu ≡ y mod n. Proof. Let k = ⌊√n⌋ be the integer part of √n. Then k2 ≤ n < (k + 1)2. Let us consider the (k + 1)2 integers xu − y, where both x and y take values from the set {0, 1, 2, . . . , k}. As n < (k + 1) 2, we have more such diﬀerences than remainders on dividing by n. Thus, by the Pigeonhole Principle, two such diﬀerences are congruent modulo n; that is, x1u − y1 ≡ x2u − y2 (mod n) for some x1, x2, y1, y2, where either x1 ̸= x2 or y1 ̸= y2. Hence (x1 − x2)u ≡ y1 − y2, and x = x1 − x2 and y = y1 − y2 satisfy the conditions of the lemma. Theorem 4 (Fermat). Let p = 4n + 1 be a prime. Then there exist positive integers x and y such that x2 + y2 = p. Proof. We will prove, ﬁrst, that u 2 ≡ −1 mod p for u = ((p − 1)/2)!. We note that p − 1 ≡ −1 (mod p), p − 2 ≡ −2 (mod p), . . . (p − 1)/2 + 1 ≡ −(p − 1)/2 (mod p) where we have (p − 1)/2 = 2n, i.e. an even number, of such pairs. Multiplying them all, we get (p − 1)! ((p − 1)/2)! ≡ (−1) 2n(((p − 1)/2)!) = (((p − 1)/2)!) (mod p). Since, by Wilson’s theorem (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p), this implies −1 ≡ (p − 1)! ≡ (((p − 1)/2)!)2 = u2 (mod p). Now we will use Lemma 3, to ﬁnd two integers x, y such that 1. 0 ≤ |x| ≤ √p and 0 ≤ |y| ≤ √p; and, 2 2. xu ≡ y mod p. Since √p is not a whole number, the inequalities in the ﬁrst property are strict; that is, 0 ≤ |x| < √p and 0 ≤ |y| < √p. So x2 < p and y2 < p, and hence 0 < x 2 + y2 < 2p. From the second property, we get that y2 ≡ x2u2 ≡ −x2 mod p, so x2 + y2 ≡ 0 mod p Combining these gives x2 + y2 = p, which proves the theorem. 4 Problems 1. Given n pairwise coprime positive integers which are greater than 1 but smaller than (2n − 1)2, prove that at least one of them is prime.
