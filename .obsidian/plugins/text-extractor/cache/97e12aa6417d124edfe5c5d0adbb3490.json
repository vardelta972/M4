Assume there exists such a solution other than (0, 0, 0). Divide both sides by the greatest power of 2 that is a divisor of x2, y2, and z2. Then the RHS is an even multiple of xyz, so either one or all of x, y, and z are even. The latter is impossible, as we already divided out by the greatest power of two. In the former case, since one of x, y ,and z is even, the RHS is a multiple of four. All squares are congruent to either 0 or 1 mod 4 depending on if they are even or odd, so we have: 0 + 1 + 1 ≡ 0 (mod 4) This is a contradiction, so there can not exist any solutions other than (0, 0, 0). 1.3 Same Proof, Diﬀerent Style We will use proof by contradiction. Assume there exists such a solution other than (0, 0, 0). Clearly, either x, y, z are all even, or at least one of them is odd. Case 1: x, y, z are all even and at least one of them is not zero. If x, y, z are all even, then let n be the largest power of 2 that divides x, y, z. Since x, y, z are not all zero, n is a ﬁnite number. Let x = 2 na, y = 2 nb, z = 2 nc. If a, b, c are all even, 2 n+1 would divide x, y, z, making our ﬁrst statement false. At least one of a, b, c must 1 be odd. Now we have a2 + b2 + c + 2 = 2 xabc, where x > 2. A square must be 0 or 1 in mod 4, and the RHS is 0 mod 4, so the LHS must be 0+0+0, and therefore a, b, c are all even. Contradiction. x, y, z are not all even unless they are all zero. Case 2: At least one of x, y, z is odd. The RHS is either 0 or 2 mod 4. If it is 0 mod 4, all our solutions are even. Therefore, the RHS must be 2 mod 4. Then the LHS must be 1 + 1 + 0, so one of x, y, z is even, but then the RHS would be 0 mod 4. Contradiction. None of x, y, z are odd. There can not exist any solutions other than (0, 0, 0). 1.4 Notes LHS: Left Hand Side of the equation RHS: Right Hand Side of the equation First, we can notice that the LHS has order 2 while the RHS has order 3, so the diophantine equation would be hard to approach directly with algerbra. Thus, we try mods. Seeing squares, the ﬁrst mod we should try is mod 4. The easiest way to ﬁnd this solution would be to examine every value of x, y, z in mod 4. In general, Euler’s Totient Theorem (aϕ(n) ≡ {0, 1} (mod n)) can help you decide what mod to take equations in. 2 [Putnam 1993] A deck containing 2n cards numbered from 1 to 2n is shuﬄed and n cards are dealt to each of two players, Alice and Bob. Starting with Alice, the two players take turns discarding one of their remaining cards. A player can win at anytime by discarding a card that causes the sum of the numbers of all the discarded cards to be divisible by 2n + 1. If both Alice and Bob play ﬂawlessly, what is the probability that Alice wins? 2.1 Answer Alice has 0 probability of winning. In other words, Bob always wins. 2.2 Proof Whenever it is Bob’s turn, he will always have one more card than Alice. Each card Bob plays will allow Alice only one winning card, so at least one of his cards will ensure that Alice does not have a winning move. Since the sum of all the cards is divisible by 2n + 1, and Bob goes last, Bob can win as long as he keeps Alice from making a winning move. 2.3 Notes Notice that the random shuﬄing makes no diﬀerence in this problem. To familiarize yourself with game problems, try playing several diﬀerent starting states of the game. This time, you 2 should realize Bob always wins after playing the game several times. Knowing the answer makes the proof a lot easier to ﬁnd. Another possible observation you might make is that, while playing as Bob, you don’t have to try very hard to win - any move that doesn’t cause you to lose immediately seems to be ﬁne. This is one way to motivate the ﬁrst observation of the problem (that Bob always has one more card than Alice on his turn). 3 [IMO 1985] In a convex cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, a circle has its center on side AB and is tangent to BC, CD, and DA. Prove that AD + BC = AB. 3.1 Proof #1 Let the circle with center at point O touch BC, CD, and DA at P, Q, and R, respectively. Let angle A be α. OP = OQ = OR since they are radii of the same circle. ∠OP C = ∠OQC = ∠ORD = 90 ◦. By the Pythagorean Theorem, √OC 2 − OP 2 = √OC 2 − OQ2 = P C = QC. Similarly, QD = RD. ABCD is cyclic, so ∠A + ∠C = 180 ◦. Also △OP C ∼= △OQC, so ∠OCP = ∠OCQ = 180−α 2 . Let X be a point on line AD on the same side of A as D such that AO = AX = AR + RX (or −AR + RX, depending which side of A the point R is on) Since △AOX is isosceles, ∠AOX = ∠AXO = 180−α 2 . Now we have △ORX ∼= △OQC, and RX = QC. Combining multiple equations, we get AO = AR + RX = AR + QC = AR + P C. Similarly, BO = BP + RD. Adding these last two equations, we get AB = AD + BC, which is our desired result. QED. 3.2 Notes After drawing several large and accurate diagrams, you might notice that AO = AR + P C. Working backwords from this point, we can motivate the construction of point X, which is the key to this geometry problem. 3.3 Proof #2 Let AD and BC intersect at E. The circle tangent to BC, CD, and DA must have a center I lying along angle bisectors of D, C, and E and also along AB by the problem condition. Since ABCD is cyclic, ∠EBA = ∠EDC and ∠EAB = ∠ECD, so △CDE ∼ △ABE. Now reﬂect AB across EI to A′B′. As EC and ED are reﬂections across EI, A′ lies on EC and B′ lies on ED. Also, BA′ and AB′ are reﬂections of each other, so they are equal and CB + AD = CA′ + DB′. Thus it suﬃces to show that CA′ + DB′ = A′B′. Since △A′B′E ∼= △ABE ∼ △CDE, A′B′ ∥ CD. Now reﬂect A′ across CI to A′′. ∠A′CI = ∠ICA ′′ = ∠A′IC = ∠A′′IC, so CA′IA′′ is a parallelagram. Therefore, A′I = CA′′ = CA′ 3 (as they are reﬂections of each other), so CA′I is isoceles. By similar logic, DB′I is isoceles. Then A′B′ = A′I + IB′ = A′C + B′D, so AD + BC = AB and we are done. 3.4 Notes The reason we draw point E is because we need some way to use the condition of tangency. If we make AD, BC, and CD sides of a triangle, then the tangency condition is equivalent to saying that the incenter or an excenter of CDE lies on AB, which is a much easier condition to work with. You might start with the case where I is the incenter, since this is, again, easier to work with. Whenever angle bisectors appear, a natural thing to try is reﬂections. Reﬂecting AB leaves us with a trapezoid A′B′DC where the angle bisectors of CD meet on A′B′. This is an even nicer ﬁgure to work with. Upon drawing several diagrams, we note that CA′I and DB′I are always isoceles. As we once again have angle bisectors, we reﬂect again and ﬁnd a way to show that the resulting ﬁgure is a rhombus. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
