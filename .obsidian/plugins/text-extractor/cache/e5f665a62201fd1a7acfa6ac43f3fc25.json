Consider the equation ax + by = c where a, b, c are given integers and we seek solutions for integer x, y. Show that, the equation has a solution iﬀ d | c where d = gcd(a, b). Furthermore, if (x0, y0) be a particular solution then show that all other solutions are given by x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 − (a/d)t where t is an arbitrary integer. Hint: For existence, use Bezout’s theorem. Other parts are simple divisibility problems. 2. If {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n with n > 2, then show that ∑ϕ(n) i=1 ri ≡ 0 (mod n). Hint: Pair up the coprime remainders as k and n − k. (Same hint for problem 3 below.) 3. For any n ∈ N, ﬁnd the average of all integers in {1, 2, . . . , n} that are coprime to n. 4. For any n ∈ N, deﬁne Un to be the set of positive integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. For example, U12 = {1, 5, 7, 11}. Let m, n be coprime positive integers. Deﬁne a function f : Umn → Um × Un as f (c mod mn) = (c mod m, c mod n). Show that f is bijective and hence prove that ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n) for coprime m, n ∈ N. Hint: To prove f is onto, use CRT. 5. Suppose that m, n are natural numbers such that ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Is it necessary that m, n must be coprime? Hint: Show that ϕ(mn) mn = ϕ(m) m ϕ(n) n d ϕ(d) where d = gcd(m, n). To show this, you may use the formula for ϕ(n) that evolves from prime factorisation of n. 6. A number is called square-free if it is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Show that there exists 2020 consecutive integers none of which is square-free. Hint: Grab 2020 distinct primes and make N + i ≡ 0 (mod p2 i ). 7. What is the remainder when 12 345678 is divisible by 90? Hint: Call it X. Note that X ≡ 0 (mod 2), X ≡ 1 (mod 5), X ≡ 0 (mod 9) (Euler’s theorem may be useful). Now ﬁnd X (mod 90) using CRT. Ans: 36. 8. Consider the sequence a1, a2, . . . deﬁned by an = 2 n + 3n + 6n − 1 (n = 1, 2, . . . ). Show that no positive integer other than 1 is coprime to every term of the sequence. Hint: Show that for every prime p there is some n such that p | an. 9. There are no positive integers m, n, p such that 4mn − m − n = p2. Hint: (4m − 1)(4n − 1) = 4p2 + 1. Pick a prime q = −1 (mod 4) that divides 4m − 1. 10. A natural number n is said to have the property P, if for every a, n 2 divides a n − 1 whenever n divides an − 1. (a) Show that every prime number n has property P. (b) Show that there are inﬁnitely many composite numbers n that possess property P. Hint: When p divides ax − 1 and ay − 1, we can conclude that p divides agcd(x,y) − 1. For part (b), try to use part (a). 1 11. (a) Show that there are exactly 2 numbers a in {2, 3, . . . , 9999} for which a2 − a is divisible by 10000. Find these values of a. (b) Let n be a positive integer. For how many numbers a in {2, 3, . . . , n2 − 1} is a2 − a divisible by n2? State your answer suitably in terms of n and justify. Hint: Let S = {1, 2, . . . , n2}. Fixing two coprime integers x, y such that xy = n2, let us ﬁnd all a ∈ S for which x | a and y | a − 1 holds. By CRT, the system of congruences a ≡ 0 (mod x), a ≡ 1 (mod y) admit solution which is unique modulo xy = n 2. Ans: 2 k − 2 where k is the number of distinct prime factors of n. 12. Suppose {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n. Find all a such that {a + r1, a + r2, . . . , a + rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n. Hint: It will hold iﬀ a is divisible by each prime factor of n. Prove the if part and only if part separately. 13. Let a, b be positive integers. Prove that in the inﬁnite A.P. {ak + b : k ≥ 0}, there exist inﬁnitely many terms with the same prime divisors. (In other words, you need to ﬁnd an inﬁnite subsequence whose set of prime divisors is ﬁxed.) Hint: Let d = gcd(a, a + b). Write a = a1d, a + b = cd. Now, cϕ(a1) ≡ 1 (mod a1). Can you ﬁnd inﬁnitely many terms in the AP which have no prime factors other than those primes that divide cd? 14. Prove that the sequence 2 n − 3(n > 1) contains a subsequence of numbers that are pairwisely coprime. Hint: Proceed inductively. Suppose that ai = 2 ni − 1 (i = 1, 2, . . . , k) are constructed, where 2 = n1 < n2 < · · · < nk such that a1, . . . , ak are pairwisely coprime. Deﬁne s = a1a2 · · · ak and construct a new nk+1 such that ak+1 = 2 nk+1 − 1 is coprime to s. 15. The positive integers a and b are such that the numbers 15a + 16b and 16a − 15b are both squares of positive integers. What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the sum of these two squares? Hint: Call them x2 and y2. What is x4 + y4? Next, use the following lemma: Suppose p | x4 + y4 where x, y are integers and p is an odd prime, such that p ̸= 1 (mod 8). Then p must divide both x and y. Ans: 2 × 481 2. 16. Find all pairs of positive integers (x, p) such that p is a prime, x ≤ 2p, and xp−1 divides (p − 1)x + 1. Hint: Let us assume x, p ≥ 3 (other cases are trivial). Observe that x must be odd. Let q be the smallest prime divisor of x. By Fermat’s little theorem, (p − 1) q−1 = 1 (mod q). To combine this with (p − 1)x = −1 (mod q), use Bezout’s theorem. Can you ﬁnd any relation among q, p or x, p? Ans: (2, 2), (3, 3), and (1, p), for any prime p. Some of the above problems are taken from past IMOs or IMOSLs. Two more problems that you might try now: (i) IMOSL 2000 #14, and (ii) IMOSL 1992 #15. For solutions, see The IMO compendium. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
