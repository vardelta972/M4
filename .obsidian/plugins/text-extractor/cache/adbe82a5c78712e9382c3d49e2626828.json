The roots (solutions) of a quadratic polynomial are x1,2 = −b ± √b2 − 4ac 2a There are many problems about roots of quadratic polynomials, however it is not always the best idea to use the above formula. Some other techniques include: 1. Vieta’s Theorem: ax2 + bx + c = a(x − x1)(x − x2) where x1, x2 are the roots. Therefore: x1 + x2 = − b a , x1x2 = c a 2. Discriminant: The discriminant of an equation ax2 + bx + c is D = b2 − 4ac. The equation has two real roots if D > 0, one real root if D = 0, and no real roots if D < 0. 3. Graph: It is sometimes useful to consider the graph of a function. The graph of f (x) = ax2 + bx + c is a parabola that opens up if a > 0 and a parabola that opens down if a < 0. The graph will cross the x-axis if there are two real roots, touch it if there is one real root, and not intersect it at all if there are no real roots. The graph is symmetric with respect to the vertical line x = − b 2a . 4. Manipulation: Algebraic manipulations are very important in solving many mathematical problems, not just ones about quadratic polynomials. Seeing and knowing how to manipulate a given expression to get something useful is a handy skill that comes with practice. Factoring is always a good thing to try. Problems 1. Find the sum of the roots of equation (x+1)(x+2)+(x+3)(x+4)+. . .+(x+99)(x+100) = 0. 2. Solve (x2 + 3x + 2)(x2 + 7x + 12) + (x2 + 5x + 6) = 0. 3. Let k be a non-zero real number. Find, in terms of k, the roots of x2 + (k − 1 k )x − 1 = 0. 4. Let the roots of x2 − 17x + 13 = 0 be r and s. What is the value of: (a) r2s2 (b) r2 + s2 (c) r2s + s2r (d) r3 + s3 (Hint: you are not supposed to use the quadratic formula) 5. Do there exist positive integers a, b, c such that each of the equations ax2 + bx + c = 0, ax2 − bx + c = 0, ax2 + bx − c = 0, ax2 − bx − c = 0, has two integer roots? 6. The absolute value of the diﬀerence of the roots of the quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c is 2. (a) What is the absolute value of the diﬀerence of the roots of the equation ax2 + 6bx + 36c? (b) Prove the absolute value of the diﬀerence of the roots of the equation ax2 + 10bx + 27c is at least 2 √27. (Hint: think about how you can use Vieta’s formula) 1 Math Circles 2010-2011 Alexander Remorov Some Problems from Competitions Recall that a2 − b2 = (a − b)(a + b); this may help for some of the problems below. 1. (Euclid 2010) Determine all real values of x such that (x + 8)4 = (2x + 16)2. 2. (Euclid 2008) Determine all k ̸= 0 such that the equation y = kx2 + (5k + 3)x + (6k + 5) touches the x−axis. 3. (Fermat 2008) For how many integers k do the graphs of y = − 1 8 x2 + 4 and y = x2 − k intersect on or above the x−axis? 4. (COMC 2008) Determine all real x such that (a) (x + 3)(x − 6) = −14 (b) 22x − 3(2x) − 4 = 0 (c) (x2 − 3x)2 = 4 − 3(3x − x2) (Hint: for (b), (c), use substitution). 5. (COMC 2004) (a) Determine the two values of x such that x2 − 4x − 12 = 0. (b) Determine the one value of x such that x − √4x + 12 = 0. (c) (Hard) Determine all real c such that x2 − 4x − c − √8x2 − 32x − 8c = 0 has exactly two real solutions for x. Harder Problems 1. It is known that (a + b + c)c < 0. Prove that b2 > 4ac. (Hint: b2 − 4ac is a discriminant of a certain equation...) 2. f (x) and g(x) are quadratic polynomials. The polynomial f (x) + g(x) has two distinct roots, each of which is a root of f (x) − (g(x))3 = 0. Prove that f (x) = Cg(x) for some constant C. (Hint: you have f (x) + g(x) = 0 and f (x) − (g(x))3=0 when x is a root of f (x) + g(x) = 0.) 3. Let f (x) = x2 + bx + c. Prove that at least one of the numbers |f (−1)|, |f (0)|, |f (1)| is greater than 1 2 . 4. There are several quadratic polynomials, such that each of them has two real roots, and the diﬀerence of any two of them has no real roots. Prove that the sum of all of the polynomials has at least one real root. (Hint: look at the graphs of the polynomials.) 5. A quadratic polynomial P (x) satisﬁes −1 ≤ P (x) ≤ 1 for 0 ≤ x ≤ 1.
