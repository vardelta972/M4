Mildorf June 6, 2010 Abstract. This paper develops some basic theorems in elementary number theory, especially those appearing on mathematical Olympiads, from the perspective of groups, rings, and group actions. 1 Introduction In the mid seventeenth century, the French lawyer Pierre de Fermat wrote a letter in which he challenged his friend Fr´enicle de Bessy to prove a famous little theorem [1]. A secretive purveyor of mathematical puzzles in his day, Fermat is credited with the discovery of many early results underlying modern calculus, probability theory, and diophantine analysis [2]. He is remembered in particular for a pair of theorems, his Little and Last theorems. The latter withstood 357 years of investigation before a sophisticated solution was found (ﬁnally!) by Andrew Wiles in 1994 [3]. The former, which is elementary, will be proved in this paper. Indeed, Fermat’s Little Theorem is a central piece of our discussion, which develops elementary number theory and modular arithmetic from the perspective of abstract algebra. We focus on the groups and rings of algebra. Groups, having the existence of unique inverses as their chief property, capture the essence of multiplication in modular arithmetic. Rings simply incorporate the addition operation. With this perspective, emphasizing abstraction, we suggest to the reader that results such as Fermat’s Little Theorem arise naturally as a progression that characterizes multiplicative order with increasing speciﬁcity. We also expend considerable energy motivating the discussion. Bystanders see mathematics as a dull collection of axioms. Mathematicians, on the other hand, have been known compare it to a Big Game Hunt in the Sahara Desert. Thus, our second idea is to impart a good sense of the behavior behind these axioms: what they do and how they relate. To this end, the organization is as follows. In Section 2, we give basic deﬁ- nitions, including all of those that will be assumed later. It may be skipped if the reader feels comfortable with groups; for students making this judgement, the notions of subgroups, cosets, quotient groups, and group homomorphisms 1 2 FUNDAMENTALS 2 should not be especially encumbering. In Section 3, we introduce basic elements of group actions and ring theory. We start with the general Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem. From it, we arrive easily at Lagrange’s Theorem, Euler’s Theorem, Fermat’s Little Theorem, Wilson’s Theorem, and Eisenstein’s Criterion. Sec- tion 4 focuses on ﬁnding elements with speciﬁc orders. Using Fermat’s Little Theorem, we connect the discussion with multiplication in the ﬁeld Z/pZ. We then build up the precise structure of Z/nZ, proving and using the Chinese Remainder Theorem in the process. At last, we establish the Primitive Root Theorem. As a bonus, we include an additional section, which introduces the combinatorial Nullstellensatz, a powerful theorem concerning the zeros of mul- tivariate polynomials. With it, one can solve many problems by writing down and analyzing a suitably constructed polynomial. 2 Fundamentals As an aid to the reader, we provide in this section a sketch of the results aris- ing in the ﬁrst week or so of an introductory course in abstract algebra. The propositions and their corollaries in this section are manifold, though simple; we leave some of their proofs as exercises for the reader. Deﬁnition 2.1. A group (G, ·) is a set G together with a binary law of com- position · : G × G → G having the following three properties. 1. Associativity: the equality a · (b · c) = (a · b) · c holds for all a, b, c ∈ G. 2. Identity: an element e ∈ G exists, such that g · e = g = e · g for all g ∈ G. 3. Inverses: for each element g ∈ G there exists an h ∈ G such that g · h = e. A group is called abelian or commutative if the law of composition is commuta- tive. For example, the integers under addition, or the positive reals under mul- tiplication are examples of groups. The underlying set need not be inﬁnite. For example, let n be a positive integer and deﬁne X = {1, 2, . . . n}. There are n! permutations of X, or bijective functions σ : X → X. Under the natural composition of maps, these permutations give rise to the symmetric group Sn. The immediate consequences of the group axioms are numerous; we collect several here. Proposition 2.1. A group has a unique identity element. Proof. Suppose that e and f are identity elements. Then e = e · f = f. Proposition 2.2 (Cancellation Law). If a, b, g ∈ G are such that a · g = b · g, then a = b. 2 FUNDAMENTALS 3 Proof. Multiply through by g−1, obtaining a = a · e = a · (g · g−1) = (a · g) · g−1 = (b · g) · g−1 = b · (g · g−1) = b · e = b. Proposition 2.3 (Mutuality). If g · h = e, then h · g = e as well. Proof. Write e · h = h · e = h · (g · h) = (h · g) · h. Now apply the Cancellation Law. Proposition 2.4. Each group element g ∈ G has a unique inverse. Proof. Let g ∈ G and suppose that x, y ∈ G are such that g · x = g · y = e. By Mutuality, x · g = e, so that x = x · e = x · (g · y) = (x · g) · y = e · y = y. To promote diligence, we shall leave the proofs of the remaining propositions in this section as exercises. It is customary to exchange · for + as the notation for composition in an abelian group. Respecting this convention, the identity of an arbitrary group is often denoted 1, while the identity element is denoted 0 in a commutative group. Considering its uniqueness, the inverse of an element g ∈ G is denoted g−1; under this notation, mutuality becomes (g−1) −1 = g. As is typical, we will henceforth omit the operator when context makes it clear what composition is meant. The associativity condition makes ﬁnite products of group elements unam- biguous, and the two-sidedness of identity elements makes them and inverses unique. Essentially, the group axioms allow us to make sense of so-called words of a group, such as abca −1db −1a, as group elements. In particular, expressions such as g3 = ggg and g−4 = g−1g−1g−1g−1 have natural interpretations. Deﬁnition 2.2. A group homomorphism between the groups G and H is a map ϕ : G → H such that ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b) for all a, b ∈ G. A homomorphism has as kernel, denoted ker(ϕ) := {g | g ∈ G, ϕ(g) = eH }, and an image, denoted im(ϕ) := {ϕ(g) | g ∈ G}. Proposition 2.5 (Composition). Suppose that ϕ : G → H and ϕ : H → K are group homomorphisms. Then the composition ϕ ◦ ϕ : G → K is also a group homomorphism. Homomorphisms often have other properties. For instance, a homomorphism ϕ : G → H is injective if ker(ϕ) = {eG} and surjective if im(ϕ) = H. are isomor- phic, denoted G ∼= H. A homomorphism that is both injective and surjective is called an isomorphism. A trivial example is the identity map ⊮G : G → G is an isomorphism of G. 2 FUNDAMENTALS 4 Proposition 2.6. Let ϕ : G → H be a group homomorphism. Then ϕ is an isomorphism if and only if its inverse is. Thus, two groups G and H are called isomorphic if there exists an isomor- phism between them. This property, denoted G ∼= H, deﬁnes equivalence classes of groups because the identity map gives reﬂexivity, the preceding gives sym- metry, and composition gives transitivity. Isomorphisms are considered strong equivalence relations, and one is usually only interested in establishing results “up to isomorphism.” Indeed, the task of classifying ﬁnite simple groups means grouping them into equivalence classes by isomorphism. Deﬁnition 2.3. The order of a group (G, ·) is the cardinality of the set G and is denoted by |G|. If a ∈ G and there exists a positive integer n such that a n = e, then we say that a has order n where n is the smallest such integer. For instance, one speaks of the ﬁnite group of order two comprises because all groups of two elements are isomorphic. If G = {1, g}, then g · g = 1 because one also requires g · 1 = g and g · g ̸= g · 1. Then an isomorphism ϕ : G → G ′ between two such groups is given by ϕ(1) = 1 ′ and ϕ(g) = g′. Deﬁnition 2.4. A subset H of G is called a subgroup of group G if composition restricts to a map H × H → H that makes H into a group. A subgroup N of G is called normal if it is the kernel of a homomorphism from G, that is, if there exists some group homomorphism ϕ : G → K such that N = ker(ϕ). A subgroup inherits the identity element and inverses from the overlying group. The notation for the product of two group elements is often extended to the following products of an element and a subset: H ⊂ G and a ∈ G, then aH := {ah | h ∈ H} and Ha := {ha | h ∈ H}. Deﬁnition 2.5. If H is a subgroup of G, then a left coset of H is a set of the form aH for some a ∈ G, and a right coset is a set Ha. The index of a subgroup H is the number of distinct left cosets of H in G, denoted [G : H]. Deﬁnition 2.6. A subgroup N of G is normal if it is invariant under conju- gation, or gN g−1 = N for all g ∈ G. If N is a normal subgroup of G, then the quotient group G/N is the set of left cosets of N with the law of composition (gN )(hN ) = (gh)N and having order [G : N ]. Lemma 2.7 (First Isomorphism Theorem). If ϕ : G → H is a group homo- morphism, then G/ ker(ϕ) ∼= im(ϕ). Lemma 2.8. Suppose that H and K are normal subgroups of G with H ⊆ K. Then K/H is a normal subgroup of G/H and (G/H)/(K/H) ∼= G/K. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 5 Exercises Begin the following problems assuming that G is a group. 1. Verify that the rational numbers are a group under addition but not un- der multiplication. What are some subsets of the rational numbers that constitute a group under mutliplication? 2. Prove that for any a ∈ G, the set ⟨a⟩ = {a n : n ∈ Z} is a subgroup of G. This subgroup is called the cyclic subgroup of G generated by a. If G is a group and an element g ∈ G is such that ⟨g⟩ = G, then the group G is cyclic and g is a generator. 3. A subset H of a group G is a subgroup of G iﬀ for all a, b ∈ H, the element ab −1 is in H. 4. The intersection of two subgroups of G is also a subgroup of G. 5. Let H be a subgroup of G. The left (right) cosets of H partition G and have cardinality |H|. 6. The center of G is the set Z(G) of elements of G that commute with all of G, namely Z(G) = {z ∈ G | gz = zg ∀g ∈ G}. a) Prove that Z(G) is a subgroup of G. b) Show that Z(G) is a normal subgroup of G. 7. Consider the map ϕ : G → Aut(G) deﬁned by ϕ(g) = ϕg, where ϕg is the automorphism of G deﬁned by ϕg(h) = ghg−1. a) Show that ϕ is a homomorphism. b) Show that ker(ϕ) = Z(G). c) By the First Isomorphism Theorem, conclude that G/Z(G) ∼= Inn(G). 3 Basic Group and Ring Properties In this section, we focus on group actions and their role in determining general properties of order. We introduce rings and prove several easy results. Deﬁnition 3.1. Let G be a group and S any nonempty set. A left group action is a homomorphism from G to the group of permutations of S; in particular, we regard the action as a map · : G × S → S such that g · (h · s) = (gh) · s and e · s = s. The orbit of a point s ∈ S is the set Gs := {g · s | g ∈ G}, and the stabilizer of s is the set Gs := {g ∈ G | g · s = s}. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 6 For example, the cyclic group of order two, C2, always acts by exchanging certain pairs of elements and ﬁxing the remainder. Group actions often arise in geometry – as transformations of the plane; for instance, C2 may act as reﬂection along a line, or 180 ◦ rotation about a point. A group acts on itself, naturally, via its multiplication rule. Another natural group action is given by conjugation [4]. It is easily checked that the stabilizer Gs is a subgroup of G. To emphasize this structure, we call Gs the stabilizer subgroup of s. As is the case with groups, the · is often omitted when its context is clear. As an introduction to the axiomatics of group actions, let us prove a basic result about actions. Proposition 3.1. The orbits of a group action G × S → S partition S; the set of orbits is denoted S/G and called the orbit space. Proof. We check for reﬂexivity, symmetry, and transitivity in the relation s ∼ t, where s, t ∈ S, that indicates whether t ∈ Gs. We have s ∼ s as s = es ∈ Gs. Now if s ∼ t, then t ∈ Gs, so that there exists an element g ∈ G such that t = gs. It follows that s = es = (g−1g)s = g−1(gs) = g−1t, so that s ∈ Gt or t ∼ s as well. Finally, if s ∼ t and t ∼ u, then t = gs and u = ht for some g, h ∈ G, so that u = ht = h(gs) = (hg)s. It follows that u ∈ Gs, so that s ∼ u, as required. Thus, a group action provides equivalence classes (its orbits) on its image. Two elements belonging to the same equivalence class are often said to be iden- tiﬁed. Understanding structures is often key in mathematics. A group action G × S → S can make S into a graph. Treating the set S as vertices and drawing edges between pairs of elements sharing an orbit, we naturally form a graph comprising a disjoint union of cliques. The following counting theorem is equally easy to prove, yet in its generality underlies many interesting results. Theorem 3.2 (Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem). Suppose G acts on S. Fix a point s ∈ S arbitrarily, and let Ls be the set of left cosets of Gs in G. Then the map f : Gs → Ls deﬁned by gs 7→ gGs is well deﬁned and bijective. In particular, |Gs| = [G : Gs] and |Gs| · |Gs| = |G| for all s ∈ S. Proof. Suppose gs = hs. Then s = (g−1g)s = g−1(gs) = g−1(hs) = (g−1h)s, so that g−1h ∈ Gs. It follows that g−1hGs = Gs, so that hGs = gGs, proving that the map is well deﬁned. By its deﬁnition, the map is surjective. Injectivity 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 7 can be established by noting that if gGs = hGs, then g−1h ∈ Gs, so that (g−1h)s = s. Finally, hs = (g(g−1h))s = g((g−1h)s) = gs, as desired. Now observe that |Gs| = |Ls| = [G : Gs]. It is easy to see that the same number of elements of G carry s to each element of its orbit Gs, so that the equivalent formula |Gs| · |Gs| = |G| is obtained. As an application, one can easily deduce Burnside’s lemma, a combinatorial lemma with a colorful history. For our present purposes, however, we deduce a famous theorem of Lagrange. Corollary 3.3 (Lagrange’s Theorem). If H is a subgroup of a ﬁnite group G, then |G| = |H| · [G : H]. In particular, the order of the group is divisble by the order of any subgroup or any group element. Proof. Let LH be the set of cosets of H. Then G acts on LH by group multipli- cation. The stabilizer GH is just H, and the orbit of H is all of H’s cosets. By the Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem, we have |G| = |GH | · |LH | = |H| · [G : H]. Observe that the index [G : H] is a positive integer. To ﬁnish the proof, note that any group element by itself generates a cyclic subgroup of the same order. When the extra structure of a second operation is introduced, we move into the theory of rings. Deﬁnition 3.2. A ring is a set R together with commutative and associative binary operations +, · : R × R → R such that addition makes R into an abelian group and multiplication distributes over addition. Elements having multiplica- tive inverses are called units, and the set of all units is denoted R×. The set of integers Z is a ring, and so is the set of Gaussian integers Z[i]. The latter example shows that formal elements can be added to a ring. The polynomials with integer coeﬃcients over a single variable are denoted by Z[x]; they, too, form a ring. Often, multiplicative commutativity is dropped, but we maintain the axiom for the sake of simplicity. We remark also that the set of units R× forms a group under multiplication in R; accordingly, R× is often called the group of units. Deﬁnition 3.3. An ideal is a subset I ⊂ R that is closed under addition and satisﬁes rI ⊂ I for all r ∈ R. An ideal P is called prime if whenever r, s ∈ R and rs ∈ P then either r or s lies in P. Many closed operations on ideals are deﬁned: intersections, sums, and products of two ideals in the same ring are also ideals, where the latter two are deﬁned as I + J := {i + j | i ∈ I, j ∈ J} and IJ := {i1j1 + · · · + injn | i1, . . . , in ∈ I; j1, . . . , jn ∈ J}. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 8 Two ideals I and J in a ring R are called coprime if I + J = R. By analogy to cosets of normal subgroups, the additive cosets a + I := {a + i | i ∈ I} yield the quotient ring R/I, where addition and multiplication are deﬁned as (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I and (a + I)(b + I) = (ab) + I. In the integers, the multiples of 2 are denoted 2Z and form an ideal. The ideal aR is often abbreviated (a); still more generally, the ideal a1R + · · · + akR is written (a1, . . . , ak). Ideal addition respects this notation, in that (a) + (b) = (a, b), as can be quickly veriﬁed. Multiplication of ideals obeys IR = I. More curiously, multiplication also obeys IJ ⊂ I ∩ J. Now let m and n be positive integers and let p be a prime. Because m divides n if and only if n ∈ mZ, the deﬁnitions of prime and coprime ideals generalize the familiar arithmetic notions. If p divides the product mn, or equivalently mn ∈ pZ, then p divides m or p divides n, so that {m, n} ∩ pZ ̸= ∅. If m and n are coprime, then there exist integers s and t such that ms + nt = 1. It follows that 1 ∈ mZ + nZ, so that mZ + nZ = Z. Perhaps not surprisingly, (2)(3) = (6) in the ring of integers. In many rings, ideal factorization generalizes our notion of elementary factorization. However, we might equally well write (2) + (3) = (1). Let us recall the fundamental idea of a group homomorphism; it extends in a natural way to rings. Deﬁnition 3.4. A ring homomorphism is a map ϕ : R → S between two rings R and S such that ϕ(1R) = 1S and, for all a, b ∈ R, ϕ(a + b) = ϕ(a) + ϕ(b) and ϕ(ab) = ϕ(a)ϕ(b). Again, if ϕ is bijective, then its inverse is also a ring homomorphism and the rings R and S are isomorphic. By analogy with group theory, the kernel of a ring homomorphism ϕ : R → S is deﬁned ker(ϕ) := {r ∈ R | ϕr = 0S}. Likewise, the image of a ring homomor- phism is deﬁned im(ϕ) := {s ∈ S | ∃r ∈ R : s = ϕ(r)}. It is easy to check that the kernel is an ideal. Conversely, every ideal is the kernel of a homomorphism. For example, this can be seen from the natural quotient map R → R/I deﬁned by a 7→ a+I for all a ∈ R. Thus, quotient groups G/H and quotient rings R/I come equipped with natural homomorphisms, ϕ : G → G/H and ϕ : R → R/I; each identiﬁes a group (ring) element with the (additive) coset containing the element. We remark that there is a tendency to blur the distinction between a coset in the image and a representative (element) of the coset. When context is clear, this loses no information; however, we shall reserve g and a as typical quotient group and quotient ring elements (cosets) of which g and a are representatives, respectively. After these introductory concepts, we can now understand “the integers modulo n” more precisely as the quotient ring Z/nZ. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 9 Corollary 3.4 (Euler’s Theorem). If a and n be coprime positive integers, then n | a ϕ(n) − 1, where ϕ is Euler’s totient function. Proof. There are ϕ(n) integers b such that 0 ≤ b < n and (b, n) = 1; these are in bijective correspondence with units in (Z/nZ) ×. For, given such a b, there exist integers s and t such that bs + nt = 1; passing to the quotient ring, we have 1 = bs + nt = bs + nt = bs + nt = bs, so that b is a unit. Conversely, any integer not relatively prime to n cannot have a multiplcative inverse in Z/nZ. Now apply Lagrange’s Theorem. The following is an immediate consequence. Corollary 3.5 (Fermat’s Little Theorem). If a is an integer and p is prime, then p | a p − a. Proof. Either p | a or p ∤ a. In the latter case, note that ϕ(p) = p − 1 and use Euler’s Theorem. Nontrivial information is conveyed by homomorphisms. For example, it is sometimes easier to study factorization in a quotient ring. Consider the quotient map π : Z[x] → Z[x]/pZ[x] ∼= (Z/pZ)[x], where p is a prime. Then P (x) = Q(x)R(x) =⇒ P (x) = Q(x) R(x). With this in mind, a simple contradiction argument gives the following result. Corollary 3.6 (Eisenstein’s Criterion). If P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0 and p is a prime such that p ∤ an, p 2 ∤ a0, and p | ai for all i = 0, . . . , n − 1, then P (x) is irreducible. Proof. For, P (x) = anxn. If P (x) = Q(x) R(x) where both Q and R are noncon- stant, then both Q(x) and R(x) are divisible by x. Thus, p | Q(0) and p | R(0), contrary to p 2 ∤ a0. The familiar division algorithm for polynomials in a single variable depends only on the existence of multiplicative inverses. Although the division algorithm applies to arbitrary ﬁelds, many ring elements do not have inverses, so the algo- rithm does not apply to division by any arbitrary polynomial in R[x]. However, it is easy to see that division by a polynomial with a unit as leading coeﬃcient proceeds as usual. Proposition 3.7 (Factor Theorem). Let p(x) ∈ R[x] be a polynomial of degree n. For each element a ∈ R, there exists a polynomial q(x) of degree n − 1 such that p(x) − p(a) = (x − a)q(x). Proof. The division algorithm gives p(x) − p(a) = (x − a)q(x) + r, where r ∈ R is constant. Plugging in x = a shows that r = 0. Corollary 3.8 (Wilson’s Theorem). For a prime p, we have p | (p − 1)! + 1. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 10 Proof. Assume p > 2. Consider the polynomial p(x) = xp−1 − 1 in the ﬁeld Z/pZ. By Fermat’s Little Theorem, the roots of p(x) are 1, 2, . . . , p − 1. Using the factor theorem to expand, we have p(x) = (x − 1)(x − 2) · · · (x − (p − 1)) = xp−1 − · · · + 1 · 2 · · · (p − 1). The result follows by comparing this expansion to xp−1 − 1. Exercises Let G be a ﬁnite group. 1. Show that conjugation gives a group action G×G → G deﬁned by (g, h) 7→ h −1gh. 2. Let G × S → S be a group action. Show that for any s ∈ S the stabilizer Gs := {g | gs = s} is a subgroup of G. 3. (Burnside’s lemma) Let G × S → S be a group action and let Sg denote the subset of S ﬁxed by g ∈ G. Prove that the number of orbits is given by |S/G| = 1 |G| ∑ g∈G |Sg|. 4.

Determine the prime ideals in Z[x] and R[x]. 6. (Gauss’s Lemma) A primitive polynomial over Z is a polynomial p(x) ∈ Z[x] such that the coeﬃcients of p(x) have no common divisors other than the units ±1. a) Show that the product of two primitive polynomials is a primitive poly- nomial. Hint: examine the converse in a quotient ring. b) Let f (x) ∈ Z[x] be a primitive polynomial that factors as f (x) = g(x)h(x) for some nonconstant polynomials g(x), h(x) ∈ Q[x]. Argue that without loss of generality, there exist positive integers m and n such that mg(x) and nh(x) are primitive polynomials in Z[x]. c) Deduce that mn is a unit. d) Conclude that a polynomial in Z[x] factors in Z[x] if and only if it factors in Q[x]. Note that a similar result where Z is replaced by a unique factorization domain R and Q is replaced by the ﬁeld of fractions F of R. 3 BASIC GROUP AND RING PROPERTIES 11 7. Let a and n be coprime positive integers. Prove Euler’s theorem, that n divides a ϕ(n) − 1, by examining multiplication by a in the group of units (Z/nZ) ×. 8. Let p be a prime.

(First Sylow Theorem) Let p be a prime, let n be a positive integer, and suppose the order of G is an integer divisible by pn. a) Consider the collection C := {S ⊂ G : |S| = pn}, let |G| = p nr, and suppose that pm is the largest power of p dividing r. Show that p m is the largest power of p that divides |C|. b) Consider the group action G × C → C deﬁned by left multiplication, S 7→ gS = {gh : h ∈ S ⊂ G} for each g ∈ G.

(Third Sylow Theorem) Let np denote the number of Sylow p-subgroups of a ﬁnite group G, and let q be their common order. Show that np divides |G|/q and that np ≡ 1 (mod p). 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 12 4 Structure Theorems Many of the theorems in the previous section have in common that they give general properties of speciﬁc group elements. This section considers more de- tailed structures and addresses a dual question, whether there exist group ele- ments with speciﬁc properties. With the goal of constructing group elements of particular orders, we shall proceed combinatorially. For the remainder of this paper, G denotes a group, and m and n denote positive integers. We will abbreviate Z/nZ by Z/nZ and (Z/nZ) × by (Z/nZ)× . The order of an element g ∈ G is written OG(g), or simply O(g) where the context is clear. Recall that the order of an element is the least positive integer such that gO(g) = 1, or ∞ if no such integer exists. For any group element g ∈ G, the cyclic subgroup generated by g is deﬁned by ⟨g⟩ := {. . . , g−1, 1, g, g2, . . . }; if O(g) < ∞, then ⟨g⟩ = {1, g, . . . , gO(g)−1}. From the deﬁnition of O(g), we have gn = 1 if and only if O(g) | n. In particular, {n ∈ Z | gn = 1} = O(g)Z. Proposition 4.1. Let a group element g ∈ G have ﬁnite order. Then the order of each element of the subgroup ⟨g⟩ divides O(g), and every divisor of O(g) is the order of an element of ⟨g⟩. Proof. Consider a ∈ ⟨g⟩; there exists a unique integer 0 ≤ m < O(g) such that a = gm. Then a n = (gm) n = gmn, so that a n = 1 ⇐⇒ O(g) | mn. Writing n = O(g), it follows that a O(g) = 1, and O(a) | O(g). Moreover, O(a) = lcm(O(g), m)/m. Writing O(g) = d1d2 and putting m = d2 yields O(a) = lcm(O(g), d2)/d2 = O(g)/d2 = d1, as desired. The proposition above shows that we can easily ﬁnd group elements with small orders. In particular, the reader familiar with the poset of divisibility relations in the positive integers might notice that we have just shown that the set of group element orders is an order ideal [5]. A more diﬃcult investigation concerns the existence of elements with large orders, a matter to which we now turn. Proposition 4.2. If G is abelian and contains elements of coprime orders, m and n, then G contains an element of order mn. Proof. Let a, b ∈ G be such that O(a) = m and O(b) = n; we claim that the product ab is satisfactory. Observe that O(ab) | mn, since (ab) mn = amnbmn = (a m) n(b n)m = 1. On the other hand, a O(ab) = b−O(ab) ∈ ⟨a⟩ ∩ ⟨b⟩. Because 1 is the only common positive divisor of m and n, the orders of a O(ab) and b −O(ab) must be 1; that is, both elements are the identity. Then O(ab) is divisible by O(a) and O(b), as required. We should like to ﬁnd elements of coprime order. Knowing that order low- ering is an easy process, we might hope for the following compromise. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 13 Proposition 4.3. If G is abelian and contains elements of order m and n, then G contains an element of order lcm(m, n). Proof. Consider k so large that the index set I := {1, . . . , k} deﬁnes exponents such that m =: ∏ i∈I p ai i and n =: ∏ i∈I p bi i , where the sequence p1, p2, p3, . . . is the primes in increasing order. Deﬁne IA := {i ∈ I | ai ≥ bi}, the set of indices having maximal exponents in the factorization of m, and denote the complement IB := I \\ IA. By Proposition 3.1, G contains elements of orders m := ∏ i∈IA pai i and n := ∏ i∈IB p bi i . Because IA ∩ IB = ∅, the orders m and n are coprime, so that Proposition 3.2 gives an element of G having order m n = ∏ i∈IA p ai i ∏ i∈IB p bi i = ∏ i∈I p max{ai,bi} i = lcm(m, n), as desired. Motivated by our ability to usefully combine any pair of elements with ﬁnite order in an abelian group, we introduce the following deﬁnitions that amalga- mate all of the elements. Deﬁnition 4.1. A positive integer m is a universal order for the group G if gm = 1 for all g ∈ G. The smallest such integer is the least universal order of G and is denoted OG. A group need not have any universal order. Consider, for example, the group of integers under addition. In fact, there exist groups in which every element has ﬁnite order but no universal order exists; consider Q/Z under addition, for example. But not all is lost. Because the positive integers are well-ordered, if a group has a universal order then it has a least universal order. And there exist condi- tions that guarantee a universal order. Proposition 4.4. Every ﬁnite abelian group G contains an element of order OG, and OG divides |G|. Proof. Consider group elements g1, . . . , gk ∈ G. By Lagrange’s Theorem, these elements have ﬁnite orders O(g1), . . . , O(gk) dividing |G|. It follows that the least common multiple of these elements is the least universal order. In particular, it divides |G|. Now observe that lcm(O(g1), O(g2), O(g3)) = lcm(lcm(O(g1), O(g2)), O(g3)). With this observation, we construct group elements h1, . . . , hk ∈ G such that the orders O(hi) = lcm(O(g1), . . . , O(gi)) by applying Proposition 3.3 to the pairs {hi, gi+1}. Then hk has least universal order, as required. Deﬁnition 4.2. Let R be a ring. An nonzero element a ∈ R is called a zerodi- visor (pl. zerodivisors) if there exists another nonzero element b ∈ R such that ab = 0. A ring with no zerodivisors is an integral domain. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 14 For example, Z/3Z is an integral domain but Z/4Z is not (since 2 2 = 0). In fact, any ﬁeld is an integral domain, because nonzero elements have multiplica- tive inverses. For, if 1 = a−1a and ab = 0, then b = (a −1a)b = a −1(ab) = a −10 = 0. This is the crucial property behind our next statement. Lemma 4.5 (Root Theorem). Let R be an integral domain. A polynomial p(x) ∈ R[x] of degree n has at most n roots, including multiplicity. Proof. Use induction. The case n = 1 is trivial. So let n > 1 and suppose p(x) has a root x0. Then the division algorithm gives p(x) = (x − x0)q(x) + r where q(x) has degree n − 1 and r is constant. Plugging in x = x0 gives r = 0. Now if a is a root of p(x), then (a − x0)q(a) = 0, implying that a = x0 or a is a root of q(x). It follows that p(x) has at most one more root than q(x), as required. We are at last ready to discuss modular arithmetic. Proposition 4.6. (Z/pZ) × is a cyclic group. Proof. Introduce the least universal order m := O(Z/pZ)×, and consider the polynomial p(x) := xm−1. On the one hand, Proposition 4.4 shows that m | p−1; hence, m ≤ p−1. On the other hand, by deﬁnition, all p−1 elements of (Z/pZ)× are roots of p(x). The Root Theorem shows that m ≥ p − 1. Thus, m = p − 1. And it follows that (Z/pZ) × contains an element of order p − 1, which is the generator we sought. One might ask whether the primality condition can be relaxed in the above proposition. In fact, precisely the same proof holds for all ﬁnite ﬁelds, which necessarily have prime power orders [4]. However, the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fpk and the quotient ring Z/pkZ cease being isomorphic for k > 1 (for instance, p becomes a zerodivisor in the ring), so more machinery is needed to assess the usual modular arithmetic. Introducing powers of p leads to consideration of zp − 1; curiously, it is easier to consider compare such a diﬀerence to zero than equate zp with 1 in its own right. Naturally, one has the factorization zp − 1 = (z − 1)(zp−1 + · · · + z + 1), to which we turn. Lemma 4.7. Let p an odd prime. Then for each integer x, the cyclotomic polynomial ϕp(x) = xp−1 + · · · + x + 1 is not divisible by p2. Proof. Suppose for contradiction’s sake that p 2|ϕp(a) for some integer a. Then in modulo p, 0 ≡ (a − 1)(a p−1 + · · · + a + 1) = a p − 1 ≡ a − 1. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 15 Thus, a = 1 + kp for some integer k. But then in modulo p2, 1 + a + · · · + ap−1 = 1 + (1 + kp) + · · · + (1 + kp)p−1 ≡ 1 + (1 + kp) + · · · + (1 + (p − 1)kp) = p(1 + kTp−1), where Tp−1 = 1 + · · · + (p − 1) = (p − 1)p/2. Since p is odd, p divides Tp, so that ϕp(a) ≡ p (mod p2), a contradiction. The following gem is immediate. Lemma 4.8 (Lifting Lemma). Let p be an odd prime. If a and k are nonnegative integers such that p k ∤ a − 1, then p k+1 ∤ a p − 1. Proof. One writes a p − 1 = (a − 1)(a p−1 + · · · + a + 1), and observes that p divides the second factor at most once. Returning, we need a means of comparing diﬀerent moduli. Observe that for all pairs of positive integers m and n there exists a natural ring homomorphism ϕm,n : Z/mnZ → Z/nZ due to the ideal containment mnZ ⊂ nZ. In particular, each coset in Z/nZ is partitioned by additive cosets in Z/mnZ; these partitions comprise the preimages. For example, consider the map ϕ3,2 : Z/6Z → Z/2Z. The preimage of 1 = 1 + 2Z is the collection ϕ−1 3,2(1) = {1 + 6Z, 3 + 6Z, 5 + 6Z}. Because 1 ∈ Z/mnZ 7→ 1 ∈ Zn, it follows that O(Z/nZ) × (a) | O(Z/mnZ) × (a) for all a ∈ (Z/mnZ) × . That is, the multiplicative order of a unit in modulo mn is divisible by the order it assumes in modulo n. As it turns out, (Z/pkZ )× is almost always cyclic. Proposition 4.9. The group (Z/pkZ )× is cyclic if and only if p is odd or k ≤ 2. Proof. Consider the case p = 2. Observe that both (Z/2Z)× and (Z/4Z)× are cyclic while (Z/8Z) × is not; we have 12 ≡ 3 3 ≡ 5 2 ≡ 7 2 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Now take an integer k > 3 and consider the natural homomorphism (Z/2kZ )× → (Z/8Z) × . Because the map is surjective, a generator of (Z/2 kZ )× would map to a generator in (Z/8Z) × , of which there are none. Now assume p > 2 and consider k = 2. Let g ∈ (Z/p2Z )× be such that ϕp,p(g) generates (Z/pZ) × . Then O(Z/pZ) × (g) = p − 1 and we have that p − 1 divides O(Z/p2Z) × (g + mp) for all m. By Lagrange’s Theorem, the orders {O(Z/p2Z) × (g + mp)}m are divisors of | (Z/p2Z )× | = ϕ(p 2) = p(p − 1). Thus, O(Z/p2Z)× (g + mp) ∈ {p − 1, p(p − 1)} for all m. Suppose that g has order p − 1 in (Z/p2Z )× . Then (g + p)p−1 ≡ gp−1 + gp−2p(p − 1) ≡ 1 − pgp−2 (mod p2). 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 16 Because the image of g generates (Z/pZ) × , g is coprime to p, and it follows that the order of g + p is not p − 1. Thus, at least one of g and g + p is a generator of (Z/p 2Z )× . To complete the proof for k > 2, we claim that an integer g that generates (Z/pk−1Z )× also generates (Z/pkZ )× . By the natural homomorphism (Z/pkZ )× → (Z/p k−1Z )× , we have that the order pk−2(p − 1) of g in (Z/pk−1Z )× divides the order of g in (Z/pkZ )× . By Lagrange’s theorem, O(Z/pkZ)×(g) divides p k−1(p − 1). Finally, as p k−1 ∤ gp k−3(p−1) − 1, the lifting lemma gives pk ∤ gpk−2(p−1) − 1. The strategy employed in ﬁnal paragraph of the preceeding proof merits particular attention. We realize a strong and abstract deduction by essentially squeezing an equality case out of an inequality; observe how Lagrange’s theorem acts as an upper bound while the natural homomorphism and lifting lemma provide a lower bound that happens to be sharp in the integer divisibility lattice. All that remains in extending our primitive roots proposition is generaliza- tion from prime powers to arbitrary integers. The techniques to this end are varied and eclectic, and the best motivation comes from practice. We shall use the Chinese Remainder Theorem. However, to understand it and its usage, we require several notions from our earlier encounter with ring theory, which we recall presently. Two ideals I, J ⊂ R are coprime if their sum is the entire over- lying ring, or I + J = R. Ideal products are deﬁned and obey the containment IJ ⊂ I ∩ J. As might be hoped, addition and multiplication of ideals is commu- tative and distributive in a commutative ring. Quotient rings R/I are deﬁned in terms of additive cosets, r + I, having operations (a + I) + (b + I) = (a + b) + I and (a + I)(b + I) = (ab) + I inherited from R. Lastly, the direct product of the rings R1, . . . , Rk is just the ring structure on the cartesian product obtained by allowing the factors to act coordinatewise; more precisely, the elements are k-tuples such as (a1, . . . , ak) and (b1, . . . , bk) where ai, bi ∈ Ri, and the operations are deﬁned as (a1, . . . , ak) + (b1, . . . , bk) = (a1 + b1, . . . , ak + bk), (a1, . . . , ak)(b1, . . . , bk) = (a1b1, . . . , akbk). Note that the additive and multiplicative identities are (0, . . . , 0) and (1, . . . , 1). Intuitively, the behavior of a ring element as it appears in multiple quotient rings should provide information about that element in some combined quotient ring, and vice versa. This is the content of the theorem we are about to prove. Theorem 4.10 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). If R is a ring and I1, I2, . . . , Ik are pairwise coprime ideals, then I1I2 · · · Ik = I1 ∩ I2 ∩ · · · ∩ Ik =: I and the map f : R/I → R/I1 × · · · × R/Ik deﬁned by f (r + I) := (r + I1, . . . , r + Ik) is a ring isomorphism. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 17 Proof. First, we check that I is well deﬁned. Observe that R = ∏ i̸=1 (I1 + Ii) ⊂ I1 + ∏ i̸=1 Ii ⊂ R, implying that I1 + I2I3 · · · In = R. Now if J and K are coprime ideals, J ∩ K = (J ∩ K)(J + K) ⊂ KJ + JK ⊂ JK. But the reverse containment always holds, so J ∩ K = JK. Using J = I1 and K = I2 as a base case together with the inductive step I1 ∩ ( k⋂ i=2 Ii ) = I1 ∩ ( k∏ i=2 Ii ) = k∏ i=1 Ii, we see that I1I2 · · · In = I1 ∩ · · · ∩ In. Hence, I is indeed well-deﬁned. Now consider the ring homomorphism ϕ : R 7→ ∏n i=1 R/Ii deﬁned by r ϕ 7→ (r + I1, r + I2, . . . , r + In). Note that ker(ϕ) = I1∩· · ·∩In = I. To see that ϕ is surjective, we will ﬁnd r ∈ R such that r ∈ 1+I1 and r ∈ ∏ i̸=1 Ii; this is suﬃcient because, for such r, we have ϕ(r) = (1, 0, . . . , 0). But we already saw that 1 ∈ R = I1 + I2 · · · In, so 1 = j + j∗ for some j ∈ I1, j∗ ∈ I2 · · · In and r = 1 − j = j∗ has the properties we sought. Finally, the First Isomorphism Theorem [7] gives the central isomorphism in R/I ∼= R/ ker(ϕ) ∼= im(ϕ) = n∏ i=1 R/Ii, as desired. This abstract formulation has a more elementary corollary, often given the same name, in the integers. Corollary 4.11 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). Let k be a positive integer and suppose that integers m1, . . . , mk are pairwise coprime. Then for each k-tuple (n1, . . . , nk) of integers such that 0 ≤ ni < mi for each i there exists a unique integer n such that 0 ≤ n < m1 · · · mk and for all indices i, ni ≡ n (mod mi). Moreover, this correspondence is bijective. Proof. Observe that if i ̸= j then there exist integers a and b such that ami + bmj = 1. Thus, 1 ∈ miZ + mjZ, implying that miZ + mjZ = Z. Moreover, (miZ)(mjZ) = (mimj)Z. The ideals {miZ}i meet the criteria in the Theorem 3.1 and this in turn gives the ring isomorphism Z/m1 · · · mkZ ∼= Z/m1Z × · · · × Z/mkZ. Identifying each additive coset a + bZ with the unique nonnegative integer less than |b| it contains, we reduce this bijection to the claims. 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 18 There is a subtlety involved in using the Chinese Remainder Theorem to de- scribe (Z/nZ) × . The ring isomorphism Z/m1 · · · mkZ ∼= Z/m1Z × · · · × Z/mkZ respects both additive and multiplicative structures, but what we actually de- sire is a group isomorphism on the respective groups of units. Note that a ring isomorphism ϕ : R → S carries units to units, since ϕ(a)ϕ(a −1) = ϕ(aa −1) = ϕ(1R) = 1S. Thus, dropping the additive property of ϕ and restricting the do- main and image, ring isomorphisms induce isomorphisms between unit groups. Finally, the unit group of a direct product is the direct product of the corre- sponding unit groups, so that (Z/nZ) × ∼= ( k∏ i=1 Z/miZ )× ∼= k∏ i=1 (Z/miZ) × . We are at last ready for this section’s main result. Theorem 4.12 (Primitive Root Theorem). The group (Z/nZ)× is cyclic if and only if n ∈ {2, 4} or n ∈ {pk, 2p k} for some positive integer k and odd prime p. Proof. Write n = ∏m i=1 p ai i and consider a residue class g ∈ (Z/nZ)× . By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, O(Z/nZ) × (g) = lcm(O(Z/pa1 1 Z)×(g), . . . , O(Z/pam m Z)×(g)). If g is a generator in modulo n, then g is a generator in modulo p ai i for each i. Under this hypothesis, the equation above reduces to m∏ i=1 (pi − 1)p ai−1 i = ϕ(n) = O(Z/nZ)× = lcm({O(Z/pai i Z) × (g)}i) = lcm({(pi − 1)p ai−1 i }i), so that the numbers {(pi − 1)p ai−1 i }i are pairwise coprime. Thus, if (Z/nZ) × is cyclic, then n cannot be divisible by both 4 and an odd prime or divisible by two odd primes. Of the remaining candidates, only those of the form 2p k are new. But ϕ(2p k) = ϕ(p k), so that any odd integer generating modulo pk also generates modulo 2p k. Now that we have answered which moduli have generators, we turn to a dual question that merits attention: given an integer, for which moduli is it a generator? Once more, it is natural to study the query for prime moduli. However, progress in this direction has proven very diﬃcult. The following conjecture was made by Emil Artin in 1927 [8]. Conjecture 4.1 (Artin’s Conjecture). Suppose a ̸= −1 is a nonsquare integer. Let P denote the set of primes, and denote by S(a) the set of primes p for which 4 STRUCTURE THEOREMS 19 a generates (Z/pZ)× . Then 1. S(a) has positive density inside the set of primes, in particular |S(a)| = ∞; 2. if a are squarefree, then the density equals the Artin constant CArtin = ∏ p∈P (1 − 1 p(p − 1) ) = 0.3739558136 . . . . Artin’s conjecture has resisted a complete solution for over eighty years. Nonetheless, several notable achievements have been realized. In 1967, Hooley gave conditional proof establishing the conjecture assuming parts of the Gener- alized Riemann Hypothesis [9]. A 1984 paper [10] by Gupta and Murty showed that the conjecture holds for inﬁnitely many a. In 1986, Heath-Brown extended this inﬁnitude of solutions, showing, amazingly, that there are at most two prime numbers a violating the claims [11]. It is not known, however, which value(s), if any, fail. So, while Artin’s conjecture is known to hold for at least one value a ∈ {3, 5, 7}, we still cannot tell which, and in fact, no particular value of a has yet been proven to satisfy the conditions. † Exercises 1. (USAMO 2005) Prove that the system x6 + x3 + x3y + y = 147 157 x3 + x3 + y2 + y + z9 = 157 147 has no solutions in integers x, y, and z. 2.

Determine whether or not there exist arbitrarily long sequences of consecutive positive integers no two of which have the same number of prime divisors. 5 Nullstellensatz The following discussion is heavily inspired by, indeed contains many excerpts from, a paper by Noga Alon [12]. By now, the reader should be capable of following the excellent presentation there and is therefore encouraged to read that literature. The theory in this section generalizes familiar results about zeros of uni- variate polynomials, which we recall presently. Consider a polynomial f having coeﬃcients in an integral domain R. If f can be written as anxn + · · · + a1x + ao and there are n + 1 values x such that f (x) = 0, then f = 0 identically. If r1, . . . , rk are roots of the polynomial then f (x) = h(x)(x − r1) · · · (x − rk) for some polynomial h(x) with coeﬃcients in R. Moreover, the degree of h will be n − k. Finally, if f has degree n, any set of n + 1 values in its coeﬃcient ring contains a non-zero. Lemma 5.1 (Brick Lemma). Fix a polynomial P ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn], where R is an integral domain. Suppose that the degree of P as a polynomial in xi is at most ti for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and let Si ⊂ R be such that |Si| ≥ ti + 1. If P (s1, . . . , sn) = 0 for all tuples (s1, . . . , sn) ∈ S1 × · · · × Sn, then P = 0. The proof of this lemma is left as an exercise. This lemma is simply the natural generalization of the familar univariate result and expresses a property of the zero polynomial. 5 NULLSTELLENSATZ 21 Theorem 5.1 (Ideal Decomposition). Fix a polynomial f ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn], where R is an integral domain. Let S1, . . . , Sn be nonempty subsets of F and deﬁne gi(xi) = ∏ s∈Si(xi − s). If f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for all (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 × · · · × Sn, then there are polynomials h1, . . . , hn ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn] such that deg(hi) ≤ deg(f ) − deg(gi) and f = n∑ i=1 higi. Proof. Write gi(xi) = ∏ s∈Si(xi − s) = xti+1 i − ∑ti j=0 gijxj i ., and note that xti+1 i = ∑ti j=0 gijxj i for all x ∈ Si. Let f be the polynomial that results when each xdi i where di > ti is re- peatedly replaced by xdi−ti−1 i ∑ti j=0 gijxj as much as possible. Note that f is obtained by subtracting products higi from f, where the degree of hi does not exceed deg(f ) − deg(gi). Moreover, f (x1, . . . , xn) = f (x1, . . . , xn) for all (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 × Sn. Hence, f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for all such (x1, . . . , xn). Fi- nally, by the brick lemma, f = 0, completing the proof. I have called this theorem ideal decomposition because the equation for f reads f ∈ (g1, . . . , gn). In fact, in the multivariate case, the formulation is slightly stronger because it includes a nontrivial statement about the degrees involved. The statement about degrees is immediate in the single variable case, where it can clearly be improved to an equation. However, it is key to the power of the multivariate theory. Theorem 5.2 (Inverse Bricks Theorem). Let f ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn], where R is an integral domain. Suppose the coeﬃcient of xt1 1 · · · xtn n is nonzero, where∑n i=1 ti = deg(f ). Then if S1, . . . , Sn are subsets of R with |Si| > ti, there exists a point (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 × · · · × Sn such that f (x1, . . . , xn) ̸= 0. Proof. Assume that |Si| = ti + 1 for all i. Suppose the result is false, and deﬁne gi(xi) = ∏ s∈Si(xi − s). By the ideal decomposition theorem, there are polynomials hi ∈ F [x1, . . . , xn] satisfying deg(hj) ≤ ∑n i=1 ti − deg(gj) such that f = n∑ i=1 higi. The coeﬃcient of xt1 1 · · · xtn n on the left is nonzero. However, the degree of higi = hi ∏s∈Si(xi − s) is at most deg(f ), and so any monomials of degree deg(f ) in it are divisible by xti+1 i . Because the monomial xt1 1 · · · xtn n violates this property for every i, its coeﬃcient on the right is 0, the desired contradiction. Following a trend in the previous two results, the subsets of Rn involved in this generalization again take the form of a direct products. A distinction that 5 NULLSTELLENSATZ 22 may be surprising is that direct products guaranteed to containing a non-zero are numerous. However, this multiplicity may be motivated by consideration of the explosion of potential maximal degree terms due to the deﬁnition of the degree of a multivariate polynomial. It turns out that these multivariate generalizations are highly versatile in ways that are not anticipated by the single variable case. Developing a sense of this behavior is the goal of the exercises, to which we now turn. 5.1 Exercises The theory described above, referred to as combinatorial Nullstellensatz,1 pro- vides a powerful tool for combinatorics and combinatorial number theory prob- lems, as the following exercises will show. In fact, Alon proves these results and many more, so the interested reader is again referred his paper. 1. Prove the brick lemma. 2.

Show that if the coeﬃcient of xc0 0 · · · xck k in (x0 + x1 + · · · + xk)mh(x0, . . . , xk) is nonzero as an element of Z/pZ, then \f \f \f \f \f⊕h k∑ i=0 Ai \f \f \f \f \f ≥ m + 1. 6. (Alon Proposition 4.7) If p is prime and A and B are nonempty subsets of Z/pZ, then |{a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B, ab ̸= 1}| ≥ min{p, |A| + |B| − 3}. 7. (Alon Theorem 6.1) Let p be a prime and let G = (V, E) be a loopless 2 graph with average degree bigger than 2p − 2 and maximum degree at most 2p − 1. Show that G contains a p-regular 3 subgraph. 8. (Alon Theorem 6.2) Let p be a prime and G = (V, E) a graph with |V | > d(p − 1) vertices where d is a positive integer. Show that there exists a nonempty subset U ⊂ V of vertices such that the number of d-cliques that U intersects is 0 modulo p. 9. (IMO 2007/6) Let n be a positive integer. Consider S = {(x, y, z)|x, y, z ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, x + y + z > 0} as a set of (n + 1)3 − 1 points in three-dimensional space. Determine the smallest possible number of planes, the union of which contains S but does not include (0, 0, 0). 2A loop is an edge from a vertex to itself. 3A regular graph is one in which all vertices have the same degree, p in this case.
