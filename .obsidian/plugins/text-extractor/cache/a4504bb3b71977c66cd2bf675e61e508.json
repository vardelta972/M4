A Problem Walkthrough We will go through in detail the following problem that appeared on your mock olympiad. Problem 1: (IMO 2009 Shortlist) Find all functions f : R → R such that f (xf (x + y)) = f (yf (x)) + x2, for all x, y ∈ R. Functional Equation Strategies: 1. (Find Solutions:) Find a class of solutions by inspection, i.e. f (x) = c, a constant, f (x) = ax + b for some a, b ∈ R, f (x) = x2, ax, etc. If the functional equation contains trignometric terms, you can consider terms of the form f (x) = a sin x + b cos x, etc. Your class of solutions often dictates your strategies. At this point forward, make sure that you follow the following rule: Make sure everything you do from this point onwards is consistent with these equations. 2. (Basic Substitutions:) Apply good substitutions, often to either cancel things out or make terms equal to zero. (a) In this exercise, substituting x = 0, y = 0 or both are good starts. (b) You can consider whether you can make xf (x + y) = yf (x), so that you can cancel the terms f (xf (x + y)) = f (yf (x)). It turns out that in this case you cannot do so easily. However, you should still consider doing it. 3. Try to ﬁnd f (k) for some ﬁxed k, usually k = 0 or k = ±1. In our case, try to prove that f (0) = 0. 4. Is f an odd or even function? i.e. f (x) = f (−x), ∀x ∈ R? f (x) = −f (−x), ∀x ∈ R ? 5. Is f injective or surjective? If so, can you prove it? We will show how powerful it is to know that f is injective, or surjective, or both. 6. Is f strictly (or monotone) increasing (or decreasing)? 7. Fixed Points: Is there some thing special about ﬁxed points of f ? i.e. all w ∈ R such that f (w) = w. See Section 2. 1 2010 IMO Summer Training: Functional Equations 8. Something more advanced; if z1, z2 ∈ Range(f ), can every x ∈ R be written in the form x = z1 − z2? Or something similar? Then if you are trying to prove, say, f (x) = x2, ∀x ∈ R, then you can try to prove f (z1 − z2) = (z1 − z2)2, ∀z1, z2 ∈ Range(f ).1 See Section 3. 9. Is the function f periodic? i.e. is there a positive d such that f (x + d) = f (x) for some or all values of x? 10. Can you reduce the problem to a Cauchy equation? i.e. f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y), ∀x, y ∈ R? We know that if f satisﬁes any of the following conditions, then f (x) = cx for some constant c. (a) f is deﬁned over the rationals (b) f is bounded on any closed interval of R, i.e. [a, b] = {x|a ≤ x ≤ b}, where a, b ∈ R, a < b. (c) f is monotone increasing, i.e. f (x) ≤ f (y) whenever x ≤ y or monotone decreasing, i.e. f (x) ≥ f (y) whenever x ≤ y. 11. At the end, remember to check that your solutions work in your solution write-up! These are the main things you should look for. It is impossible to lay out every method possible to solve a functional equation. A lot of it does come down to a jigsaw puzzle approach, i.e. piecing together results to obtain bigger results. For this reason, it is important that you highlight your main observations clearly, i.e. not an obscure line in a 42-line paragraph in small hand-writing. Let’s return to our problem. We inspect that f (x) = x and f (x) = −x, ∀x ∈ R are solutions of the functional equations. There are possibly other solutions. But these are the ones you have found for now, so you will assume that these are the only solutions until shown otherwise. Substituting x = 0 into the original equation yields f (0) = f (yf (0)), ∀y ∈ R. Suppose f (0) ̸= 0. Then yf (0) ranges over all reals as y varies over all reals. (Remember this technique!) Hence, f (0) = f (z) for all z ∈ R. Consequently, f is a constant. It is easy to verify that f is not a constant. Therefore, f (0) = 0. Suppose f (z) = 0. We will prove that z = 0. Substituting x = z, y = −z into the original equation yields f (zf (0)) = f (−zf (z)) + z2 = z2. Since f (0) = f (z) = 0, 0 = 0 + z2. Therefore, z = 0. We have f (z) = 0 ⇔ z = 0, ∀z ∈ R (1) Now that we know (1), it is good idea to make a lot of things zero in the functional equation to see what happens. Some things turn out to be useful, and some may not. 1Of course, z1 − z2 is only an example. The term in equation can be some other combination of z1, z2. We will see an example where this is a very powerful technique. 2 2010 IMO Summer Training: Functional Equations Since f (0) = 0, substituting y = 0 into the original equation yields f (xf (x)) = x2, ∀x ∈ R (2) Substituting y = −x yields f (−xf (x)) = −x2, ∀x ∈ R (3) Not only have we established two interesting identities, we just showed that f is surjective. (Do you see how?) Always be on the lookout for terms written in the form f (·) = an expression not dependent on the function f . If the right hand side ranges over all reals, then f is surjective. (Even showing that f ranges over non-negative reals is a nice result.) We now prove that f is injective. Suppose f (z) = f (z + r) for some z, r ∈ R. Substituting x = z, y = r into the original equation yields f (zf (z + r)) = f (rf (z)) + z2. Since f (z) = f (z + r), f (zf (z)) = f (rf (z)) + z2. By (2), f (zf (z)) = z2. Therefore, f (rf (z)) = 0. By (1), rf (z) = 0. Therefore, f (z) = 0 or r = 0. If f (z) = 0, then z = 0, Hence, f (0) = f (0 + r). By (1), r = 0. Hence, in either case, r = 0. Therefore, f is injective. Now, we abuse the surjectivity property. Can we make the right-hand side of the original equation zero. We ﬁx x = z ̸= 0. Then f (z) ̸= 0. Therefore, yf (z) ranges over all reals. Since f is surjective, f (yf (z)) ranges over all reals. Remember we want to make things zero? Choose y such that f (yf (z)) = −z2. Then f (z(z + y)) = 0. Since z ̸= 0, y = −z. Then f (−zf (z)) = −z2. By (3), we already know this. Well, that yielded nothing new. Let’s try x = −z ̸= 0 instead. Then f (−z(−z + y)) = f (yf (−z)) + z2. Again, there exist y such that f (yf (−z)) = −z2. Then f (−z(−z + y)) = 0. Since z ̸= 0, y = z. Then f (zf (−z)) = −z2. But f (−zf (z)) = −z2 as well. Time to abuse injectivity. We then have zf (−z) = −zf (z). Since z ̸= 0, f (−z) = −f (z). If z = 0, then clearly f (−z) = −f (z). This is an important result! Write it down! f (−x) = −f (x), ∀x ∈ R. (4) Given this fact. Substituting x, y = ±1 is a great idea. Since f is surjective, another alternative is to let z ∈ R such that f (z) = 1. You should try all of these things. It turns out that it is the latter that gives us more information. Since f is surjective, there exist z ∈ R such that f (z) = 1. Then substituting x = z into (2) yields f (z) = z2. Since f (z) = 1, z = ±1. Therefore, by (4) (f (1), f (−1)) = (1, −1) or (f (−1), f (1)) = (−1, 1). If f (1) = 1 and f (−1) = −1, then substituting x = 1 yields f (f (y + 1)) = f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R (5) and substituting x = −1 yields f (−f (y − 1)) = f (−y) + 1, or by Lemma 3, 3 2010 IMO Summer Training: Functional Equations −f (f (y − 1)) = −f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. (6) Therefore, −f (f (y + 1)) = −f (y + 2) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. Adding this equation with (5) yields 0 = f (y) − f (y + 2) + 2. Hence, f (y + 2) − f (y) = 2. Similarly, f (y + 4) − f (y + 2) = 2. Therefore, f (y + 4) − f (y) = 4, ∀y ∈ R. (7) Now why did I do this? First of all, I would have preferred to have proven f (y + 1) − f (y) = 1, ∀y ∈ R. Then I can use (5) to yield f (f (y + 1)) = f (y + 1). Since f is injective, f (y + 1) = y + 1. We then conclude that f (x) = x for all x ∈ R. Awesome. But instead I have f (y + 2) − f (y) = 2. I want to substitute x = 2 to make the 4 appear in the original equation. Hence, I created (6). I suppose I could instead substitue x = √2, but that would be too irrational. Substituting x = 2 into the original equation ﬁelds f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2)) + 4. By (7), we have f (yf (2) + 4) = f (yf (2)) + 4. Therefore, f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2) + 4). Since f is injective, 2f (y + 2) = yf (2) + 4. Hence, f (y) = f (2) 2 (y − 2) + 2. Let c = f (2) 2 . Then f (y) = cy + (2 − 2c). Since y = 0 and f (0) = 0, c = 1. Then f (y) = y, ∀y ∈ R. This is a solution to the functional equation since f (xf (x + y)) = x(x + y) and f (y(f (x))) + x2 = xy + x2 = x(x + y). If f (1) = −1 and f (−1) = 1, then I leave to the reader to ﬁnish the problem similarly to the previous case. 2. Fixed Points Given a function f , a ﬁxed point of f is deﬁned to be w ∈ R such that f (w) = w. It is often good to observe ﬁxed points of a function. Problem 2: (IMO 1993) Determine all functions f : R+ → R+ such that f (xf (y)) = yf (x) for all x, y ∈ R+ and as x → ∞, f (x) → 0. Solution: Let’s inspect some functions ﬁrst. So f (x) approaches 0 as x gets large. So forget f (x) = x or constants. It’s probably something like f (x) = 1 x . Well, it works. So let’s keep this in mind. Maybe this function is injective. Suppose f (z1) = f (z2). Substitute x = 1. Then z1f (x) = f (xf (z1)) = f (xf (z2)) = z2f (x). Since f (x) ̸= 0 for any x, z1 = z2. Hence, f is injective. So far so good. Let’s ﬁnd xf (y) = x to try to clear the terms f (xf (y)) = f (x). Let x = y = 1. Then f (f (1)) = f (1). Since f is injective, f (1) = 1. So 1 is a ﬁxed point. 4 2010 IMO Summer Training: Functional Equations So maybe I can substitute y = 1. I get f (x) = f (x). Well, thanks for nothing. Maybe I should try x = 1 instead. Then f (f (y)) = yf (1) = y. This sounds good. I should write this down. f (f (y)) = y, ∀y ∈ R.2 (8) Substituting x = y yields f (xf (x)) = xf (x). Therefore, xf (x) is a ﬁxed point for all x ∈ R. The funny thing is, since f (x) → 0 as x → ∞. Hence, the set of ﬁxed points of f is bounded above. I’m also trying to ”prove” that f (x) = 1 x , i.e. 1 is the only ﬁxed point. Let w be a ﬁxed point of f . Suppose w > 1 is a ﬁxed point of f , i.e. f (w) = w. Then substituting x = y = w into the original equation yields f (w2) = w2. Therefore, w2 is also a ﬁxed point. Inductively, w2n is a ﬁxed point for any n ∈ N. Since w > 1, w2n → ∞. But the set of ﬁxed points of f is bounded. Hence, w ≤ 1. If w < 1, then substituting x = 1 w and y = w yields f (1) = wf ( 1 w . Therefore, f (1/w) = 1/w. Hence, 1/w > 1 is a ﬁxed point. This is again a contradiction. Therefore, 1 is the only ﬁxed point of f . Hence, since xf (x) is a ﬁxed point for all x ∈ R, xf (x) = 1 for all x ∈ R. Therefore, f (x) = 1/x. This is indeed a solution to the equation since f (xf (y)) = f (x/y) = y/x and yf (x) = y/x. □ 3. An Advanced Technique Consider the following problem. Problem 3: (IMO 1999) Find all functions f : R → R such that f (x − f (y)) = f (f (y)) + xf (y) + f (x) − 1 for all x, y ∈ R. Solution: It appear diﬃcult to ﬁnd a solution to this functional equation. Maybe we should move on and try to ﬁnd some properties of f ﬁrst, before conjecturing what f is. Let’s set x = y = 0. Then f (−f (y)) = f (f (y)) + f (0) − 1. Then substituting x = f (y) yields f (0) = f (f (y)) + f (y)2 + f (f (y)) − 1. Hence, z2 + 2f (z) = f (0) for all z ∈ Range(f ), by substituting z = f (y). This would be awesome if Range(f ) = R. Because then f (z) = f (0) − z2 2 for all z ∈ R. But we do have this statement for all z ∈ Range(f ). Note that f (z) − f (0) = − z2 2 , which can be any non-positive number and f (0) − f (z) = z2 2 , which can be any non-negative number. Therefore, {z1 − z2|z1, z2 ∈ Range(f )} = R. Hence, it suﬃces to show that f (z1 − z2) = f (0) − (z1 − z2)2 2 , 2We of course conclude that f is surjective on the positive reals. You should certainly note that. But it turns out that this is not necessary for this proof. 5 2010 IMO Summer Training: Functional Equations for all z1, z2 ∈ Range(f ). Then substituting x = z1, f (y) = z2 (yes we can do this! :D) yields f (z1−z2) = f (z2)+z1z2+f (z1)−1 = 2f (0)− z2 1 + z2 2 2 +z1z2−1 = (2f (0)−1)− (z1 − z2)2 2 = c− (z1 − z2)2 , for some constant c. Now substitute this back into the original equation to obtain c = 1. □ Exercises: 1. Consider the functions f : N → N such that f (m + n) ≥ f (m) + f (f (n)) − 1 for all m, n ∈ N.
