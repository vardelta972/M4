{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/Number Theory/Number Theory 2/Ideals.pdf","text":"11 Ideals The presentation here is somewhat diﬀerent than the text. In particular, the sections do not match up. We have seen issues with the failure of unique factorization already, e.g., Z[ √−5] = OQ( √−5) does not have unique factorization. For instance 6 = 2 · 3 = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5) and one can check 2, 3, 1 ± √−5 are all irreducible. This cannot be resolved like we resolved factorization in Z[√ −3], namely by adding more integers in the quotient ﬁeld1 Q( √−3), simply because Z[ √−5] is already the entire ring of integers of the quotient ﬁeld Q( √−5). As remarked at the end of the last chapter, one could try passing to the ring of integers OK of a larger ﬁeld K, but this introduces new complications: How do you ﬁnd the right K, and then OK (determining OK is harder for non-quadratic ﬁelds)? How do you know OK has unique factorization? In fact, there are examples (albeit complicated) where one cannot always ﬁnd such an extension K. Kummer developed a theory of “ideal numbers” to add to rings to recover unique factorization, which was revolutionized by Dedekind’s theory of ideals. Kummer used this to recover unique factorization in the cyclotomic rings Z[ζp] for regular primes p, and proved Fermat’s Last Theorem for regular prime exponents (I won’t deﬁne regular yet, but as an example all odd primes ≤ 100 except for 37, 59, 67 are regular). This chapter we will introduce the notions developed by Dedekind. 11.1 Revisiting Z In mathematics, when one encounters diﬃculties, it is often a good idea to take a step back and try to look at things from a diﬀerent point of view. Let’s now take another look at divisibility in Z. Deﬁnition 11.1. Let n ∈ Z. The (principal) ideal (of Z) generated by n is (n) = nZ. In other words, (n) is the set of multiples of Z. Example. (0) = {0}. (1) = (−1) = Z. (2) = (−2) = 2Z is the set of even integers. Just like with rings and ﬁelds, we could take an axiomatic approach to ideals. Deﬁnition 11.2. Let R be a ring and I ⊆ R (I ̸= ∅). Suppose (i) a, b ∈ I =⇒ a + b ∈ I, and (ii) a ∈ I, b ∈ R =⇒ ra ∈ I. Then we say I is an ideal of R. It is easy to see properties (i) and (ii) hold for the principal ideals (n) of Z, so they satisfy the general deﬁnition of ideals. Example. For any ring R, the zero ideal {0} is an ideal of R. R is also an ideal of R. These are trivial cases and we will often want to avoid them. We say an ideal I is a proper ideal of R if I ̸= R, and we say I is a nonzero ideal of R if it is not the zero ideal. Exercise 11.1. Check (i) and (ii) hold for the principal ideal (2). 1The quotient ﬁeld of a nonzero subring R or C is the smallest subﬁeld of C containing R. It is the set of all quotients a b where a, b ∈ R, b ̸= 0, hence the name. 78 Proposition 11.3. Every ideal I of Z is of the form (n) for some n ∈ Z. Proof. Since {0} = (0) and Z = (1), we may assume Z is a non-zero proper ideal. Note if a ∈ I then −a ∈ I by Property (ii), so the non-zero elements of I occur in pairs a, −a. Let n be the smallest non-zero element of I. We claim I = (n). First note I ⊇ (n) by Property (ii). Suppose I ̸= (n), i.e., suppose there is some m ∈ I such that m ̸∈ (n). Write m = qn + r where 0 < r < n. Since m, −qn ∈ I, r = m − qn ∈ I, but this contradicts the deﬁnition of n being minimal, i.e., I = (n). Corollary 11.4. The ideals of Z are in 1-to-1 correspondence with N ∪ 0, given by (n) ↔ n. In general, the ideals of a ring are not just the multiples of elements in the ring, but more complicated. However, we’ll worry about that later. For now let’s just keep Z in mind, and see what ideal theory says in this context. First we deﬁne arithmetic operations on ideals. Deﬁnition 11.5. Let I, J be ideals of a ring R. Their sum is the ideal I + J = {i + j : i ∈ I, j ∈ J } and their product is the ideal IJ = {iij1 + i2j2 + ikjk : im ∈ I, jn ∈ J } . Note that the deﬁnition of IJ may seem a little complicated: naively we would like IJ = {ij : i ∈ I, j ∈ J } but in general this set will not be closed under addition, so we need to consider ﬁnite sums of products ij. However for ideals in Z, the situation is simpler, as we will see below. Exercise 11.2. Check that I + J and IJ indeed deﬁne ideals. Example. Let R = Z. Then (2) + (4) = {2m + 4n} = {2k} = (2) and (2) + (3) = {2m + 3n} = (1) = Z since 1 = gcd(2, 3) = 2m+3n for some m, n by Section 2.3. (Or precisely 1 = 2·2+(−1)3.) Example. Let R = Z. Then (2)(4) = {2m1 · 4n1 + · · · + 2mk · 4nk} = {8k} = (8) and (2)(3) = {2m1 · 3n1 + · · · + 2mk · 3nk} = {6k} = (6). Exercise 11.3. Let m, n ∈ Z. Show (m) + (n) = (gcd(m, n)) and (m)(n) = (mn). (Cf. Exercise 11.1.1.) Deﬁnition 11.6. Let I, J be ideals in a ring R. We say I divides J , and write I|J if I ⊇ J . This notion is crucial, so say it to yourself 3 times: contains means divides, contains means divides, contains means divides. Example. (2)|(4) since every multiple of 4 is a multiple of 2. Exercise 11.4. Let m, n ∈ Z. Show (m)|(n) ⇐⇒ m|n. Deﬁnition 11.7. Let p be a proper ideal of a ring R. We say p is a prime ideal of R if p|IJ implies p|I or p|J , where I, J are ideals of R. 79 By the previous exercise, it is clear the prime ideals of Z are p = (p) where p is a prime in N. Hence we may state unique factorization in Z in terms of ideals: Let I be a nonzero proper ideal of Z. Then I = p1p2 · · · pk where each pi is a prime ideal. Moreover the pi’s are uniquely determined (up to reordering). We can translate this back into the usual statement as follows—we know I = (n) for some n ∈ N, n ̸= 1. Then there is a unique factorization (up to ordering) n = ∏ pi where each pi ∈ N is prime. This corresponds to the prime ideal factorization (n) = p1p2 · · · pk = (p1)(p2) · · · (pk). Note that working with ideals already makes the statement of unique factorization in Z a little simpler than just working with integers, because one does not need to worry about units. However the main advantage of working with ideals is this: for any nice ring2, we always have unique prime factorization of ideals! The rest of the semester will be devoted to understanding this, and then seeing how one can apply it, for example, to determining which primes p are of the form x2 + 5y2. 11.2 Revisiting Z[ √−3] While in Z, the ideals correspond to elements of Z up to units, in general for a ring R, some ideals will correspond to elements of R and some will correspond to the “ideal elements” which are required for unique factorization. The ideals corresponding to actual elements of R have a special name. Deﬁnition 11.8. Let R be a ring and α1, . . . , αk ∈ R. The ideal generated by α1, . . . , αk is deﬁned to be the smallest ideal containing α1, . . . , αk and denoted (α1, . . . , αk). Explicitly, this ideal is (α1, . . . , αk) = {c1α1 + c2α2 + · · · + ckαkci ∈ R} . If the ideal I of R is generated by a single element, i.e., I = (α) = αR = {rα : r ∈ R} for some α ∈ R, we say I is a principal ideal. Note, it is clear from the deﬁnition that (α1, . . . , αk) = (α1) + (α2) + · · · + (αk). The key point will be that the principal ideals (α) corresponds to the element α (and its associates), and the non-principal ideals will correspond to “ideal” elements of R. Speciﬁcally (α1, . . . , αk) is the smallest ideal which contains each (αj), in other words (α1, . . . , αk) is the small- est ideal which divides each (αj) (this was our deﬁnition of dividing for ideals), so (α1, . . . , αk) should be the “ideal gcd” of (α1), . . . , (αk). This is a rather revolutionary idea, so let’s go through it with the example of Z[ √−3]. Let R = Z[ √−3]. The principal ideals of R are (α) = αR = {rα : r ∈ R}, where α ranges over the elements of R. Note that (α) ̸= (β) unless α and β are associates. To see this, suppose (α) = (β). This means β = rα and α = sβ for some r, s ∈ R. But then α = sβ = rsα implies rs = 1, i.e., r and s are units, i.e., α and β are associates. Conversely, if α = uβ for some unit u ∈ R, then we also have β = u−1α, i.e., α and β are multiples of each other, so (α) = (β). Note that this argument applies to any R, so for the record we will record the general statement here. For α ∈ R, we deﬁne the associate class of α to be the set {uα : u is a unit of R}. 2Technically, the conditions on the ring are being what is called a Dedekind domain. The primary examples of Dedekind domains, and what we will care about, are the rings of integers OK of number ﬁelds K. 80 Proposition 11.9. Let R be a subring of C. The principal ideals (α) of R are in 1-1 correspondence with the set of associate classes of R. Now the issue with unique factorization in Z[ √−3] was the following: 4 = 2 · 2 = (1 + √−3) · (1 − √−3) but 2, 1 + √−3 and 1 − √−3 are all irreducible in Z[ √−3]. In the language of ideals, we can write this as (4) = (2)(2) = (1 + √ −3)(1 − √−3). (Note in the former equation (1 + √−3) is just the number 1 + √−3 in parentheses, but in the latter equation it means the ideal generated by 1 + √−3. Hopefully there will be no confusion about this notation, as the meaning should be clear from context.) The resolution of this non- unique factorization using ideals is the following: the ideals (2), (1 + √−3) and (1 − √−3) are not irreducible! Indeed, (2) and (1 + √−3) have a “common factor” (2, 1 + √−3) = (2) + (1 + √−3) = { 2m + (1 + √ −3)n : m, n ∈ R} . In fact, since 2√−3 = 2(−1)+(1+√−3)2 and (1+√ −3) √−3) = −3+√−3 = 2(−2)+(1+√−3)·1 are both of the form 2m + (1 + √−3)n for m, n ∈ Z, we have (2, 1 + √−3) = {2m + (1 + √−3)n : m, n ∈ Z } . (You can just check this set is closed under addition and multiplication by elements in R.) Now this ideal contains both (2) and (1 + √−3), so it divides them. It is easy to see 1 ̸∈ (2, 1 + √−3), hence (2, 1 + √−3) ̸= (1) = R; in other words, (2, 1 + √−3) is a nontrivial divisor of R. Note the non-proper ideal R of R, always divides (contains) every ideal trivially, just like the number 1 divides any integer—in fact R is the principal ideal generated by 1, so in the corre- spondence described above, it is the principal ideal corresponding to 1 and its associates, i.e., the principal ideal corresponding to the units. Thus any proper ideal which divides another ideal may be thought of as a nontrivial divisor. Exercise 11.5. Check that the ideal (2, 1 + √−3) in Z[ √−3] is not principal. (Use contradiction.) Hence (2, 1 + √−3) corresponds to some “ideal number” in Z[ √−3], which should basically be the element ζ3 that is not in the ring. In fact, if we pass to the ring Z[ζ3], we see that the ideal (2, 1 + √−3) = (ζ3) = (1) = Z[ζ3] is principal. Indeed, all ideals of Z[ζ3] are principal, just like for Z, because we have unique factorization. We will go over this formally later. Actually, this example is of Z[ √−3] does not illustrate the power of ideals because it is not a Dedekind domain. (A Dedekind domain must be integrally closed, meaning it should contain all the integers in its quotient ﬁeld.) If it were a Dedekind domain, we would have unique factorization into prime ideals, e.g., there would be prime ideals p, q in Z[ √−3] such that (2) = pq, (1 + √ −3) = p2 and (1 − √−3) = q2. This would resolve the factorization (4) = (2)(2) = (pq)(pq) = p 2q2 = (1 + √−3)(1 − √−3), however there is only one prime ideal dividing (2), namely (2, 1 + √−3) = (2, 1 − √−3). Hence, to really make use of ideals, we need to pass to the integral closure Z[ζ3] of Z[√−3] which already has unique factorization, so one does not really gain anything by using ideals. While, this example does not illustrate the full power of ideals, there is some interesting geometry going on. See the pictures in Section 11.4 of Stillwell. To see the full power of ideals, we will need to move to another ﬁeld F where the full ring of integers OF does not have unique factorization. 81 11.3 A visit to Z[√ −5] Since Z[ √−5] is already the full ring of integers of its quotient ﬁeld Q(√−5), it is not clear what elements we might adjoin to recover unique factorization. The standard example of non-unique factorization in this ring is 6 = 2 · 3 = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5). Since 2, 3, 1 + √−5 and 1 − √−5 are all irreducible in this ring, this is a counter-example to unique factorization into irreducibles/primes. Let’s see how we can resolve this with ideal theory. We set p = (2, 1 + √−5) = (2) + (1 + √ −5) = { 2m + (1 + √−5)n : m, n ∈ Z } q = (3, 1 + √ −5) = (3) + (1 + √−5) = { 3m + (1 + √−5)n : m, n ∈ Z } and q = (3, 1 − √−5) = (3) + (1 − √−5) = { 3m + (1 − √−5)n : m, n ∈ Z } . (Note that p = p = (2, 1 − √−5) since 1 − √−5 = 2 − (1 + √−5) ∈ p.) It is not diﬃcult to check p 2 = (2), qq = (3) and pq = (1 + √−5), pq = (1 − √−5). Further p, q, q are all “irreducible” (prime). We will go through the details later, but the point is that this will resolve the above non-unique factorization—for at the level of ideals we have (6) = (2)(3) = p 2qq = (pq)(pq) = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5). To help us understand all the details, we will ﬁrst develop some more theory. If you want to see some of the details, look at 11.8 of the text. 11.4 PID’s ’n ED’s First we characterize what it means to have unique factorization in a ring in terms of its ideals. With the philosophy that (i) any ideal has a unique factorization into prime ideals (which we will prove later), and (ii) the elements of R correspond to the principal ideals of R, it makes sense to guess that R has unique factorization if and only if every ideal is principal. Here we will show one direction, and return to the other direction later. Deﬁnition 11.10. Let R be a non-zero subring of C. We say R is a principal ideal domain (PID)3 if every ideal of R is principal. Example. Z is a PID. We already proved this. 3In general, PID’s and ED’s need not be subrings of C—I just make this assumption for simplicity since it is the only case we will be interested in. Technically they must be certain kinds of rings called domains, which have the property that if ab = 0 then a = 0 or b = 0. This is not true for Z/nZ if n is not prime, e.g., 2 · 2 ≡ 0 in Z/4Z. 82 Proposition 11.11. Let R be a PID. Then R satisﬁes the prime divisor property, i.e., any non-unit irreducible π ∈ R is prime. Consquently, R has unique factorization, i.e., if α is any nonzero non- unit in R, then it can be written uniquely (up to reordering and units) in the form α = π1π2 · · · πk where πi are primes of R. Proof. The second statement follows formally from the ﬁrst (I have said many times now that the prime divisor property and unique factorization are equivalent—if you want to review the argument, look back at the cases of Z or Z[i]). Thus it suﬃces to show any non-unit irreducible π ∈ R is prime. Let π be a non-unit irreducible. Recall π is prime means π|αβ =⇒ π|α or π|β. So suppose π|αβ for some α, β ∈ R. The idea is to look at the “gcd” (π, α) = (π) + (α) of π and α. Note that (π, α) = (γ) for some γ ∈ R since R is a PID. We know (γ) = (π, α)|(π) and (γ) = (π, α)|(α) by the deﬁnition of divides for ideals. This means, π = mγ and α = nγ for some m, n ∈ R. Since π is irreducible, either m or γ is a unit and the other is an associate of π. If γ is an associate of π, this means π|α = nγ, so the prime divisor property holds. Thus we may assume γ is a unit. This means 1 ∈ (γ) = (π, α), i.e., 1 = rπ + sα for some r, s ∈ R. Thus β = rπβ + sαβ, but π divides both terms on the right, so therefore π|β. Hence the prime divisor property holds. Note this argument is similar to the argument we gave in Z (or Z[i]) to show that the Euclidean algorithm (or more precisely that gcd(a, b) = ma + nb for some m, n) implies the prime divisor property. Here one idea we used is that if (α)|(β) at the level of principal ideals, then α|β as elements of R. This justiﬁes the terminology that I|J means I ⊇ J . Exercise 11.6. Let R be a ring and α, β ∈ R. Show (α)|(β) (principal ideals) implies α|β (ele- ments). (We already had this exercise for R = Z.) Now that we know PID’s have unique factorization, how can we tell if a ring is a PID? Well, since the Euclidean algorithm implies unique factorization, one might guess that it implies being a PID. Deﬁnition 11.12. Let R be a non-zero subring of C. We say R is a Euclidean domain if there is a map (called the absolute value) | · | : R → Z≥0 such that (i) |a| = 0 ⇐⇒ a = 0, (ii) |1| = 1,and (iii) for any a, b ∈ R, b ̸= 0, there exist q, r ∈ R such that a = qb + r such that |r| < |b|. Exercise 11.7. Suppose R is a Euclidean domain with absolute value | · |. Let a ∈ R such that |a| = 1. Show (a) = R. Proposition 11.13. If R is a Euclidean domain, it is a PID. Proof. This is like the proof that Z is a PID. Suppose I is a non-principal ideal R. It is clear that I must be a non-zero proper ideal. Choose b ∈ I such that |b| > 0 is minimal. By the previous exercise, |b| > 1. Every multiple of b ∈ I since I is an ideal, so if I ̸= (b) there is some a ∈ I such that a is not a multiple of b. Then we can write a = qb + r where 0 < |r| < |b|. But r = a − qb ∈ I, contradicting the minimality of |b|. Example. We showed earlier that Z[i], Z[ √−2] and Z[ζ3] are Euclidian domains, and therefore a PIDs. This completes the proof that each of these rings have unique factorization. In fact the only values of d < 0 squarefree such that OQ( √d) are Euclidean domains are d = −1, −2, −3, −7, −11. However, there are 4 more values of d < 0 such that OQ( √d) is a PID, and 83 therefore has unique factorization: d = −19, −43, −67 and −163. This was conjectured by Gauss (in a diﬀerent language, from a diﬀerent context), and is called the Gauss class number problem, which was ﬁnally resolved by Heegner, Baker and Stark in the 1950’s and 1960’s. For more on the cases d = −7, −11, see Section 11.3 and the exercises in the text. The case of d > 0 squarefree is very diﬀerent. There are still only ﬁnitely many d such that OQ( √d) is a Euclidean domain: d = 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 57, 73. But it is not known for which d > 0 OQ(√d) is a PID, or even if this number is ﬁnite or inﬁnite. Nevertheless, it is conjectured that OQ( √d) is a PID, i.e., has unique factorization, about 75% of the time. When one considers number ﬁelds of higher degree, less is known. In particular, it is not known for which number ﬁelds K is OK a Euclidean domain. In any case, we are interested in unique factorization, and not so much in whether a ring has a Euclidean algorithm or not. The known examples show that the existence of a Euclidean algorithm is not necessary for unique factorization. However, we will see later that if OK is not a PID, it does not have unique factorization. This characterization of unique factorization in terms of ideals further suggest that ideals are the right thing to look at. By the way, if you like TLA’s (three letter acronyms), one often calls domains with unique factorization UFD’s. If you’ve seen these in algebra, you might be confused by something I’ve just said. In algebra one typically shows every PID is a UFD, but not the converse. Indeed, the converse is not true for general rings, but it is in the case of rings of integers of number ﬁelds. 11.5 Maximal ideals Our goal is to show the following: Let K be a number ﬁeld.4 Then any nonzero proper ideal of OK factors uniquely into prime ideals of OK. After we show this, we will see how we can use this to surmount diﬃculties arising from non-unique factorization of elements in OK. Before we can show unique factorization into prime ideals, we should ﬁrst show the existence of factorization into prime ideals, which requires knowing the following: If I is an nonzero proper ideal of OK, then there is a prime ideal p of OK dividing (containing) I. If we think about elements in a ring, it’s not always true that a prime factorization exists. For instance, in Z[√−5] we have the non-unique factorization 6 = 2 · 2 = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5), where 2, 1 + √ −5 and 1 − √−5 are all irreducible non-units, but none of them are prime (i.e., satisfy the prime divisor property). However, it is easy to show that any element of OK factors into a ﬁnite number of irreducibles (this is like the proof of existence of prime factorization in Z, where there is no diﬀerence between primes and irreducible non-units, though one needs to provide a new argument about the ﬁniteness). It is a good idea to think about the corresponding notion of (non-unit) irreducibles for ideals. A non-unit irreducible is an element that has no divisors other than units and its associates. So the non-unit “irreducible” ideals of R should be the ideals I such that the only ideals dividing (containing) I are R = (1) and I. Deﬁnition 11.14. Let R be a ring. We say m is a maximal ideal of R if m ̸= R and the only ideals of R containing m are R and m. 4By the way, the reason one often uses K for ﬁelds (though one also often uses F ) is because ﬁelds were originally introduced by Dedekind who called them Körper, meaning body or corpus in German. 84 Note that we impose the condition m ̸= R so that m does not correspond to the units. It is perhaps an unfortunate conﬂuence of terminology that the terms prime element, prime ideal and maximal ideal exclude the trivial case of either units or R, but the term irreducible includes units. I’m sorry if this is confusing to remember, but I am just going with the standard terminology. Another strange consequence of standard terminology is that 0 is never a prime element but the zero ideal {0} is a prime ideal of any domain (see deﬁnition below). Proposition 11.15. Let I be a proper ideal in OK. Then I is contained in some maximal ideal m of OK. Proof. Either I maximal or not. If so, we are done. If not, it is contained in some strictly larger proper ideal I1 of OK. Either I1 is either maximal or not. If so, we are done. If not, I1 is contained in a larger proper ideal I2 of OK. Hence there is an ascending sequence of ideals I ⊆ I1 ⊆ I2 ⊆ · · · ⊆ OK. The point is that we can only ﬁt a ﬁnite number of ideals in such a chain before we get to OK. I won’t prove this, but it’s a standard fact from algebra since OK is a ﬁnitely generated ring. The ideal preceding OK in this chain is the desired maximal ideal. The key point about working with ideals is that for a general ring of integer OK, the non-unit irreducible elements and prime elements do not coincide, but the maximal ideals are precisely (non- zero) prime ideals. This fact will allow us to prove unique factorization into prime ideals, but to prove this fact, we ﬁrst need to characterize prime and maximal ideals in terms of their quotient rings. 11.6 Quotient rings Deﬁnition 11.16. Let R be a ring and I an ideal. Denote by R/I the set of cosets of the subgroup (I, +) in (R, +). The quotient ring R/I is the ring whose underlying set is R/I with operations + and · deﬁned by (r + I) + (s + I) = (r + s) + I and (r + I) · (s + I) = rs + I. THe norm of I is the number of elements of R/I (if ﬁnite). This in fact deﬁnes a ring (the details are simple, or see an algebra text if you are not satisﬁed), and we have seen this construction before. Example. Let R = Z and I = (n). Then R/I = Z/nZ. The norm of (n) is |n|. Example. Let R = Z[i] and I = (1 + i). (Recall 1 + i is a prime element of Z[i].) Then R/I = {0 + I, 1 + I} ≃ Z/2Z. To see why this is so, note that we may think of R/I as the set of possible remainders upon division by 1 + i. Note that 2 = (1 + i)(1 − i) ≡ 0 mod 1 + i, so the possible remainders mod 1 + i are going to be numbers of the form a + bi with 0 ≤ a, b < 2, i.e., 0, 1, i and 1 + i. Clearly 1 + i ≡ 0 mod 1 + i. Further i ≡ −1 ≡ −1 + 2 ≡ 1 mod 1 + i. This proves the assertion since 0 ̸≡ 1 mod 1 + i. This means the norm of the principal ideal I = (1 + i) is N (I) = 2 is same as the norm of the element 1 + i ∈ Z[i]. 85 We see these quotient rings generalize the notion of mod, and we write a ≡ b mod I if b − a ∈ I. Example. Let R = Z[i] and I = (3). Again 3 is a prime element of Z[i]. Since 3 ≡ 3i ≡ 0 mod 3, a priori the possible remainders for R/I are 0, 1, 2, i, 1 + i, 2 + i, 2i, 1 + 2i, 2 + 2i. These are all distinct mod I, since the diﬀerence of any two of them is not a multiple of 3. Again, we see the norm of the ideal (3), which is 9, is the same as the norm of the element 3 ∈ Z[i]. Deﬁnition 11.17. Let R be a nonzero ring. We say a ∈ R is a zero divisor if a|0 and a ̸= 0. If R has no zero divisors, we say R is an (integral) domain. Proposition 11.18. Let R be a ring and I an ideal. Then (i) I is prime ⇐⇒ R/I is an integral domain; (ii) I is maximal ⇐⇒ R/I is a ﬁeld. Proof. Proof of (i). (⇒) Suppose I is prime. We claim R/I has no zero divisors. Suppose it does, i.e., there are nonzero a, b ∈ R/I such that ab = 0. We can write a = r + I, b = s + I where r, s ̸∈ I. Then ab = 0 means rs ∈ I. In other words, I|(rs) but I ∤ (r), I ∤ (s), which contradicts the deﬁnition of I being prime. (⇐) Suppose R/I is an integral domain. If I is not prime, then there are ideals J , J ′ such that I|J J ′ but I ∤ J , I ∤ J ′. Hence there are r ∈ J , s ∈ J ′ such that r, s ̸∈ I, but rs ∈ I. This means a = r + I and b = s + I are zero divisors of R/I, a contradiction. Proof of (ii). The ideals of R/I are in 1-1 correspondence with ideals J of R such that I ⊆ J ⊆ R. It is simple to check that R is a ﬁeld if and only if its only ideals are {0} and R. Corollary 11.19. Let R be a ring and m a maximal ideal. Then m is prime. Proof. This is immediate from the previous proposition since any ﬁeld is an integral domain. In particular, any nonzero proper ideal of a ring of integers OK is divisible by a prime ideal (cf. Prop. 11.15). Lemma 11.20. Let R be a ﬁnite integral domain. Then R is a ﬁeld. Proof. Since R is a ring with 0 ̸= 1, to show it is a ﬁeld it suﬃces to show every nonzero a ∈ R is invertible. Note that in any integral domain, if ab = ac and a ̸= 0, then b = c. This is because ab − ac = a(b − c) = 0 which implies b − c = 0 since R has no zero divisors. This means multiplication by a simply permutes the elements of R, hence there is some b ∈ R such that ab = 1. Corollary 11.21. Let K be a number ﬁeld and p be a nonzero prime ideal of OK. Then p is maximal. Proof. By the propsition OK/p is an integral domain. Let α ∈ p be nonzero. The set of possible remainders for OK mod α is ﬁnite, hence OK/(α) is ﬁnte, hence OK/p is a ﬁnite integral domain, and therefore a ﬁeld by the Lemma. This means p is maximal by the same proposition above. These two corollaries mean that the “irreducible” (maximal) ideals are exactly the same as the (non-zero) prime ideals. We will use this to prove unique factorization into prime ideals in the next section. 86 Example. Since (3) is prime in Z[i] and it has norm 9, Z[i]/(3) is a ﬁnite ﬁeld of order 9. One consequence of this is the following: it is a standard fact in algebra that any ﬁnite ﬁeld has prime power order. Thus if p is a prime ideal of OK, then N (p) = pr for some rational prime p and r ∈ N. Exercise 11.8. Let R = Z[√−5] and consider the ideals I = (2), J = (1 + √−5) and p = (2, 1 + √−5). Write down a set of representatives for R/I, R/J and R/p. What are their norms? Show that I and J are not prime but p is. 11.7 Summary Here is a summary of what all the concepts we’ve encountered with ideals mean, thinking in terms of just working with elements in a ring. Table 1: The language of ideals Ideals of R Elements of R principal ideals of R elements of R up to units non-principal ideals of R “ideal elements” of R the zero ideal {0} 0 the ideal R the units of R contains divides product of ideals product of elements sum of ideals “gcd” of elements prime ideals prime elements maximal ideals (non-unit) irreducible elements R is a PID R has unique factorization It may helpful to read this chapter from the text to solidify these ideas. The discussion section is also somewhat interesting. 87","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
