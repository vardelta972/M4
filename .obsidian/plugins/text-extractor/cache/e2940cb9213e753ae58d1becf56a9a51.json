Pell's equation is a diophantine equation of the form x2 − dy2 = 1, x, y ∈ Z, where d is a given natural number which is not a square. An equation of the form x2 −dy2 = a for an integer a is usually referred to as a Pell-type equation. An arbitrary quadratic diophantine equation with two unknowns can be reduced to a Pell-type equation. How can such equations be solved? Recall that the general solution of a linear diophantine equation is a linear function of some parameters. This does not happen with general quadratic dio- phantine equations. However, as we will see later, in the case of such equations with two unknowns there still is a relatively simple formula describing the general solution. Why does the deﬁnition of Pell's equations assume d is not a square? Well, for d = c2, c ∈ Z, the equation x2 − dy2 = a can be factored as (x − cy)(x + cy) = a and therefore solved without using any further theory. So, unless noted otherwise, d will always be assumed not to be a square. The equation x2 − dy2 = a can still be factored as (x + y√ 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Since z is a solution to a Pell-type equation if and only if so is −z, we always assume w.l.o.g. that z > 0. Solutions of a Pell's Equation A Pell's equation has one trivial solution, (x, y) = (1, 0), corresponding to solution z = 1 of equation N(z) = 1. But if we know the smallest non-trivial solution, then we can derive all the solutions. This is what the following statement claims. Theorem 2.

When it does, it is possible to describe the general solution. Theorem 4.
