There are eight rooks on a chessboard, no two attacking each other. Prove that some two of the pairwise distances between the rooks are equal. (The distance between two rooks is the distance between the centers of their cells.) C2. Every vertex of the unit squares on an n × m grid is coloured either blue, green, or red, such that all the vertices on the boundary of the board are coloured red. We say that a unit square on the board is properly coloured if exactly one pair of adjacent vertices of the square are the same colour. Show that the number of properly coloured squares is even. C3. 3n points are marked on a circle, dividing it into 3n arcs, n of which have length 1, n others have length 2, and n have length 3. Prove that it is possible to ﬁnd two marked points diametrically opposite to each other. C4. In a round robin chess tournament each player faces every other player exactly once. For every game, 1 point is awarded for a win, 0.5 points for a draw, and 0 points for a loss. Given a positive integer m, a tournament is m−special if among every set S of m players, there is one player who won all her games against the other m − 1 players in S and one player who lost all her games against the other m − 1 players in S. For a given integer m ≥ 4, determine the minimum value of n (as a function of m) such that in every m−special round robin chess tournament with n players, the ﬁnal scores of the n players are all distinct. 1 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions 1.3 Geometry G1.

(√ ab(a + b) + √ bc(b + c) + √ ca(c + a))2 = ∑ cyc ab(a + b) + 2 ∑ cyc √ab2c(a + b)(b + c) > ∑ cyc ab(a + b) + 6abc > ∑ cyc ab(a + b) + 2abc = (a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Comment: Most Olympiad inequalities are tighter approximations, and steps like replacing 6abc with 2abc will not be good enough. Expanding can help though, and the cyclic sum notation used here is a good way to write things down when you do expand. Source: Russia 1990. A2. Suppose √x + √y = 2. By the power-mean inequality, we have x + y ≥ 1 2 · (√x + √y)2 ≥ 2, and x2 + y2 ≥ 1 2 · (x + y)2 = 2. Now, by the AM-GM inequality: 2x2+y + 2y2+x ≥ 2 · √ 2x2+y · 2y2+x = 21+ x2+y2 2 + x+y 2 ≥ 8. Equality holds if and only if x = y, so the only possible solution to the given pair of equations is x = y = 1. Substituting this pair in, we see that it is indeed a valid solution. Comment: Solving a system of equations like this requires doing two things: (a) proving that nothing other than x = y = 1 works, and (b) proving that x = y = 1 does work. It is always a good idea to check (b) separately. Your argument for (a) might take care of (b), but it might not, and it’s better to be safe than sorry. Source: Olymon 1997-1998. A3. Let a = maxi∈{1,2,...,n} |xi|, let S0 denote the set of indices i such that xi = a, let S1 denote the set of indices i such that xi = −a, and let S2 denote the remaining indices. Finally, let b = maxi∈S2 |xi|. (If S2 is empty, then deﬁne b = 0.) Consider replacing each xi in S0 with b and each xi in S1 with −b. This will have the following eﬀect on each |xi + xj| term: • If i, j are both in S0 or both in S1, then |xi + xj| will decrease from 2a to 2b. There are exactly |S0|2 + |S1|2 ordered pairs (i, j) for which this case applies. • If one of i, j is in S0 and the other is in S1, then |xi + xj| will be 0 both before and after the replacement, and therefore will be unchanged. 3 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions • If one of i, j is in S0 ∪ S1 and the other is in S2, then |xi + xj| will decrease by exactly a − b. (Assume without loss of generality that xi = a, and let c = xj; then |xi + xj| will decrease from a + c to b + c. There will be no sign change since |c| ≤ b ≤ a.) There are exactly 2 · (|S0| + |S1|) · |S2| ordered pairs (i, j) for which this case applies. • If i, j are both in S2, then |xi + xj| will not change. Therefore, ∑n i,j=1 |xi + xj| will decrease by exactly (a − b) · (2 · (|S0| + |S1|) · |S2| + 2 · |S0| 2 + 2 · |S1| 2) ≥ (a − b) · ((|S0| + |S1|) · |S2| + (|S0| + |S1|) 2) = (a − b) · (|S0| + |S1|) · n. On the other hand, n · ∑n i=1 |xi| will decrease by exactly (a − b) · (|S0| + |S1|) · n. Therefore, this replacement will always decrease the left-hand side by at least as much as it will decrease the right-hand side by. Performing this replacement repeatedly, we will eventually reach the conﬁguration where every xi is equal to 0, at which point it is obvious that the left-hand side is equal to the right-hand side. Therefore, we must originally have had the left-hand side being greater than or equal to the right-hand side, as required. Solution #2: If {x1, x2, . . . , xn} contains only non-negative numbers or only non-positive numbers, the claim is obvious. Otherwise, assume without loss of generality that x1, x2, . . . , xm ≥ 0 and xm+1, xm+2, . . . , xn < 0. Let a = x1 + . . . + xm m , b = − xm+1 + . . . + xn n − m . Clearly, a, b ≥ 0. Returning to the original inequality, we can now write the left-hand side minus the right-hand side in the following form: m∑ i,j=1 |xi + xj| + n∑ i,j=m+1 |xi + xj| + 2 m∑ i=1 n∑ j=m+1 |xi + xj| − n m∑ i=1 |xi| − n n∑ j=m+1 |xi|. This simpliﬁes further to LHS-RHS = 2m2a + 2(n − m)2b + 2 m∑ i=1 n∑ j=m+1 |xi + xj| − nma − n(n − m)b. Now assume without loss of generality that a ≥ b. Since |x + c| is a convex function, Jensen’s inequality implies LHS-RHS is greater than or equal to 2m2a + 2(n − m)2b + 2m n∑ j=m+1 |a + xj| − nma − n(n − m)b ≥ 2m2a + 2(n − m)2b + 2m(n − m)(a − b) − nma − n(n − m)b = a (2m2 + 2m(n − m) − nm) + b (2(n − m)2 − 2m(n − m) − n(n − m)) = amn + b(n2 − 5mn + 4m2) ≥ bmn + b(n2 − 5mn + 4m2) = b(n2 − 4mn + 4n2) = b(n − 2m)2 ≥ 0. 4 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions Comments: The technique of changing one or more variables, and seeing what happens to the inequality is called “smoothing” or “mixing variables”. Usually, you make two variables equal, or reduce one of them to zero. On some problems, smoothing is too messy to be useful, but when the algebra is not too complicated, it is a very powerful technique. Source: Iran 2006. A4. Let us say a function f is “good” if it satisﬁes the given equation. Note that: • If f1 and f2 are good, then so is f1 + f2. • For all rational numbers A, B, C, we have f (x) = Ax2 is good, f (x) = Bx is good, and f (x) = C is good. Therefore, all quadratical polynomials are good. We claim this is the complete set of good functions. Fact1: Fix real numbers a, b, c, t with t ̸= 0. Then there exists a quadratic polynomial P (x) such that P (−t) = a, P (0) = b, and P (t) = c. Lemma: Fix a positive integer n. If f is good, then there exists a quadratic polynomial P (x) such that f ( m n ) = P ( m n ) for all integers m. Proof of lemma: Let P (x) be the quadratic polynomial that equals f (x) for x = −1 n , 0, 1 n , and let g(x) = f (x) − P (x). Then g is a good function satisfying g ( −1 n ) = g(0) = g ( 1 n ) = 0. We need to show g ( m n ) = 0 for all m. Taking a = b = 1 n and c = −1 n , we have 3g ( 1 n ) + g ( −1 n ) = g ( 2 n ) + 3g(0), and hence g ( 2 n ) = 0. Now, for any m, take a = b = 1 n and c = m−2 n . Then g ( m n ) + 2g ( 1 n ) + g ( m − 2 n ) = 2g ( m − 1 n ) + g ( 2 n ) + g(0), and hence g ( m n ) = 2g ( m−1 n ) − g ( m−2 n ). Therefore, g ( m n ) is 0 if both g ( m−2 n ) and g ( m−1 n ) are 0. It follows immediately that g ( m n ) is 0 for all positive integers m. Similarly, g ( m−2 n ) is 0 if both g ( m−1 n ) and g ( m n ) are 0, and hence g ( m n ) is also 0 for all negative integers m. Now pick an arbitrary good function f . By the lemma, there exists a quadratic polynomial P such that f (m) = P (m) for all integers m. Suppose there exists a rational number t n so that f ( t n ) ̸= P ( t n ). Applying the lemma again, there exists a quadratic polynomial P2 such that f ( m n ) = P2 ( m n ) for all m. But then P − P2 is a quadratic polynomial that has roots at -1, 0, and 1, but is non-zero at t n . However, this is impossible: a non-zero quadratic polynomial can have at most 2 roots. Therefore it must be that f (x) ≡ P (x), and the problem is solved. Comments: This problem generalizes Cauchy’s equation: f (a) + f (b) = f (a + b). Like Cauchy’s equation, there can be all sorts of weird solutions if you let the domain of f be the set of all real numbers. It depends on whether you assume the Axiom of Choice, and is far beyond the scope of the IMO! 1You can quote the following more general theorem: Given any k + 1 pairs (x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xk+1, yk+1) with xi ̸= xj, there exists a unique degree-k polynomial P satisfying P (xi) = yi for all i. In our case, the polynomial is P (x) = a+c−2b 2t2 · x 2 + c−a 2t · x + b. 5 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions 2.2 Combinatorics C1. Suppose that 8 rooks are placed on a chessboard with no two attacking each other. Then there must be one rook in each row and one in each column. Consider a pair of rooks that are either in adjacent rows or in adjacent columns. The distance between them is one of√12 + 12, √12 + 22, √ 12 + 32, . . . , √12 + 72. Note that there are exactly 7 distinct distances of this form. If all rook pairs are a diﬀerent distance apart, it follows that there are at most 7 rook pairs in adjacent rows or columns. However, there are exactly 7 pairs in adjacent rows (the rook in row 1 paired with the rook in row 2, the rook in row 2 paired with the rook in row 3, etc.), and exactly 7 pairs in adjacent columns. If these combine to give only 7 pairs altogether, it must be that any time two rooks are in adjacent rows, they are also in adjacent columns. But in this case, all 7 of these rook pairs are separated by a distance of exactly √2, and we have a contradiction. Solution #2: If there are 8 rooks on a board, this gives (8 2 ) = 28 pairs of rooks. The distance between any pair must be of the form √ i2 + j2 for i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , 7}. There are exactly (7 2)+7 = 28 such distances. Therefore, if every pair of rooks is separated by a diﬀerent distance, each of these 28 distances must be used. In particular, there are two rooks separated by a distance of √72 + 72, meaning there are two rooks in opposite corners. But then no more rooks can be placed on the boundary without attacking one of these two. Hence, no two rooks can be separated by a distance of √72 + 62, and we have a contradiction. Comments: With Pigeonhole Principle arguments like this, it is always a good idea to count the number of possible distances and the number of rook pairs. In this case, the total number of rook pairs and the total number of possible distances are both (8 2 ), which is not enough for a contradiction. You need to tweak the argument a little bit, like we did here. Source: Russia 2002. C2. We will call an edge of a square good if both its endpoints are of the same colour, and bad otherwise. Any square can have either no good edges (call such squares type A), one good edge (type B), two good edges (type C), or four good edges (type D). Note that it cannot have three good edges. Let the number of squares of type A, B, C, D be a, b, c, d respectively. For each square, count the number of good edges, and add the numbers. We must get an even number, since each edge not on the boundary is counted twice, and all 2(m + n) edges on the boundary are good. On the other hand, this number is b + 2c + 4d. Hence b is even and the result follows. Comments: We are counting in two diﬀerent ways the number of (square, good edge) pairs. This kind of argument is very important in combinatorics problems! Source: India 2001. C3. Assume it is not possible to ﬁnd the two required points. Starting at any marked point, divide the circumference into 6n arcs of length 1. Colour the endpoints of these arcs blue if they are marked, and red otherwise. By assumption, each blue point is diametrically opposite a red point. Since the total number of red points and the total 6 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions number of blue points are both equal to 3n, all red points must be used in this way, and therefore each red point is also diametrically opposite a blue point. Let us call any arc between two adjacent blue points “elementary”. Consider an elementary arc AC of length 2. Its endpoints are blue, and its midpoint B′ is red. As argued above, the point B diametrically opposite to B′ must be blue. Now suppose arc AB contains a1 elementary arcs of length 1, a2 elementary arcs of length 2, and a3 elementary arcs of length 3. Each length-1 elementary arc in AB is diametrically opposite a length-3 elementary arc in BC: the two blue endpoints of the length-1 arc must be opposite red points and no elementary arc can have length greater than 3. Conversely, each length-3 elementary arc in BC is diametrically opposite a length-1 elementary arc in AB. Therefore, the total number of length-3 elementary arcs in BC is exactly a1. Since the total number of length-3 elementary arcs on the whole circle is k, we have a1 = k − a3. Finally, arc AB is of length 3k − 1, so we have 3k − 1 = a1 + 2a2 + 3a3 = 2a2 + 2a2 + k. Therefore, 2k − 1 = 2a1 + 2a2, but this is impossible because the left-hand side is odd, and the right-hand side is even. Source: Russia 1982. C4. The answer is 2m − 3. For n ≤ 2m − 4, consider a tournament with players P1, P2, . . . , Pn where Pi beats Pj for all i > j except Pm−1 draws against Pm−2. Consider any set of m players, and let i, j denote the highest and lowest index respectively of any player in this set. Clearly, i ≥ m and since n ≤ 2m − 4, we also have j ≤ m − 3. Since i, j are not m − 1 and m − 2, we know that Pi beat all other players in the set, and Pj lost to all other players in the set. Therefore, the tournament is m-special. Since players Pm−2 and Pm−1 have identical scores, the answer to the problem must be at least 2m − 3. Conversely, consider an arbitrary m-special tournament. First suppose two players P1 and P2 drew against each other. Let A be the set of players who beat or tied P1, and let B be the set of players who lost to P1. If |A| ≥ m − 2, then consider a set of m − 2 players from A, along with P1 and P2. Each player in A beat or drew against P1, P1 drew against P2, and P2 drew against P1. Therefore, no player lost to all other players in the set, and so the tournament cannot be m-special, which is a contradiction. Therefore, |A| ≤ m − 3. Similarly, |B| ≤ m − 3. Since A and B together comprise all players other than P1 and P2, we must have n ≤ 2 + 2(m − 3) = 2m − 4. Next suppose there exists a “3-cycle”: three players P1, P2, P3 such that P1 beat P2, P2 beat P3, and P3 beat P1. Let A be the set of players who beat or tied P1, and let B be the set of players who lost to P1. Looking at size-m sets containing all of P1, P2, P3 as above, we ﬁnd |A|, |B| ≤ m − 4, and hence n ≤ 2m − 5. Finally, consider an arbitrary tournament with no draws and with no 3-cycles. Let P be the player with the largest number of wins. Suppose some player Q is not beaten by P . Since there are no ties, it must be that Q beat P . Since there are no 3-cycles, it must also be that Q beat every player beaten by P , and hence Q has more wins than P . This contradicts the deﬁnition of P , so the only possibility is that P beat all other players. Label P as Pn and now restrict our attention to the remaining n − 1 players who together form a smaller 7 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions tournament with no draws and with no 3-cycles. By the same argument, this tournament also has a player Pn−1 who beats all remaining players. Proceeding recursively, we can label the players P1, P2, . . . , Pn so that player Pi beats Pj whenever i > j. Notice that no two players can have the same score for this kind of tournament. Therefore, if two players have the same score, then the tournament must have a tie or a 3-cycle. In the case of m-special tournaments, we showed that this means n ≤ 2m − 4, and the proof is complete. Comments: In the ﬁnal case, we proved one player had beaten all other players by starting with the player who had the most wins and analyzing what properties she must have. This is called an extremal argument, and it is very useful. Source: China 2007. 2.3 Geometry G1. Let E be the reﬂection of A through the angle bisector of ∠BCD. Since P is the reﬂection of Q through the same line, it follows that P Q and AE are both perpendicular to the bisector, and that AQ = EP . In particular, AQP E is an isosceles trapezoid, and is therefore cyclic. It follows that the circumcircle of △AP Q passes through E no matter where P is. A B C D E P Q Comments: For many problems where you need a show a shape always passes through a ﬁxed point, the key is to ﬁrst ﬁgure out where that point is, and then go from there. Always have a straight-edge and compass ready to help with this kind of guessing! Source: Russia 2005. G2. Assume without loss of generality that E is closer to AB than to CD. Since ∠EBN = ∠EDN = 90◦, the points E, B, D, N lie on a circle. (We do not know what order they lie in however.) Similarly, the points E, A, C, M lie on a circle. Now, suppose segments BN and DE cross. Then ∠EBD > ∠EBN = 90◦, and ∠EAC = 180◦ − ∠CEA − ∠ECA = 180◦ − ∠DEB − ∠EDB = ∠EBD > 90◦. It follows that segments AM and CE also cross, as shown in the left diagram. In this conﬁguration, we have ∠DEN = 180◦ − ∠BED − ∠BDN = 90◦ − ∠BED − ∠BDA = 90◦ − ∠AEC − ∠ACB = 180◦ − ∠AEC − ∠ACM = ∠CEM . 8 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions If segments AM and CE cross, then segments BN and DE also cross as argued above, and we are in the same case as before. Otherwise, it must be that AM does not cross CE, and BN does not cross DE, as shown in the right diagram. In this conﬁguration, we have ∠DEN = ∠DBN = ∠DBC −90◦ = ∠CAD −90◦ = ∠CAM = ∠CEM . Thus, ∠DEN = ∠CEM in all possible conﬁgurations. A B C D E M N A B C D M N E Solution #2: We know ∠ACE = ∠ACB = ∠BDA = ∠BDE and ∠CEA = ∠DEB, so △EAC must be similar to △EBD. Also, E, A, C, M lie on a circle with diameter EM since ∠EAM = ∠ECM = 90◦. In particular, this means AM is the diameter of the circumcircle of △EAC. Similarly, BN is the diameter of the circumcircle of △EBD. Now consider the similarity transformation (rotation, scaling, translation, and/or reﬂection) taking △EAC to △EBD. This transformation will also take the point on the circumcircle of △EAC opposite A to the point on the circumcircle of △EBD opposite B; i.e., it will take M to N . Thus, the entire ﬁgure EACM is similar to EBDN , and hence ∠DEN = ∠CEM . Comments: Many students will just assume one conﬁguration and ignore the possibility of the other one, even when the argument needs to be tweaked. This will usually cost you a point. In this problem, it would cost you multiple points. Always, always, always pay attention to all possible conﬁgurations! Source: Iran 2004. G3. Let △ABC have angles a, b, c, and assume without loss of generality that X lies on the same side of AD as C. Then ∠XAD = ∠XAC + ∠CAD = b + (90◦ − c). Now, ∠AF C = ∠ADC = 90◦ so AF DC is a cyclic quadrilateral. Similar arguments apply for BDEA and CEF B. Therefore, ∠XDA = ∠XDE + ∠EDA = ∠DF E + ∠EDA = ∠DF C + ∠CF E + ∠EDA = ∠DAC + ∠CBE + ∠EBA = (90 ◦ − c) + (90◦ − c) + (90◦ − a) = 90◦ + b − c = ∠XAD. Therefore, △XAD is isosceles and XA = XD. Since XA and XD are both tangents, it follows that X has equal power with respect to the circumcircles of △ABC and △DEF . In 9 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions particular, X is on the radical axis of these circles. The same argument can be applied to Y and Z, and so all three points lie on the one line as required. A B C D E F X Comments: As with G1, the trick here is to guess the line in advance. Once you know the goal is to prove X, Y, Z are on the radical axis of the two circles, it is straightforward. If you don’t know what power of a point and radical axes are, you should look them up. They are important! G4. First note that △AF D ∼= △AED by angle-angle-side. Now extend AH to meet BC at K. Since AF = AE, Ceva’s theorem guarantees that: BK CK = BF CE = BD · cos B CD · cos C = BA · cos B CA · cos C by the angle bisector theorem. Now let K′ be the base of the altitude from A to BC. Then BK′ CK′ = BA·cos B CA·cos C = BK CK , so K = K′, and AK is perpendicular to BC. Since ∠AF D = ∠AKD = 90◦, it follows that AF DK is a cyclic quadrilateral. By power of a point on circles AF DK and AF GH, we have BK · BD = BF · BA = BH · BG. Therefore, KDGH is also a cyclic quadrilateral. Since ∠DKH = 90◦, it has diameter DH and hence ∠DGH = 90◦ as well. In other words, DG is perpendicular to BE. Therefore, BG2 − GE2 = BD2 − DE2 = BD2 − DF 2 = BF 2 as required. A B C D E F G H K 10 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions Comments: The key observations are that AK is perpendicular to BC and DG is perpen- dicular to BE, both of which you would probably see if you made a good straight-edge and compass diagram! Source: China 2003. 2.4 Number Theory N1. The answer is no. Let X = ∏2011 i=1 (3ai − 1), and let xi = ∏j̸=i(3aj − 1). Note that 2011∑ i=1 1 3ai − 1 = 1 X · 2011∑ i=1 xi. Working modulo 3 however, we have X ≡ 22011 ≡ 2, and ∑2011 i=1 xi ≡ ∑2011 i=1 22010 ≡ 2011·1 ≡ 1. Therefore, X ̸= ∑2011 i=1 xi, and hence the original sum cannot be equal to 1. Comments: If you look at the equation mod 3, the argument is intuitively clear, but a nuisance to write up clearly. Think about how you would do it. Source: Ukraine 2005. N2. For any integer n, we have n = gcd(n, 2n) = gcd(an, a2n), which divides an. Therefore, n divides an for all n. Now suppose there exists n for which an ̸= n. Then an = nm for some m > 1. Since nm also divides anm, we have nm| gcd(an, anm). However, nm does not divide n = gcd(n, nm), so this is a contradiction. It follows that an = n for all n. Source: Russia 1995. N3. Let p be an odd prime. We claim that p2 is not Yorky, which implies there are inﬁnitely many non-Yorky numbers. Indeed, suppose x2−1 y2−1 = p2. Then: x2 − 1 = y2p2 − p 2 ⇒ p 2 − 1 = y2p2 − x2 ⇒ p 2 − 1 = (yp − x)(yp + x). If yp − x = 1, then yp + x = p2 − 1 and 2yp = p2, contradicting the fact that p is odd. Otherwise, yp − x > 1. Taking the equation modulo p, we have x2 ≡ 1 mod p, and hence yp − x ≡ −x ≡ ±1 mod p. Since yp − x is positive and greater than 1, it follows that yp − x ≥ p − 1. Also, x must be greater than 1, so yp + x > yp − x + 2 ≥ p + 1. But then (yp − x)(yp + x) > (p − 1)(p + 1), and we have a contradiction. Comments: Unless you are 100% completely sure you know whether there are inﬁnitely many non-Yorky numbers, do NOT put all your eggs in one basket. Spend time both trying to prove there are inﬁnitely many, and trying to prove there are not. When trying to construct non-Yorky numbers, it is natural to look at perfect squares because they let you factor the 11 of 12 Winter Camp 2011 Warmup Solutions expression. The advantage of trying to construct examples is you can restrict your attention to whatever is easy to work with! Source: Russia 2010. N4. Lemma 1: Let n > 1 be a positive integer. If the sequence contains inﬁnitely many multiples of n, then it contains all multiples of n. Proof of lemma 1: Let kn be an arbitrary multiple of n. Consider the ﬁrst kn + 1 mul- tiples of n in the sequence. Each of these terms shares a non-trivial divisor with n, and each is followed by a distinct number. Eventually these numbers will become larger than kn, at which point kn has to be used. Therefore, kn will appear in the sequence at some point. Lemma 2: Let n > 1 be a positive integer. If the sequence contains inﬁnitely many multiples of n, then it contains all positive integers greater than 1. Proof of lemma 2: Let m > 1 be an arbitrary positive integer. By Lemma 1, the se- quence contains all multiples of n, including all multiples of nm. Therefore, the sequence contains inﬁnitely many multiples of m, which means it contains all multiples of m, including m itself. Since m was arbitrary, the proof is now complete. We now show that the sequence must contain inﬁnitely many prime numbers. Suppose by way of contradiction that it contains only the primes p1, p2, . . . , pk. By Lemma 2, it can contain only ﬁnitely many multiples of each of these primes. Therefore, it must eventually reach a number m not divisible by any of them. Let q be the smallest prime factor of m. Then q is the smallest number sharing a non-trivial divisor with m, so m will be immediately followed by q if q has not already appeared in the sequence. Either way, q appears at some point, and we have a contradiction. Therefore, the sequence does indeed contain inﬁnitely many prime numbers. For any prime p, the smallest number sharing a non-trivial divisor with p is 2p. If 2p has not already appeared in the sequence, it will therefore immediately follow p. Thus, having inﬁnitely many primes in the sequence guarantees that there will be inﬁnitely many even numbers, and we are now done by Lemma 2. Comments: The devil here is in the details. Take a look at how the proof is made rigorous, and make sure you could do the same thing! Source: China 2010. 12 of 12","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
