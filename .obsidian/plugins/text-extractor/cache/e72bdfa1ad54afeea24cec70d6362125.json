(This is not to say that these problems are trivial.) Most of these properties are not very diﬃcult, and are left as an exercise to the reader – see the problems section. 2 Homothety This is one of the most useful nontrivial geometric transformations, and is extremely important in problems dealing with circles. A homothety from a point P with ratio r is simply a dilation from the point P by the factor r. The concept of a homothety with negative ratio is also deﬁned - a homothety with ratio −r from point P is the composition of a homothety with ratio r from point P and a reﬂection about point P . Any two triangles whose corresponding sides are parallel are homothetic - that is, there is a homothety bringing one to the other. In the case of triangles ABC and DEF , this homothety is from point AD ∩ BE. Additionally, it is easily seen that homothety maps parallel lines to parallel lines. This is most commonly applied to circles. Any two circles are homothetic in two ways - one homothety has positive ratio (this is called the “external homothety”) and one has a negative ratio (this is called the “internal homothety”). Two tangent circles are homothetic with a center at their point of tangency. The external center of homothety of two circles external to each other is the intersection of their common external tangents, and the internal center of homothety between these two circles is the intersection of their common internal tangents. 3 Spiral similarity A spiral similarity is the composition of a homothety from a point with a rotation about the same point. All homotheties are also spiral similarities. The important fact about spiral similarities is that any two segments AB, CD in the plane are related by two spiral similarites: an “internal” and an “external” one. This center of spiral similarity is the intersection of the circumcircles of P AC, P BD, where P is the intersection of the two segments, as can be proven by an angle chase. 4 Problems Here are some problems on which these geometric transformations can be used. 1. Prove that the composition of two rotations (not necessarily about the same point) is a rotation. How can the center of the resulting rotation be constructed? 2. Circles ω1 and ω2 are internally tangent at A (with ω2 inside ω1), and line ℓ is tangent to ω2 at B and intersects ω1 at P and Q. Prove that A, B, and the midpoint of arc P Q not containing A are collinear. 3. Let ABCD be a cyclic quadrilateral, with AB ∩ CD = E and BC ∩ AD = F . Prove that the circumcircles of EAC, EBD, F AB, F CD are concurrent. 1 4. ω1 and ω2 are two circles such that the intersection of their external common tangents is P . Let ℓ1 and ℓ2 be lines through P . Let A be the intersection of ℓ1 with ω1 farthest from P , let B be the intersection of ℓ2 with ω1 farthest from P , let C be the intersection of ℓ2 with ω2 closest to P , and let D be the intersection of ℓ1 with ω2 closest to P . Prove that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. 5. Circle ω contains circles ω1 and ω2 which are interally tangent to ω, and line ℓ is tangent to ω1 and ω2 and intersects ω at P and Q. Prove that the midpoint of one of the arcs P Q lies on the radical axis of ω1 and ω2. 5 More Problems These problems, unlike the previous ones, do not necessarily involve the geometric transformations listed above. (Don’t forget about radical axes, Ceva’s theorem, and Menelaus’s theorem when trying the below problems.) 1. Suppose that ω1, ω2, ω3 are circles. Prove that the centers of the three external homotheties taking ω1 to ω2, ω2 to ω3, and ω3 to ω1 are collinear. (This is known as Monge’s theorem.) 2. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with AB ̸= AC. The circle with diameter BC intersects the sides AB and AC at M and N respectively. Denote by O the midpoint of the side BC. The bisectors of the angles ∠BAC and ∠M ON intersect at R. Prove that the circumcircles of the triangles BM R and CN R have a common point lying on the side BC. 3. Two circles ω1 and ω2 with radii r1 and r2 are externally tangent at point A. Line ℓ meets ω1 at P, Q and ω2 at R, S, such that P, Q, R, S are on the line in that order, and P Q RS = r1 r2 . Prove that ∠QAS is right. 4. Let ABCD be a quadrilateral, and let E and F be points on sides AD and BC, respectively, such that AE ED = BF F C . Ray F E meets rays BA and CD at S and T, respectively. Prove that the circumcircles of triangles SAE, SBF, T CF, and T DE pass through a common point. 5. Let A, B, C, D, E, F be points such that A, B, C are collinear and D, E, F are collinear. Prove that AE ∩ BD, AF ∩ CD, BF ∩ CE are collinear. (This is known as Pappus’s theorem.) 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
