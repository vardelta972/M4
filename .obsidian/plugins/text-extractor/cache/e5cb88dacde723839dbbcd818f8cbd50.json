A line ℓ is tangent to the circumcircles of ∆ADB and ∆ADC at points M, N , respectively. Prove that ℓ is also tangent to the circle passing through the midpoints of BD, DC, M N . Solution 1: (Using homothety:) Let ω1, ω2 be circumcircles of ∆BAD, ∆CAD, respec- tively with circumcentres O1, O2, respectively. Let h be the homothety with positive ratio that maps ω1 to ω2. Then h(M ) = N and h(O1) = O2. We claim that h(B) = D and h(D) = C. Note that ∠O1BC = 90 − ∠BAD and ∠O2DC = 90 − ∠DAC. Since ∠BAD = ∠DAC, ∠O1BC = ∠O2DC. Therefore, BO1||DO2. Consequently, h(B) = D. Therefore, the centre of h lies on BD. Hence, h(D) is a point (diﬀerent from D) on ω2 that lies on BC. Therefore, h(D) = C. Let E, X, Y be the midpoints of M N, BD, DC, respectively and ω the circumcircle of ∆EXY . Since N = h(M ) and D = h(B), M B||N D. Therefore, EX||M B||N D. Similarly, EY ||M D||N C. Hence, the homothety h1 (with positive ratio) that maps M B to EX has the same centre as h and maps D to Y . Since the circumcircle of ∆M BD is tangent to ℓ and ℓ passes through the centre of h1 and h1 maps ∆M BD to ∆EXY , the image of this circumcircle is also tangent to ℓ, i.e. the circumcircle of ∆EXY is tangent to h. This completes the problem. □ Solution 2: (Using angle chasing:) Let ω1, ω2 be circumcircles of ∆BAD, ∆CAD, re- spectively. We will consider the two tangent lines of ω1, ω2 separately. We ﬁrst consider the case when ℓ intersects DA on ray DA. Using the same argument as in Solution 1, AD passes through the midpoint of M N ; we will call this point E. I claim that M D||N C and M B||N D. Let α = ∠BAD = ∠DAC, θ1 = ∠N M D, θ2 = ∠M N D. Note that ∠BM D = ∠BAD = α and ∠DN C = ∠DAC = α. Then by properties of tangents, ∠M BD = θ1, ∠N CD = θ2. Looking at the quadrilateral M N CB, we have 2(θ1 + θ2 + α) = 360◦. Hence, θ1 + θ2 + α = 180◦. Since ∠N M D = θ1 and ∠M N C = θ2 + α and θ1 + θ2 + α = 180◦, M D||N C. Since ∠BM D = ∠DN C = α, M B||N D. Let X, Y be the midpoints of BD and DC. Since E is the midpoint of M N , M B||EX||N D and M D||EY ||N C. Therefore, ∠M EX = ∠M N D = ∠N CD = ∠EY X. Hence, the circum- circle of ∆M XY is tangent to ℓ, as desired. The case when ℓ intersects DA on ray AD is handled similarly. Using the same argument as in Solution 1, AD passes through the midpoint of M N ; we will call this point E. I claim that M D||N C and M B||N D. Let α = ∠BAD = ∠DAC, θ1 = ∠N M D, θ2 = ∠M N D. Note that ∠BM D = 180 − ∠BAD = 180 − α and ∠DN C = 180◦ − ∠DAC = 180◦ − α. Then by properties of tangents, ∠M BD = θ1, ∠N CD = θ2. Looking at the quadrilateral M N CB, we have 2(θ1 + θ2 + 180◦ − α) = 360◦. Hence, θ1 + θ2 + 180◦ − α = 180◦. Since ∠N M D = θ1 and ∠M N C = 180 − α + θ2 and θ1 + θ2 + 180◦ − α = 180◦, M D||N C. Since ∠BM D = ∠DN C = 180◦ − α, M B||N D. Let X, Y be the midpoints of BD and DC. Since E is the midpoint of M N , M B||EX||N D and M D||EY ||N C. Therefore, ∠M EX = ∠M N D = ∠N CD = ∠EY X. Hence, the circum- circle of ∆M XY is tangent to ℓ, as desired. □ 2. Let P (x) be a non-constant polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Prove that there is no func- tion T : Z → Z such that the number of integers x with T n(x) = x is equal to P (n) for every n ≥ 1, where T n denotes the n-fold application of T . Solution: Suppose such a function T exists. For each positive integer n, let A(n) = {x ∈ Z | T n(x) = x} and B(n) = {x ∈ Z | T n(x) = x, and n is the smallest positive integer with this property.} Then P (n) = |A(n)| for all positive integers n. This implies that A(n) is ﬁnite for all n ∈ N. Note that A(n) = ⋃ d|n B(d) and the sets B(d), d|n are pairwise disjoint. Therefore, |A(n)| = ∑ d|n |B(d)|. We claim that d divides |B(d)|. We represent this as a direct graph: let the set of integers be represented by vertices and there is a direct edge from a to b if and only if b = T (a). Then an element x ∈ B(d) if and only if x is in a cycle of length d. Since the number of elements in a given cycle of length d is a multiple of d, the number of elements in a cycle of length d is a multiple of d. Therefore, d divides |B(d)|. Let m = deg P with P (x) = amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + a1x + a0. Since P is not a constant, m ≥ 1. Let p be any prime number. Note that P (1) = |A(1)| = |B(1)| and P (p) = |A(p)| = |B(p)|+|B(1)| = |B(p)|+|A(1)| = |B(p)|+P (1). Since p divides |B(p)|, p divides P (p)−P (1). Hence, p divides am(p m − 1) + · · · + a1(p − 1). Therefore, p|am + am−1 + · · · + a1. Since this is true for all primes p, am + am−1 + · · · + a1 = 0 (1) Finally, let p, q be any two distinct primes. Then P (pq) = |A(pq)| = |B(pq)|+|B(p)|+|B(q)|+ |B(1)| = |B(pq)|+(|A(p)|−B(1))+(|A(q)|−B(1))+|A(1)| = |B(pq)|+|A(p)|+|A(q)|−|A(1)| = |B(pq)| + P (p) + P (q) − P (1). Therefore, |B(pq)| = P (pq) − P (p) − P (q) + P (1). Since pq divides |B(pq)|, pq divides P (pq) − P (p) − P (q) + P (1). Therefore, pq divides am((pq)m − pm − qm + 1) + · · · + a1(pq − p − q + 1) = am(pm − 1)(qm − 1) + · · · + a1(p − 1)(q − 1). In particular, p divides this expression. Taking this equation modulo p and by (1), we have −am(qm − 1) − · · · − a1(q − 1) ≡ −(amqm + · · · + a1q) ≡ 0 (mod p). Therefore, every prime q is a root of the equation amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + a1x (mod p). We will show that this is impossible. Choose p such that p > m + 1. By Dirchlet’s theorem for prime, for each i ∈ {1, · · · m + 1}, there exists a prime qi such that qi ≡ i (mod p). Since p > m + 1, q1, · · · , qm+1 are pairwise distinct modulo p. Then q1, · · · , qm+1 are pairwise distinct roots of the polynomial amxm + am−1xm−1 + · · · + ax (mod p). But this polynomial contains at most m roots. This is a contradiction. Therefore, no such function T exists. □ 3. On a 999 × 999 board a limp rook can move in the following way: From any square it can move to any of its adjacent squares, i.e. a square having a common side with it, and every move must be a turn, i.e. the directions of any two consecutive moves must be perpendicular. A non-intersecting route of the limp rook consists of a sequence of pairwise diﬀerent squares that the limp rook can visit in that order by an admissible sequence of moves. Such a non- intersecting route is called cyclic, if the limp rook can, after reaching the last square of the route, move directly to the ﬁrst square of the route and start over. How many squares does the longest possible cyclic, non-intersecting route of a limp rook visit? Solution: The answer is 4 · ((499)2 − 1). Colour the board with four colours A, B, C, D according to the following rules: Given a square in the ith row and jth column, colour the square A if i, j are both odd, B if i is odd and j is even, C if i is even and j is odd and D if i, j are both even. Then a limp rook encounters the same colour exactly every four steps. More speciﬁcally, D appears once every four steps. Since there are only 4992 squares coloured D, a limp rook cycle contains at most 4(4992). We claim that a limp rook cycle cannot go through every square coloured D. This will prove that a limp rook cycle passes through at most 4(4992 − 1) squares. We will then construct such a cycle to prove that this length is indeed the maximum. Colour the squares marked D in a ”chessboard” manner in black and white. Suppose that a limp rook cycle passes through every square marked D. Note that two consecutive squares of a limp rook cycle that are coloured D, are ”neighbours” of each other (i.e. distance 2 horizontally and/or vertically of each other.) Since there are an odd number of squares marked D, there are two consecutive squares in the limp rook cycle coloured the same colour, marked D. By symmetry, we may assume that these two squares are (a, b), (a + 2, b + 2), where (i, j) is the square in the ith row and the jth column, for some positive integers a, b. Without loss of generality, suppose (a, b) is going toward (a + 2, b + 2). Also, assume that the path goes (a, b) → (a, b + 1) → (a + 1, b + 1) → (a + 1, b + 2) → (a + 2, b + 2). It is easy to show that by parity, the limp rook cycle enters any square coloured D horizon- tally and exits any square coloured D vertically. Consider the square (a, b + 2). This square is coloured D. Then the limp rook cycle enters this square horizontally and exits this square vertically. Therefore, the limp rook cycle goes from (a − 1, b + 2) → (a, b + 2) → (a, b + 3). By the direction of the limp rook cycle, the limp rook goes from (a, b + 3) to (a, b) and from (a + 2, b + 2) to (a − 1, b + 2). Let P1, P2 be these two paths of the limp-rook cycle, respec- tively. Note that P1, P2 does not go through the interior of the quadrilateral whose vertices are (a, b), (a + 2, b + 2), (a, b + 3), (a − 1, b + 2). Therefore, P1 and P2 must intersect. Hence, the limp rook cycle must intersect. This is a contradiction. Hence, a limp rook cycle contains at most 4(4992 − 1) squares. And now the construction. 2010 Mock 2 Time: 4.5 Hours 1. A positive integer N is called balanced, if N = 1 or if N can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers a and b, consider the polynomial P deﬁned by P (x) = (x + a)(x + b). (a) Prove that there exist distinct positive integers a and b such that all the numbers P (1), · · · , P (50) are balanced. Solution: For each n ∈ N, let f : N → Z be a function such that f (n) = −1 if n has an odd number of prime divisors and f (n) = 1 if n has an even number of prime divisors. Then n is balanced if and only if f (n) = 1. Note that f is multiplicative. Consider the 250 + 1 sequences (km + 1, · · · , km + 50) for k = 1, 2, · · · , 250 + 1. Since there are 250 possible sequences containing ±1, two of the 250 + 1 sequences are the same. Hence (f (um + 1), · · · , f (um + 50)) = (f (vm + 1), · · · , f (vm + 50)) for some distinct u, v ∈ {1, · · · , 250 + 1}. Hence, f ((um + i)(vm + i)) = 1, which implies that (um + i)(vm + i) is balanced for each i ∈ {1, · · · , 50}. Setting a = um, b = vm yields P (1), · · · , P (50) each having an even number of prime divisors. □ (b) Prove that if P (n) is balanced for all positive integers n, then a = b. Solution: Suppose a ̸= b. WLOG, suppose a < b. Then for any n > b, P (n − a) = n(n + b − a) is balanced. Therefore, f (n) = f (n + (b − a)). Then the sequence f (1), f (2), · · · is eventually periodic with period d for some d | b − a. Then for any prime p, f (dp) = −f (dp2), since dp2 has exactly one more prime divisor (namely p) than dp. Choose a suﬃciently large p such that f (dp) is part of the sequence f (1), f (2), · · · for which the sequence is periodic. Since dp2 and dp diﬀers by a multiple of d, f (dp) = f (dp2). This is a contradiction. Therefore, a = b. □ 2. In a triangle ABC with AB ̸= AC, the incircle touches the sides BC, CA, AB at D, E, F , respectively. Line AD meets the incircle again at P . The line EF and the line through P perpendicular to AD meet at Q. Line AQ intersects DE at X and DF at Y . Prove that A is the midpoint of XY . Solution 1: Let I be the incentre of △ABC. Let AI intersect EF at M . Then clearly M is the midpoint of EF and ∠AM Q = 90o. Since ∠AP Q = 90o, AP M Q is cyclic. Furthermore, by Power of a Point, note that AP · AD = AF 2 = AM · AI (since △AF M ∼ △AIF .) Hence, P M ID is also cyclic. Then, ∠AQP = ∠AM P = ∠ADI, and so ∠QAD = 90o−∠AQP = ∠BDI−∠ADI = ∠BDA, and so BC||AQ. Therefore, ∠AXE = ∠EDC = ∠CED = ∠AEX. Therefore, AE = AX. Similarly, AF = AY . Since AE = AF , AX = AY , as desired. □ Solution 2: We do the same as Solution 1 to prove that AQ||BC. Since F P ED is cyclic, F P ED is harmonic. Therefore, the pencil D(D, F, P, E) is harmonic. Intersecting it with line AQ we get a harmonic bundle (S, A; Y, X), where S is some point on XY . Since we want to show A is the midpoint of XY , it suﬃces to show S is a point at inﬁnity, i.e. that AQ||BC. This completes the solution. □ 3. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (xf (x + y)) = f (yf (x)) + x2, for all x, y ∈ R. Solution: The answers are f (x) = x, ∀x ∈ R and f (x) = −x, ∀x ∈ R. Substituting x = 0 into the original equation yields f (0) = f (yf (0)), ∀y ∈ R. Suppose f (0) ̸= 0. Then yf (0) ranges over all reals as y varies over all reals. Hence, f (0) = f (z) for all z ∈ R. Consequently, f is a constant. If f (x) = c, a constant, then substituting this into the original equation yields c = c + x2, or x2 = 0 for all x ∈ R. This is clearly absurd since x = 1 violates this condition. Therefore, f (0) = 0. (2) Suppose f (z) = 0. We will prove that z = 0. Substituting x = z, y = −z into the original equation yields f (zf (0)) = f (−zf (0)) + z2 = z2. Since f (0) = 0 by (2), 0 = 0 + z2. Therefore, z = 0. We have f (z) = 0 ⇔ z = 0, ∀z ∈ R (3) Since f (0) = 0, substituting y = 0 into the original equation yields f (xf (x)) = x 2, ∀x ∈ R (4) Substituting y = −x yields f (−xf (x)) = −x2, ∀x ∈ R (5) Lemma 1: f is surjective. Proof of Lemma 1: This follows from both (4) and (5). End Proof of Lemma 1 Lemma 2: f is injective. Proof of Lemma 2: Suppose f (z) = f (z + r) for some z, r ∈ R. Substituting x = z, y = r into the original equation yields f (zf (z + r)) = f (rf (z)) + z2. Since f (z) = f (z + r), f (zf (z)) = f (rf (z)) + z2. By (4), f (zf (z)) = z2. Therefore, f (rf (z)) = 0. By (3), rf (z) = 0. Therefore, f (z) = 0 or r = 0. If f (z) = 0, then z = 0, Hence, f (0) = f (0 + r). By (3), r = 0. Hence, in either case, r = 0. Therefore, f is injective. End Proof of Lemma 2 Lemma 3: f (−x) = −f (x), ∀x ∈ R. Proof of Lemma 3: Let z ∈ R. If z = 0, then clearly, f (−z) = −zf (z), since both are equal to 0. Otherwise, suppose z ̸= 0. Substituting x = −z yields f (−zf (−z + y)) = f (yf (−z)) + z2. Since z ̸= 0, f (−z) ̸= 0. Therefore, yf (−z) ranges over all reals as y varies over all reals. Since f is surjective, we can let w ∈ R such that f (wf (−z)) = −z2. Then f (−zf (−z + w)) = 0. Hence, −zf (−z + w) = 0. Since z ̸= 0, f (−z + w) = 0. Hence, w = z. Therefore, by the deﬁnition of w, f (zf (−z)) = −z2. But we also know that f (−zf (z)) = −z2 by (5). Since f is injective, zf (−z) = −zf (z). Since z ̸= 0, f (−z) = −f (z), as desired. □ Since f is surjective, there exist z ∈ R such that f (z) = 1. Then substituting x = z into (4) yields f (z) = z2. Since f (z) = 1, z = ±1. Therefore, by Lemma 3, either (f (1), f (−1)) = (1, −1) or (f (−1), f (1)) = (−1, 1). If f (1) = 1 and f (−1) = −1, then substituting x = 1 yields f (f (y + 1)) = f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R (6) and substituting x = −1 yields f (−f (y − 1)) = f (−y) + 1, or by Lemma 3, −f (f (y − 1)) = −f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. (7) Therefore, −f (f (y + 1)) = −f (y + 2) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. Adding this equation with (6) yields 0 = f (y) − f (y + 2) + 2. Hence, f (y + 2) − f (y) = 2. Similarly, f (y + 4) − f (y + 2) = 2. Therefore, f (y + 4) − f (y) = 4, ∀y ∈ R. (8) Substituting x = 2 into the original equation ﬁelds f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2)) + 4. By (8), we have f (yf (2) + 4) = f (yf (2)) + 4. Therefore, f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2) + 4). Since f is injective, 2f (y + 2) = yf (2) + 4. Hence, f (y) = f (2) 2 (y − 2) + 2. Let c = f (2) 2 . Then f (y) = cy + (2 − 2c). Since y = 0 and f (0) = 0, c = 1. Then f (y) = y, ∀y ∈ R, which can be veriﬁed as a solution to the functional equation. If f (1) = −1 and f (−1) = 1, then substituting x = 1 yields f (f (y + 1)) = f (−y) + 1 = −f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R (9) and substituting x = −1 yields f (−f (y − 1)) = f (y) + 1, or by Lemma 3, −f (f (y − 1)) = f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. (10) Therefore, −f (f (y + 1)) = f (y + 2) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. Adding this equation with (8) yields 0 = −f (y) + f (y + 2) + 2. Hence, f (y) − f (y + 2) = 2. Similarly, f (y + 2) − f (y + 4) = 2. Therefore, f (y) − f (y + 4) = 4, ∀y ∈ R. (11) Substituting x = 2 into the original equation ﬁelds f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2)) + 4. By (8), we have f (yf (2) − 4) = f (yf (2)) + 4. Therefore, f (2f (y + 2)) = f (yf (2) − 4). Since f is injective, 2f (y + 2) = yf (2) − 4. Hence, f (y) = f (2) 2 (y − 2) − 2. Let c = f (2) 2 . Then f (y) = cy − (2 + 2c). Since y = 0 and f (0) = 0, c = −1. Then f (y) = −y, ∀y ∈ R, which can be veriﬁed as a solution to the functional equation. This completes the problem. □ 2010 Mock 3 Time: 4.5 Hours 1. For any n ≥ 2, let N (n) be the maximal number of triples (ai, bi, ci), i = 1, · · · , N (n) consisting of nonnegative integers ai, bi, ci such that the following two conditions are satisﬁed: • ai + bi + ci = n for all i = 1, · · · , N (n) • If i ̸= j, then ai ̸= aj, bi ̸= bj, ci ̸= cj. Determine N (n) for n ≥ 2. Solution: The answer is N (n) = ⌊2n/3⌋ + 1. For brevity, let N = N (n). Note that N∑ i=1 ai, N∑ i=1 bi, N∑ i=1 ci ≥ N (N − 1)/2. Therefore, 3N (N − 1) 2 ≤ n∑ i=1(ai + bi + ci) = N n. Therefore, N ≤ ⌊2n/3⌋ + 1. It remains to construct such triples for each n. We will split this into 3 cases; n ≡ 0 (mod 3), n ≡ 1 (mod 3), n ≡ 2 (mod 3). If n ≡ 0 (mod 3), let n = 3k for some positive integer k. Then N (n) = 2k + 1. The following is a construction of triples satisfying the conditions given in the problem. ai bi ci 2k 0 k 2k − 1 2 k − 1 ... ... ... k 2k 0 k − 1 1 2k k − 2 3 2k − 1 ... ... ... 0 2k − 1 k + 1 If n ≡ 1 (mod 3), let n = 3k + 1 for some positive integer k. Then N (n) = 2k + 1. The following is a construction of triples satisfying the conditions given in the problem. ai bi ci 2k 0 k + 1 2k − 1 2 k ... ... ... k 2k 1 k − 1 1 2k + 1 k − 2 3 2k ... ... ... 0 2k − 1 k + 2 If n ≡ 2 (mod 3), let n = 3k + 2 for some positive integer k. Then N (n) = 2k + 2. The following is a construction of triples satisfying the conditions given in the problem. ai bi ci 2k + 1 0 k + 1 2k 2 k ... ... ... k 2k + 2 0 k − 1 1 2k + 2 k − 2 3 2k + 1 ... ... ... 0 2k − 1 k + 3 This completes the problem. □ 2. Let f : R → R be any function. Prove that there exist x, y ∈ R such that f (x − f (y)) > yf (x) + x. Solution: Suppose no such x, y ∈ R exist. Then f (x − f (y)) ≤ yf (x) + x, ∀x, y ∈ R. (12) Substituting x ← x + f (0) and y = 0 into (12) yields f (x) ≤ x + f (0). (13) Substituting x = f (y) into (12) and using (13) yields f (0) ≤ yf (f (y)) + f (y) ≤ yf (f (y)) + y + f (0). Therefore, f (f (y)) ≥ −1, ∀y > 0. (14) Therefore, for all x, y ∈ R such that x > f (y), we have by (14), (13) and (12), −1 ≤ f (f (x − f (y))) ≤ f (x − f (y)) + f (0) ≤ yf (x) + x + f (0). (15) Suppose there exists x ∈ R such that f (x) > 0. By (13), we have that f (y) approaches −∞ as y approaches −∞. Then we can choose a suﬃciently small y such that f (y) < x and yf (x) + x + f (0) < −1. This contradicts (15). Therefore, f (x) ≤ 0 for all x ∈ R. Suppose there exists a positive real x such that f (x) < 0. Then for all y ∈ R, f (y) ≤ 0 < x. Then by (15), we have −1 ≤ yf (x) + x + f (0). This is not possible if y is suﬃciently large. Therefore, f (x) = 0 for all positive real x. Finally, choose y = 1 and any x < 0. Since f (y) = f (1) = 0, by (12) f (x) ≤ f (x) + x. Then x ≥ 0. This contradicts the choice of x. This solves the problem. □ 3. Let P be a polygon that is convex and symmetric about some point O (i.e. if a point is on the polygon, then its reﬂection in O is also on the polygon). Prove that for some parallelogram R satisfying P ⊂ R we have |R| |P | ≤ √2 where |R| and |P | denote the areas of R and P , respectively. Solution: Let A, B be two vertices of P such that [OAB] is maximum, where [XY Z] denotes the area of XY Z. Let A′, B′ be the reﬂections of A, B across O, respectively. Then A′, B′ are vertices of P , since P is symmetric about O. Let l1, l3 be the lines passing through A, A′ respectively parallel to OB and l2, l4 the lines passing through B, B′ respectively parallel to OA. Let P1 be the parallelogram formed by l1, l2, l3, l4. Clearly, P ⊆ P1, since [OAB] has maximum area. Note that A, B, A′, B′ are midpoints of the sides of P1. Therefore, ABA′B′ is a parallelogram. Let P2 be this parallelogram. Then |P1| = 2|P2|. Note that P2 ⊆ P . Let P3 be the smallest parallelogram whose sides are parallel to that of P2 such that P ⊆ P3. Note that each side of P3 contains a vertex of P . Let X be a point on the side of P3 “closest” to AB which is on P . Let X ′ be the image of the reﬂection of X about O. Note that X ′ is on the side of P3 closest to A′B′ which is on P . Let Y be a point on the side of P3 closest to BA′ which is on P . Let Y ′ be the image of the reﬂection of Y about O. Let x be the ratio of the distance from X to AB to the distance from O to AB. Let y be the ratio of the distance from Y to BA′ to the distance from O to BA′. Note that the polygon AXBY A′X ′B′Y ′ is contained in P , since P is convex. By symmetry, we have [AXBY A ′X ′B′Y ′] = 2[OAXB] + 2[OBY A′] = 2(1 + x) |P2| 4 + 2(1 + y) |P2| 4 = (1 + x) |P2| 2 + (1 + y) |P2| 2 = |P2| 2 (2 + x + y). Hence, |P2| 2 (2 + x + y) ≤ |P |. Also, note that |P3| = (1 + x)(1 + y)|P2| ≤ 2(1 + x)(1 + y) 2 + x + y |P | Therefore, |P2| |P | ≤ 2 2 + x + y ⇒ |P1| |P | ≤ 4 2 + x + y If 2 + x + y ≥ 2√2, then |P1| |P | ≤ 4 2+x+y ≤ √2. Therefore, P1 satisﬁes the desired conditions. Otherwise, we may assume that 2 + x + y < 2 √2. Let a = 1 + x, b = 1 + y. Therefore, |P3| |P | ≤ 2ab a+b ≤ (a+b)2 2(a+b) = a+b 2 < √2. Thus, P3 satisﬁes the desired conditions. We are done. □ 2010 Mock 4 Time: 4.5 Hours 1. Find the largest possible integer k, such that the following statement is true: Let 2009 arbitrary non-degenerated triangles be given. In every triangle the three sides are colored, such that one is blue, one is red and one is white. Now, for every color separately, let us sort the lengths of the sides. We obtain b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ b2009 the lengths of the blue sides r1 ≤ r2 ≤ · · · ≤ r2009 the lengths of the red sides and w1 ≤ w2 ≤ · · · ≤ w2009 the lengths of the white sides. Then there exist k indices j such that we can form a non-degenerated triangle with side lengths bj, rj, wj. Solution: The answer is k = 1. We ﬁrst prove that k > 0. Suppose k = 0. Then WLOG, suppose b2009 ≤ r2009 ≤ w2009. Since k = 0, these three numbers do not form the sides of a non-dengerate triangle. Therefore, b2009 + r2009 ≤ w2009. Since bi ≤ b2009 and rj ≤ r2009 for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , 2009}, bi + rj ≤ w2009 for all i, j ∈ {1, · · · , 2009}. Therefore, w2009 cannot be the side length of any of the 2009 tri- angles. This is a contradiction. Therefore, k ≥ 1. The following is an example for which k = 1. For i ∈ {1, · · · , 2008}, let bi = i, ri = 2i, wi = 3i. Let b2009 = 2009, r2009 = 2008 · 3, w2009 = 2008 · 3. Then for all i ∈ {2, · · · , 2009}, it is easy to verify that (bi, ri−1, wi−1) form the sides of a trian- gle, since bi = i, ri−1 = 2i − 2 and wi−1 = 3i − 3 and i + (2i − 2) > 3i − 3, and (b1, r2009, w2009) form the sides of a triangle, since 1, a, a are the sides of a triangle for any positive integer a. □ 2. Given a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, let the diagonals AC and BD meet at E and the lines AD and BC meet at F . The midpoints of AB and CD are G and H, respectively. Show that EF is tangent at E to the circle through the points E, G and H. Solution: WLOG, suppose A, B are closer to F than D, C, respectively. By tangency prop- erties, it suﬃces to show that ∠F EG = ∠GHE. Note that ∆F CD ∼ ∆F AB. Let r be the ratio of similarity of ∆F CD to ∆F AB. Let ϕ map the plane to itself by reﬂecting a point about the angle bisector of ∠AF B and dilating the result by a ratio of r. We note the following properties of ϕ: • Since reﬂection and dilation preserves the collinearity of any three points, ϕ preserves the collinearity of any three collinear points. • ϕ(A) = C, ϕ(B) = D and ϕ(G) = H by the similarity of ∆F AB and ∆F CD. Let C′ = ϕ(C) and D′ = ϕ(D). Then by the similarity, C′ lies on line AD and C′C||BD. Similarly, D′ lies on BC and DD′||AC. Let E′ = CC′ ∩ DD′. Since ϕ preserves collinear- ity and (A, E, C) is a triple of collinear points, (ϕ(A), ϕ(E), ϕ(C)) = (C, ϕ(E), C′) is a triple of collinear points. Similarly, (D, ϕ(E), D′) is a triple of collinear points. Hence, ϕ(E) = CC′ ∩ DD′ = E′. Note that EDE′C is a parallelogram. Since H is the midpoint of CD, EH = HE′ and E, H, E′ are collinear. Since ϕ preserves angles, ∠F EG = ∠F E′H. We want to show this angle is equal to ∠GHE to solve the problem; i.e. GH||F E′. Let E′′ = ϕ(E′) and H ′ = ϕ(H). Then by similarity, H ′ is the midpoint of C′D′. Using the same argument as before, we have E′H ′ = H ′E′′ and E′, H ′, E′′ are collinear. Therefore, EE′′||HH ′. Note that ϕ(ϕ()) is a dilation about F . Therefore, F, E, E′′ are collinear. There- fore, F E||HH ′. Since ϕ preserves parallel lines, F E′||H ′ϕ(H ′). But since ϕ(ϕ()) is a dilation, GH||ϕ(ϕ(G))ϕ(ϕ(H)) = H ′ϕ(H ′). Hence, F E′||GH, as desired. □ 3. There exists a sequence of positive integers a1, a2, · · · , an satisfying ak+1 = a2 k + 1 ak−1 + 1 − 1 for every k with 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Prove that n ≤ 4. Solution: Rewrite the equation as (ak+1 + 1)(ak−1 + 1) = a 2 k + 1. Since n ≥ 5, (1) (a3 + 1)(a1 + 1) = a2 2 + 1. (2) (a4 + 1)(a2 + 1) = a2 3 + 1. (3) (a5 + 1)(a3 + 1) = a2 4 + 1. We claim that each of a1, a2, a3, a4, a5 are even. If a1 is odd, then by (1), a2 is odd. Then by (2), a3 is odd. Since a1 and a3 are both odd, in (1), a2 2 + 1 is divisible by 4. This is impossible since no integer of the form a2 + 1 is divisible by 4. Therefore, a1 is even. If a2 is odd, then similarly, a3 and a4 are odd. Sine a2 and a4 are both odd, in (2), a2 3 + 1 is divisible by 4. This is again impossible. Therefore, a2 is even. If a3 is odd, then by (1), a2 is odd and by (3), a4 is odd. Again, a2 3 + 1 is divisible by 4, which is a contradiction. If a4 is odd, then by (2), a3 is odd. By (1), a2 is odd. Again, a2, a4 cannot both be odd. If a5 is odd, then a4 is odd, whose case has already been handled. Therefore, each of a1, · · · , a5 are even. By (1) and (2), a3 + 1|a2 2 + 1 and a2 + 1|a2 3 + 1. It suﬃces to show that there are no pairs of even positive integers x, y such that x + 1|y2 + 1, y + 1|x2 + 1. Suppoe on the contrary that there exist a pair of even numbers (x, y) such that x + 1|y2 + 1 and y + 1|x2 + 1. Without loss of generality, suppose x, y are chosen minimally and x ≥ y. If x = y, then x + 1|x2 + 1, which implies that x + 1|2 ⇒ x = 1. This contradicts x being even. Therefore, x > y. The conditions on x, y implies that x + 1|(y2 + 1) + (x2 − 1) = x2 + y2. Similarly, y + 1|x2 + y2. I claim that gcd(x + 1, y + 1) = 1. Let d = gcd(x + 1, y + 1). Then x, y ≡ −1 (mod d). Hence, x2 + y2 ≡ 2 (mod d). Since d|x + 1, d|x2 + y2. Hence, x2 + y2 ≡ 0 (mod d). This implies that 0 ≡ 2 (mod d). Therefore, d = 1 or d = 2. But d ̸= 2 since x is even and d|x + 1. Therefore, d = 1. Since x + 1|x2 + y2 and y + 1|x2 + y2 and gcd(x + 1, y + 1) = 1, (x + 1)(y + 1)|x2 + y2. Let x2 + y2 (x + 1)(y + 1) = k. (16) for some positive integer k. This can be rewritten as x2 − k(y + 1)x + (y2 − k(y + 1)) = 0. Let x′ be the second root of t2 − k(y + 1)t + (y2 − k(y + 1)) = 0, other than x. Note that x′ is an integer, since x is an integer and x + x′ = k(y + 1). Note that k(y + 1) = x2 + y2 x + 1 = x + y2 − x x + 1 . If x < y2, then since x + x′ = k(y + 1) = x + y2−x x+1 , x′ > 0. Since xx′ = (y2 − k(y + 1)) and x > y, x′ < y < x. Hence, x′ < x. We conclude that (x′, y) is a smaller solution to (16), contradicting the minimality of (x, y). If x > y2, then since x + 1|y2 + 1, x + 1 ≤ y2 + 1. Hence, y2 + 1 < x + 1 ≤ y2 + 1. This is a contradiction. Finally, if x = y2, then since y + 1|x2 + 1, y + 1|y4 + 1. Since y + 1|y4 − 1, y + 1|2. This implies that y = 1. This contradicts that y is even. Therefore, there are no even numbers x, y such that x + 1|y2 + 1 and y + 1|x2 + 1. Hence, n ̸≥ 5. □ 2010 Mock 5 Time: 4.5 Hours 1. Let O be the centre of the excircle of ∆ABC opposite A. Let M be the midpoint of AC, and P the intersection of M O and BC. Prove that if ∠BAC = 2∠ACB, then AB = BP . Solution 1: Let ∠ACB = θ. Then ∠BAC = 2θ and ∠ABC = 180 − 3θ. Note that O lies on the angle bisector of ∠BAC. Therefore, ∠BAO = θ. Let D be the intersection of AO and BC. To prove that BA = BP , it suﬃces to show that ∠BAP = 3θ/2, i.e. ∠DAP = ∠P AC = θ/2 ⇔ AP bisects ∠DAC ⇔ AD/AC = DP/P C. By Sine Law, we have AD AC = sin θ sin 2θ . Since M, P, O are collinear, by Menelaos Theorem on ∆ADC, AO OD · DP P C · CM M A = 1. Since CM = M A, DP P C = OD OA . Let r be the radius of the excircle of ∆ABC opposite A. Note ∠CDO = ∠BDA = 180 − ∠ABC − ∠BAO = 2θ. Let X, Y be the foot of the perpendicular from O on BC, AC, respectively. Since OX = r, OD = r sin ∠CDO = r sin 2θ . Furthermore, OA = r sin ∠CAO = r sin θ . Hence, DP P C = OA OD = sin θ sin 2θ . By looking at triangle ADC, by Sine Law, AD AC = sin ∠ACD sin ∠ADC = sin ∠ACD sin(180 − ADC) = sin θ sin 2θ = DP P C , as desired. □ Solution 2: Let AO and BC intersect at D. Since AO bisects ∠BAC and ∠BAC = 2∠ACB, ∠BAD = ∠CAD = ∠ACD. Therefore, AD = DC. Consider the triangles OAC and ODC. Since they have equal altitudes from O and the same altitude from C, [OAC] [ODC] = AC DC = AO DO . Since M is the midpoint of AC, [OAM ] = [OCM ] and [P AM ] = [P CM ]. Therefore, [OAP ] = [OCP ]. Then, AC AD = AC DC = AO DO = [OAP ] [ODP ] = [OCP ] [ODP ] = CP DP . Therefore, AP is the bisector of ∠DAC. It follows that ∠BAP = ∠BAD + ∠DAP = ∠ACP + ∠P AC = ∠AP B. Therefore, AB = BP , as desired. □ 2. Let f be a non-constant function from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers such that a − b divides f (a) − f (b) for all distinct positive integers a, b. Prove that there exist inﬁnitely many primes p such that p divides f (c) for some positive integer c. Solution: Suppose the conclusion of the problem statement is false. Then there exist a ﬁnitely number of primes p1, · · · , pt such that the prime divisors of f (n) is a subset of {p1, · · · , pt} for every n ∈ N First, I claim that there exists a positive integer N such that m ≥ N implies f (m) ̸= f (1). Suppose the contrary; i.e. there are inﬁnitely many positive integers m such that f (m) = f (1). Let k be the smallest positive integer such that f (k) ̸= f (1). Such a positive integer exist since f is a non-constant function. Let d = |f (k) − f (1)|. If f (m) = f (1) for some m > k + d. Then m − k | |f (m) − f (k)| = |f (1) − f (k)| = d ̸= 0 and m − k > d. This is a contradiction. Let f (1) = pa1 1 · · · p at t for some non-negative integers a1, · · · , at. Note that pm 1 pm 2 · · · pm t di- vides f (pm 1 · · · pm t + 1) − f (1). Consider this statement when m > max{a1, · · · , at}. Then p ai i ||f (pm 1 · · · pm t +1) for all such m. This implies that f (pm 1 · · · pm t +1) = pa1 1 · · · pat t = f (1), since the only possible prime divisors of f (pm 1 · · · pm t + 1). But by our claim, f (pm 1 · · · pm t + 1) > f (1) when m gets suﬃciently large. This is a contradiction. Hence, there are indeed inﬁnitely many primes p such that p divides f (c) for some positive integer c. □ 3. A multiple choice contest with n questions was written by K students. The jury assigns the diﬃculty to each question - a positive integer which is awarded to each student who solves the question. If a student does not solve the question, the student gets 0 points. The student’s score is the sum of the scores received for each question. It turns out that when the answer sheets are submitted, the jury can assign the diﬃculty of each question in a way so that the ranks of the students are in any pre-determined order. What is the maximum possible value of K? Solution: The maximum value of K is n. Label the students S1, · · · , Sn. An example of n students where the rank of the students can be pre-determined is by having each student solve a unique question Qi. If the ranking order is S1, · · · , Sn, then assign problem Qi a score of n + 1 − i for each i ∈ {1, · · · , n}. Assume the result holds for K ≥ n + 1. Take n + 1 diﬀerent students, and clone each of them inﬁnitely many times so that we get n + 1 types of students. Let us show that if we can ﬁnd two non-identical teams with ﬁnitely many students but with the same results, i.e. for every question, the number of students on each team who solved the question is the same, we arrive at a contradiction. We can assume every type of students is present on at most one team (otherwise keep remov- ing 1 student of the same type from both teams until this is no longer possible). Without loss of generality, the ﬁrst team has at least as many students as the second. The sum of the scores of each of the two teams are the same. Then it is impossible to assign the diﬃculty of questions so that each student on the ﬁrst team is ranked higher than each student on the second team. It remains to ﬁnd the two teams. We will suppose that it is possible and construct a system of n linear equations on n + 1 variables. The non-zero solution of this system will correspond to the assignment of the teams. For j = 1, 2, · · · , n + 1, if the contestants that solved problem j are on team 1, then let xj be the number of such contestants. If the contestants that solved problem j are on team 2, then let xj be the negative number of such contestants. For i = 1, 2, · · · , n let equation i state that the diﬀerence between the number of contestants on the two teams who solved question i is 0; this is an equation involving only variables x1, x2, · · · , xn+1. We get a homogenous system of n equations and n + 1 unknowns. It has a non-zero solution; it must be rational since all the coeﬃcients in the equation are rational numbers (namely, 0 or 1). Multiplying it by an appropriate constant still gives a solution which contains only integers. This gives us the two teams.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
