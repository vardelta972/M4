Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Determine all composite positive integers n for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of n that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. 2. Prove that the system of equations x 6 + x3 + x3y + y = 147157 x3 + x3y + y2 + y + z9 = 157147 has no integer solutions. 3. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle, and let P and Q be two points on side BC. Construct a point C1 in such a way that the convex quadrilateral AP BC1 is cyclic, QC1 ∥ CA, and C1 and Q lie on opposite sides of line AB. Construct a point B1 in such a way that the convex quadrilateral AP CB1 is cyclic, QB1 ∥ BA, and B1 and Q lie on opposite sides of line AC. Prove that the points B1, C1, P , and Q lie on a circle. 4. Legs L1, L2, L3, L4 of a square table each have length n, where n is a positive integer. For how many ordered 4-tuples (k1, k2, k3, k4) of nonnegative integers can we cut a piece of length ki from the end of leg Li and still have a stable table? (The table is stable if it can be placed so that all four of the leg ends touch the floor. Note that a cut leg of length 0 is permitted.) 5. Let n > 1 be an integer. Suppose 2n points are given in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Suppose n of the given 2n points are colored blue and the other n colored red. A line in the plane is called a balancing line if it passes through one blue and one red point and, for each side of the line, the number of blue points on that side is equal to the number of red points on the same side. Prove that there exist at least two balancing lines. 6. For a positive integer m, let s(m) denote the sum of the decimal digits of m. A set S positive integers is k-stable if s( ∑ x∈X x) = k for any nonempty subset X ⊆ S. For each integer n ≥ 2 let f (n) be the minimal k for which there exists a k-stable set with n integers. Prove that there are constants 0 < C1 < C2 with C1 log10 n ≤ f (n) ≤ C2 log10 n. 2 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1 Solutions to Day 1 §1.1 USAMO 2005/1, proposed by Zuming Feng Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213007. Problem statement Determine all composite positive integers n for which it is possible to arrange all divisors of n that are greater than 1 in a circle so that no two adjacent divisors are relatively prime. The only bad ones are n = pq, products of two distinct primes. Clearly they can’t be so arranged, so we show all others work. • If n is a power of a prime, the result is obvious. • If n = pe1 1 . . . pek k for some k ≥ 3, then first situate p1p2, p2p3, . . . , pkp1 on the circle. Then we can arbitrarily place any multiples of pi between pi−1pi and pipi+1. This finishes this case. • Finally suppose n = paqb. If a > 1, say, we can repeat the argument by first placing pq and p2q and then placing multiples of p in one arc and multiples of q in the other arc. On the other hand the case a = b = 1 is seen to be impossible. 3 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2005/2, proposed by Răzvan Gelca Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213009. Problem statement Prove that the system of equations x6 + x3 + x3y + y = 147157 x 3 + x3y + y2 + y + z9 = 157147 has no integer solutions. Sum the equations and add 1 to both sides to get (x3 + y + 1)2 + z9 = 147157 + 157147 + 1 ≡ 14 (mod 19) But a2 + b9 ̸≡ 14 (mod 19) for any integers a and b, since the ninth powers modulo 19 are 0, ±1 and none of {13, 14, 15} are squares modulo 19. Therefore, there are no integer solutions. Remark. In fact, a 2 + b 3 ̸≡ 14 (mod 19) has no solutions modulo 19 either. Remark. It can also be checked that the original system has no equations modulo 13. (As in the modulo 19 situation, z9 may be replaced by z3 and this remark still holds.) 4 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2005/3, proposed by Zuming Feng Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213011. Problem statement Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle, and let P and Q be two points on side BC. Construct a point C1 in such a way that the convex quadrilateral AP BC1 is cyclic, QC1 ∥ CA, and C1 and Q lie on opposite sides of line AB. Construct a point B1 in such a way that the convex quadrilateral AP CB1 is cyclic, QB1 ∥ BA, and B1 and Q lie on opposite sides of line AC. Prove that the points B1, C1, P , and Q lie on a circle. It is enough to prove that A, B1, and C1 are collinear, since then ∡C1QP = ∡ACP = ∡AB1P = ∡C1B1P . A B CP B1 Q C1 ¶ First solution Let T be the second intersection of AC1 with (AP C). Then readily △P C1T ∼ △ABC. Consequently, QC1 ∥ AC implies T C1QP cyclic. Finally, T Q ∥ AB now follows from the cyclic condition, so T = B1 as desired. ¶ Second solution One may also use barycentric coordinates. Let P = (0, m, n) and Q = (0, r, s) with m + n = r + s = 1. Once again, (AP B) : −a2yz − b 2zx − c 2xy + (x + y + z)(a2m · z) = 0. Set C1 = (s − z, r, z), where C1Q ∥ AC follows by (s − z) + r + z = 1. We solve for this z. 0 = −a2rz + (s − z)(−b 2z − c 2r) + a2mz = b 2z2 + (−sb2 + rc2)z − a2rz + a 2mz − c 2rs = b 2z2 + (−sb2 + rc2 + a 2(m − r))z − c 2rs =⇒ 0 = rb2 ( z r )2 + (−sb 2 + rc2 + a 2(m − r)) ( z r ) − c 2s. So the quotient of the z and y coordinates of C1 satisfies this quadratic. Similarly, if B1 = (r − y, y, s) we obtain that 0 = sc 2 ( y s )2 + (−rc2 + sb2 + a2(n − s)) ( y s ) − b 2r 5 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Since these two quadratics are the same when one is written backwards (and negated), it follows that their roots are reciprocals. But the roots of the quadratics represent z y and y z for the points C1 and B1, respectively. This implies (with some configuration blah) that the points B1 and C1 are collinear with A = (1, 0, 0) (in some line of the form y z = k), as desired. 6 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2005/4, proposed by Elgin Johnston Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213012. Problem statement Legs L1, L2, L3, L4 of a square table each have length n, where n is a positive integer. For how many ordered 4-tuples (k1, k2, k3, k4) of nonnegative integers can we cut a piece of length ki from the end of leg Li and still have a stable table? (The table is stable if it can be placed so that all four of the leg ends touch the floor. Note that a cut leg of length 0 is permitted.) Flip the table upside-down so that that the table’s surface rests on the floor. Then, we see that we want the truncated legs to have endpoints A, B, C, D which are coplanar (say). Claim — This occurs if and only if ABCD is a parallelogram. Proof. Obviously ABCD being a parallelogram is sufficient. Conversely, if they are coplanar, we let D′ be such that ABCD′ is a parallelogram. Then D′ also lies in the same plane as ABCD, but is situated directly above D (since the table was a square). This implies D′ = D, as needed. In still other words, we are counting the number of solutions to (n − k1) + (n − k3) = (n − k2) + (n − k4) ⇐⇒ k1 + k3 = k2 + k4. Define ar = #{(a, b) | a + b = r, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ n} so that the number of solutions to k1 + k3 = k2 + k4 = r is just given by a2 r. We now just compute 2n∑ r=0 a 2 r = 12 + 22 + · · · + n2 + (n + 1)2 + n2 + · · · + 12 = 1 3 (n + 1)(2n2 + 4n + 3). 7 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2005/5, proposed by Kiran Kedlaya Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213018. Problem statement Let n > 1 be an integer. Suppose 2n points are given in the plane, no three of which are collinear. Suppose n of the given 2n points are colored blue and the other n colored red. A line in the plane is called a balancing line if it passes through one blue and one red point and, for each side of the line, the number of blue points on that side is equal to the number of red points on the same side. Prove that there exist at least two balancing lines. Consider the convex hull H of the polygon. There are two cases. The easy case: if the convex hull H is not all the same color, there exist two edges of H (at least) which have differently colored endpoints. The extensions of those sides form balancing lines; indeed given any such line ℓ one side of ℓ has no points, the other has n − 1 red and n − 1 blue points. So now assume H is all blue (WLOG). We will prove there are at least |H| balancing lines in the following way. Claim — For any vertex B of H there is a balancing line through it. Proof. Assume A, B, C are three consecutive blue vertices of H. Imagine starting with line ℓ passing through B and A, then rotating it through B until it coincides with line BC, through the polygon. H B A C ℓ During this process, we consider the set of points on the same side of ℓ as C, and let x be the number of such red points minus the number of such blue points. Note that: • Every time ℓ touches a blue point, x increases by 1. • Every time ℓ touches a red point, x decreases by 1. • Initially, x = +1. • Just before reaching the end we have x = −1. So at the moment where x first equals zero, we have found our balancing line. 8 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2005/6, proposed by Titu Andreescu, Gabriel Dospinescu Available online at https://aops.com/community/p213014. Problem statement For a positive integer m, let s(m) denote the sum of the decimal digits of m. A set S positive integers is k-stable if s( ∑ x∈X x) = k for any nonempty subset X ⊆ S. For each integer n ≥ 2 let f (n) be the minimal k for which there exists a k-stable set with n integers. Prove that there are constants 0 < C1 < C2 with C1 log10 n ≤ f (n) ≤ C2 log10 n. Lower bound: Let n ≥ 1 and e ≥ 1 be integers satisfying 1 + 2 + · · · + n < 10e. Consider the set S = {10 e − 1, 2(10e − 1), . . . , n(10e − 1)} . For example, if n = 6 and e = 3, we have S = {999, 1998, 2997, 3996, 4995, 5994}. The set S here is easily seen to be 9e-stable. Thus f (n) ≥ 9 ⌈log10 n⌉, proving one direction. Remark. I think the problem is actually more natural with a multiset S rather than a vanilla set, in which case S = {10e − 1, 10 e − 1, . . . , 10e − 1} works fine, and is easier to think of. In some sense the actual construction is obtained by starting with this one, and then pushing together the terms together in order to get the terms to be distinct, hence the 1 + 2 + · · · + n appearance. Upper bound: we are going to prove the following, which obviously sufficient. Claim — Let r be a positive integer. In any (multi)set S of more than 12k integers, there exists a subset whose sum of decimal digits exceeds k. Proof. Imagine writing entries of S on a blackboard, while keeping a running sum Σ initially set to zero. For i = 1, 2, . . . we will have a process such that at the end of the ith step all entries on the board are divisible by 10i. It goes as follows: • If the ith digit from the right of Σ is nonzero, then arbitrarily partition the numbers on the board into groups of 10, erasing any leftover numbers. Within each group of 10, we can find a nonempty subset with sum 0 mod 10i; we then erase each group and replace it with that sum. • If the ith digit from the right of Σ is zero, but some entry on the board is not divisible by 10i, then we erase that entry and add it to Σ. Then we do the grouping as in the previous step. • If the ith digit from the right of Σ is zero, and all entries on the board are divisible by 10i, we do nothing and move on to the next step. This process ends when no numbers remain on the blackboard. The first and second cases occur at least k + 1 times (the number of entries decreases by a factor of at most 12 each step), and each time Σ gets some nonzero digit, which is never changed at later steps. Therefore Σ has sum of digits at least k + 1 as needed. 9 USAMO 2005 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Remark. The official solutions contain a slicker proof: it turns out that any multiple of 10 e − 1 has sum of decimal digits at least 9e. However, if one does not know this lemma it seems nontrivial to imagine coming up with it. 10","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
