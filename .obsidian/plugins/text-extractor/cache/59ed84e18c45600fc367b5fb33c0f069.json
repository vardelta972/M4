(Proposed by Mohammad Jafari) 18 102) The plain and desert which compete for breathing play the following game : The desert choses 3 arbitrary numbers and the plain choses them as he wants as the coefficients of the polynomial ((… 𝑥2+ ⋯ 𝑥 + ⋯ )).If the two roots of this polynomial are irrational, then the desert would be the winner, else the plain is the winner. Which one has the win strategy? (Proposed by Mohammad Jafari) 103) The two polynomials 𝑝(𝑥) and 𝑞(𝑥) have an amount in the interval [𝑛 − 1, 𝑛] (𝑛 ∈ ℕ) for𝑥 ∈ [0,1].If 𝑝 is non-increasing such that:𝑝�𝑞(𝑛𝑥)� = 𝑛𝑞(𝑝(𝑥)) ,prove that there is 𝑥0∈ [0,1] such that 𝑞(𝑝(𝑥0) = 𝑥0.
