If the inequality holds in the reverse direction, f is concave. Many criteria exist for proving convexity. Graphically, f is convex iﬀ the set of points {(x, y) ∈ [a, b] × R|y ≥ f (x)} is convex (the line segment joining any points of the set lies entirely within the set). If f is continuous, then it suﬃces to check the statement for λ = 1 2 (or any other ﬁxed 0 < λ < 1). (Conversely, if f is convex on I, then f is continuous except possibly at the endpoints of I.) If f is continuous on [a, b] and twice diﬀerentiable on (a, b), then it suﬃces to check that f ′′(x) ≥ 0 for x ∈ (a, b). There are many useful convex and concave functions. For example, e x is a convex function of x, as is x c for c ≥ 1 or c < 0. Common concave functions include ln(x) and x c for 0 < c ≤ 1. Deﬁnition 2 Let x, y ∈ Rn be two vectors of real numbers, and suppose that x1 ≥ · · · ≥ xn and y1 ≥ · · · ≥ yn are their components in decreasing order. Then x majorizes y, denoted x ≻ y, if x1 + · · · + xi ≥ y1 + · · · + yi for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, and x1 + · · · + xn = y1 + · · · + yn. Equality of the full sums is an important requirement in majorization. Theorem 1 (Karamata) Let f be a convex function on an interval I and suppose that the reals x1, . . . , xn ∈ I majorize the reals y1, . . . , yn ∈ I. Then f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + · · · + f (yn) Theorem 2 (Jensen) Let f be a convex function on an interval I. Then for any reals x1, . . . , xn ∈ I, f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f ( x1 + · · · + xn n ) . If f is concave, then the inequality is ﬂipped. Theorem 3 (AM-GM) Let a1, . . . , an be positive reals. Then a1 + · · · + an ≥ n n√a1 · · · an. Theorem 4 (H¨older) Let a1, . . . , an; b1, . . . , bn; · · · ; z1, . . . , zn be sequences of nonnegative real numbers, and let λa, λb, . . . , λz positive reals which sum to 1. Then (a1 + · · · + an) λa (b1 + · · · + bn) λb · · · (z1 + · · · + zn) λz ≥ a λa 1 bλb 1 · · · zλz 1 + · · · + a λz n bλb n · · · zλz n Cauchy’s inequality is a special case of H¨older’s inequality where λa = λb = 1/2. 1 Theorem 5 (Power Mean) Let r and s be nonzero-real numbers with r > s. Then for positive reals a1, . . . , an, ( a r 1 + · · · + a r n n ) 1 r ≥ ( a s 1 + · · · + a s n n ) 1 s . Moreover, if we interpret the 0th power-mean as the geometric mean, the statement is valid for all reals r and s. Observe that the famous AM-GM-HM inequality is a special case of the power-mean inequality. Theorem 6 (Rearrangement) Let a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn be two nonincreasing sequences of real numbers. Then, for any permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n}, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a1bπ(1) + a2bπ(2) + · · · + anbπ(n) ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1. Theorem 7 (Chebyshev) Let a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an; b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn be two nonincreasing sequences of real numbers. Then a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn n ≥ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n · b1 + b2 + · · · + bn n ≥ a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 n Theorem 8 (Schur) Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals and r > 0. Then a r(a − b)(a − c) + br(b − c)(b − a) + c r(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if a = b = c or some two of a, b, c are equal and the other is 0. There exist weighted forms of Jensen, AM-GM, and power-mean. We suggest a program for deducing them here, but the details are left as an exercise to the reader. First, obtain integer-weighted forms by setting diﬀerent combinations of variables equal to one another. Then show that rationally-weighted forms are implied by the integer-weighted forms. Finally, argue by continuity that the weights can be arbitrary reals. 1 Dumbassing: Expansion, AM-GM, and Schur Dumbassing almost always provides a way to solve homogenous, symmetric inequalities of rational functions. By multiplying by the least common denominator of the fractions at hand one obtains symmetric polynomial inequality, which is then veriﬁed by AM-GM (eﬀectively Muirhead’s inequality) and Schur’s inequality. Situations where it is less likely to be successful include instances of nontrivial equality cases, especially sharp inequalities. Because Olympiad problems are intended to be clever, they usually have nice solutions. As its colloquial name suggests, dumbassing isn’t clever. Rather, it replaces the need for cleverness with sheer calculation. At the 2005 IMO, ﬁve members of the USA team solved problem #3, a three variable symmetric inequality of rational functions, more than any other country. Four of those ﬁve solvers used dumbassing. Dissatisfaction with the problem has presumably caused such inequalities to fall out of favor at the IMO. However, when working problems of any type, one should ﬁrst look for easy solutions. For inequalities, this technique should always be considered, though not necessarily executed. It has the noteworthy advantages of taking a relatively predictable amount of time to execute and no chance of falsifying an inequality. (Iran 1996) Show that for all positive reals a, b, c, (ab + bc + ca) ( 1 (a + b)2 + 1 (b + c)2 + 1 (c + a)2 ) ≥ 9 4 Solution. Clear the denominators. On the left we obtain ∑ cyc 4(a + b) 2(a + c) 2(ab + bc + ca) 2 = 4 ∑ cyc (a 2 + 2ab + b2)(a 2 + 2ac + c 2)(ab + bc + ca) = 4 ∑ cyc (a 4 + 2a 3b + a 2b2 + 2a 3c + 4a 2bc + 2ab 2c + a 2c 2 + 2abc 2 + b2c 2)(ab + bc + ca) = 4 ∑ cyc [(a 5b + 2a 4b2 + a 3b3 + 2a 4bc + 4a 3b2c + 2a 2b3c + a 3bc 2 + 2a 2b2c 2 + ab 3c 2) + (a 4bc + 2a 3b2c + a 2b3c + 2a 3bc 2 + 4a 2b2c 2 + 2ab 3c 2 + a 2bc 3 + 2ab 2c 3 + b3c 3) + (a 5c + 2a 4bc + a 3b2c + 2a 4c 2 + 4a 3bc 2 + 2a 2b2c 2 + a 3c 3 + 2a 2bc 3 + ab 2c 3)] = ∑ sym 4a 5b + 8a 4b2 + 10a 4bc + 6a 3b3 + 52a 3b2c + 16a 2b2c 2, and on the right we obtain 9(a + b) 2(b + c) 2(c + a) 2 = 9 ( 2abc + ∑ sym a 2b )2 = 9 ( 4a 2b2c 2 + ∑ sym [ 4a 3b2c + a 2b(a 2b + a 2c + ab 2 + b2c + ac 2 + bc 2) ] ) = 9 ( 4a 2b2c 2 + ∑ sym [ 4a 3b2c + a 4b2 + a 4bc + a 3b3 + a 2b3c + a 3bc 2 + a 2b2c 2] ) = ∑ sym 9a 4b2 + 9a 4bc + 9a 3b3 + 54a 3b2c + 15a 2b2c 2 The desired is LHS − RHS = ∑ sym 4a 5b − a 4b2 + a 4bc − 3a 3b3 − 2a 3b2c + a 2b2c 2 ≥ 0 This is true since ∑ sym 4a 5b − a 4b2 − 3a 3b3 ≥ 0 ∑ sym a 4bc − 2a 3b2c + a 2b2c 2 = abc ∑ sym (a 3 − a 2b + abc ) ≥ 0, by Muirhead and Schur’s inequality, respectively. □ Various shorthands exist to expedite the expansion process, but to avoid digression, we don’t elaborate on them here. 2 H¨older H¨older is most useful in inequalities that suggest a factored form. It is also more practical than AM-GM in problems with only cyclic symmetry. Furthermore, applied globally, H¨older is sharper than AM-GM, which is evident upon noting that nontrivial equality cases involving 0 are possible by design. The intended solution for IMO 2005 problem #3 involved Cauchy. Sometimes the required factorization is introduced by simply multiplying it into both sides of the given inequality. In this case, a good way to detect the required factor or factors is to plug in an arbitrary weights and inspect the outcome for nice possibilities. Another idea is to apply Cauchy locally by applying it to squares expanded under an artiﬁcial square root, as is the case in our example. 3 (Gabriel Dospinescu) Show that for all positive reals a, b, c, x, y, z such that xy + yz + zx = 3, a(y + z) b + c + b(z + x) c + a + c(x + y) a + b ≥ 3 Solution. The desired is equivalent to (x + y + z) ( a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ) ≥ 3 + ∑ cyc{a,x} ax b + c Cauchy’s inequality now gives (x + y + z) ( a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ) = v u u √ ( [2(xy + yz + zx)] + ∑ cyc x2) ([ 2 ∑ cyc ab (c + a)(c + b) ] + ∑ cyc a2 (b + c)2 ) ≥ v u u √[2(xy + yz + zx)] [ 2 ∑ cyc ab (c + a)(c + b) ] + ∑ cyc{a,x} ax b + c Since xy + yz + zx = 3, we need only show ∑ cyc ab (c + a)(c + b) ≥ 3 4 This is easy, since after clearing denominators we are left with ∑ sym 4a 2b ≥ ∑ sym 3a 2b + abc, which is evident by AM-GM. □ 3 Jensen/Karamata (Majorization) Jensen and Karamata are the basis of most smoothing type solutions. This is because they oﬀer a convenient way of rigorously expressing that we can move variables together or apart. Because they depend only on convex and concave functions, they constitute a particularly natural vehicle for solving inequalities with trigonometry or radicals. Also like Cauchy and Holder, these smoothing inequalities are able to handle equality cases involving zero. (What happens if one of the weights is 0?) A good general strategy is to plug arbitrary weights into Jensen and inspect for nice choices. Our example shows how Jensen applied to a radical can actually force a cyclic inequality into a fully symmetric form. (Mock IMO 2005) a, b, c are positive reals. Show that a √2a2 + 2b2 + b √2b2 + 2c2 + c √2c2 + 2a2 ≤ 3 2 Solution. Let f be the concave function f (x) = √x. Jensen’s inequality now gives ∑ cyc a √2a2 + 2b2 = ∑ cyc (2a 2 + 2c 2)f ( a 2 (2a2 + 2c2)2(2a2 + 2b2) ) ≤ [∑ cyc (2a 2 + 2c 2) ] f   ∑ cyc a 2 (2a2+2c2)(2a2+2b2) ∑ cyc 2a2 + 2c2   = v u u √ ∑ cyc a2(a2 + b2 + c2) (a2 + c2)(a2 + b2) 4 Thus, it suﬃces to show that for positive reals x, y, z, ∑ cyc x(x + y + z) (x + y)(x + z) ≤ 9 4 After clearing denominators this reduces to ∑ sym 8a 2b + 4abc ≤ ∑ sym 9a 2b + 3abc, and is evident by AM-GM. □ 4 Problems 1.
