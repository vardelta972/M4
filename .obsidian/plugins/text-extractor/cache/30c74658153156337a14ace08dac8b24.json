(Winter Camp 2015) James Rickards Irreducibility Problems A polynomial f (x) with integer coeﬃcients is called reducible if there exist non-constant polynomials g(x), h(x) with integer coeﬃcients such that f (x) = g(x)h(x). It is irreducible otherwise. Irreducibility problems are some of the most common number theoretic polynomial problems. There are only a few simple methods to deal with such problems, so in general you have to be creative. First of all: Gauss’s Lemma: Let f (x) be a non-constant polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Then it is irreducible over the rational numbers if and only if it is irreducible over the integers. In particular, this lemma allows us to basically ignore whether we are working with rationals or integers. Eisenstein’s Criterion: Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, and let p be a prime number. If: i) p | ai for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 ii) p ∤ an ii) p2 ∤ a0 Then f (x) is irreducible. Eisenstein’s criterion is an excellent tool, however you often cannot directly apply it. Let a, b, c be rational numbers. Then Gauss’s lemma imples that f (x) is irreducible if and only if cf (ax + b) is irreducible over the rationals. An integral part to some problems is ﬁguring out good choices of a, b, c (often a = c = 0 and b = ±1). Reduction modulo p: Let p be a prime, and f (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients so that p does not divide the leading coeﬃcient. If f (x) is reducible over the integers, then it is clearly reducible over the ﬁeld modulo p. Therefore if you can show that f (x) is irreducible modulo p, then f (x) is irreducible over the integers. Exercise: Find an integral polynomial f (x) which is irreducible over the integers but reducible modulo p for every prime p. When solving an irreducibility problem, try letting f (x) = g(x)h(x) and then try to show that one of the two must be constant. In small degree cases the following is useful: Rational Roots Test: Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, and assume p q be a rational root with p, q being relatively prime. Then p | a0 and q | an. Note for degree 3 polynomials, f (x) is irreducible if and only if it has no rational roots. If f (x) is of degree 4, check it has no rational roots and write f (x) = g(x)h(x) where g, h are quadratic; it is fairly simple to check whether this is possible or not. Problems 1. Prove that the following polynomials are irreducible: i) x5 + 2x4 − 4x3 + 4x2 − 2x + 13 ii) x5 − 32x 3 + 96x2 − 64 2. Let n > 1 be an integer, and let f (x) = xn + 5x n−1 + 3. Prove that f (x) is irreducible. (IMO 1993) 3. Let f (x) be monic, irreducible, and |f (0)| is not a perfect square. Prove that f (x2) is also irreducible. (Romania TST 2003) 1 4. Let p be a prime number, n1, . . . , np positive integers, and let d = gcd(n1, n2, . . . , np). Prove that the polynomial xn1 + xn2 + . . . + xnp − p xd − 1 is irreducible. (Romania TST 2010) 5. Let a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an > 0 be positive integers. Show that P (x) = xn − a1xn−1 − a2xn−2 − · · · − an is irreducible over the integers. (Yufei Zhao, Integer Polynomials Problem 17) Root Problems For this section, assume f (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 and it has roots r1, r2, · · · , rn. By far the most useful result when dealing with roots is Vieta’s Formulas. The easiest way to remember them is writing f (x) = (x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn) and expanding out. Many problems ask for properties of the roots, for example they are all real, all imaginary, all positive, etc. In this case it is useful to look at inequalities with f (x), being careful that using > or < implies we are working with real numbers. Another useful idea is: Descartes’ Rule of Signs: Let f (x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Order the terms as usual, from highest exponent to lowest. Let d be the number of sign changes in the non-zero coeﬃcients, then if f has r positive roots (counted with multiplicity), then r ≤ d and r ≡ d mod 2. If d is odd then this implies that a positive root exists, and d = 1 implies that exactly one positive root exists. You can repeat the test with f (−x) to give an idea of how many negative roots may exist. Finally, plugging in values of x is helpful because of: Intermediate Value Theorem If g(x) is a continuous function that sends the reals to reals (any poly- nomial is continuous), then if a, b are real numbers with g(a) < 0 < g(b) then there exists x between a and b such that g(x) = 0. In particular, since deg(f ) = n, if we can ﬁnd real numbers a1 < a2 < ... < an+1 such that f (ai) and f (ai+1) have opposite sign for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, then we have found n distint real roots, so all the roots are real! Exercise: Show that for each positive integer n, all the roots of the polynomial ∑n k=0 2k(n−k)xk are real numbers. (Putnam 2014) Problems 1. The roots of the equation x3 − 3ax2 + bx + 18c = 0 form a non-constant arithmetic progression, and the roots of x3 + bx2 + x − c 3 = 0 form a non-constant geometric progression.

Let xn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 = 0 be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients such that 0 ≤ a0 ≤ a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an−1 ≤ 1. If λ is a root with |λ| ≥ 1 then λ n+1 = 1.
