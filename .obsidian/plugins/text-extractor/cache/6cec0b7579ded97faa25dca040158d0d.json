Let p be a prime number. Prove that (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). 2. If a and b are positive integers with a ≡ b (mod n), show that a n ≡ bn (mod n2). 3. Prove that for all positive integers a > 1 and n, n is a divisor of ϕ(a n − 1). 2 Divisibility The divisibility relation |, deﬁned on the integers, is given by a|b if b = ka for some integer k. Before we try to solve any diﬃcult number theory problem, it is important to become acquainted with some of the basic properties of divisibility: • On the positive integers, the divisibility relation is reﬂexive (a|a), antisymmetric (a|b and b|a imply a = b), and transitive (a|b and b|c imply a|c). • If a|b and a|c, a|αb + βc for any α, β. • If a and b are positive and a|b, then a ≤ b. These are all trivial properties, and being able to apply them eﬀortlessly will greatly improve your ability to solve any problem relating to divisibility. 3 Factoring Factoring is pretty useful in divisibility problems. If P (n) can be factored into Q(n)R(n) (where Q, R are polynomials with integer coeﬃcients), then Q(n)|P (n) for all n. In particular, a − 1|a n − 1 for all positive integers a, n with a ̸= 1, and a + 1|a n + 1 for all positive integers a, n with a ̸= 1 and n odd. 4 Greatest Common Divisors Let a, b be integers. Then the greatest common divisor of a and b, written as gcd(a, b), is the largest integer which is a divisor of both a and b. Bzout’s identity states that for all a, b, there are integers α, β with αa + βb = gcd(a, b). (Note, in particular, that an integer can be written in the form αa + βb for some integers α, β iﬀ it is a multiple of gcd(a, b).) Additionally, gcd(a, b) = a iﬀ a|b. 5 A Criterion Let vp(n), where p is a prime, be the p-adic valuation of n; that is, the exponent of p in the prime factorization of n. Then, m|n if and only if vp(m) ≤ vp(n) for all primes p. Additionally, vp(mn) = vp(m) + vp(n) for all p, m, n with p prime. 1 6 Problems 1. Prove that vp(gcd(m, n)) = min{vp(m), vp(n)} for all m, n, p with p prime. 2. Prove that if a|m and a|n, then a| gcd(m, n). 3. Prove that if S is a nonempty set of integers such that • for any a in S, −a is in S • for any a, b (not necessarily distinct) in S, a + b is in S then there is some integer n such that S is the set of all multiples of n. 4. Let n have the prime factorization pe1 1 pe2 2 · · · pen n . How many divisors does n have? What is their sum? 5. An multiplicative number-theoretic function f is a function taking positive integers to positive integers which satisﬁes f (mn) = f (m)f (n) for all m, n with gcd(m, n) = 1. Prove that if f (n) is a multiplicative function, then the function g(n) = ∑ d|n f (d) is multiplicative. 7 More Problems Modular arithmetic, in addition to the properties of divisibility outlined in this handout, will be useful in solving these problems. 6. Let n be a positive integer. Prove that the fraction 21n + 4 14n + 3 cannot be reduced. 7. Find the largest positive integer n such that n3 + 100 is divisible by n + 10. 8. Let a and b be relatively prime. Prove that ab − a − b is the largest integer which cannot be expressed as ax + by where x and y are nonnegative integers. 9. Let n be a positive integer, and let a1, a2, · · · , ak be positive integers, all less than n, such that lcm(ai, aj) > m for all distinct i, j. Prove that 1 a1 + 1 a2 + · · · + 1 ak < 2. 10. Prove that for every positive integer n ≥ 2, there is a set S of n integers such that (a − b) 2|ab for all distinct a, b in S. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
