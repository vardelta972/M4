It is pseudo-symmetry. What happens if you swap x and y? 2. Suppose f (x) = 0 for some x ̸= 0. Prove that f (y) = 0 for all y ̸= x2 2 . This problem isn’t really about writing one term in multiple ways; it’s just about ﬁnishing the worked example. 3. In both cases, we can write the equation as f (x)+f (g(x)) = h(x). In (a), we have g(g(x)) = x, so try substituting in both x and g(x). In (b), we have g(g(g(x))) = x and the same idea works. (Source: Korea 1999 for (b)) 4. A variant on fudging: Choose x and y so that xy is ﬁxed and vary x + y. You should be able to prove f (x) = f (y) if x ≤ 2√y, and now let y be very large. 5. Fudging: Suppose there exists some y such that ⌊f (y)⌋ ̸= 0. Then, vary x to conclude f (x) = f (0) for x ∈ [0, 1). Now pick x large and vary y to show f (z) = f (0) for all z > 0. (Source: IMO 2010) Problems: Induction, squeezing, and Cauchy 1. Set n = 1 to get f (m + 1) = f (m) + f (1) + m, and look for a formula. For (b), the answer is of the same form, but see what happens when you change the coeﬃcients. 2. For each positive integer n, show that |f (x) − f (y)| ≤ nK ( x−y n )2, and then squeeze. 3. Prove that f (x3) = xf (x)2. Then if f (nx) = nf (x) for all x, you can show f ( 3√n · x) = 3√n · f (x). There is a square root so you have to watch out for sign though. Is is possible that f (x) < 0 for x > 0? Once this is proven, try y = 3√n · x. 4. There are several steps here. First write f (x + 1) in two diﬀerent ways to calculate f (1). Then calculate f (n) for all positive integers n. To extend to the rational numbers, try writing f ( a b ) = f ((b + a b ) − b ). 5. Let f (0) = k. Find a formula for f (f (y)) and let y = f (z) to get f (x2 +z +k2) = f (x)2 +f (z). If you can show k = 0, then this is reduced to Example 3. (Source: IMO 1992) 6. Let P (x) be that quadratic polynomial that equals f (x) for x = −1, 0, 1. (Do you see why such a polynomial has to exist?) Show by induction that f (x) = P (x) for all integers. Now repeat the argument for integer multiples of 1 n . 1 of 3 Winter Camp 2014 Functional Equation Hints David Arthur Problems: Injectivity and surjectivity 1. First show f is injective. Now let x = f (z). 2. Set x = y and let y vary to see f is surjective. Now let y = 0. 3. Set y = −f (x). For any z, can you choose x so that x + f (−f (x)) = z? (Source: Mathlinks) 4. First show f is injective. Now look at f (g(f (x)) and conclude f (x3) = f (x)2. Is this possible for an injective function? (Source: IMO Shortlist 1997) 5. First show f is surjective. Now choose x, y so that f (x) = 0 and f (y) = z for some arbitrary z. You should be able to conclude that f is linear. (Source: IMO Shortlist 2002) More Problems: Hints 1. Set x = y. 2. Use induction to show f (nx) = n2f (x). (Source: Nordic 2008) 3. From the ﬁrst two conditions, you can prove f (n + 2) = f (n) − 2. You know f (0). What is f (1)? 4. You may be tempted to use Cauchy’s equation, but it’s not that hard. First ﬁnd f (0) and then try y = −x. 5. It’s quite similar to #4. Set x = a, y = 0, z = 0 to get f (a) ≤ f (0). Can you now show f (a) ≥ f (0)? (Source: Russia 2000) 6. For (a), try focusing on perfect squares. For (b), what happens when h(n) = 1, what happens when h(n) = 2, etc.? 7. First show f is injective. Now show f (f (x + y) + f (1) + f (1)) = f (f (x) + f (y) + f (2)) to get f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) + C for some constant C. Then show f (x) = ax + b for some a, b. 8. Use pseudo-symmetry to show f (x) = u(x) − 1 and then u(x + y) = u(x)u(y). Show u(x) > 0 for all x, and let v(x) = log u(x) to reduce to Cauchy’s equation, and solve with monotonicity. (Source: Romania 1998) 9. Try self-cancelation with m = 2n − f (n). We would be done if we could show that f (t) = 0 only when t = 0. But if f (t) = 0, then f (m − t) = f (m) so f would have to be periodic and hence bounded. Is that possible? (Source: Italy 2006) 10. It’s not as scary as it looks. Use the ﬁrst two conditions to get a formula for f (kx,ky,kz) f (x,y,z) . Now, given arbitrary x, y, z, ﬁnd a k such that x + ky = k2z. (Source: Balkan 2013) 11. First show f is bijective. Setting x = f −1(0) should let you prove f (0) = 1 and eventually f (n) = n + 1 for all integers n. Now try y = −2. When is it possible to have f (z) = 2z? (Source: Brazil 2006) 2 of 3 Winter Camp 2014 Functional Equation Hints David Arthur 12. It is all about fudging. First show f (0) = 0, then f −1(0) = 0, then f (a) = f (b) only if a = b. (Source: APMO 2010) 13. Let k = f (1). First try to prove k · f (mn) = f (m) · f (n). Use this to prove k|f (n) for all n, and hence g(n) = f (n) k is a strictly better solution. Finally show f is a bijection on primes. The answer is 23 · 3 · 5 = 120. (Source: IMO 1998) 14. Prove by induction that f (n + 1) > f (f (n)) for all n. This is enough to prove f (n) = n. For this part, try showing f (n) ≥ n. (Source: Titu Andreescu? See also IMO 1997) 15. The hardest part is showing f (1) = 1. Show f (−x) = ±f (x) and then look at x, x+1, −x, 1−x. If f (1) ̸= ±1, then f (x) can take on only ﬁnitely many values, which is impossible. From here, show f is increasing and f (q) = q for q ∈ Q. (Source: Bulgaria 2005) 16. When is f (x) = 0? From there, you should be able to show that f (q) = q and f (qx) = qf (x) for all rational numbers q. In the interest of fudging, try multiplying m by q and dividing n by q. If done right, you should get f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) and then f (x2) = f (x)2 to reduce to Cauchy’s. (Source: Mathlinks) 3 of 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
