If b≠0 and n are relatively prime (i.e. they have no common prime divisor), then 0, b, 2b, …, (n−1)b are distinct (mod n) because for 0 ≤ s < r<n, rb ≡ sb (mod n) implies (r−s)b = kn. Since b, n have no common prime divisor, this means b divides k. Then 0 < (k/b)n = r−s < n, contradicting b ≤ k. Hence, there is a unique r among 1, …, n−1 such that rb≡ 1 (mod n). We will denote this r as b−1 or 1/b (mod n). Further, we can extend (mod n) to fractions by defining a/b ≡ ab−1 (mod n). We can easily check that the usual properties of fractions holds in mod n arithmetic. Next, we will introduce Wolstenholme’s theorem, which is an important relation concerning harmonic series. Theorem (Wolstenholme): For a prime p ≥ 5, 211 ( 1) 1 ... 0 (mod ). 21 H pp p −= + + + ≡ − (More precisely, for a prime p ≥ 5, if 11 (1) 1 ... , 21 a Hp pb − =+ + + = − then p2 | a.) Example We have 1 1 1 7381 (10) 1 ... 2 3 10 2520 H =+ + + + = and 11 2 | 7381.

() pp nn p np n n −− == ≡− −∑∑ Since every 1/n2 is congruent to exactly one of the numbers 12, 22, … , [(p−1)/2] 2 (mod p) and 1/n2 are all distinct for n =1,2,…,(p −1)/2, we have when p ≥ 5, ).(mod0 24 )1(1 22/)1( 1 2/)1( 1 2 2 p pp k n p n p k ≡ − =≡∑∑ − = − = Wolstenholme’s theorem follows. Second proof (using polynomials mod p) We use a theorem of Lagrange, which says if f (x) = c0 + c1x + ⋯ + cnx n is a polynomial of degree n, with integer coefficients, and if f (x) ≡ 0 (mod p) has more than n solutions, where p is prime, then every coefficient of f (x) is divisible by p. The proof is not hard. It can be done basically by induction and the division algorithm mod p. The statement is false if p is not prime. For instance, x 2 − 1 ≡ 0 (mod 8) has 4 solutions. Here is the other proof. From Fermat’s Little theorem, x p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) has 1, 2, …, p −1 as solutions. Thus x p−1−1 ≡ (x−1)(x−2) ⋯ (x−p+1) (mod p). Let (x−1)(x−2) ⋯ (x−p+1) = x p−1 − s1x p−2 + ⋯ − sp−2x + sp−1. (*) By Wilson’s theorem, sp−1 = (p−1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). Thus 0 ≡ s1x p−2 + ⋯ − sp−2x (mod p). The formula is true for every integer x. By Lagrange’s theorem, p divides each of s1, s2, …, sp−2. Putting x = p in (*), we get (p−1)!=pp−1−s1pp−2 + ⋯ − sp−2p+ sp−1. Canceling out (p−1)! and dividing both sides by p, we get 0 = pp−2 − s1 pp−3 + ⋯+sp−3 p − sp−2. As p ≥ 5, each of the terms is congruent to 0 (mod p2). Hence, we have sp−2 ≡ 0 (mod p2). Finally, 2 11 ( 1)!(1 ... ) ( 1)! . 21 p a sp p p b − =− + + + = − − This proves Wolstenholme’s theorem. Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 16, No. 1, May. 11 Page 2 Using Wolstenholme’s theorem and setting x = kp in (*), we get (kp−1)(kp−2)⋯(kp−p+1) = (kp)p−1−s1(kp)p−2+⋯ +sp−3(kp)2−sp−2kp+sp−1 ≡ sp−3(kp)2 − sp−2kp + sp−1 ≡ (p −1)! (mod p 3). Upon dividing by (p−1)!, we have 31 1 (mod ), 1, 2,... . 1 kp pk p −⎛⎞ ≡=⎜⎟ −⎝⎠ This result may in fact be taken as the statement of Wolstenholme’s theorem. Here are a few further remarks. Wolstenholme’s theorem on the congruence of harmonic series is related to the Bernoulli numbers .nB For instance, we have 23 4 3 1 1 1( ) (mod ) 1 3 p kp kk p B p p − −⎛⎞ ≡− −⎜⎟ −⎝⎠ , which is usually called Glaisher’s congruence. These numbers are related to Fermat’s Last Theorem. It is known that for any prime p ≥ 5, 31 1(mod ). 1 kp p p −⎛⎞ ≡⎜⎟ −⎝⎠ Are there primes satisfying 421 1(mod ) ? 1 p p p −⎛⎞ ≡⎜⎟ −⎝⎠ These primes are called Wolstenholme primes. (So far, we only know 16843 and 2124679 are such primes). In another direction, one can ask if there exist composite numbers n such that 31 1(mod ) ? 1 kn n n −⎛⎞ ≡⎜⎟ −⎝⎠ All these are very classical questions. Example 10 (APMO 2006): Let p ≥ 5 be a prime and let r be the number of ways of placing p checkers on a p×p checkerboard so that not all checkers are in the same row (but they may all be in the same column). Show that r is divisible by p5. Solution Observe that .1 )!1( ))1(()1( 222 ⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ − − −−− =−⎟ ⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜ ⎜ ⎝ ⎛ = p ppp pp p p r L Hence it suffices to show that (p2−1)(p2−2)⋯(p2−(p−1)) − (p−1)! ≡ 0 (mod p4) (1) Now let f(x) = (x−1)(x−2)⋯(x−(p−1)) = x p−1 + s1x p−2 + ⋯ + sp−2x + sp−1. (2) Thus the first congruence relation is the same as f(p2) − (p−1)! ≡ 0 (mod p4). Therefore it suffices to show that sp−2 p2 ≡ 0 (mod p4) or sp−2 ≡ 0 (mod p 2), which is exactly Wolstenholme’s theorem. Example 11 (Putnam 1996): Let p be a prime number greater than 3 and k =[2p/3]. Show that 2... 0 (mod ) 12 pp p p k ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ++ + ≡⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ For example, ).7(mod098 4 7 3 7 2 7 1 7 2≡=⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ +⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ +⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ +⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ Solution Recall ( 1)...( 1) . 1 2 ... p pp p i i i ⎛⎞ −− + =⎜⎟ ⋅⋅⎝⎠ This is a multiple of p if 1 ≤ i ≤ p−1.

We can also give a more detailed proof as follow. Let n nH 1 3 1 2 1 1)( ++++= L and 111 () 1 ... ( 1) . 2 nPn n −=− + + − Then the problem is reduced to showing that for any p > 3, p divides the numerator of P([2p/3]).

Case 1 (p = 3n+1) Then [2p/3] = 2n. So we must show p divides the numerator of P(2n). Now (3 ) (2 ) 1 111 1 2(1 ... ) ( ... ) 22 2 1 2 2 3 11 1 1 1 (1 ... ) ( ... ) 22 1 2 2 3 11 1 1 (1 ) (2 ) ...

Case 2 (p = 3n+2) Then [2p/3] = 2n+1. So we must show p divides the numerator of P(2n+1). Now (3 1) (2 1)Hn P n+− + 1 111 1 2(1 ... ) ( ... ) 2 2 22 22 3 1nn n n = + ++ + + ++ ++ + 11 1 1 1 (1 ... ) ( ... ) 22 2 2 2 3 1nn n n = + ++ + + ++ ++ + 11 1 1 (1 ) (2 ) ...

Example 12: Let p ≥ 5 be a prime, show that if 11 1... , 2 a p b ++ + = then p4| ap −b.

Let n be a positive integer in base 10. For i=1,2,…,9, let a(i) be the number of digits of n that equal i. Prove that 110932 )9()8()2()1( +≤ n aaaa L and determine all equality cases. Solution. LAU Chun Ting (St. Paul’s Co-educational College, Form 2). Let f(n)=2a(1)3 a(2)⋯9a(8)10a(9). If n is a number with one digit, then f (n) = n+1. Suppose all numbers A with k digits satisfy the given inequality f (A) ≤ A+1. For any (k+1) digit number, it is of the form 10A+B, where A is a k digit number and 0 ≤ B ≤ 9. We have f(10A+B) = (B+1) f(A) ≤ (B+1)(A+1) = (B+1)A+B+1 ≤ 10A+B+1. Equality holds if and only if f (A) = A+1 and B = 9. By induction, the inequality holds for all positive integers n and equality holds if and only if all but the leftmost digits of n are 9’s.

For n = 1,2,3,…, let xn and yn be positive real numbers such that 2 12 ++ += nnn xxx and .1 2 2 ++ += nnn yyy If x1, x2, y1, y2 are all greater than 1, then prove that there exists a positive integer N such that for all n > N, we have xn > yn.

Since x1, x2, y1, y2 are all greater than 1, by induction, we can get xn+1> xn2 > 1 and yn+1> 1+yn > n for n ≥ 2. Then xn+2 = xn+xn+12 > xn+1 2 > xn4 and yn+2 = yn2+yn+1 = yn2+yn−12+yn < 3yn2 < yn3 for all n ≥ 4. Hence, log xn+2 > 4 log xn and log yn+2 < 3 log yn.

Let C be a circle, A1, A2, …, An be distinct points inside C and B1, B2, …, Bn be distinct points on C such that no two of the segments A1B1, A2B2,…, AnBn intersect. A grasshopper can jump from Ar to As if the line segment ArAs does not intersect any line segment AtBt (t≠r,s). Prove that after a certain number of jumps, the grasshopper can jump from any Au to any Av. Solution. William PENG. The cases n = 1 or 2 are clear. Suppose n ≥ 3. By reordering the pairs Ai, Bi, we may suppose the convex hull of A1, A2, …, An is the polygonal region M with vertices A1, A2, …, Ak (k≤n). For 1≤m≤k, if every AmBm intersects M only at Am, then the n-th case follows by removing two pairs of Am, Bm separately and applying case n −1. M AI Ax A1 AkAJ Ay Am Bm Dm Bx Dx By BI BJ Dy Otherwise, there exists a segment AmBm intersecting M at more than 1 point. Let it intersect the perimeter of M again at Dm. Since AiBi’s do not intersect, so AjDj’s (being subsets of AiBi’s) do not intersect. In particular, Dm is not a vertex of M. Now AmDm divides the perimeter of M into two parts. Moving from Am to Dm clockwise on the perimeter of M, there are points Ax, Dx such that there is no Dw between them. As Dx is not a vertex, there is a vertex AI between Ax and Dx. Then AIBI only intersect M at AI. Also, moving from Am to Dm anti-clockwise on the perimeter of M, there is AJ such that AJBJ only intersects M at AJ. Then AIBI and AJBJ do not intersect any diagonal of M with endpoints different from AI and AJ. Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 16, No. 1, May. 11 Page 4 Removing AI, BI and applying case n−1, the grasshopper can jump between any two of the points A1,…,AI−1, AI+1,…,An. Also, removing AJ, BJ and applying case n−1, the grasshopper can jump between any two of the points A1,…,AJ−1, AJ+1,…,An. Using these two cases, we see the grasshopper can jump from any Au to any Av via At (t≠I,J). Other commended solvers: T. h. G. Problem 369. ABC is a triangle with BC > CA > AB. D is a point on side BC and E is a point on ray BA beyond A so that BD=BE=CA. Let P be a point on side AC such that E, B, D, P are concyclic. Let Q be the intersection point of ray BP and the circumcircle of ΔABC different from B. Prove that AQ+CQ=BP. Solution. CHAN Long Tin (Diocesan Boys’ School), Giorgos KALANTZIS (Demenica’s Public High School, Patras, Greece) and LAU Chun Ting (St. Paul’s Co-educational College, Form 2). CB A E D P Q Since A,B,C,Q are concyclic and E,P,D,B are concyclic, we have ∠AQC = 180°−∠ABC =∠EPD and ∠PED=∠PBD =∠QAC. Hence, ΔAQC and ΔEPD are similar. So we have AQ/AC=PE/DE and CQ/AC = PD/DE. Cross-multiplying and adding these two equations, we get (AQ+CQ)×DE = (PE+PD)×AC. (*) For cyclic quadrilateral EPDB, by the Ptolemy theorem, we have BP×DE = PE×BD+PD×BE = (PE+PD)×AC (**) Comparing (*) and (**), we have AQ+CQ=BP.

On the coordinate plane, at every lattice point (x,y) (these are points where x, y are integers), there is a light. At time t = 0, exactly one light is turned on. For n = 1, 2, 3, …, at time t = n, every light at a lattice point is turned on if it is at a distance 2005 from a light that was on at time t = n − 1. Prove that every light at a lattice point will eventually be turned on at some time. Solution. LAU Chun Ting (St. Paul’s Co-educational College, Form 2), LEE Tak Wing (Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School), Gordon MAN Siu Hang (CCC Ming Yin College) and Emanuele NATALE (Università di Roma “Tor Vergata”, Roma, Italy). We may assume the light that was turned on at t = 0 was at the origin. Let z = 2005 = 5×401 = (22+1 2)(202+12) = |(2+i)(20+i)| 2 = |41+22i| 2 = 41 2+222. Let x = 412−222=1037 and y =2×41×22 = 1716. Then x 2+y 2 = z 2. By the Euclidean algorithm, we get gcd(1037, 1716) = 1. By eliminating the remainders in the calculations, we get 84×1716−139×1037=1. Let V1, V2, V3, V4, V5 be the vectors from the origin to (2005,0), (1037, 1716), (1037, −1716), (1716, 1037), (1716, −1037) respectively. We have V2 + V3 = (2×1037,0) and V4 + V5 = (2×1716,0). Then we can get (1,0) =1003[84(V4+V5)−139(V2+V3)]−V1. So, from the origin, following these vector movements, we can get to the point (1,0). Similarly, we can get to the point (0,1). As (a,b) = a(1,0) + b(0,1), we can get to any lattice point. Olympiad Corner (continued from page 1) Problem 4. Let n be a fixed positive odd integer. Take m+2 distinct points P0, P1, …, Pm+1 (where m is a non-negative integer) on the coordinate plane in such a way that the following 3 conditions are satisfied: (1) P0=(0,1), Pm+1=(n+1,n), and for each integer i, 1 ≤ i ≤ m, both x- and y- coordinates of Pi are integers lying in between 1 and n (1 and n inclusive). (2) For each integer i, 0 ≤ i ≤ m, PiPi+1 is parallel to the x-axis if i is even, and is parallel to the y-axis if i is odd. (3) For each pair i,j with 0 ≤ i < j ≤ m, line segments PiPi+1 and PjPj+1 share at most 1 point. Determine the maximum possible value that m can take. Problem 5. Find all functions f:ℝ→ℝ, where ℝ is the set of all real numbers, satisfying the following 2 conditions: (1) There exists a real number M such that for every real number x, f(x) < M is satisfied. (2) For every pair of real numbers x and y, f (x f (y)) + y f (x) = x f (y) + f (xy) is satisfied.
