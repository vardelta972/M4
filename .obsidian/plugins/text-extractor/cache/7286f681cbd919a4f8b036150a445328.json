Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC and let Γ denote its circumcircle. A point D is on the arc AB of Γ not containing C and a point E is on the arc AC of Γ not containing B such that AD = CE. Prove that BE is parallel to AD. Solution. We note that triangle AEC and triangle BDA are congruent. Therefore AE = BD and hence ∠ABE = ∠DAB. This proves that AD is parallel to BE. 2. Find all triples (p, q, r) of primes such that pq = r + 1 and 2(p2 + q2) = r2 + 1. Solution. If p and q are both odd, then r = pq − 1 is even so r = 2. But in this case pq ≥ 3 × 3 = 9 and hence there are no solutions. This proves that either p = 2 or q = 2. If p = 2 then we have 2q = r + 1 and 8 + 2q2 = r2 + 1. Multiplying the second equation by 2 we get 2r2 + 2 = 16 + (2q)2 = 16 + (r + 1)2. Rearranging the terms, we have r2 − 2r − 15 = 0, or equivalently (r + 3)(r − 5) = 0. This proves that r = 5 and hence q = 3. Similarly, if q = 2 then r = 5 and p = 3. Thus the only two solutions are (p, q, r) = (2, 3, 5) and (p, q, r) = (3, 2, 5). 3. A ﬁnite non-empty set S of integers is called 3-good if the the sum of the elements of S is divisble by 3. Find the number of 3-good non-empty subsets of {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}. Solution. Let A be a 3-good subset of {0, 1, . . . , 9}. Let A1 = A∩{0, 3, 6, 9}, A2 = A∩{1, 4, 7} and A3 = A ∩ {2, 5, 8}. Then there are three possibilities: • |A2| = 3, |A3| = 0; • |A2| = 0, |A3| = 3; • |A2| = |A3|. Note that there are 16 possibilities for A1. Therefore the ﬁrst two cases correspond to a total of 32 subsets that are 3-good. The number of subsets in the last case is 16(12+32+32+12) = 320. Note that this also includes the empty set. Therefore there are a total of 351 non-empty 3- good subsets of {0, 1, 2, . . . , 9}. 4. In a triangle ABC, points D and E are on segments BC and AC such that BD = 3DC and AE = 4EC. Point P is on line ED such that D is the midpoint of segment EP . Lines AP and BC intersect at point S. Find the ratio BS/SD. Solution. Let F denote the midpoint of the segment AE. Then it follows that DF is parallel to AP . Therefore, in triangle ASC we have CD/SD = CF/F A = 3/2. But DC = BD/3 = (BS + SD)/3. Therefore BS/SD = 7/2. 5. Let a1, b1, c1 be natural numbers. We deﬁne a2 = gcd(b1, c1) , b2 = gcd(c1, a1) , c2 = gcd(a1, b1) , and a3 = lcm(b2, c2) , b3 = lcm(c2, a2) , c3 = lcm(a2, b2) . Show that gcd(b3, c3) = a2. 1 Mumbai region Regional Mathematical Olympiad 2013 December 1, 2013 Solution. For a prime p and a natural number n we shall denote by vp(n) the power of p dividing n. Then it is enough to show that vp(a2) = vp(gcd(b3, c3)) for all primes p. Let p be a prime and let α = vp(a1), β = vp(b1) and γ = vp(c1). Because of symmetry, we may assume that α ≤ β ≤ γ. Therefore, vp(a2) = min{β, γ} = β and similarly vp(b2) = vp(c2) = α. Therefore vp(b3) = max{α, β} = β and similarly vp(c3) = max{α, β} = β. Therefore vp(gcd(b3, c3)) = vp(a2) = β. This completes the solution. 6. Let a, b be real numbers and, let P (x) = x3 + ax2 + b and Q(x) = x3 + bx + a. Suppose that the roots of the equation P (x) = 0 are the reciprocals of the roots of the equation Q(x) = 0. Find the greatest common divisor of P (2013! + 1) and Q(2013! + 1). Solution. Note that P (0) ̸= 0. Let R(x) = x3P (1/x) = bx3 + ax + 1. Then the equations Q(x) = 0 and R(x) = 0 have the same roots. This implies that R(x) = bQ(x) and equating the coeﬃcients we get a = b2 and ab = 1. This implies that b3 = 1, so a = b = 1. Thus P (x) = x3 + x2 + 1 and Q(x) = x3 + x + 1. For any integer n we have (P (n), Q(n)) = (P (n), P (n) − Q(n)) = (n3 + n2 + 1, n 2 − n) = (n3 + n2 + 1, n − 1) = (3, n − 1) . Thus (P (n), Q(n)) = 3 if n − 1 is divisible by 3. In particular, since 3 divides 2013! it follows that (P (2013! + 1), Q(2013! + 1)) = 3. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
