Let the circumcircles of triangles AXD and BXC intersect again at Y . If X is the incentre of triangle ABY , show that ∠CAD = 90 ◦. Solution: Given that X is the incentre of tri- angle ABY , we have ∠BAX = ∠XAY . There- fore, ∠BDC = ∠BAC = ∠BAX = ∠XAY = ∠XDY = ∠BDY . This shows that C, D, Y are collinear. Therefore, ∠CY X + ∠XY D = 180◦. But the left-hand side equals (180◦ − ∠CBD) + (180 ◦ − ∠CAD). Since ∠CBD = ∠CAD, we ob- tain 180◦ = 360 ◦ − 2∠CAD. This shows that ∠CAD = 90 ◦. 2. Let P1(x) = x 2 + a1x + b1 and P2(x) = x2 + a2x + b2 be two quadratic polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose a1 ̸= a2 and there exist integers m ̸= n such that P1(m) = P2(n), P2(m) = P1(n). Prove that a1 − a2 is even. Solution: We have m 2 + a1m + b1 = n2 + a2n + b2 n2 + a1n + b1 = m2 + a2m + b2. Hence (a1 − a2)(m + n) = 2(b2 − b1), (a1 + a2)(m − n) = 2(n 2 − m2). This shows that a1 + a2 = −2(n + m). Hence 4(b2 − b1) = a 2 2 − a 2 1. Since a1 + a2 and a1 − a2 have same parity, it follows that a1 − a2 is even. 3. Find all fractions which can be written simultaneously in the forms 7k − 5 5k − 3 and 6l − 1 4l − 3 , for some integers k, l. Solution: If a fraction is simultaneously in the forms 7k − 5 5k − 3 and 6l − 1 4l − 3 , we must have 7k − 5 5k − 3 = 6l − 1 4l − 3 . This simpliﬁes to kl + 8k + l − 6 = 0. We can write this in the form (k + 1)(l + 8) = 14. Now 14 can be factored in 8 ways: 1 × 14, 2 × 7, 7 × 2, 14 × 1, (−1) × (−14), (−2) × (−7), (−7) × (−2) and (−14) × (−1). Thus we get 8 pairs: (k, l) = (13, −7), (6, −6), (1, −1), (0, 6), (−15, −9), (−8, −10), (−3, −15), (−2, −22). These lead respectively to 8 fractions: 43 31 , 31 27 , 1, 55 39 , 5 3 , 61 43 , 19 13 , 13 9 . 4. Suppose 28 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? Solution: One can choose 3 objects out of 28 objects in (28 3 ) ways. Among these choices all would be together in 28 cases; exactly two will be together in 28 × 24 cases. Thus three objects can be chosen such that no two adjacent in (28 3 ) − 28 − (28 × 24) ways. Among these, furthrer, two objects will be diametrically opposite in 14 ways and the third would be on either semicircle in a non adjacent portion in 28 − 6 = 22 ways. Thus required number is (28 3 ) − 28 − (28 × 24) − (14 × 22) = 2268. 5. Let ABC be a right triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let E and F be respectively the mid-points of AB and AC. Suppose the incentre I of triangle ABC lies on the circumcircle of triangle AEF . Find the ratio BC/AB. Solution: Draw ID ⊥ AC. Then ID = r, the inradius of △ABC. Observe EF ∥ BC and hence ∠AEF = ∠ABC = 90 ◦. Hence ∠AIF = 90 ◦. Therefore ID2 = F D · DA. If a > c, then F A > DA and we have DA = s − a, and F D = F A − DA = b 2 − (s − a). Thus we obtain r2 = (b + c − a)(a − c) 4 . But r = (c + a − b)/2. Thus we obtain (c + a − b)2 = (b + c − a)(a − c). Simpliﬁcation gives 3b = 3a + c. Squaring both sides and using b 2 = c 2 + a 2, we obtian 4c = 3a. Hence BC/BA = a/c = 4/3. (If a ≤ c, then I lies outside the circumcircle of AEF .) 6. Find all real numbers a such that 3 < a < 4 and a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) Solution: Let a = 3 + f , where 0 < f < 1. We are given that (3 + f )(3 − 2f ) is an integer. This implies that 2f 2 + 3f is an integer. Since 0 < f < 1, we have 0 < 2f 2 + 3f < 5. Therefore 2f 2 + 3f can take 1, 2, 3 or 4. Equating 2f 2 + 3f to each one of them and using f > 0, we get f = −3 + √17 4 , 1 2 , −3 + √33 4 , −3 + √41 4 . Therefore a takes the values: a = 3 + −3 + √17 4 , 3 1 2 , 3 + −3 + √33 4 , 3 + −3 + √41 4 . ———-0———- 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
