Prove that r is an integer. Solution: The arithmetic sequence contains 1. Let 1, d + 1, 2d + 1, · · · be the given arithmetic sequence starting at 1. This sequence contains 1, r, r2. Then r = 1 + md and r2 = 1 + nd for some integers m, n. If d = 0, then r = 1, which is clearly an integer. Otherwise, m = r−1 d and n = r2−1 d are in- tegers. But r2−1 d = r−1 d · (r + 1). This implies r + 1 is a rational number. Hence, r is rational. But r is a term in the arithmetic sequence 1, d + 1, 2d + 1, · · ·. This implies this arithmetic sequence has a rational common diﬀerence and consequently, contains only rational numbers. Let f be the denominator of the rational common diﬀerence. Then all terms in the arithmetic sequence have denominator at most f . If r is not an integer, then if we write r = a b with gcd(a, b) = 1 and b > 1, then the denominators of 1, r, r2, r3, · · · are strictly increasing, and will eventually exceed f . But then these terms whose denomi- nator is larger than f cannot be in the given arithmetic sequence. This is a contradiction. Therefore, r must be an integer. □ Source: IberoAmerican Mathematical Olympiad 2000 A2 Find all functions f : R → R such that f (f (x) + y) = f (x2 − y) + 4f (x)y for all x, y ∈ R. Solution: The answers are f (x) ≡ 0, x 2. Subsituting y = −f (x) yields f (0) = f (x2 + f (x)) − 4f (x) 2, ∀x ∈ R. (1) Substituting y = x2 yields f (f (x) + x2) = f (0) + 4f (x)x2, ∀x ∈ R. (2) Comparing equations (1) and (2) yields 4f (x) 2 = 4f (x)x2 for all x ∈ R. Equivalently, f (x)(f (x) − x2) = 0. Therefore, for each x ∈ R, f (x) = 0 or f (x) = x2. I claim that exactly one of these conditions hold for all x ∈ R. Suppose f (a) = 0 for some a ̸= 0. I claim that f ≡ 0. Then substituting x = a yields f (y) = f (a 2 − y), for all y ∈ R. Suppose f (y) = y2 for some y ̸= 0, a 2 2 . Then f (a 2−y) = y2 ̸= 0. Hence, (f (a 2−y) = (a 2−y) 2, implying (a2 −y)2 = y2. This simpliﬁes to a 2(a 2 −2ay) = 0. This contradicts a ̸= 0 and y ̸= a 2 2 . Therefore, f (y) = 0 for all y ̸= a2 2 . Choose z such that z ̸= ±a. By the same argument, f (y) = 0 for all y ̸= z2 2 . 3 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 4 Since a 2 2 ̸= z2 2 , f ( a2 2 ) = 0. Hence, f ≡ 0. Therefore, f (x) ≡ 0, x 2 are the only candidate solutions. It remains to verify that both solutions work. If f (x) ≡ 0, then f (f (x) + y) = 0 and f (x2 − y) + 4f (x)y = 0. If f (x) ≡ x2, then f (f (x) + y) = (x2 + y) 2 and f (x2 − y) + 4f (x)y = (x2 − y) 2 + 4x2y = (x2 + y) 2, as desired. □ Source: Iranian Mathematical Olympiad 1999 Comments: In the step f (x)(f (x) − x2) = 0, a costly mistake is to conclude here that f (x) ≡ 0 and f (x) ≡ x2 are the only solutions. It is still possible that f is a function that takes on 0 for some non-trivial values of x and x2 for the other values of x. You must handle this with care in similar problems. Try the following problem from the 2008 International Mathematical Olympiad where you have to handle a similar situation. Exercise: Find all functions f : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) ( so f is a function on the positive real numbers) such that (f (w)) 2 + (f (x)) 2 f (y2) + f (z2) = w2 + x 2 y2 + z2 , for all positive real numbers w, x, y, z such that wx = yz. A3 Find all ﬁnite sets A of distinct non-negative real numbers for which: (a) the set A contains at least four numbers. (b) for any 4 distinct numbers a, b, c, d ∈ A, the number ab + cd ∈ A. Solution: The answer is {0, 1 x , 1, x} for some x > 0. We ﬁrst prove a lemma. Lemma: Let a, b, c, d be non-negative real numbers such that a < b < c < d. Then ad + bc < ac + bd < ab + cd. Proof of Lemma: This follows from the fact that (ab + cd) − (ac + bd) = (d − a)(c − b) > 0 and (ac + bd) − (ad + bc) = (b − a)(d − c) > 0. End Proof of Lemma 1 Suppose n = |A| ≥ 5. Let a1, · · · , an ∈ A with a1 < a2 < · · · < an. Then by the Lemma, a1a4 + a2a3 < a1a2 + a3a4 < a1a2 + a3a5 < · · · < a1a2 + a3an, and a1a2 + a3an < a1a2 + a4an < · · · < a1a2 + an−1an, and a1a2 + an−1an < a1a3 + an−1an < · · · < a1an−2 + an−1an and a1an−2 + an−1an < a2an−2 + an−1an < · · · < an−3an−2 + an−1an. There are (n − 2) + (n − 4) + (n − 4) + (n − 4) = 4n − 14 elements in these inequalities. Since n ≥ 5, 4n − 14 > n. Hence, the 4n − 14 terms are pairwise distinct and all in A. This is impossible since |A| = n 1This result is simply the rearrangement inequality on four variables. 4 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 5 and 4n − 14 > n. Therefore, |A| = 4. Let A = {a, b, c, d} with a < b < c < d. Let x = ad + bc, y = ac + bd, z = ab + cd. Then by the Lemma, x < y < z. By property (b), x, y, z ∈ A. Since A = {a, b, c, d}, {x, y, z} ⊆ {a, b, c, d}. Therefore, x = a or x = b. If x = a, then ad + bc = a. Hence, bc = a(1 − d). Since bc > 0, d < 1. Note that ac + bd = b or c, implying ac+bd ≥ b. Then b−a ≤ (ac+bd)−(ad+bc) = (b−a)(d−c). Hence, d−c ≥ 1, contradicting d < 1. Hence, x ̸= a. Since x < y < z and x, y, z ∈ A and A = {a, b, c, d} and x ̸= a, we conclude that x = b, y = c, z = d. Hence, ad + bc = b, ac + bd = c, ab + cd = d. Rewriting these equations give us ad = b(1 − c), bd = c(1 − a), ab = d(1 − c). Subtracting the ﬁrst equation from the third equation yields (1 − c + a)(d − b) = 0. Since d > b, c − a = 1. Substituting this into the ﬁrst equation yields a(d + b) = 0. Since d > b, a = 0 and c = 1. Substituting this into the second equation yields bd = 1. Therefore, b = 1 d . Since b < d, 1 d < 1 < d. It is easy to verify that that the set {0, 1 d , 1, d} satisfy the given condition for d > 1. This ﬁnishes the problem. □ Source: Bulgarian Mathematical Olympiad 1998 Number Theory N1 Let a, b be rational numbers such that a + b and a2 + b2 are integers. Prove that a, b are both integers. Solution 1: Let a = x z for some integers x, z with z, > 0 and gcd(x, z) = 1. Then b = k − x z = kz−x z for some integer k. Since gcd(kz − x, z) = gcd(x, z) = 1, the denominator of b in lowest terms is also z. Hence, we can let b = y z with gcd(y, z) = 1. Since a + b and a 2 + b2, (a + b) 2 − (a 2 + b 2) = 2ab is also an integer. Hence, 2xy z2 is an integer. Since gcd(x, z) = gcd(y, z) = 1, gcd(xy, z2) = 1. Hence, z2 divides 2. This implies z = 1. Therefore, a, b are integers. □ Solution 2: Using the same notation as Solution 1, we note that 2(a 2 + b2) − (a + b) 2 = (a − b)2 is an integer. Since a, b is rational, a − b is rational. Hence, a − b is an integer. Since a + b is an integer, 2a, 2b are integers. If at least one of a, b is an integer, then since a + b is an integer, the other of a, b is also an integer and we are done. Otherwise, a, b are both not integers, implying a, b have denominator 2 when expressed in lowest terms. Let a = x 2 , b = y 2 , where x, y are odd integers. Since a 2 + b 2 is an integer, 4 divides x2 + y2. But x2, y2 ≡ 1 mod 4 since x, y are odd. Hence, x2 + y2 ≡ 2 mod 4, implying 4 ∤ x2 + y2. This is a contradiction. Therefore, a, b are integers. □ Source: Russian Math Olympiad 2006 Variant N2 Find all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that the sequence of positive integers a1, a2, a3, · · ·, formed by a1 = a, a2 = b and an = an−1 + an−2 gcd(an−1, an−2) , for n ≥ 3, is bounded. (A bounded sequence is a sequence for which there exists a positive real number M such that an ≤ M for all n ∈ N.) Solution: The answer is (a, b) = (2, 2). 5 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 6 First note if for two consecutive terms ak, ak+1 satisfy gcd(ak, ak+1) = 1, then gcd(ak+2, ak+1) = gcd(ak + ak+1, ak+1) = gcd(ak, ak+1) = 1. Iteratively, we have that gcd(an, an+1) = 1 for all n ≥ k. Hence, for all n ≥ k + 2, an = an−1 + an−2 and so the sequence is strictly increasing since each term is a positive integer. Hence, the sequence is not bounded. Henceforth, we will assume that no two consecutive terms in the sequence are coprime. Then for all positive integers n, we have an+2 ≤ an+an+1 2 ≤ max(an, an+1) with equality iﬀ an = an+1 and gcd(an, an+1) = 2. Hence max(an, an+1) is non-increasing. Since this number is always an integer, eventu- ally this max becomes constant, so for some m, max(am, am+1) = max(am+1, am+2) = max(am+2, am+3) = · · · = t. If am ̸= am+1, then am+2 < t, am+3 < t so max(am+2, am+3) < t, which is impossible. Hence am = am+1 = am+2 = · · · = t and gcd(am, am+1) = 2. Therefore, t = 2. Finally, we now ﬁnd the values of am−1, am−2, · · · , a1. Since 2 = am+1 = am−1+am gcd(am−1,am) = am−1+2 gcd(am−1,2) ≥ am−1+2 2 . Hence, am−1 ≤ 2. If am−1 = 1, then gcd(am−1, am) = 1, which is not allowed. Therefore, am−1 = 2. Hence, iteratively, we have that am−1 = am−2 = · · · = a1 = 2. So the only such sequence is the sequence where all terms are equal to 2. Hence, (a, b) = (2, 2) is the only solution. □ Source: Russian Math Olympiad 1999 N3 For a positive integer n, let f (n) be the largest prime divisor of n. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many positive integers n such that f (n) < f (n + 1) < f (n + 2). Solution 1: Let p ≥ 5 be an odd prime number and let mk = p2 k − 1 and nk = p 2 k + 1 (= mk + 2). Clearly, f (mk + 1) = p. Note also that nk − 2 = mk = (p − 1)(p + 1)(p2 + 1) · · · (p2 k−1 − 1) = (p − 1)n0n1 · · · nk−1. Note that nk = p2 k + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4. Hence, 4 ∤ nk and nk > 4. Therefore, nk contains an odd prime factor. Suppose q is an odd prime such that q | nk, ni for some 0 ≤ i < k − 1. Then q|2, which is impossible. Therefore, nk contains an odd prime factor which is not a prime factor of n0, n1, · · · , nk−1. Hence, let k be the smallest non-negative integer such that f (nk) > p. Since n0 = p + 1 and p + 1 is composite, implying f (n0) < p. Therefore, k ≥ 1. Hence, f (mk + 2) > p = f (mk + 1). Finally, note that mk = (p − 1)n0n1n2 · · · nk−1. By the choice of k and the fact that p ∤ ni, we have f (ni) < p for each i ∈ {0, 1, · · · , k − 1}. p + 1 is composite, which implies f (p + 1) < p. Hence, f (mk) < p. Therefore, f (mk) < f (mk + 1) < f (mk + 2). We now choose another prime p such that p > mk to generate another integer n larger than mk such that f (n) < f (n + 1) < f (n + 2). We repeat this process similarly to generate inﬁnitely many such positive integers. This completes the problem. □ Solution 2: Suppose the statement is false, i.e. there are only ﬁnitely many integers n such that f (n) < f (n + 1) < f (n + 2). Consider the number n = 2 k for some positive integer k. Note that f (n) = 2 and f (n + 1) > 2 = f (n). Since there are only ﬁnitely many k such that f (2k) < f (2 k + 1) < f (2k + 2), there exists a positive integer m such that k ≥ m implies f (2k) < f (2k + 1) and f (2k + 2) ≤ f (2k + 1). Since gcd(2 k + 1, 2 k + 2) = 1, f (2k + 2) < f (2k + 1). For k ≥ m, note that f (2 k + 2) = f (2 k−1 + 1), since every odd factor of 2k + 2 (which is ≥ 2) is also an odd factor of 2 k−1 + 1. Therefore, for k ≥ m, f (2 k−1 + 1) < f (2k + 1). Hence, f (2m + 1), f (2 m+1 + 1), f (2m+2 + 1), · · · is a strictly increasing sequence of integers. (*) 6 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 7 Let k ≥ m. Consider n = 2 2(2k−1) + 1 = (2 2k−1 + 1)2 − 2 · 2 2k−1 = (2 2k−1 − 2k + 1)(22k−1 + 2k + 1). Therefore, f (22(2k−1) + 1) = f (22k−1 + 2k + 1) or f (2 2(2k−1) + 1) = f (22k−1 − 2 k + 1). If the former holds, then f (22(2k−1) + 1) = f (22k−1 + 2k + 1) = f (2(2 2k−1 + 2k + 1)) = f ((2 k + 1)2) = f (2k + 1). Since 2(2k − 1) > k ≥ m, this contradicts (*). Therefore, f (2 2(2k−1) + 1) = f (22k−1 − 2 k + 1) for all k ≥ m. Since f (22(2k−1) + 1) > f (2k + 1) (since k ≥ m), we have that f (22k−1 − 2 k + 1) > f (2k + 1). Let n = 2 2k − 2 k+1 = 2 k+1(2k−1 − 1). Then f (n) = f (2 k−1 − 1), f (n + 1) = f (22k − 2k+1 + 1) = f ((2 k − 1) 2) = f (2 k − 1) and f (n + 2) = f (2 2k − 2 k+1 + 2) = f (22k−1 − 2 k + 1) > f (2 k − 1) = f (n + 1). If f (n) < f (n + 1) for inﬁnitely many choices of k, then we are done. Otherwise, there exists a positive integer M such that M > m and k ≥ M implies f (n) ≥ f (n + 1), i.e. f (2k−1 − 1) ≥ f (2k − 1). Since (2k − 1) − 2(2 k−1 − 1) = 1, gcd(2k−1 − 1, 2 k − 1) = 1. Hence, f (2k−1 − 1) > f (2k − 1) for all k ≥ M . Hence, for f (2 M − 1), f (2M +1 − 1), f (2M +2 − 1), · · · is an inﬁnite strictly decreasing sequence of positive integers, which is absurd. Hence, the statement of the problem is indeed true. □ Source: Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad 1995 Combinatorics C1 Let n ≥ 2 be a positive integer. An n × n grid is ﬁlled with the integers 1, 2, · · · , n 2 (with each number used exactly once). Let t be the maximum of the (positive) diﬀerence of the entries of two neighbouring squares, where two squares are said to be neighbours if they share at least one vertex. Determine the minimum possible value of t in terms of n. Solution: The answer is t = n + 1. The number of squares in the shortest sequence of successive neighbouring squares between any two squares is at most n − 1. Since both 1, n 2 are in the grid and diﬀer by n2 − 1, there are two neighbouring squares that diﬀer by at least n2−1 n−1 = n + 1. Hence, t ≥ n + 1. Consider the grid ﬁlled in order row by row 1, 2, · · · , n 2, i.e. place (i − 1)n + j in the i th row and the jth column. Two entries in such a conﬁguration diﬀer by at most n + 1. Hence, t = n + 1. □ Source: Unknown C2 A chessboard is tiled with 32 dominoes. Each domino covers two adjacent squares, a white and a black square. Show that the number of horizontal dominoes with the white square on the left of the black square equals the number of horizontal dominoes with the white square on the right of the black square. Solution: Let Si be the set of horizontal dominoes contained in columns i and i + 1 (obviously, all Si are disjoint). Then Si = Li ∪ Ri, where Li is the set of such dominoes with a white square on the left, and Ri is the set of such dominoes with a white square on the right. Since each column has an even number of rows, and an even number of those rows is taken up by vertical dominoes (each of them takes 2 rows), the horizontal dominoes must also occupy an even number of rows, so |Si−1 ∪ Si| is even for each i. Since |S1| is even, we must have that |Si| is even for each i. Consider the horizontal dominoes that intersect the ﬁrst column of the board. The space between any consecutive pair of horizontal dominoes is taken up by vertical dominoes. Each of those occupies 2 rows, so there is an even number of rows between the horizontal dominoes. Thus, if one of those dominoes is in L1, the other is in R1, and vice-versa. Since |S1| is even, we must have |L1| = |R1|. 7 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 8 We prove by induction that |Li| = |Ri| for each i. The base case is i = 1, shown above. Suppose |Li−1| = |Ri−1|. The set of horizontal dominoes that intersect column i is Si−1 ∪ Si. As in the i = 1 case, any consecutive pair of these dominoes has an even number of rows between them. Thus, the number of dominoes that use a black square in column i (|Li−1 ∪ Ri|) is the same as the number of dominoes that use a white square in column i (|Ri−1 ∪Li|). However, since |Li−1| = |Ri−1|, we must have that |Li| = |Ri|. Therefore, the total number of horizontal dominoes with a white square on the left (| ∪i Li|) equals the total number of horizontal dominoes with a white square on the right (| ∪i Ri|). □ Source: IMO Training 2006, General Problems C3 Let n > 1 be a positive integer. On each of 2n points around a circle we place a disk with one white side and one black side. We may perform the following move: select a black disk, and reverse its two neighbors. Find all initial conﬁgurations from which some sequence of such moves leads to a position where all disks but one are white. Solution: The answer is when the number of black disks initially is odd. Note that each move preserves the parity of the number of black disks on the circle. Hence, if the initial number of black disks is even, then we can never have one black disk remaining. Suppose there is an odd number of black disk. We deﬁne a group to be a maximal set of black disks that appear on consecutive points on the circle. Let k be the number of groups initially. I claim that if k > 1, after a ﬁnite number of moves, we can decrease the number of groups. Since there are an odd number of black disks, one group contains an odd number of disks. Suppose there are 2m − 1 disks in this group for some positive integer m. We label the disks 1, 2, · · · , 2m − 1 in clockwise order. By assumption, the disk next to 1 (which is not 2), which we now call 0, is white and the disk next to 2m − 1 (which is not 2m − 2), which we will call 2m, is also white. Note that since k > 1, disks 0 and 2m are distinct. We perform a move on disks 1, 3, 5, · · · , 2m − 1, in this order. In doing so, the disks 2, 4, · · · , 2m − 2 are each ﬂipped twice, and therefore, remain black. The only disks ﬂipped are 0 and 2m, which are now ﬂipped to black. Hence, this group increased by size at least 2. If it increased by more than 2, then this group merged with another group and the number of groups decreased. Otherwise, this group still has odd cardinality and we can repeat this process. Since there is another group, eventually, this group will merge with another group. Hence, we have decreased the number of groups. We repeat this process (by choosing another odd group). Eventually, the number of groups becomes one. By performing the steps in the previous paragraph, we have one group of black disks. There are an odd number of disks in this group, say 2m − 1 for some positive integer m. We again label the disks 1, 2, · · · , 2m − 1. If m = 1, then only one black disk remain and we are done. Otherwise, we choose the disks 2, 4, · · · , 2m − 2. Hence, disks 3, 5, · · · , 2m − 3 are ﬂipped twice, and thus remain the same colour. But disks 1 and 2m − 1 are changed to white. Hence, the group size decreased by 2. We can repeat this procedure until one black disk remains. We are done. □ Source: Japanese Mathematical Olympiad 1998 Geometry G1 The altitude from A of triangle ABC intersects the side BC at D. A circle is tangent to BC at D, intersects AB at M and N , and intersects AC at P and Q. Prove that AM + AN AC = AP + AQ AB . 8 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 9 Solution 1: By Power of a Point, we have that BM · BN = BD2 and CP · CQ = CD2. Hence, (AB − AM )(AB − AN ) = BD2 ⇒ AB2 − AB(AM + AN ) + AM · AN = BD2 ⇒ AB2 − BD2 = AB(AM + AN ) − AM · AN . Similarly, AC 2 − CD2 = AC(AP + AQ) − AP · AQ. But AB2 − BD2 = AD2 = AC 2 − CD2 by Pythagorean Theorem and AM · AN = AP · AQ by Power of a Point. Hence, AB(AM + AN ) = AC(AP + AQ), as desired. □ Solution 2: Let O be the centre of the circle. Since the circle is tangent to BC at D and AD ⊥ BC, O lies on AD. Let U , V be the feet of the perpendicular on AB, AC from O, respectively. Therefore, U, V are midpoints of M N, P Q, respectively. This implies AM + AN = 2 · AU and AP + AQ = 2 · AV . Hence, it suﬃces to show that AU AC = AV AB . Since AU = AO cos ∠BAO, AC = AD cos ∠CAO , AV = AO cos ∠CAO, AB = AD cos ∠BAO , this equation is true, as desired □. 2 Source: IMO Correspondence program, 1995-96 G2 Let P be a convex 2010-gon.

Suppose AC, BD, M N are concurrent at a point P . Then AB||CD and ∆P AB ∼ ∆P CD. Proof of Lemma: Let l be a line passing through B parallel to CD and intersecting P A at a point A′. Let M ′ be the midpoint of A′B. Since ∆P A ′B ∼ ∆P CD, ∆P AM ′ ∼ ∆P CN . Hence, ∠A′P M ′ = ∠CP N , i.e. M ′ lies on P N . Suppose A ̸= A′. Then M ̸= M ′. Since M also lies on P N , M M ′ is parallel to AP . But they intersect at P , contradicting the fact that they are parallel. Therefore, A = A′. Therefore, AB||CD. Subsequently, ∠P BA = ∠P DC and ∠P AB = ∠P CD, we have that ∆P AB ∼ ∆P CD. End Proof of Lemma Let A1, A2, · · · , A2010 be the vertices appearing clockwise of the 2010-gon and Mi the midpoint of Ai and Ai+1. Then Ai and Ai+1005 are opposite vertices. Let P be the concurrent point of the 2010 lines. Since AiAi+1005, Ai+1Ai+1006, MiM1005 are concurrent at P , consider the quadrilateral AiAi+1Ai+1005Ai+1006. Since the polygon is convex, this quadrilateral is convex. By the Lemma, we have that AiAi+1 is parallel to Ai+1005Ai+1006. Hence, opposite sides of the polygon are parallel. By the similarities, we have that P A1 P A1006 = P A2 P A1007 = P A3 P A1008 = · · · = P A2010 P A1005 . More importantly, we have P Ai Ai+1005 = P Ai+1005 P Ai+2010 = P Ai+1005 P Ai , since the indices are taken modulo 2010. Hence, |P Ai| = |P Ai+1005|. Therefore, since by the Lemma that ∆P AiAi+1 ∼ ∆P Ai+1005Ai+1006, we have |AiAi+1| = |Ai+1005Ai+1006|. Hence, the opposite sides of the 2We can also prove AU AC = AV AB by noting ∆AOU ∼ ∆ABD and ∆AOV ∼ ∆ACD. 9 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 10 polygon are equal in length. □ Source: Brazilian Mathematical Olympiad 2006, modiﬁed in the obvious way Alternate Proof of Lemma: It suﬃces to prove AP BP = CP DP . By Sine Law, we have that AP BP = AP AM · BM BP = sin ∠AM P sin ∠AP M · sin ∠BP M sin ∠BM P = sin ∠BP M sin ∠AP M , since ∠AM P + ∠BM P = 180 ◦. Similarly, we have CP DP = sin ∠DP N sin ∠CP N = sin ∠BP M sin ∠AP M . Therefore, AP BP = CP DP . End Proof of Lemma. G3 Two circles meet at A and B. Line ℓ passes through A and meets the circles again at C and D respectively. Let M and N be the midpoints of arcs BC and BD which do not contain A, and let K be the midpoint of CD. Prove that ∠M KN = 90 ◦. Solution 1: Let X, Y be the midpoints of BC, BD, respectively. Note that M X ⊥ BC and N Y ⊥ BD. Also note that KY ||BC and KX||BD. Hence, KXBY is a parallelogram. Since |N B| = |N D| and |M B| = |M C|, ∠BN Y = 1 2 ∠BN D = 1 2 ∠BAC = ∠M AC = ∠M BC. Since ∠BXM = ∠N Y B = 90 ◦, we conclude that ∆BXM ∼ ∆N Y B. Observe that |M X| |KY | = |M X| |XB| = |BY | |Y N | = |XK| |Y N | . Also, ∠M XK = 90 ◦ + ∠BXK = ∠90◦ + ∠KY B = ∠KY N . Hence, ∆M XK ∼ ∆KY N . Finally, ∠M KN = ∠XKY − ∠XKM − ∠N KY = ∠XKY − ∠XKM − ∠XM K = ∠XKY − (180 ◦ − ∠M XK) = ∠XKY − 180 + 90 + ∠BXK = 180 − 180 + 90 = 90 ◦, (with the second last assertion following from the fact that KY ||XB), as desired. □ Solution 2: (Inversion solution:) Since M, N are midpoints of the arcs BC and BD, respectively, AM bisects ∠BAC and AN bisects ∠BAD. Therefore, ∠M AN = 90 ◦. To prove ∠M KN = 90 ◦, it suﬃces to prove that AM N K is cyclic. We will invert the diagram about the point A with radius 1. For each object X, let X ′ be its image under the inversion. Since ABM C is cyclic, B′, M ′, C ′ are collinear. Since AM bisects ∠BAC, AM ′ bisects ∠B′AC ′. Similarly, B′, N ′, D′ are collinear and AN ′ bisects ∠B′AD′. The point K ′ lies on C ′D′ external to segment C ′D′. To prove that M ′, N ′, K ′ are collinear, by Menelaus’ Theorem, it suﬃces to prove that |C ′M ′| |M ′B′| · |B′N ′| |N ′D′| · |D′K ′| |K ′C ′| = 1. By angle bisector theorem, we have that |C′M ′| |M ′B′| = |AC′| |AB′| and |B′N ′| |N ′D′| = |AB′| |AD′| . Hence, it suﬃces to show that |C ′A| |AD′| = |C ′K ′| |K ′D′| . 10 Winter Camp 2010 Buﬀet Contest 11 By properties of inversion, we know that |K ′C ′| = |KC| · |AC ′| |AK| , |K ′D′| = |KD| · |AK ′| |AD| . Since K is the midpoint of CD, |KC| = |KD|. Hence, |K ′C ′| |K ′D′| = |AC ′| · |AD| |AK| · |AK ′| = |AC ′| · |AD| |AD′| · |AD| = |AC ′| |AD′| , as desired. □ Solution 3: (Harmonic Division solution:) Using the notation of Solution 2, it suﬃces to prove that |C ′A| |AD′| = |C ′K ′| |K ′D′| , i.e. (K ′, A) divides (C ′, D′) harmonically. But since K is the midpoint of CD, (K, ∞) divides (C, D) harmonically. Since the property that a harmonic quadruple is preserved under inversion of a point on the same line as the quadruple 3, this implies (K ′, A) divides (C ′, D′) harmonically, as desired. □ Source: Romanian Team Selection Test 1999 3The proof of this fact is similar to the last step of Solution 2. 11","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
