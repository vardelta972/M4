The purpose of this note is to give an introductory lesson about this issue and the structure behind it and to present some examples of how this knowledge can be used at olympiad problems. 1 Prerequisites 1.1 The M¨obius Inversion Deﬁnition 1. The M¨obius Function µ : Z + → {−1, 0, 1} is deﬁned as follows: µ(n) =    1 if n = 1 (−1) k if n is squarefree and k is the number of prime divisors of n 0 else. Evidentially, µ is multiplicative, that is, µ(mn) = µ(m)µ(n) for all coprime positive integers m, n. Theorem 1. Let n be a positive integer. Then ∑ d|n µ(d) = { 1 if n = 1 0 if n ≥ 2. Proof. The claim is obvious for n = 1. Suppose that n ≥ 2. Let T be the product of all prime numbers dividing n, that is, T = ∏ p prime p|n p. 1 Every divisor of n that does not divide T is not square-free and thus drops out of the sum. We hence obtain ∑ d|n µ(d) = ∑ d|T µ(d). Let p be any prime number dividing T . Then ∑ d|T = ∑ d| T Theorem 2 is closely related to the following theorem which, in rudimentary terms, can be reduced to Theorem 2 by taking the logarithms: Theorem 3. Suppose that F, f : Z + → Z + are functions so that F (n) = ∏ d|n f (d). Then f (n) = ∏ d|n F ( n Deﬁnition 3. Let n be a positive integer and ζ be an nth root of unity. Then the smallest positive intege k that satisﬁes ζ k = 1 is called the order of ζ and is denoted by ord(ζ). Lemma 1. Let n be a positive integer and ζ be an nth root of unity. Then for every integer k, ζ k = 1 if and only if ord(ζ) | k. In particular, ord(ζ) | n. Proof. Let d = ord(ζ). If d | k, then obviously ζ k = 1. On the other hand, suppose that ζ k = 1. By the integer division algorithm there exist integers q, r with 0 ≤ r ≤ d − 1 so that k = qd + r. Then 1 = ζ k = ζ qd+r = ζ r. But 0 ≤ r < d and d is the smallest positive integer satisfying ζ d = 1, so r = 0. 2 Cyclotomic Polynomials 2.1 Deﬁnition and Elementary Properties Deﬁnition 5. Let n be a positive integer. Then the nth cyclotomic polynomial, denoted as Φn, is the (monic) polynomial having exactly the primitive nth root of unity as roots, that is, Φn(X) ≡ ∏ ζ n=1 ord(ζ)=n (X − ζ). Since there are exactly ϕ(n) primitive nth roots of unity, the degree of Φn is ϕ(n). In the following, I will present some elementary properties of cyclotomic polynomials which can also be very useful at competitions. Theorem 4. Let n be a positive integer. Then X n − 1 ≡ ∏ d|n Φd(X). Proof. The roots of X n − 1 are exactly the nth roots of unity. On the other hand, if ζ is an nth root of unity and d = ord(ζ), then ζ is a primitive dth root of unity and thus a root of Φd(X). But d | n, so ζ is a root of the right hand side. It follows that the polynomials on the left and right hand side have the same roots and since they are both monic, they are equal. minimality of M. Similary, there exists an integer j ∈ {0, . . . , n} so that p ∤ Bj. Let I and J be the greatest integers among these numbers i and j respectively. Then the coeﬃcient of X I+J in MNf (X)g(X) is AIBJ + p · R where R is an integer, so in particular, it is not divisible by p which contradicts the coeﬃcients of MNf (X)g(X) being divisible by MN. However, d | pn and d ∤ n implies that p2 | d (since p | n), so d is not squarefree and thus µ(d) = 0. Thus, ∏ d|pn d∤n (X pn Comparing coeﬃcients, we see that the coeﬃcient of y on the right hand side is 0. By the binomial theorem, the coeﬃcient of y on the left hand side is na n−1. It follows that na n−1 ≡ 0 (mod p). But p ∤ a, so p | n. Theorem 7. Let a and b be positive integers. Suppose that gcd(Φa(x), Φb(x)) > 1 for some integer x. Then a/b is the integral power of a prime number, that is, a/b = pk for a prime number p and an integer k. Proof. Suppose that p is a common prime divisor of Φa(x) and Φb(x). We will show that a/b must be a power of p. Suppose that a = pαA and b = pβB where α, β ≥ 0 are integers and A, B are positive integers not divisible by p. We shall show that A = B. Since p | Φa(x) | x a − 1, we have p ∤ x. We shall ﬁrst show that p | ΦA(x). This is trivial if α = 0. Otherwise, if α > 1, it follows from Corollary 4 that 0 ≡ Φa(x) = ΦA(x pα) Another nice application is a generalisation of a problem from the IMO Shortlist 2002: Problem 1 (IMO Shortlist 2002). Let p1, p2, . . . , pn be distinct primes greater than 3. Show that 2p1p2...pn + 1 has at least 4n divisors. The oﬃcial solution comments that using cyclotomic polynomials, it can be shown that 2p1p2...pn + 1 has at least 2 2n−1 divisors (which is much more than 4n when n is large). We are going to prove this generalisation now. Problem 2. Let p1, p2, . . . , pn be distinct primes greater than 3. Show that 2p1p2...pn + 1 has at least 22n−1 divisors. Solution. It is suﬃcient to prove that 2 p1...pn + 1 has at least 2 n−1 pairwise coprime divisors and hence at least 2n−1 distinct prime divisors. We know that (2p1...pn − 1) (2p1...pn + 1) = 22p1...pn − 1 = ∏ d|2p1...pn Φd(2) =   ∏ d|p1...pn Φd(2)     ∏ d|p1...pn Φ2d(2)   = (2p1...pn − 1)   ∏ d|p1...pn Φ2d(2)   and hence, 2p1...pn + 1 = ∏ d|p1...pn Φ2d(2). From Theorem 7, we know that if Φa(2) and Φb(2) are not coprime, then a/b must be a prime power. We thus have to prove that there exists a set of 2 n−1 divisors of p1 . . . pn so that no two of them diﬀer by exactly one prime number. But this is obvious because we can take the divisors of p1 . . . pn which have an even number of prime divisors and since there are equally many divisors having an even number of prime divisors and divisors having an odd number of prime divisors, there exist exactly 2 n−1 of them. 7 or congruent to 1 modulo 7. Thus, (y − 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7) or (y − 1) ≡ 1 (mod 7), that is, y ≡ 1 (mod 7) or y ≡ 2 (mod 7). If y ≡ 1 (mod 7) then 1 + y + . . . + y4 ≡ 5 ̸≡ 0, 1 (mod 7), a contradiction and if y ≡ 2 (mod 7) then 1 + y + . . . + y4 ≡ 31 ≡ 3 ̸≡ 0, 1 (mod 7), also a contradiction. Hence, this equation has no integer solutions.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
