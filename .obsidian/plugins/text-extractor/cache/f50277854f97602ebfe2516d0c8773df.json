Draw a line perpendicular to AI at I. Let it intersect AC in E. Prove that IE = IF . Solution: Extend EI to meet CB extended in D. First observe that ADBI is a cyclic quadrilateral since ∠AID = ∠ABD. Hence ∠ADI = ∠ABI = 45◦. Hence ∠DAI = 45 ◦. Therefore IA = ID. Consider the triangles AIE and DIF . Both are right triangles. Moreover ∠IAE = ∠IAB = ∠IDB. Since IA = ID, the triangles are congruent. This means IE = IF . 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a 1 + b + b 1 + c + c 1 + a = 1. Prove that abc ≤ 1/8. Solution: This is equivalent to ∑ a(1 + c)(1 + a) = (1 + a)(1 + b)(1 + c). This simpliﬁes to ∑ a 2 + ∑ a 2c = 1 + abc Using AM-GM inequality, we have 1 + abc = ∑ a 2 + ∑ a 2c ≥ 3(abc)2/3 + 3abc. Let x = (abc) 1/3. Then 3x2 + 2x3 ≤ 1. This can be written as (x + 1)2(2x − 1) ≤ 0. Hence x ≤ 1/2. Thus abc ≤ 1 8 . 3. For any natural number n, expressed in base 10, let S(n) denote the sum of all digits of n. Find all natural numbers n such that n3 = 8S(n) 3 + 6nS(n) + 1. Solution: We write the given condition as n 3 + (−2S(n))3 + (−1)3 = 3 × n × (−2S(n)) × (−1). This is in the form x3 + y3 + z3 = 3xyz. We know that this can happen if and only if x + y + z = 0. Thus we obtain a simpler condition n − 2S(n) − 1 = 0. Again we know that n − S(n) is divisible by 9. Hence 9 should divide S(n) + 1. It is easy to see that the number of digits in n cannot be more than 2. For a three digit number maximum value of S(n) can be 27 and 2S(n) + 1 ≤ 55.. Hence n is either a 1-digit number or a two digit number. Hence S(n) ≤ 18. Since 9 divides S(n) + 1, we can have S(n) = 8 or S(n) = 17. But then n = 17 or n = 35. Among these n = 17 works but not 35. (S(35) = 8 and 2S(n) + 1 = 17 ̸= 35.) Hence the only solution is n = 17. 4. How many 6-digit natural numbers containing only the digits 1, 2, 3 are there in which 3 occurs exactly twice and the number is divisible by 9? Solution: Let S(n) be the sum of the digits of n. Then n ≡ S(n) (mod 9). For any admissible n we observe that 10 ≤ S(n) ≤ 14 and hence there is no value of S(n) that is a multiple of 9. Thus no such n exists. 5. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let AD be the bisector of ∠A with D on BC. Let the circumcircle of triangle ACD intersect AB again in E; and let the circumcircle of triangle ABD intersect AC again in F . Let K be the reﬂection of E in the line BC. Prove that F K = BC. Solution: First we show that EB = F C. Con- sider the triangles EBD and CF D. Observe that ∠CF D = 90◦ since ∠AF D = 90◦ (angle in a semi- circle). Hence ∠CF D = ∠EBD. Since ACDE is a cyclic quadrilateral, we have ∠CDE = 180 ◦ − ∠A. Similarly, we see that AF DB is a cyclic quadrilateral and therefore ∠F DB = 180 ◦ − ∠A. Thus we obtain ∠CDE = ∠F DB. This gives ∠F DC = ∠BDE. It follows △EBD ∼ △CF D. Since AD bisects ∠A, we have DB = DF . Hence △EBD ∼= △CF D. Hence F C = EB = BK. We also observe that AF = AB since △ABD ∼= △AF D. It follows that F B ∥ CK. Since F C = BK, we conclude that CKDF is an siosceles trapezium. This gives F K = BC. Alternate solution: First we show that K, D, F are collinear. Observe that ∠F DB = 180 ◦ − ∠A by the concyclicity of AF DB. Moreover ∠BDK = ∠BDE = ∠A. Therefore ∠KDF = 180 ◦. This proves that KDF is a line segment. Consider the triangles AKF and ABC. Since both are right-angled triangles and ∠A is common, they are similar. We also see that △AF D ∼= △ABD since ∠AF D = ∠ABD = 90◦, ∠F AD = ∠BAD = ∠A/2 and AD common. Hence AF = AB. This implies now that △AF K ∼= △ABC. Hence KF = BC. 6. Show that the inﬁnite arithmetic progression ⟨1, 4, 7, 10, . . .⟩ has inﬁnitely many 3-term subsequences in harmonic progression such that for any two such triples ⟨a1, a2, a3⟩ and ⟨b1, b2, b3⟩ in harmonic progression, one has a1 b1 ̸= a2 b2 ( a2 b2 ̸= a3 b3 ) . Solution: Consider ⟨4, 7, 28⟩. We observe that 1 4 + 1 28 = 2 7 . Thus we look for the terms of the form a, b, ab which give a HP. The condition is 1 a + 1 ab = 2 b . This reduces to b(1 + b) = 2ab or 2a = 1 + b. The terms of the given AP are of the form 3k + 1. If we take a = 3k + 1, then b = 2a − 1 = 6k + 1. We observe that b is also a term of the gven AP. 2 Besides, ab = (3k + 1)(6k + 1) = 3(6k2 + 3k) + 1 is again a term of the given AP. Thus the triple of the form ⟨3k + 1, 6k + 1, (3k + 1)(6k + 1)⟩ form a HP. We observe that 3k + 1 3l + 1 ̸= 6k + 1 6l + 1 ̸= (3k + 1)(6k + 1) (3l + 1)(6l + 1) . ———-0———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
