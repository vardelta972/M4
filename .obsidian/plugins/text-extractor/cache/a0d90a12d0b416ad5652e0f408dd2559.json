Further on, we analyse relationships between properties of the roots of a cubic and properties of its coeﬃcients (which are symmetric polynomials of the roots). This analysis is then used to derive a number of triangle- geometric inequalities. We restrict ourselves throughout to polynomials in three variables. The results of Sections 2-3, however, hold (with appropriately generalized statements and proofs) for symmetric polynomials in arbitrarily many variables. 2 The Fundamental Theorem A polynomial F (x, y, z) is said to be symmetric if F (x, y, z) = F (x, z, y) = F (y, x, z) = F (y, z, x) = F (z, x, y) = F (z, y, x). Example 1. F (x, y, z) = x3yz + xy3z + xyz3. The three polynomials σ1(x, y, z) = x + y + z, σ2(x, y, z) = xy + yz + zx, σ3(x, y, z) = xyz. are the best-known examples. For instance, they appear in Vieta’s theorem expressing the coeﬃcients of a polynomial in terms of its roots. They are called elementary symmetric polynomials. Of course there are many other important symmetric polynomials, e.g. ∆(x, y, z) = (x − y)2(y − z)2(z − x) 2, but the importance of the elementary symmetric polynomials stems from the main theorem of this section, which will assert that all symmetric polynomials can be expressed as polynomials in the elementary symmetric polynomials σ1, σ2, σ3. To start on the proof of this theorem, let us consider ﬁrstly the monomials xk1 yk2zk3 of a ﬁxed degree n = k1 + k2 + k3. We consider these monomials as words in the alphabet of the three letters x, y, z. Let us write down all the monomials in the lexicographic (vocabularly) order. For instance, for n = 3 we shall have: x3 > x 2y > x2z > xy2 > xyz > xz2 > y3 > y2z > yz2 > z3, where the sign “>” means lexicographically earlier. In general, for two monomials of degree n we write x k1yk2 zk3 > x m1ym2zm3 1 if k1 > m1 or if k1 = m1 and k2 > m2 and say that the ﬁrst monomial is earlier than the second one. Let F (x, y, z) be a symmetric polynomial which monomials are all of the same degree n. Among them there is a monomial that are earlier of all other monomials of F (x, y, z). We shall call it the leading monomial of F (x, y, z). Example 2. The leading monomial of F (x, y, z) = x3yz + xy3z + xyz3 is x3yz. Lemma 1. A monomial xk1yk2 zk3 is a leading monomial of some symmetric polynomial if and only if k1 ≥ k2 ≥ k3. If k1 ≥ k2 ≥ k3 the monomial xk1 yk2zk3 is the leading monomial of σk1−k2 1 σk2−k3 2 σk3 3 . Proof. If, for instance, k1 < k2, then the monomial xk1yk2zk3 cannot be the leading monomial of a symmetric polynomial F (x, y, z), because F (x, y, z) = F (y, x, z) contains also a monomial xk2 yk1zk3 which is earlier than xk1 yk2zk3. The case k2 < k3 is similar. The leading monomial of σk1−k2 1 σk2−k3 2 σk3 3 is equal to the product of the leading monomials of σk1−k2 1 , σk2−k3 2 and σk3 3 , that is xk1−k2 · (xy) k2−k3 · (xyz) k3 = xk1yk2 zk3 . Now we can prove the main theorem of the section. Theorem 2 (Fundamental Theorem). For any symmetric polynomial F (x, y, z) there exists a (not necessarily symmetric) polynomial f (u, v, w) such that F (x, y, z) = f (σ1, σ2, σ3). Proof. We sketch an algorithm for constructing f . Let xk1yk2zk3 be the leading monomial of F (x, y, z). Then k1 ≥ k2 ≥ k3 and the polynomial σk1−k2 1 σk2−k3 2 σk3 3 has the same leading monomial. Consider F1(x, y, z) = F (x, y, z) − σk1−k2 1 σk2−k3 2 σk3 3 . This polynomial is also symmetric but its leading monomial is later than that of F (x, y, z). This process of reducing of leading monomials can be continued. Since we have only ﬁnite number of monomials of a ﬁxed degree, ﬁnally we shall obtain the required presentation of F (x, y, z). Example 3. In this example we shall not use the complete algorithm exposed in the proof of Theorem 2 since an easier way is possible. Consider δ(x, y, z) = (x + y − z)(y + z − x)(z + x − y). Then δ(x, y, z) = −σ3 1 + 4σ1σ2 − 8σ3. The following computation shows that this is true: δ(x, y, z) = (σ1 − 2z)(σ1 − 2x)(σ1 − 2y) = σ3 1 − 2(x + y + z)σ2 1 + 4(xy + yz + zx)σ1 − 8xyz = −σ3 1 + 4σ1σ2 − 8σ3. Example 4. Here the complete algorithm cannot be avoided. We leave the routine computation to the reader. ∆(x, y, z) = −4σ3 1σ3 + σ2 1σ2 2 + 18σ1σ2σ3 − 4σ3 2 − 27σ2 3. Exercise 1. Express the following symmetric polynomials as polynomials of σ1, σ2, σ3: (a) x2 + y2 + z2; 2 (b) x3 + y3 + z3; (c) x4 + y4 + z4; (d) x2y + y2z + z2x + xy2 + yz2 + zx 2; (e) x2y2 + y2z2 + z2x2. Exercise 2. Check Example 4. Exercise 3. Express as a function of σ1, σ2, σ3: (a) 1 x2 + 1 y2 + 1 z2 ; (b) 1 xy + 1 yz + 1 zx . 3 Muirhead’s theorem Let us consider the set Sn of sequences (α) = (α1, . . . , αn) with the following two properties: • α1 + α2 + . . . + αn = 1, • α1 ≥ α2 ≥ . . . ≥ αn ≥ 0. For any two sequences (α) and (β) from S we say that (α) majorises (β) if α1 + α2 + . . . + αr ≥ β1 + β2 + . . . + βr for all 1 ≤ r < n. We denote this as (α) ≽ (β). If (α) ≽ (β) and (α) ̸= (β), we will write (α) ≻ (β). Example 5. (1, 0, 0) ≻ ( 1 2 , 1 2 , 0) ≻ ( 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 6 ) ≻ ( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ). Now we introduce one more notation: for (α) from Sn we denote x(α) = 1 n! (xα1 1 xα2 2 . . . x αn n + . . .), where the dots denote all n! − 1 terms obtained by permutations of α’s. Example 6. Let n = 3. Then x(1,0,0) = 1 6 (x1 1x0 2x0 3 + x1 1x0 3x0 2 + x0 1x1 2x0 3 + x0 1x1 2x0 3 + x0 1x0 2x1 3 + x0 1x0 2x1 3) = 1 3 (x1 + x2 + x3); x ( 1 2 , 1 2 ,0) = 1 6 (x 1 2 1 x 1 2 2 x0 3 + x 1 2 1 x 1 2 2 x0 3 + x0 1x 1 2 2 x 1 2 3 + x0 1x 1 2 2 x 1 2 3 + x 1 2 1 x0 2x 1 2 3 + x 1 2 1 x0 2x 1 2 3 ) = 1 3 (√x1x2 + √x1x3 + √x2x3); x( 1 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ) = 3√x1x2x3. Theorem 3 (Muirhead). If (α) ≽ (β), then the inequality x(α) ≥ x(β) holds for all non-negative x1, . . . , xn. There is equality only when either (α) = (β) or all the xi are equal. 3 Proof. We will prove this theorem for the case n = 3. The general case can be proved similarly. We assume that (α) ̸= (β) and not all the xi are equal. Let us consider the following three partial cases from which the general case will follow. (a) Let (α) = (α1, α2, α3), and ρ be a positive real number such that ρ < α1−α2 and (α′) = (α1−ρ, α2+ρ, α3). Then 3! (x(α) − x(α′)) = (xα1 1 xα2 2 + xα2 1 xα1 2 − xα ′ 1 1 x α′ 2 2 − xα ′ 2 1 xα′ 1 2 )xα3 3 +(xα1 1 xα2 3 + x α2 1 xα1 3 − xα ′ 1 1 xα ′ 2 3 − xα ′ 2 1 xα ′ 1 3 )xα3 2 +(xα1 2 xα2 3 + xα2 2 xα1 3 − xα ′ 1 2 x α′ 2 3 − xα ′ 2 2 xα′ 1 3 )xα3 1 . We claim the right-hand side is positive. Indeed, certainly for any xi and xj, xα1 i xα2 j + xα2 i xα1 j − x α′ 1 i xα ′ 2 j − xα′ 2 i xα ′ 1 j = (xixj) α2 [ (xα1−α2−ρ i − xα1−α2−ρ j )(xρ i − xρ j ) ] ≥ 0, since the two round-bracketed diﬀerences are either both non-negative or both non-positive. Moreover, since not all the xi are equal, at least one of x1 ̸= x2, x1 ̸= x3, x2 ̸= x3 will hold, securing strict inequality. So x(α) > x (α ′) as required. (b) Similarly, if ρ < α2 − α3 and (α′′) = (α1, α2 − ρ, α3 + ρ), then x(α) > x (α ′′). (c) The same argument also shows that if α2 = α′ 2, then, for any ρ ≤ (α1 −α2), and (α′′′) = (α1 −ρ, α2, α3 +ρ), then x(α) > x (α ′′′). Suppose now that α2 < β2. Then α2 < β1, and ρ = α1 − β1 < α1 − α2. Then by (a), x(α) > x(α ′), where (α′) = (α1 − ρ, α2 + ρ, α3) = (β1, α2 + ρ, α3). As α3 < β3, α2 + ρ > β2, hence x(α′) > x(β) by (b). Thus x(α) > x (β), as required. The case α2 > β2 is dealt with similarly using (b) and (a). If α2 = β2, then the statement follows straight from (c). Example 7. For all non-negative x1, x2, x3 1 3 (x1 + x2 + x3) ≥ 1 3 (√x1x2 + √x1x3 + √x2x3) ≥ 3√x1x2x3 or, after substitution a = √x1, b = √x2, c = √x3, 1 3 (a 2 + b2 + c 2) ≥ 1 3 (ab + ac + bc) ≥ 3√a2b2c2. Exercise 4. Prove that for all non-negative a, b, c the following two inequalities hold: a 3 + b 3 + c 3 ≥ a 2(b + c) + b2(c + a) + c2(a + b), a 3 + b 3 + c 3 ≥ a 2b + b2c + c2a. Establish when these are equalities. 4 Cubic polynomials and their roots Theorem 4. Let a, b, c be the roots (real or complex) of a cubic equation x3 − σ1x2 + σ2x − σ3 = 0. (1) Then any symmetric function of the roots a, b, c is a polynomial function of the coeﬃcients σ1, σ2, σ3. Proof. Follows from Vieta’s theorem and the Fundamental Theorem. 4 The value ∆(a, b, c) = (a − b)2(b − c) 2(c − a) 2, is known as the discriminant of the equation (1). We know it is equal to ∆(a, b, c) = −4σ3 1σ3 + σ2 1σ2 2 + 18σ1σ2σ3 − 4σ3 2 − 27σ2 3. Theorem 5. Let σ1, σ2, σ3 be real. Then the equation (1) has exactly three (possibly repeated) real roots if and only if − 4σ3 1σ3 + σ2 1σ2 2 + 18σ1σ2σ3 − 4σ3 2 − 27σ2 3 ≥ 0. (2) If σ1 ≥ 0, σ2 ≥ 0, σ3 ≥ 0 all these roots are positive. These roots are the lengths of sides of a (nondegenerate) triangle if and only if in addition − σ3 1 + 4σ1σ2 − 8σ3 > 0. (3) Proof. Let a, b, c be the roots of (1). If all of them are real, then obviously ∆(a, b, c) = −4σ3 1σ3 + σ2 1σ2 2 + 18σ1σ2σ3 − 4σ3 2 − 27σ2 3 ≥ 0. Suppose now that (2) holds, i.e ∆(a, b, c) ≥ 0. It is known that either all roots a, b, c are real or one of them is real and the other two are complex conjugates. We will show that the later case cannot occur. Indeed, if a is real, b = z, c = z, then ∆(a, b, c) = (a − z)2(z − z)2(z − a)2 = [(a − z)(a − z)] 2 (2ℑ(z)z) 2 · i 2 = (a 2 − 2ℜ(z) · a + |z|2)2 · 4(ℑ(z)z)2 · (−1) < 0, where z = ℜ(z) + iℑ(z). Moreover, (3) together with Example 3 shows that δ(a, b, c) = (a + b − c)(b + c − a)(c + a − b) > 0. Either all three factors are positive and we can construct a triangle or two factors are negative. The later case cannot happen since if, for instance, a + b − c < 0 and b + c − a < 0, adding these two inequalities we obtain 2b < 0. Corollary 6. A cubic equation x3 + px + q = 0, (4) where p and q are real, has three real roots if and only if ∆ = −4p 3 − 27q2 ≥ 0. Note that any cubic with real coeﬃcients can be reduced to a cubic of the form (4) by a simple substitution. 5 Triangle geometry Recall that the lengths of the sides a, b, c of a triangle ABC are the roots of the cubic equation x3 − 2px2 + (p 2 + r2 + 4rR)x − 4prR = 0, where p, r and R are the semiperimeter, inradius and circumradius respectively of ABC. Theorem 7. Three positive numbers p, r, R are the semiperimeter, inradius and circumradius respectively of some triangle, if and only if (p 2 − 2R2 − 10Rr + r2) 2 ≤ 4R(R − 2r) 3. (5) 5 Proof. We want to show that the roots of the cubic x3 − 2px2 + (p2 + r2 + 4rR)x − 4prR = 0 are the sides of a triangle. To do this we use Theorem 5 about the relationship between properties of a cubic’s roots and properties of its coeﬃcients. First, we need to show that the roots of this cubic are real. Theorem 5 says this happens if and only if the cubic’s coeﬃcients satisfy condition (2). Substituting and manipulating, we ﬁnd this to be equivalent to the condition (5) speciﬁed. Next we need to show that all three roots of the cubic are positive; this is clear by Theorem 5, since 2p, p 2 + r2 + 4rR and 4prR are all positive. Finally we will check that the roots of our cubic are the sides of a triangle, using Theorem 5’s further condition (3). Indeed, for every positive p, r, R we have −(2p) 3 + 4(2p)(p2 + r2 + 4rR) − 8 · 4prR = 8pr2 > 0. Corollary 8. For any triangle ABC, (a) 27r2 ≤ 16Rr − 5r2 ≤ p2 ≤ 4R2 + 4Rr + 3r2 ≤ 27 7 R2. (b) 3√3r ≤ p ≤ 3 √3 2 R. These inequalities become equalities if and only if the triangle ABC is equilateral. Proof. By Theorem 7, 2R2 + 10Rr − r2 − 2(R − 2r) √R(R − 2r) ≤ p 2 ≤ 2R2 + 10Rr − r2 + 2(R − 2r) √R(R − 2r). It follows that 2R2 + 10rR − r2 − 2(R − 2R)√ R(R − 2r) = 16rR − 5r2 + [(R − 2r) − √ R(R − 2r) ]2 ≥ 16rR − 5r2 and 2R2 + 10rR − r2 + 2(R − 2r) √R(R − 2r) = 4R2 + 4rR + 3r2 − [ (R − 2r) − √R(R − 2r) ]2 ≤ 4R2 + 4rR + 3r2. In both cases equality occurs if R = 2r which means by Euler’s theorem that ABC is equilateral. Using R ≥ 2r we conclude further 16rR − 5r2 ≥ 27r2, 4R2 + 4rR + 3r2 ≤ 27 4 R2. This proves (a). Part (b) follows directly. Theorem 9. If S is the area of a triangle ABC, then r ≤ 4√3 3 √S ≤ √3 9 p ≤ 1 2 R. If equality occurs in any of these, then ABC is equilaterial. 6 Proof. By the second part of Theorem 8, r ≤ √3 9 p ≤ 1 2 R, so we need only prove the inequalities involving S. Indeed, applying the second part of Theorem 8 again gives S = pr ≥ 3 √3r2, that is, r ≤ 1 3 √√3S = 4√3 3 √S. Also by Theorem 8’s ﬁrst part, S = pr ≤ 3 √3 2 Rr = 1 3 √3 · 27 2 Rr ≤ 1 3 √3 (16Rr − 5r2) ≤ p 2 3√3 , whence 1 3 √√3S ≤ √3 9 p. Example 8 (IMO, 1962). Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle of an area S. Prove that a 2 + b 2 + c2 ≥ 4√3S. Solution. Using both parts of Theorem 8, a 2 + b2 + c 2 = σ2 1 − 2σ2 = (2p) 2 − 2(p 2 + r2 + 4rR) = 2p 2 − 2r2 − 8rR ≥ 32rR − 12r2 − 8rR = 24rR − 12r2 ≥ 18rR ≥ 18r · 2 3√3 p = 4√3S. Many other problems can be solved by this technique. Exercise 5. Prove that (a) 36r2 ≤ 20rR − 4r2 ≤ ab + bc + ca ≤ 4(r + R) 2 ≤ 9R2; (b) 24 √3r3 ≤ 12√3r2R ≤ abc ≤ 6√3rR2 ≤ 3 √3R3; (c) √3 R ≤ 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≤ √3R 4r2 ; (d) 1 R2 ≤ 1 ab + 1 bc + 1 ca ≤ 1 4r2 ; (e) 1 R2 ≤ 1 a2 + 1 b2 + 1 c2 ≤ 1 4r2 ; (f) 6 ≤ a p − a + b p − b + c p − c = 4R − 2r r ; (g) 9r2 ≤ ha + hb + hc ≤ 9 2 R; 7 (h) 2 R ≤ 1 ha + 1 h6 + 1 hc = 1 r ; (i) 9r ≤ ρa + ρb + ρc ≤ 9 2 R; (j) 2 R ≤ 1 ρa + 1 ρb + 1 ρc = 1 r ; (k) 3√3 r R ≤ sin α + sin β + sin γ ≤ 3√3 2 ; (l) 3r R ≤ cos α + cos β + cos γ ≤ 3 2 .
