Fermat proved that there is no arithmetic progression of more than three squares (of rationals). In other words, the pair of diophantine equations a2 + c2 = 2b 2 and b 2 + d 2 = 2c2 has no solution in rationals a , b , c and d . Curiously, the readily accessible literature seems not to contain a straightforward proof. Several years ago, after explaining why three rational squares in arithmetic progres- sion correspond to pythagorean triangles with integer area, I found it natural to tell my graduate student audience that “Fermat proved that there is no arithmetic progression of more than three squares (of rationals). In other words, the pair of diophantine equations a 2 + c 2 = 2b2 and b2 + d2 = 2c 2 has no solution in rationals a, b , c and d .” But my suggestion that they be Fermat and write me an essay on the proof fell on stony ground and, worse, the best I could provide as a solution was to say: “Too hard for me? I looked this up in [3] and found at p54 the unhelpful footnote “Fermat could show by descent that one cannot have four squares in AP . . . . Gerry Myerson has pointed me to a reference but the argument there seems utterly soulless and I remain searching for a decent descent argument warranting report to you.” I decided recently that such a proof was most readily found on a (previously) blank page of my notebook. Fermat’s four squares theorem. There are no four distinct rational squares in arithmetic progression. Proof. It is rather more convenient to work with integer squares. First, this is a not altogether trivial exercise, note that the four integer squares x − 3n , x − n , x + n , x + 3n may be presumed to be pairwise relatively prime, and all odd. By the way, if two squares diﬀer by an even integer 2n they must diﬀer by an integer divisible by 4; so n must be even and x is odd. Thus, second, we have integers x, y , and n satisfying y2 = (x 2 − n2)(x 2 − 9n2) = x 4 − 10n2x 2 + 9n4 = (x 2 − 5n2) 2 − 16n4, whence there are relatively prime integers u and v so that both 4n2 = 4uv and x 2 − 5n2 = 4u2 + v2 . It follows that both u and v are squares and that we may replace u ← A 2 and v ← D2 , so obtaining x 2 = (A 2 + D2)(4A 2 + D2) . Hence, third, noting that A 2 + D2 and 4A 2 + D2 are relatively prime, it must be that both A 2 + D2 and 4A 2 + D2 are squares, and that necessarily A is even Typeset April 2, 2007 [ 11:58 ] . 1 2 Alf van der Poorten and D is odd. Moreover, conversely, given those two squares one may deﬁne x as a square root of their product, and n =: AD . It then readily follows that (x − 3n)(x − n)(x + n)(x + 3n) is a square, yielding an arithmetic progression of four squares of integers with common diﬀerence 2n . We therefore suppose that A and D are relatively prime and that each of A 2+D2 and 4A 2 + D2 is a square and we recall that then, necessarily, A is even and D is odd. Then we see that there are four pairwise relatively prime positive integers a, b , c, d of which a is even and so that 2A = 2 · 2ab · cd = 4ac · bd and c 2d2 − a 2b2 = b2d2 − 4a 2c 2 . Here we have used that 2 · A = 2A and that D = D . Thus, c 2(4a 2 +d2) = b2(a 2 +d2) and it follows that both a 2 +d2 and 4a 2 +d2 are squares. Equivalently, there is an arithmetic progression of four pairwise relatively prime squares of integers with common diﬀerence 2ad. However, because A = 2abcd , it is plain that ad is a proper divisor of A and thus is noticeably less than AD . Hence the set of common diﬀerences of four term arithmetic progressions of integer squares has no smallest element and is therefore empty; in other words, there is no nontrivial four term arithmetic progressions of integer squares. Degeneracy. Because of the hypothesis distinct squares, my remarks above ne- glect the degenerate case n = 2AD = 0 where, since we have noted that without loss of generality the four squares are pairwise relatively prime, x 2 = D4 = 1, so A = 0 (and D2 = 1). In this case the descent on the common diﬀerence 2n fails and the argument correctly aﬃrms that 1, 1, 1, 1 is indeed a (trivial) arithmetic progression of four integer squares. Summary. The argument points out that the existence of a four term arithmetic progression of distinct integer squares with common diﬀerence 2n is equivalent to n having a factorisation n = AD so that both A 2 + D2 and 4A 2 + D2 are squares. However it then readily follows that A has a factorisation abcd so that also both a 2 + d2 and 4a 2 + d2 are squares. Because ad is a proper divisor of AD unless n = 0, it follows that n = 0, contradicting the nontriviality of the arithmetic progression. The ingredients building the proof are the following basic facts. (i) If an integer has factorisations AB and CD with both gcd(A, B) = 1 and gcd(C, D) = 1 then there are pairwise relatively prime integers a, b , c, and d so that A = ab, B = cd , C = ac, and D = bd . (ii) If A and B are nonnegative relatively prime integers and AB is a k -th power then both A and B are k -th powers. (iii) An integer square is ≡ 0 or 4 mod 8 if even and is ≡ 1 mod 8 if odd. (iv) The parametrisation x = x(t) = 2t/(1 + t2), y = y(t) = (1 − t2)/(1 + t2) is equivalent to the equation x 2 + y2 = 1. The familiar t -formulas, cos θ = 2t/(1 + t2), sin θ = (1 − t2)/(1 + t2), with t = tan 1 2 θ , manifest this fact. Speciﬁcally, if x, y , and z are relatively prime integers then, by taking t = v/u , it follows that x 2 + y2 = z2 is equivalent to x = 2uv , y = u2 − v2 , and z = u2 + v2 ; here u and v are relatively prime integers not both odd. (v) A non-empty set of nonnegative integers contains a least element. Ingredient (i) is, in my view, the least likely to come to mind though it is no more than a restatement of unique factorisation. In the present context, ingredient (iv) Fermat’s four squares theorem 3 seems more likely to be recalled; and is in any case easily derived by ﬁrst principles. One notes that without loss of generality x = 2x ′ is even and both y and z are odd so, by (ii), x ′2 = 1 2 (z − y) · 1 2 (z + y) entails 1 2 (z − y) = v2 , 1 2 (z + y) = u2 with one of u or v even. ‘One notes without loss of generality’ by applying (iii). Although the ﬁrst principles argument is fairly simple, it seems to me much more contrived than recalling that the circular functions cos θ and sin θ parametrise the unit circle. Incidentally, (ii) is more subtle than (i) in that it fails if one omits the adjective ‘nonnegative’; speciﬁcally, its analogue in a unique factorisation domain with nontrivial units requires a more complicated proclamation. The fact that the putative four squares in arithmetic progression may be assumed odd and pairwise relatively prime is primarily a consequence of ingredient (iii). Finally, the Well Ordering Principle (v) is equivalent to the Principle of Induction (and showing that in detail is a useful exercise). I use it here disguised as Fermat’s Method of Descent, wherein the absence of a least instance proves that the set of instances is empty. What’s going on here? It seems helpful to rewrite the opening assumption as alleging that the curve C : Y 2 −(X 2 −5)Y −4 = 0 contains a rational point (X, Y ); speciﬁcally, so that X has denominator n and Y has denominator n2 . Indeed, C is a quartic model for an elliptic curve E : y2 = x(x+1)(x+4) obtained by taking x = Y and y = XY ; thus, for the presumed rational point on E , the denominator of x is n2 and that of y is n3 . E is curve 24A1 of Cremona’s tables [1]. The argument conﬁrms that the only rational points on E are the 2-torsion points (0, 0), (−1, 0), and (−4, 0); these points do not correspond to a nontrivial arithmetic progression. History. Dickson [2] reports at II, XiV, p. 440 that Fermat proposed the problem to Frenicle in 1640 and stated that it is impossible; and inter alia gives a summary of an uncompelling 1813 proof. Dickson, at II, XXII, p. 635 mentions an argument of Euler which leads one to see that x 2 + y2 and x 2 + 4y2 are not both squares for x odd, y ̸= 0 even; with the four squares theorem a corollary. I imagine that this eﬀectively coincides with my argument. Reassuringly, back at p. 440 Dickson cites (what I presume to be) an 1898 Amer. Math. Monthly problem asking for a proof of the theorem, and remarks: “Several writers failed to ﬁnd a solution.” References [1] J. E.
