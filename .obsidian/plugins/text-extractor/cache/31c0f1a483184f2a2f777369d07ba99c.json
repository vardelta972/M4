Divisibility relations imply order relations (but watch out for signs and zero). Root-\ripping Let P (x; y) be a quadratic polynomial in two variables, and suppose we have a pair of integers (a; b) such that P (a; b) = 0. Then we can \fnd new pairs (a0; b) and (a; b0) by using sum-of-roots or product-of-roots formulas on the quadratics P (x; b) and P (a; y) with the known roots a and b respectively. This can be useful either in a descent proof or as a construction of in\fnitely many solutions to an equation. The sequences of pairs (an; bn) generated by this approach usually satisfy some kind of linear recurrence. Pell Equations An equation of the form x2 \u0000 Dy2 = \u00061, with D not a square, is called a Pell equation. The best way to think about this is to view x2 \u0000 Dy2 as the norm of the element x + p Quadratic Residues The Legendre symbol \u0000a Problemsof these problems are from 1998{2003 IMO short lists, so you should already know how to solve them. 1. What is the smallest positive integer t such that there exist integers x1, x2, . . . , xt with x3 + x3 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x3 = 20022002? 2. Let b be an integer greater than 5. For each positive integer n, consider the number xn = 11 : : : 1| Homework 1. Let n be an integer greater than 1, and let p(x) = xn + an\u00001xn\u00001 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + a1x + 1 be a polynomial with nonnegative integer coe\u000ecients such that aj = an\u0000j for 1 \u0014 j \u0014 n \u0000 1. Prove that there exist in\fnitely many pairs of positive integers (a; b) such that a j p(b) and b j p(a). 2. (MOP 00) Find the number of zeros at the end of the number 456 + 654: 3.
