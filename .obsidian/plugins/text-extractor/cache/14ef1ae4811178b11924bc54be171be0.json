We say that n is the greatest integer less than or equal to x or the ﬂoor of x. We denote n = ⌊x⌋. The diﬀerence x − ⌊x⌋ is called the fractional part of x and is denoted by {x}. The integer ⌊x⌋ + 1 is called the ceiling of x and is denoted by ⌈x⌉. For example, ⌊2.1⌋ = 2 {2.1} = .1 ⌈2.1⌉ = 3 ⌊−3.9⌋ = −4 {−3.9} = .1 ⌈−3.9⌉ = −3 The following properties are useful: 1) If a and b are integers, b > 0, and q is the quotient when a is divided by b, then q = ⌊ a b ⌋ . 2) For any real number x and any integer n, ⌊x + n⌋ = ⌊x⌋ + n and ⌈x + n⌉ = ⌈x⌉ + n. 3) For any positive real number x and any positive integer n the number of positive multiples of n not exceeding x is ⌊ x n ⌋ . 4) For any real number x and any positive integer n, ⌊ ⌊x⌋ n ⌋ = ⌊ x n ⌋ . We will prove the last two properties. For 3) consider all multiples 1 · n, 2 · n, . . . , k · n, where k · n ≤ x < (k + 1)n. That is k ≤ x n < k + 1 and the conclusion follows. For 4) denote ⌊x⌋ = m and {x} = α. From the Division Algorithm and property 1) above it follows that m = n ⌊ m n ⌋ + r, where 0 ≤ r ≤ n − 1. We obtain 0 ≤ r + α ≤ n − 1 + α < n, that is⌊ r + α n ⌋ = 0 and ⌊ x n ⌋ = ⌊ m + α n ⌋ = ⌊⌊ m n ⌋ + r + α n ⌋ = ⌊ m n ⌋ + ⌊ r + α n ⌋ = ⌊ m n ⌋ = ⌊ ⌊x⌋ n ⌋ . 1 The following result is helpful in proving many relations involving the ﬂoor function. Theorem. Let p be an odd prime and let q be an integer that is not divisible by p. If f : Z∗ + → R is a function such that: i) f (k) p is not an integer, k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1; ii) f (k) + f (p − k) is an integer divisible by p, k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1, then p−1∑ k=1 ⌊f (k) q p ⌋ = q p p−1∑ k=1 f (k) − p − 1 2 . (1) Proof. From ii) it follows that qf (k) p + qf (p − k) p ∈ Z (2) and from i) we obtain that qf (k) p ̸∈ Z and qf (p − k) p ̸∈ Z, k = 1, . . . , p − 1, hence 0 < { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } < 2. But, from (1), { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } ∈ Z, thus { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } = 1, k = 1, . . . , p − 1. Summing up and dividing by 2 yields p−1∑ k=1 { q p f (k) } = p − 1 2 . It follows that p−1∑ k=1 q p f (k) − p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ q p f (k) ⌋ = p − 1 2 and the conclusion follows. □ Application 1. The function f (x) = x satisﬁes both i) and ii) in Theorem, hence p−1∑ k=1 ⌊k q p ⌋ = q p · (p − 1)p 2 − p − 1 2 , Mathematical Reflections 3, (2006) 2 that is p−1∑ k=1 ⌊k q p ⌋ = (p − 1)(q − 1) 2 (Gauss). (3) Remark. From the proof of our Theorem, it follows that the above formula holds for any relatively prime integers p and q. Application 2. The function f (x) = x3 also satisﬁes conditions i) and ii), hence p−1∑ k=1 ⌊k3 q p ⌋ = q p · (p − 1)2p2 4 − p − 1 2 = (p − 1)(p2q − pq − 2) 4 . (4) For q = 1 we obtain the 2002 German Mathematical Olympiad problem: p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ k3 p ⌋ = (p − 2)(p − 1)(p + 1) 4 . (5) Application 3. For f : Z∗ + → R, f (s) = (−1)ss2, conditions i) and ii) in our Theorem are both satisﬁed. We obtain p−1∑ k=1 ⌊(−1) kk2 q p ⌋ = q p (−12 + 22 − . . . + (p − 1) 2) − p − 1 2 = q p · p(p − 1) 2 − p − 1 2 , hence p−1∑ k=1 ⌊(−1) kk2 q p ⌋ = (p − 1)(q − 1) 2 . (6) Remark. By taking q = 1 we get p−1∑ k=1 ⌊(−1) k k2 p ⌋ = 0. Using now the identity ⌊−x⌋ = −1 − ⌊x⌋, x ∈ R\\Z, the last display takes the form p−1∑ k=1(−1) k ⌊ k2 p ⌋ = 1 − p 2 . (7) Mathematical Reflections 3, (2006) 3 Application 4. Similarly, applying our Theorem to f : Z∗ + → R, f (s) = (−1)ss4 yields p−1∑ k=1 ⌊(−1) kk4 q p ⌋ = q(p − 1)(p2 − p − 1) 2 − p − 1 2 . (8) Taking q = 1 gives p−1∑ k=1 ⌊(−1) k k4 p ⌋ = (p − 2)(p − 1)(p + 1) 2 . (9) Application 5. For f (s) = sp p , conditions i) and ii) in our Theorem are also satisﬁed and for q = 1 we obtain p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ kp p2 ⌋ = 1 p p−1∑ k=1 kp p − p − 1 2 = 1 p2 (p−1∑ k=1 kp − p(p − 1) 2 ) , hence p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ kp p2 ⌋ = 1 2 p−1∑ k=1 kp − k p . (10) Formula (10) shows that half of the sum of the quotients obtained when kp − k is divided by p (Fermat’s Little Theorem) is equal to the sum of the quotients obtained when kp is divided by p2, k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1.
