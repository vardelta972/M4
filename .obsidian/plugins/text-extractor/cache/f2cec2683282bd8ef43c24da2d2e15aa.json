Following are two useful tools with divisibility: (i) a | b, c | d ⇒ ac | bd, (ii) a | b, a | c ⇒ a | bx + cy ∀x, y ∈ Z Another useful fact is, a | b ⇒ |a| ≤ |b|. So, if x, y ∈ N and we need to show x = y then we may try showing x | y and y | x. This fact is also useful in some proofs by contradiction method. Euclid’s Lemma If a | bc with a, b coprime, then a | c. Division Algorithm Given integers a and b, with b > 0, there exist unique integers q and r satisfying a = bq + r (0 ≤ r < b). If a = bq + r then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, r). Hence we can ﬁnd gcd(a, b) using the division algorithm taught in high schools. Using the steps of division algorithm, we can express gcd(a, b) as a linear combination of a and b, which give rise to the theorem (Bezout’s Theorem): Given integers a and b, not both zero, there exist unique integers x and y such that gcd(a, b) = ax + by. The last theorem has this consequences: Two integers a and b are coprime (i.e. gcd(a, b) = 1) if and only if there exist integers x, y such that 1 = ax + by. You can use Bezout’s theorem to prove Euclid’s lemma (above), or this following fact: a | c, b | c with gcd(a, b) = 1, then ab | c. Pitfalls a | c, b | c need not imply ab | c, e.g. 2 | 4, 4 | 4 does not imply 2·4 = 8 | 4. Another is, a | bc need not imply a | b or a | c, e.g. neither 10 | 4, nor 10 | 5, but 10 | 4 · 5 = 20. ◦ An useful theorem about equations like ax + by = c is: For a, b ∈ Z, the equation ax + by = c has a solution if and only if d | c where d = gcd(a, b). If x0, y0 is any particular solution then all solutions are given by x = x0 +(b/d)t, y = y0 −(a/d)t where t is any integer. ◦ Congruence: Congruence is just another notion of divisiblity. We write a ≡ b(mod n) if n | a − b. Properties like a ≡ b(mod n), c ≡ d(mod n) ⇒ ac ≡ bd(mod n) are straight-forward and we omit them here 1. Following are some facts which are often useful: (1) ∀ n ∈ Z, n 2 ≡ 0, 1(mod 3), n 2 ≡ 0, 1, 4(mod 5) and, for odd n ∈ Z, n 2 ≡ 1(mod 8) (2) For any n ∈ Z, n 3 ≡ 0, 1, −1(mod 7), n 3 ≡ 0, 1, −1(mod 9). (3) If n ≡ 3(mod 4) then ∃a prime p such that p|n and p ≡ 3(mod 4). (4) For a prime p and an integer n, p|n 2 + 1 only if p = 2 or p ≡ 1(mod 4). (5) If p is a prime that does not divide a, then there exists an unique integer x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ p − 1 and ax ≡ 1(mod p) . ◦ Another fact is, if P (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, then for a, b, n ∈ Z, a ≡ b(mod n) ⇒ P (a) ≡ P (b)(mod n). This follows from the property that for any polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients, a − b | P (a) − P (b) ∀ a, b ∈ Z. 1you may look up these things in the book ‘An Excursion in Mathematics’. 1 ◦ Fermat’s Theorem If p is a prime and a ∈ Z then ap ≡ a(mod p). In other words, if p ∤ a then ap−1 ≡ 1(mod p). ◦ Wilson’s theorem If p be a prime then (p − 1)! ≡ −1( mod p). Actually, we can show that n is prime if and only if (n − 1)! + 1 is divisible by n. ◦ Gauss introduced a function ϕ(n) = number of positive integers≤ n that are coprime to n. Then we have the following generalisation of Fermat’s theorem : aϕ(n) ≡ 1(mod n) ∀a ∈ Z : gcd(a, n) = 1. A function f : N → R is called a multiplicative function if f (mn) = f (m)f (n) for all m, n such that gcd(m, n) = 1. So if we evaluate f (pk) for all prime p and k ∈ N, then we can determine f (n) for any n ∈ N, thanks to fundamental theorem of arithmetic. It can be proved that ϕ(n) is multiplicative. And it is easy to see that ϕ(pk) = pk − pk−1. (The positive integers≤ pk that are not coprime to pk are precisely the numbers p, 2p, 3p, . . . , pk−1p.) Hence, if n = pa1 1 pa2 2 . . . p ak k be the prime factorisation of n then ϕ(n) = ϕ(pa1 1 )ϕ(pa2 2 ) . . . ϕ(pak k ) = n(1 − 1 p1 )(1 − 1 p2 ) . . . (1 − 1 pk ) . An interesting fact about ϕ is, ∑ d|n ϕ(d) = n. (The sum is over all divisors d of n) ◦ Theorem. If F (n) = ∑ d|n f (n) then F (n) is multiplicative iﬀ f (n) is multiplicative. ◦ For any n ∈ N, let τ (n) denote number of positive divisors of n and σ(n) denote the sum of all positive divisors of n. Note that τ (n) = ∑ d|n 1 and σ(n) = ∑ d|n d, by the theorem above, τ and σ are both multiplicative. Hence from prime factorisation of n you can easily ﬁnd τ (n) and σ(n) : τ (n) = (a1 + 1)(a2 + 1) . . . (ak + 1), σ(n) = (1 + p1 + p2 1 . . . + pa1 1 ) . . . (1 + pk + p2 k . . . + pak k ). ⋆ One important fact is, τ (n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square. ◦ Representation of a positive integer: Fix any b ∈ N. Then any n ∈ N can be written uniquely as n = nsbs + ns−1bs−1 + . . . + n1b + n0 where 0 ≤ ni ≤ b − 1 for each i. ◦ Pythagorean Triples: If (x, y, z) satisﬁes x2 + y2 = z2, where x, y, z ∈ N, then we call it a pythagorean triple. Triples with gcd(x, y, z) = 1 are called primitive pythagorean triples (PPT). Theorem. If (x, y, z) is a PPT with y even, then there exists r, s ∈ N with r > s, gcd(r, s) = 1 and exactly one of r, s even, such that x = r2 − s2, y = 2rs, z = r2 + s2. (If y is odd then just swap the roles of x and y.) Note, the above formula generates only primitive Pythagorean triples, not all Pythagorean triples. For example, (6, 8, 10) is not of the form (r2 − s2, 2rs, r2 + s2).) ◦ Chinese Remainder Theorem: If m1, . . . , mk are pairwisely coprime integers and a1, . . . , ak are any integers then the system x ≡ a1( mod m1), x ≡ a2( mod m2), . . . , x ≡ ak( mod mk), has solution and any two solutions are congruent modulo m1m2 . . . mk. Further, there is a good way to ﬁnd a solution. Take M = m1m2 . . . mk and let m ′ k = M/mk. Then ﬁnd n1, n2, . . . , nk such that m ′ ini ≡ 1( mod mi), for each i. Then x = a1m ′ 1n1 + a2m′ 2n2 + . . . + akm′ knk is a solution of the system. 2 ◦ Some facts about greatest integer function: (a) 0 ≤ x − ⌊x⌋ < 1, (b) ⌊x + n⌋ = ⌊x⌋ + n for n ∈ Z, (c) ⌊x⌋ + ⌊y⌋ ≤ ⌊x + y⌋ ≤ ⌊x⌋ + ⌊y⌋ + 1. (d) ⌊x + 1/2⌋ is the integer nearest to x. If two integers are equidistant from x then it denotes the greater one. (e) ⌊x⌋ = ⌊x/2⌋ + ⌊(x + 1)/2⌋, for x > 0. (f) ⌊x⌋ + ⌊−x⌋ = 0 if x ∈ Z, −1 otherwise. In most of the cases, just writing the inequality x − 1 < ⌊x⌋ ≤ x helps. References: • An Excursion in Mathematics, • Problem Solving strategies (by Arthur Engel), • 104 Number Theory Problems.
