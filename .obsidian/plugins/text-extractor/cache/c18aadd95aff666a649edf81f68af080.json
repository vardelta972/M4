We can write p(x) = P (x)/k for some integer k so that P (x) has integer coeﬃcients. Then we can choose n = k so that q(x) = p(x + n) − p(x) = P (x + k) − P (x) k , which has integer coeﬃcients because k|P (x + k) − P (x).■ 2. The ﬁrst equation is equivalent to x2 + (y − z)2 = 2, so x, y − z = ±1. With the second equation, these four cases yield the triples (1, 2008, 2009), (1, 2009, 2008), (−1, 2009, 2010), (−1, 2010, 2009).■ 3. First note that f (x) = (x + 1)f (x − 1) x for all rational x > 1. We prove by strong induction on p + q ≥ 2 that for all rational x = p/q with gcd(p, q) = 1, f (x) = f (1)(p + q)/2. This is clearly true for p + q = 2 =⇒ p = q = 1. If p + q ≥ 3, we obtain from the inductive hypothesis for p = (p − q) + q (since we have gcd(p − q, q) = gcd(p, q) = 1 and p − q > 0) that f ( q p ) = f ( p q ) = ( p q + 1) f ( p q − 1) p q = ( p + q p ) f ( p − q q ) = 1 2 f (1)(p + q), completing the induction. Finally, since f (x) only outputs integers, and p + q can be odd, f (1) must be even so we can set the integer C = f (1)/2 so that f ( p q ) = C(p + q), gcd(p, q) = 1, which fulﬁls the problem’s conditions.■ 4. First assume x, y, z ≥ 0. Let x + y + z = 3u, xy + yz + zx = 3v2, and xyz = w3. Then f (x, y, z) = (xy + yz + zx)(x + y + z) (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = (3v2)(3u) (3u − x)(3u − y)(3u − z) = 9uv2 (3u)3 − (3u)(3u)2 + (3v2)(3u) − w3 = 1 + w3 9uv2 − w3 . Now note that u, v ≥ w by AM-GM, so 9uv2 − w3 ≥ 9w3 − w3 = 8w3. Hence 1 ≤ f (x, y, z) = 1 + w3 9uv2 − w3 ≤ 1 + w3 8w3 = 9 8 . To prove that all values in [1, 9/8] are achievable, set y = z = 1 so f (x, y, z) = (xy + yz + zx)(x + y + z) (x + y)(y + z)(z + x) = (2x + 1)(x + 2) 2(x + 1)2 = 1 + x 2(x + 1)2 . This means that f (0, 1, 1) = 1 and f (1, 1, 1) = 9/8. By the continuity of f (x, 1, 1), all values in [1, 9/8] are achievable. Now we consider the case where x, y, z need not be positive. Recall that f (x, 1, 1) = 1 + x 2(x + 1)2 , 2010 Green Homework Solutions so f (−1 + 1 k , 1, 1) = 1 + −1 + 1 k 2 (−1 + 1 k + 1)2 = 1 − k(k − 1) 2 . Then k = 1 =⇒ f = 1, and limk→+∞ f = −∞, so all values in (−∞, 1] are achievable since f is continuous. Next, we ﬁnd that f (x, y, − x + y 2 ) = (xy + y (− x+y 2 ) + x (− x+y 2 )) ( x + y + (− x+y 2 )) (x + y) (y + (− x+y 2 )) ( x + (− x+y 2 )) = x2 + y2 (x − y)2 . Therefore f (k + 1, k, − 2k + 1 2 ) = (k + 1)2 + k2, with k = 0 =⇒ f = 1 and limk→+∞ f = +∞. Again by the continuity of f , [1, +∞) is in the range of f , so we conclude that if x, y, z can be negative, then all real numbers are in the range of f .■ 5. Via polynomial division we can write P (x) Q(x) = D(x) + R(x) Q(x) , where either R(x) = 0 for all x or deg R < deg Q. Assume for the sake of contradiction that R(x) is not the zero polynomial, so deg R < deg Q. Because P (x) and Q(x) have integer coeﬃcients, D(x) has rational coeﬃcients and for some integer k we have D(x) = d(x)/k where d(x) has integer coeﬃcients. Because deg R < deg Q, for x > C for some suﬃciently large positive constant C we have − 1 k < R(x) Q(x) < 1 k =⇒ d(x) − 1 k < P (x) Q(x) = D(x) + R(x) Q(x) < d(x) + 1 k . Note that an is unbounded, so there are inﬁnitely many values of n for which an > C. But P (an)/Q(an) is always an integer, so for inﬁnitely many values of n we must have P (an) Q(an) = d(an) k =⇒ R(an) = 0 since d(an) − 1 k < P (an) Q(an) < d(an) + 1 k and d(an) only outputs integers. But if R(x) = 0 for inﬁnitely many values of x, it must be 0 for all x since it has ﬁnite degree. Thus P (x) Q(x) = d(x) k for all x with Q(x) ̸= 0, and when x = an we have to have k|d(an). Now, observe that for 0 ≤ i ≤ k − 1, 0 ≡ d(ak+i) = d((k + i)! + k + i) = d (i + k (1 + (k + i)! k )) ≡ d(i) (mod k) since k|d(i+jk)−d(i) for all integers j. Now for arbitrary integers n, write n = qk+r with 0 ≤ r ≤ k−1. Then d(n) = d(r + qk) ≡ d(r) ≡ 0 (mod k) for all n with Q(n) ̸= 0, and we are done.■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions Combinatorics 1. Let ai be the number of questions on which Isaac receives a score of i. Then a0 + · · · + a10 = 6, and for each solution in nonnegative integers (a0, . . . , a10), there is precisely one sequence of six marks that can be achieved (the scores in nonincreasing order). A simple application of balls and urns tells us that the answer is (6 + 11 − 1 11 − 1 ) = (16 10 ) = 8008.■ 2. When the sectors of the two circles line up, deﬁne a good sector on the small circle as one that lies over a sector of the same color on the big circle. Since there are an equal number of white and black sectors on both circles, the expected number of good sectors is E = ∑ pv = 200(1/2)(1) = 100. This means that at least one conﬁguration has at least 100 good sectors, for otherwise each conﬁguration would have at most 99 good sectors, contradicting the fact that the expected number of good sectors is 100.■ 3. In this solution, reduce all indices i of xi to the smallest possible positive integer modulo n. We shall prove by induction on r ≥ 0 that all n-tuples of the form ( 2 r ∏ i=1 xi, 2 r+1∏ i=2 xi, . . . , 2 r+n−1∏ i=n xi ) will eventually be obtained. Since we start with (x1, . . . , xn), this is clearly true for r = 0. Call the operation (x1, x2, . . .) 7→ ( 2 r ∏ i=1 xi, 2 r+1∏ i=2 xi, . . . ) the r-operation on (x1, x2, . . .). Assume it exists for r = s. Then through the 1-operation on (x1, x2, . . .) and the fact that x2 i = 1, we get ( 2 s ∏ i=1 xi, 2 s+1∏ i=2 xi, . . . ) 7→ (x1x2s+1, x2x2s+2, . . .) . Now through the s-operation on (x1x2s+1, x2x2s+2, . . .), we get (x1x2s+1, x2x2s+2, . . .) 7→ ( 2 s ∏ i=1 xix2s+i, 2 s+1∏ i=2 xix2s+i, . . . ) =  2 s+1 ∏ i=1 xi, 2 s+1+1∏ i=2 xi, . . .   , completing the induction. Finally, if n = 2 k for some integer k ≥ 1, a k-operation on (x1, x2, . . .) will yield   2 k ∏ i=1 xi, 2 k+1∏ i=2 xi, . . .   =   2 k ∏ i=1 xi, 2 k ∏ i=1 xi, . . .   , the right hand side of which consists of 2 k equal numbers. A 1-operation on this will give   2 k ∏ i=1 x2 i , 2 k ∏ i=1 x2 i , . . .   = (1, 1, . . .), as desired.■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions 4. We provide a construction such that it is not possible to arrange them in a desired line with at most 2010 children between any two friends. Deﬁne the sets Ai, 0 ≤ i ≤ n as follows: • Let n be the unique positive integer such that 1 + 3(2 n−1 − 1) < 2010 2010 and 1 + 3(2n − 1) ≥ 20102010. • A0 contains a single person who has 3 friends. These 3 friends are the members of A1. • For 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, Ai consists of the friends of the members of Ai−1. Each person X in Ai−1 has 2 friends in Ai. Both of these friends have no friends in a set Aj, j ≤ i besides X. • In this way, the set Ai, 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1 has 3 · 2i−1 members so |A0| + |A1| + · · · + |An−1| = 1 + 3(2n−1 − 1) < 2010 2010. If An were deﬁned in the same way as Ai, 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, we would have |A0| + |A1| + · · · + |An−1| + |An| = 1 + 3(2n − 1) ≥ 20102010. Hence we can just take away 1 + 3(2 n − 1) − 2010 2010 members from An so that |A0| + |A1| + · · · + |An−1| + |An| = 2010 2010. This gives a valid construction of 2010 2010 children. Also note that An is not empty, or else there would not be enough children. Number the positions of the 2010 2010 children in line from 1 to 20102010. Let XAi, 0 ≤ i ≤ n be an arbitrary member of Ai. Deﬁne d(XAi, XAj ) as the absolute value of the diﬀerence of the numerical positions of XAi and XAj . Through a simple induction utilizing the condition that there are at most 2010 children between any pair of friends, we can prove that d(XA0 , XAi) ≤ 2011i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n. Hence d(XA0 , XAi) ≤ d(XA0, XAn ) ≤ 2011n, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, which means that the entire line of children can have length at most 1 + 2(2011n) = 1 + 4022n, so 2010 2010 ≤ 1 + 4022n =⇒ n ≥ 2010 2010 − 1 4022 > 2010 2009 20102 = 2010 2007. Recall, however, that 1 + 3(2n−1 − 1) < 2010 2010, so 2010 2010 > 1 + 3(2n−1 − 1) > 2n > 2 2010 2007 = (2 11) 20102007 11 > 2010 20102007 11 > 2010 2010, a clear contradiction.■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions Number Theory 1. Let ω = e2πi/3. Then ω8 + ω + 1 = ω2 + ω + 1 = 0, so we conclude that n2 + n + 1|n8 + n + 1. Hence for n8 + n + 1 to be prime, we must have n2 + n + 1 = n8 + n + 1 =⇒ n = 1, which does indeed yield the prime n8 + n + 1 = 3.■ 2. Because 2n + n|8 n + n, we have n3 − n ≡ (−2n) 3 − (−8 n) ≡ 0 (mod 2n + n). From this, we ﬁnd that either n = 1, which works since 3 = 2 1 + 1|8 1 + 1 = 9, or n3 − n ≥ 2 n + n =⇒ n3 > n3 − n ≥ 2n + n > 2 n. A simple induction shows that 2 n ≥ n3 for integers n ≥ 10. Testing n < 10, we ﬁnd that the solutions are n = 1, 2, 4, 6.■ 3. Clearly a, b ≥ 0. Let n2 = 3 a + 7b ≡ (−1)a + (−1)b ≡ 0, 2 (mod 4) =⇒ n2 ≡ 0 (mod 4), so a and b must be of opposite parity since 2 is not a quadratic residue modulo 4. We have two cases. Case 1: a is even and b is odd. We have (n − 3 a 2 ) ( n + 3 a 2 ) = 7 b, so both n − 3 a/2 and n + 3 a/2 are powers of 7. Their diﬀerence is not divisible by 7, so we must have n − 3a/2 = 1 and n + 3a/2 = 7 b, so 7 b − 1 = 2 · 3 a 2 . If a = 2, we get the solution (2, 1). Otherwise, a ≥ 4, so 7 b ≡ 1 (mod 9) =⇒ 3|b. Thus b/3 is an integer, and (7 b 3 − 1 ) ( 7 2b 3 + 7 b 3 + 1) = 2 · 3 a 2 , from which it is clear that for nonnegative integers u, v with u+v = a/2 ≥ 2, we have 7b/3−1 = 2·3u and 72b/3 + 7b/3 + 1 = 3 v. If u ≥ 2, then 7 b 3 ≡ 1 (mod 9) =⇒ 7 2b 3 + 7 b 3 + 1 ≡ 3 (mod 9), so v = 1 =⇒ b/3 = 0 =⇒ 0 = 2 · 3 u which is impossible. If u = 1, we arrive at b = 3 =⇒ 72 + 71 + 1 = 57 = 3 v, with no solutions. Finally, if u = 0, then 7 b/3 − 1 = 2, also without solutions, so we see that this case only provides the solution (2, 1). Case 2: a is odd and b is even. We have (n − 7 b 2 ) ( n + 7 b 2 ) = 3 a, so both n − 7 b/2 and n + 7 b/2 are powers of 3. However, their diﬀerence is not divisible by 3, so n − 7 b/2 = 1 and n + 7b/2 = 3 a, and we get 3 a − 1 = 2 · 7 b 2 =⇒ 3 a ≡ 1 (mod 7) =⇒ 6|a, contradicting the fact that a is odd. This case has no solutions. In conclusion, the only solution is (2, 1).■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions 4. Lemma: For all primes p and integers n, p|n p−1∏ k=1 (kn + 1). Proof: If p|n, we are done. Otherwise, gcd(p, n) = 1 and n has an inverse modulo p. Deﬁne 1 ≤ u ≤ p−1 so that u ≡ −n−1 (mod p) =⇒ p|un + 1\f \f \f \fn p−1∏ k=1 (kn + 1), as desired.■ Observe that E(1) = 11! = 2a1 3 a2 5 a37 a411a5 , ai ≥ 1. Now note that for all integers n, k, we have gcd(n, kn + 1) = 1. Hence for p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, vp(E(p)) = vp ( p 10∏ k=1 (kp + 1) ) = 1, so gcd(E(1), . . . , E(2009))|2 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 11. By the lemma, all ﬁve primes 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 divide E(n) for all n, so we conclude that gcd(E(1), . . . , E(2009)) = 2 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 11 = 2310.■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions Geometry 1. Let α = ∠A/2, β = ∠B/2, and γ = ∠C/2, so α + β + γ = 90◦ with 0 ◦ < α, β, γ < 90 ◦. Simple angle chasing with exterior angles gives us ∠AEI = ∠B + ∠BCE = 2β + γ = 90 ◦ − α + β and ∠ADI = ∠C + ∠CBD = 2γ + β = 90 ◦ − α + γ. By the Law of Sines on ∠IAE = α, we ﬁnd that IE sin ∠IAE = IE sin α = AI sin ∠AEI = AI sin(90◦ − α + β) , and from another application on ∠IAD = α, we ﬁnd ID sin ∠IAD = ID sin α = AI sin ∠ADI = AI sin(90◦ − α + γ) , so dividing the two equations yields IE ID = sin(90 ◦ − α + γ) sin(90◦ − α + β) . Hence IE = ID is equivalent to at least one of (recall that 0 ◦ < α, β, γ < 90 ◦) (90 ◦ − α + γ) ≡ (90 ◦ − α + β) (mod 360◦) ⇐⇒ β = γ ⇐⇒ AB = AC and (90 ◦ − α + γ) + (90◦ − α + β) ≡ 180◦ (mod 360◦) ⇐⇒ α = 30 ◦ ⇐⇒ ∠BAC = 60 ◦. The ﬁrst is impossible as we are given AB < AC, so IE = ID ⇐⇒ ∠BAC = 60 ◦, as desired.■ 2. We use directed angles modulo 180 ◦, so A, B, C, D are concyclic, regardless of order, if and only if ∠ABC = ∠ADC = ∠AOC/2 (if O is the center of the circle). Let the center of the circle be O and let T be the intersection of the tangents at A and B. Now let X, Y, Z be the feet from P to AT, BT, AB respectively so that P X = a, P Y = b, and P Z = c. We shall use the facts that AT = BT , OB = OP , AZP X is cyclic, and BY P Z is cyclic. Then ∠ZP X = ∠ZAX = ∠Y BZ = ∠Y P Z, and ∠P XZ = ∠P AZ = ∠P AB = 1 2 ∠P OB = 90 ◦ − ∠OBP = ∠P BY = ∠P ZY . Thus △P XZ ∼ △P ZY , which means that a c = P X P Z = P Z P Y = c b =⇒ c2 = ab, as desired.■ 2010 Green Homework Solutions 3. Extend CG to hit AB at point N , the midpoint of AB. First, if ∠ACB = 90 ◦, then N is the circumcenter of △ABC so N C = N B. By deﬁnition, EG∥BC so N E = N G, giving us △CN E ∼ △BN G =⇒ ∠DGC = ∠N GB = ∠N EC = ∠AEC, as desired. Now, for the other direction, note that ∠CEB = 180 ◦ − ∠AEC = 180 ◦ − ∠DGC = ∠CGB. This means that CGEB is cyclic, so using the fact that EG∥BC, we obtain ∠N BC = ∠EBC = 180 ◦ − ∠EGC = ∠N GE = ∠N CB =⇒ N C = N B = N A, where N B = N A because N is the midpoint of AB. This shows that ∠ACB = ∠ACN + ∠N CB = ∠CAN + ∠N BC = 180 ◦ − ∠ACB =⇒ ∠ACB = 90 ◦, and we are done.■ 4. Let the midpoint of BC be M , which is also the foot from F to BC by deﬁnition, and let F A hit DE at P . Without loss of generality, assume the radius of the circle with center B is less than that of the circle with center C. Let their radii be r < s, and let the foot from B to CE be N . Note that BD∥F A∥CN E, and BN ∥DE. We can easily ﬁnd that AM = CA − CM = s − (r + s)/2 = (s − r)/2 and CN = CE − N E = CE − BD = s − r, so CN/AM = 2. Clearly ∠AM F = ∠CN B = 90◦ and ∠F AM = ∠BAP = ∠BCE = ∠BCN , so △AM F ∼ △CN B =⇒ CB AF = CN AM = 2, which is what we wanted to prove.■","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
