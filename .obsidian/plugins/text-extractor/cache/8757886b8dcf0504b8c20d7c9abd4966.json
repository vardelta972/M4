Let W, X, Y, Z be the foot of the perpendicular from O to the segments AB, BC, CD, DA, respectively. If brackets denote area, prove that [ABCD] = [ABZ] + [BCW ] + [CDX] + [DAY ]. 1.1 Solution W, X, Y, Z are just the midpoints of the sides of ABCD, so [ABZ] + [BCW ] + [CDX] + [DAY ] = [ABD] 2 + [BCA] 2 + [CDB] 2 + [DAC] 2 = [ABCD] 2 + [ABCD] 2 = [ABCD] 2 Prove that for every natural a, there exist inﬁnitely many naturals n such that 10 na − 1 is composite. 2.1 Solution Let p be a prime that divides 10a − 1. We have 10a ≡ 1 (mod p), so p must be relatively prime to 10. By Fermat’s Little Theorem, 10 p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p), so 10k(p−1)10a ≡ 1 (mod p) for any natural k. Also, note that 10 k(p−1)10a is greater than 10a, so 10 k(p−1)10a−1 is greater than p and also divides p, so it must be composite. Therefore any n of the form k(p − 1) + 1 makes 10 na − 1 composite, and we are done. 1 3 Find all ﬁnite sequences of nonnegative integers z0, z1, . . . , zn−1, such that n is a natural, and for any integer i such that 0 ≤ i < n, zi represents the number of integers j such that 0 ≤ j < n and zj = i. One such sequence is 3, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0. 3.1 Answer The only sequences that work are {1, 2, 1, 0}, {2, 0, 2, 0}, {2, 1, 2, 0, 0}, and for any integer n > 6, z0 = n − 4, z1 = 2, z2 = zn−4 = 1, and zi = 0 for all integral i such that 2 < i < n − 4 or n − 4 < i < n. 3.2 Solution First of all, it is obvious that n > 1 and z0 ̸= 0. Also note that ∑n−1 i=0 zi = n =⇒ ∑n−1 i=1 zi = n − z0. Additionally, ∑n−1 i=1 zi is the number of indices i such that zi ̸= 0, but there are n − z0 − 1 such indices between 1 and n − 1, inclusive, so we have n − z0 − 1 natural summing up to n − z0. By the Pigeonhole Principle, one of them must equal 2, so the rest must be 1. This means if i > 0, zi ≤ 2, so only one number in the sequence, namely z0, can be greater than 2. Therefore, if i > 2, zi ≤ 1. So either z1 = 2 or z2 = 2. Case 1, z2 = 2, z1 ̸= 2: There are two twos in the sequence, and the only valid indices for these twos are 0 and 2. Now we have the condition that all numbers in the sequence are less than 2 except z0 and z2, so if i > 2, zi = 0. The two possibilities remaining, z1 = 0 and z1 = 1, give us the two answers {2, 0, 2, 0} and {2, 1, 2, 0, 0}. Case 2, z1 = 2, z2 ̸= 2: There is at least one two in the sequence, so z2 ≥ 1, but since z2 ≤ 2 and z2 ̸= 2, the only possibility is that z2 = 1, so there is only one two in the sequence, so z0 ̸= 2. Thus, either z0 = 1 or z0 > 2. If z0 = 1, then if i > 2, zi = 0, so we get the answer {1, 2, 1, 0}. If z0 > 2, we let n = z0 + 4. Now we have zz0 = 1 and zi = 0 for all integers i such that i > 2 and i ̸= z0, so we get our remaining solutions, which then can easily be veriﬁed to work. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
