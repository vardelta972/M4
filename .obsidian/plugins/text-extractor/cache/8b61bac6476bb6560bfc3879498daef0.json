Let a, b, and c be three distinct integers, and let P (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Show that we cannot have P (a) = b, P (b) = c, and P (c) = a. 2 Common Techniques Here are some common ideas that occur in problems involving polynomials: • Roots: Every polynomial P (x) can be placed in the form P (x) = a(x − r1) · · · (x − rn), where r1, . . . , rn are the (complex) roots of P (x). Vieta’s formulas allow us to relate these roots to the coeﬃcients. • Interpolation: A polynomial of degree n is determined uniquely by a choice of n + 1 points, and we may compute the coeﬃcients of this polynomial explicitly using Fact 7. • Divisibility: The most important idea for integer polynomials is Fact 8. It is sometimes used in an iterated fashion – for P (x) a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, we have a − b | P (a) − P (b) | P (P (a)) − P (P (b)) | · · · . • Intermediate Values: If P is a polynomial (or any continuous function) such that P (a) and P (b) have diﬀerent sign for a < b, then P has a root on the interval (a, b). • Construct a diﬀerent polynomial: Sometimes translating the given information into facts about a diﬀerent but related polynomial will lead to a simpler interpretation in terms of standard facts about polynomials. 3 Useful Facts Here are some facts that may be useful when dealing with polynomials. Fact 1. The sum of coeﬃcients of a polynomial P (x) is P (1), and the constant coeﬃcient is P (0). Fact 2. For a polynomial P (x), if P (a) = 0, then (x − a) divides P (x). Fact 3. Let P (x) and Q(x) be polynomials. Then, we may write P (x) = T (x)Q(x) + R(x) for some polynomials T (x) and R(x) with deg R(x) < deg Q(x). 1 Fact 4. Let P (x) be a polynomial. Then, for any a, we may write P (x) = b0 + b1(x − a) + b2(x − a)2 + · · · + bn(x − a) n for a unique choice of b0, . . . , bn. Fact 5. If a−k = ak for 0 ≤ k ≤ n in the rational function R(x) = a−nx−n + a−n+1x−n+1 + · · · + an−1xn−1 + anxn, then we may write R(x) = P (x + 1 x ) for some polynomial P (x) of degree n. Fact 6 (Vieta’s Formulas). If P (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn is a polynomial with roots r1, . . . , rn, then for 0 ≤ k ≤ n we have ak an = (−1) n−k ∑ i1<···<in−k n−k∏ j=0 rij , where the right hand side is the kth elementary symmetric function in r1, . . . , rn. Fact 7 (Lagrange Interpolation). Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n passing through the points (x0, y0), (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn). Then, we may write P (x) = k∑ i=0 yi ∏ j̸=i x − xj xi − xj . Fact 8. For integers a, b and a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients P (x), we have a−b | P (a)−P (b). Fact 9 (Gauss’ Lemma). Let P (x) be a monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Then if a is a rational root of P , then a is an integer. Fact 10. Let P (x) be a polynomial that takes integer values on the integers. For any k, deﬁne (x k ) = x(x − 1) · · · (x − k + 1) k! as a polynomial in x. Then, we may write P (x) = b0 ( x 0 ) + b1 (x 1 ) + · · · + bn (x n ) for a unique choice of integers b0, . . . , bn. 4 Problems 4.1 Polynomials Problem 2 (HMMT 2007).

Let n ≥ 3 be an integer. Let f (x) and g(x) be polynomials with real coeﬃcients such that the points (f (1), g(1)), (f (2), g(2)), . . . , (f (n), g(n)) in R2 are the vertices of a regular n-gon in counterclockwise order.

Consider the polynomials f (x) = n∑ k=1 akxk and g(x) = n∑ k=1 ak 2k − 1 x k, where a1, a2, . . . , an are real numbers and n is a positive integer. Show that if 1 and 2n+1 are zeros of g, then f has a positive zero less than 2n. Problem 6 (MOP 1997). Let S = {s1, s2, . . . , sn} be a set of n distinct complex numbers, for some n ≥ 9, exactly n − 3 of which are real. Prove that there are at most two quadratic polynomials f (z) with complex coeﬃcients such that f (S) = S (that is, f permutes the elements of S). Problem 7 (China 1995). Alice and Bob play a game with a polynomial of degree at least 4: x2n + □ x2n−1 + □ x2n−2 + · · · + □ x + 1. They ﬁll in the empty boxes with real numbers in turn. If the resulting polynomial has no real root, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. If Alice goes ﬁrst, who has a winning strategy? Problem 8 (WOP 2004).

The sequence (r(1), r(3), . . . , r(1023)) is called the remainder sequence of P (x). A remainder sequence is called complete if it is a per- mutation of (1, 3, 5, . . . , 1023).
