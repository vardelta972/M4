We will focus on developing math- ematical creativity and problem-solving skills in the realms of algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and number theory, in contrast to the rote applications found in most American high school math classrooms. Thus you should expect to really be challenged: the hardest problems on math com- petitions often require lots of experimentation with various approaches, and there wouldn’t be a point in doing them if your ﬁrst try always worked, anyway. On the other hand, with enough dedication and hard work, you will be able to improve signiﬁcantly, learn some interesting ideas, and hopefully have a lot of fun too along the way. After all, pure math is more or less the epitome of intellectual curiosity—it is not restrained the slightest by the ugliness of reality, and so every new beautiful or surprising result is an untainted jewel of logic and even a work of art in itself! We hope that this elegance so prevalent in math will motivate you to continue seeking its endless riches. 1 Discussion Problems 1. Find a closed form expression for 1 + 2 + · · · + n. 2.

The numbers 1 through 2011 are written on a board. At any time, we may take two numbers on the board and replace them by the absolute value of their diﬀerence.

We have n ≥ 2 lamps L1, . . . , Ln in a row, each of them being either on or oﬀ. Every second we simultaneously modify the state of each lamp as follows: if the lamp Li and its neighbours (only one neighbour for i = 1 or i = n, two neighbours for other i) are in the same state, then Li is switched oﬀ; otherwise, Li is switched on. Initially all the lamps are oﬀ except the leftmost one which is on. Prove that (a) there are inﬁnitely many integers n for which all the lamps will eventually be oﬀ, and (b) there are inﬁnitely many integers n for which all the lamps will never be all oﬀ. 3 22.
