Each problem (should) has a nonnegative integer answer, and each of the four sections have ten problems roughly ordered by diﬃculty. I tried to make the sections of similar diﬃculties, but this is probably not the case (Combinatorics and Number Theory seem easier than Algebra and Geometry). Have fun with the problems! The majority of these problems have been selected from both collections of questions (AoPS, Brilliant, various math camps) and actual contests (HMMT, iTest, Math League, Mandelbrot1, NIMO, etc.). 1Several of the Mandelbrot problems that appear in this collection came from the book Mandelbrot Morsels. To be honest, it has some pretty awesome problems, and it’s one of the few books that has a bunch of problems that haven’t all been released onto the Internet yet. It’s deﬁnitely worth checking out! 1 David Altizio AIME Practice Set 2015 Page 2 1 Algebra 1. Let c be the larger solution to the equation x2 − 20x + 13 = 0. Compute the area of the circle with center (c, c) passing through the point (13, 7). 2.

Let S be the sum of all x such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 99 and {x2} = {x} 2. Find the number formed by the ﬁrst three digits of ⌊S⌋. (Here ⌊x⌋ denotes the greatest integer less than or equal to x and {x} = x − ⌊x⌋ denotes the fractional part of x.) 9. Let a, b, c, and d be positive real numbers such that a 2 + b2 = c2 + d 2 = 2008, ac = bd = 1000. If S = a + b + c + d, compute the value of ⌊S⌋. 10. Suppose a, b, c, d are integers such that a + b + c + d = 0 and (ab − cd)(ac − bd)(ad − bc) + 5282 = 0. What is the maximum possible value of a?

A random pizza is made by ﬂipping a fair coin to decide whether to include pepperoni, then doing the same for sausage, mushrooms, and onions. The probability that two random pizzas have at least one topping in common can be written in the form m n where m and n are positive integers. Find m + n. 2. How many permutations (a1, a2, . . . , a10) of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 satisfy |a1 − 1| + |a2 − 2| + · · · + |a10 − 10| = 4? 3.

How many subsets of this set with two or more elements satisfy: (i) the terms of the subset form an arithmetic sequence, and (ii) we cannot include another element from S with this subset to form an even longer arithmetic sequence? 5. Simon and Garfunkle play in a round-robin golf tournament. Each player is awarded one point for a victory, a half point for a tie, and no points for a loss. Simon beat Garfunkle in the ﬁrst game by a record margin as Garfunkle sent a shot over the bridge and into troubled waters on the ﬁnal hole. Garfunkle went on to score 8 total victories, but no ties at all. Meanwhile, Simon wound up with exactly 8 points, including the point for a victory over Garfunkle. Amazingly, every other player at the tournament scored exactly n. Find the sum of all possible values of n. 6. An ant starts at the origin of a coordinate plane. Each minute, it either walks one unit to the right or one unit up, but it will never move in the same direction more than twice in the row. In how many diﬀerent ways can it get to the point (5,5)? 7. Thaddeus is given a 2013 × 2013 array of integers each between 1 and 2013, inclusive. He is allowed two operations: 1. Choose a row, and subtract 1 from each entry. 2. Chooses a column, and add 1 to each entry. He would like to get an array where all integers are divisible by 2013. Let M be the number of initial arrays for which this is possible. What is the number formed by the last three digits of M ? 8. If you ﬂip a fair coin 1000 times, let P be the expected value of the product of the number of heads and the number of tails.

What is the number formed by the last three digits of N ? 10. Seven points are spaced equally around a circle each having labeled with some number. A labeling is clean if for any two pairs of points a, b and c, d with a having the same label as b and c as d, but a not having the same label as c, the chords connecting ab and cd do not intersect. Additionally, two clean labelings are the same if the set of points that have the same label in one labeling are the same as in the other and if the points can be rotated to equal the other. How many unique clean labelings are there? David Altizio AIME Practice Set 2015 Page 4 3 Geometry 1. Regular hexagon ABCDEF is given in the plane.

In the corners of a square P QRS with side length 6 cm four smaller squares are placed with side lengths 2 cm. Let us denote their vertices by W, X, Y, Z like in the picture. A square ABCD is constructed in such a way, that points W, X, Y, Z lie inside the sides AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. Find the square of the largest possible distance between points P and D. 3. Two perpendicular planes intersect a sphere in two circles. These circles intersect in two points, A and B, such that AB = 42.

Two circles, ω1 and ω2, have radii of 5 and 12 respectively, and their centers are 13 units apart. The circles intersect at two diﬀerent points P and Q. A line l is drawn through P and intersects the circle ω1 at X ̸= P and ω2 at Y ̸= P . Find the maximum value of P X · P Y . 5. Two circles in the Cartesian plane have four common tangent lines. If the slopes of these lines are 2, 3, 4, and m, in increasing order, then calculate ⌊100m⌋. 6. Let point O be the origin of a three-dimensional coordinate system, and let points A, B, and C be located on the positive x, y, and z axes, respectively. Suppose OA = 4√75 and m∠BAC = 30 ◦. Compute 100K, where K is the area of △ABC. 7. Let △ABC be an isosceles triangle with AB = AC, and denote by ω the unique circle inscribed inside the triangle. Suppose the orthocenter of △ABC lies on ω. Then there exist relatively prime positive integers m and n such that cos ∠BAC = m n . Find m + n. 8. Let △ABC have AB = 6, BC = 7, and CA = 8, and denote by ω its circumcircle. Let N be a point on ω such that AN is a diameter of ω. Furthermore, let the tangent to ω at A intersect BC at T , and let the second intersection point of N T with ω be X. The length of AX can be written in the form m√n for positive integers m and n, where n is not divisible by the square of any prime. Find m + n. 9. Given a convex, n-sided polygon P , form a 2n-sided polygon clip(P ) by cutting oﬀ each corner of P at the edges’ trisection points. In other words, clip(P ) is the polygon whose vertices are the 2n edge trisection points of P , connected in order around the boundary of P . Let P1 be an isosceles trapezoid with side lengths 13, 13, 13, and 3, and for each i ≥ 2, let Pi = clip(Pi−1). This iterative clipping process approaches a limiting shape P∞ = limi→∞ Pi. If the diﬀerence of the areas of P10 and P∞ is written as a fraction x y in lowest terms, calculate the number of positive integer factors of x · y. 10. Let ABC be a triangle, and I its incenter. Let the incircle of ABC touch side BC at D, and let lines BI and CI meet the circle with diameter AI at points P and Q, respectively. Given BI = 6, CI = 5, DI = 3, ﬁnd the sum of the numerator and denominator of (DP/DQ) 2 when written in lowest terms. David Altizio AIME Practice Set 2015 Page 5 4 Number Theory 1. Jack chose nine diﬀerent integers from 1 through 19 and found their sum. From the remaining ten integers, Jill chose nine and found their sum.

It is well-known that the nth triangular number can be given by the formula n(n + 1)/2. A Pythagorean triple of square numbers is an ordered triple (a, b, c) such that a 2 + b2 = c 2.
