Dividing both sides by abc, the inequality becomes ∑ bc − ab ab + ca ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ ∑ bc ab + ca ≥ ∑ ab ab + ca , which is true by the rearrangement inequality.■ 2. It’s equivalent to maximize the product |x − x1| · · · |x − xn|. Note that xr+s − xs ≤ xr+t − xt if s ≤ t with equality iﬀ s = t. Assume for the sake of contradiction that the optimal point lies in the interval [xi−1, xi) for some 2 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Now consider x′ = xn−1 + (xi − x) ∈ (xn−1, xn) (this is easier to visualize with n points the real line). Clearly we have x ′ − xk > x − xk > 0 for 1 ≤ k ≤ i − 2 and x′ − xk ≥ xn−1+i−k − x ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ xn−1 − xn−1+i−k ≥ xk − xi for i ≤ k ≤ n − 1. Furthermore, (xn − x′)(x′ − xi−1) > (xn − x)(x − xi−1) ≥ 0 ⇐⇒ x′ − xn + xi−1 2 ≤ xn + xi−1 2 − x ⇐⇒ xn − xn−1 ≥ xi − xi−1, so |(x′ − x1) · · · (x′ − xi−2)| · |(x′ − xn−1) · · · (x′ − xi)| · |(x′ − xi−1)(x′ − xn)| > |(x − x1) · · · (x − xi−2)| · |(x − xi) · · · (x − xn−1)| · |(x − xn)(x − xi−1)|, a contradiction.■ 3. Let P (x, y) denote the assertion that f ( x+f (x) 2 + y) = 2x − f (x) + f (f (y)). First, suppose to the contrary that some a < b exist such that ℓ = f (a) = f (b). Then f (x) = ℓ for all a ≤ x ≤ b, so for suﬃciently small ϵ, P (a, b), P (a + 2ϵ, b − ϵ) =⇒ 2a − ℓ + f (ℓ) = f ( a + ℓ 2 + b ) = 2(a + 2ϵ) − ℓ + f (ℓ), a contradiction. Thus f is injective, so a < b =⇒ f (a) < f (b) and f (a) ≥ f (b) =⇒ a ≥ b, whence P (0, r) =⇒ f (f (r)) = f (0) + f ( f (0) 2 + r) =⇒ f (r) ≥ r + f (0) 2 ∀r. Now assume for the sake of contradiction that c = f (0)/2 > 0. Then P (f (r), r) =⇒ 2f (r) = f ( f (r) + f (f (r)) 2 + r) ≥ r + c + r + 2c 2 + r + c = 2r + 5c 2 =⇒ f (r) ≥ r + 5c 4 for all r, which is clearly impossible (since (5/4)n tends to inﬁnity). Hence f (0) = 0, so P (0, r) =⇒ f (f (r)) = f (r) =⇒ f (r) = r∀r, as desired.■ 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions 4. 5. If f is constant, then the desired result is trivial, so suppose that f is not constant. Then there exist integers ai, di with di > 0 (by the non-decreasing condition) such that f (pir+si) = ai+dir for all r ≥ 1. If pi/di ̸= pj/dj for some i, j, then we easily get a bounding contradiction with the non-decreasing condition, so we have di = kpi for all i and some positive integer k. By CRT, there exists a positive integer x such that x ≡ si (mod pi) for all i. But then f (x) = ai + kpi ( x − si pi ) ∀1 ≤ i ≤ n =⇒ a1 − ks1 = · · · = an − ksn = c for some integer c, i.e. f (pir + si) = ai + dir = c + k(pir + si) for all r ≥ 1. Again by CRT, we can ﬁnd a positive integer a such that a + i ≡ si (mod pi). Because f (a + i) = c + k(a + i) for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, we’re done.■ 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Geometry 1. Obviously ACBH1 is cyclic. Let M ′, N, N ′ be the midpoints of BH1, BC, AH1, respectively, and S be the foot from C1 to BH1. We’ll show that M, M ′, N, N ′, P, Q, R, S lie on a circle centered at the center of rectangle M N M ′N ′, which clearly implies that M1 = M ′ (which lies on BH1). By trivial angle chasing, ∠N C1C = ∠BCH1 = ∠C1AH1 = ∠P C1H1, so N C1P is a line. Similarly, M C1S, N ′C1R, and M ′C1Q are lines. By right angles, M, M ′, Q, S lie on a circle with diameter M M ′ and N, N ′, R, P lie on a circle with diameter N N ′. But the midpoints of M M ′ and N N ′ coincide at the center of rectangle M N M ′N ′ while M M ′ = N N ′, so we’re done.■ 2. Consider either △ABC with maximal area or segment XY with maximal length. The rest is easy.■ 3. Obviously M1M3 ∩ M2M4, I1I3 ⊥ I2I4, and K = I1I3 ∩ I2I4. Deﬁne 4α = ∠AOB, etc. such that α + β + γ + δ = 90 ◦. First we show that M1M3∥I1I3. Indeed, since I1KI3 bisects ∠AKB = ∠CKD, ∠AOI1 − ∠DOI3 = ∠AOI1 + ∠COI3 − 4γ = 2α − 2γ = ∠AOM1 − ∠COM3, so ∠I1OM1 = ∠I3OM3. Similarly, M2M4∥I2I4. Let T = M1M3∩M2M4, R = M1M3∩I2I4, and S = M2M4∩I1I3. Note that M1I2 = M1I4, I2R = I4R, etc. We have M1R M3R = [M1I2I4] [M3I2I4] = M1I4 M3I4 M1I2 M3I2 sin 2γ sin 2α = tan α tan γ , M2S M4S = tan β tan δ . Also, M1T M3T = M1M2 M3M2 M1M4 M3M4 = tan(α + β) tan(α + δ), M2T M4T = tan(β + α) tan(β + γ) and M1M3 = 2R sin(α + 2β + γ), M2M4 = 2R sin(β + 2γ + δ) while I1K I3K = AB CD = sin 2α sin 2γ , I2K I4K = sin 2β sin 2δ and I1I3 = 2M2M4 sin β sin δ sin(β + δ) , I2I4 = 2M1M3 sin α sin γ sin(α + γ) . Now let X = M1I1 ∩ M3I3 and Y = M2I2 ∩ M4I4, so it suﬃces to show that d(X, I1I3) = d(Y, I1I3) (so d(X, I2I4) = d(Y, I2I4) and thus X = Y follows by symmetry). All segments will be directed from now on. By easy ratios with similar triangles, we can compute d(X, I1I3) = I1I3 · ST M1M3 − I1I3 = M2M4 · M2T M2M4 − M2S M2M4 M1M3 I1I3 − 1 = M2M4 · tan(β+α) tan(β+γ) tan(β+α) tan(β+γ)+1 − tan β tan β+tan δ sin(α+2β+γ) sin(β+δ) 2 sin β sin δ sin(β+2γ+δ) − 1 = M2M4 sin(α + β) sin(β + γ) sin(β + δ) − sin β cos δ cos(α − γ) cos(β − δ) sin(β + δ) − 2 sin β sin δ cos(α − γ) 2 sin β sin δ sin(β + δ) = M2M4 [2 sin(α + β) sin(β + γ)] cos(α + γ) − [2 sin β sin(α + β + γ)] cos(α − γ) cos(β − δ) cos(α + γ) − 2 sin β sin δ cos(α − γ) sin β sin δ sin(β + δ) = M2M4 − cos(α + 2β + γ) cos(α + γ) + cos(α + 2β + γ) cos(α − γ) cos(β − δ) cos(α + γ) − 2 sin β sin δ cos(α − γ) sin β sin δ sin(β + δ) = M2M4 −2 sin(β − δ) sin α sin γ cos(β − δ) cos(α + γ) − 2 sin β sin δ cos(α − γ) sin β sin δ sin(β + δ) 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions and d(Y, I1I3) − I2K d(Y, I1I3) − M2S = I2I4 M2M4 =⇒ d(Y, I1I3) = M2M4 · I2K − I2I4 · M2S M2M4 − I2I4 = M2M4 · I2K I2I4 − M2S M2M4 M2M4 I2I4 − 1 = M2M4 · sin 2β sin 2β+sin 2δ − tan β tan β+tan δ sin(β+2γ+δ) sin(α+γ) 2 sin α sin γ sin(α+2β+γ) − 1 = M2M4 cos β − cos δ cos(β − δ) cos(α − γ) sin(α + γ) − 2 sin α sin γ cos(β − δ) 2 sin α sin β sin γ sin(β + δ) = M2M4 − sin δ sin(β − δ) cos(α − γ) cos(β + δ) − 2 sin α sin γ cos(β − δ) 2 sin α sin β sin γ sin(β + δ) Thus it remains to show that cos(β − δ) cos(α + γ) − 2 sin β sin δ cos(α − γ) = cos(α − γ) cos(β + δ) − 2 sin α sin γ cos(β − δ) ⇐⇒ cos(β − δ) cos(α − γ) = cos(α − γ) cos(β − δ), as desired.■ We can also solve this problem with complex numbers. Note that m 2 1 = ab, etc., and abcd = −m1m2m3m4, so there exist integers p, q, r, s such that (a, b, c, d, m1, m2, m3, m4) = (p 2, q2, r2, s 2, −pq, qr, rs, sp). Then I1 = AM2 ∩ BM4, etc., so i1 = pr(q2 + sp) − qs(p 2 + qr) pr − qs , x1 = pr(q + s) − qs(p + r) p + r − q − s , etc. where {Mi, Xi} = MiXi ∩ (ABCD) for all i. Then it just remains to show that m1x1 ∩ m3x3 = m2x2 ∩ m4x4, where to cycle through the variables (for ease of computation) we set (p, q, r, s) 7→ (−q, r, s, p) 7→ (−r, s, p, −q) 7→ (−s, p, −q, −r) 7→ · · · .■ 4. By simple angle chasing ∠AXY = ∠AY X = ∠BKX = ∠XKY = ∠CKY , so A is the intersection of the tangents XX, Y Y of the circle (KXY ). Set (KXY ) as the unit circle in the complex plane, so a = 2xy/(x + y). From the three similarities △M XP ∼ △M KX, △Y XP ∼ △Y BX, and △XY P ∼ △XCY (all of these are with opposite orientation), we have m − x p − x = ( m − k x − k ) =⇒ p = k(x 2 + y2) − xy(x + y) k(x + y) − 2xy y − b x − b = ( y − x p − x ) =⇒ b = k + (x − k) 2 y − k x − c y − c = ( x − y p − y ) =⇒ c = k + (y − k) 2 x − k . But Q is the spiral center taking XY to BC and XB to Y C, so (q − b)(q − y) = (q − c)(q − x) =⇒ q = by − cx b + y − c − x = x(y − k) 2 + y(x − k) 2 (x − k)2 + (y − k)2 . 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Finally, a−x q−x p−k q−k = − x(x + y − 2k)(k(x + y) − 2xy) (x − k)2(x + y)2 ∈ R so ∡QXA = ∡QKP , as desired.■ 5. Let α = ∠ABD = ∠ABC. Then the tangent from A to the circumcircle of △AM P is parallel to BC iﬀ 90 ◦ − ∠DAM = ∠AP M , i.e. ∠AP M = α or M A = M P . But M A = M D = M B, so it suﬃces to show that ADP B is cyclic. By trivial angle chasing ∠P AB = ∠P DB, as desired.■ 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Number Theory 1. Suppose that ak = 2k and let p be the minimal prime p such that p|k − 1, which exists since k ≥ 3.. Clearly ak+i = 2k + i for 0 ≤ i ≤ p − 2 and ak+p−1 = 2k + p − 2, so ak+p−1 − ak+p−2 = p. Since ak+p−1 = 2(k + p − 1), we can repeat this argument to get inﬁnitely many primes in the sequence {an − an−1}.■ 2. Since x is relatively prime to n iﬀ n − x is, we have f (n) = n(n + 1 − ϕ(n))/2. Case 1: p does not divide n. Then n(n + 1 − ϕ(n)) = (n + p)(n + p + 1 − ϕ(n + p)) and gcd(n, n + p) = 1 force n + p|n + 1 − ϕ(n). But 0 < n + 1 − ϕ(n) < n + p, which is impossible. Case 2: n = pk for some integer k ≥ 1. Then k(pk + 1 − ϕ(pk)) = (k + 1)(pk + p + 1 − ϕ(pk + p)) =⇒ k(pk + 1 − ϕ(pk)) − k[p(k + 1)] = (k + 1)(pk + p + 1 − ϕ(pk + p)) − (k + 1)[pk] =⇒ k(−p + 1 − ϕ(pk)) = (k + 1)(p + 1 − ϕ(pk + p)), so for some integer m we have ϕ(pk) + p − 1 = (k + 1)m (1) and ϕ(pk + p) − p − 1 = km. (2) If p = 2 and k ≥ 2, then ϕ(pk), ϕ(pk + p) are both even (ϕ(x) is even for x ≥ 3) so (k + 1)m and km are both odd, which is impossible since k, k + 1 have opposite parity. We can check that (p, k) = (2, 1) does not work, so now we can assume p ≥ 3 is odd. From (1), we have (k + 1)m > 0 =⇒ m ≥ 1, and from (2), we have km < pk + p − p − 1 = pk − 1 =⇒ m ≤ p − 1. Taking (1) and (2) (mod p − 1) and using the fact that p − 1 = ϕ(p)|ϕ(pk), ϕ(pk + p), we have p − 1|(k + 1)m and p − 1|km + 2. Subtracting these two divisibility relations, we ﬁnd that m ≡ 2 (mod p − 1). Since 1 ≤ m ≤ p − 1, we have m = 2, so ϕ(pk) = 2k + 3 − p and ϕ(pk + p) = 2k + 1 + p. If p|k + 1, then p|2k + 1 + p =⇒ p|1, which is absurd, and if p|k, then p|2k + 3 − p =⇒ p|3, in which case ϕ(3k) = 2k and 2k + 4 = ϕ(3k + 3) ≤ 2 3 (3k + 3) = 2k + 2, another contradiction. (This also shows that p = 3 does not work, so from now on assume that p ≥ 5.) Thus k, k + 1 are relatively prime to p, so ϕ(pk) = (p − 1)ϕ(k) and ϕ(pk + p) = (p − 1)ϕ(k + 1), i.e. ϕ(k) = 2k+3−p p−1 and ϕ(k + 1) = 2k+1+p p−1 . But this means that ϕ(k + 1) − ϕ(k) = 2. Since 2|ϕ(x) for x ≥ 3, we must have k ≥ 3. But then ϕ(k + 1), ϕ(k) cannot be congruent (mod 4), so because they’re both even exactly one of them must be congruent to 2 (mod 4). First suppose that ϕ(k) ≡ 2 (mod 4), so that k ∈ {4, qr, 2qr} for some odd prime q and integer r ≥ 1. If k = 4, then 2 = ϕ(k) = 2k + 3 − p p − 1 = 11 − p p − 1 =⇒ 3p = 13, which has no solutions. If k = qr or k = 2qr, then qr − qr−1 = ϕ(k) = 2k + 3 − p p − 1 ≤ 4qr + 3 − p p − 1 < 4qr p − 1 =⇒ 1 < 4 p − 1 + 1 q . Because q ≥ 3 and p ≥ 5, we must have p = 5. Therefore ϕ(k) = k−1 2 , so k is odd, i.e. k = qr and qr−1(q − 1) = qr−1 2 , which is impossible. 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Now suppose that ϕ(k + 1) ≡ 2 (mod 4), so that instead k ∈ {3, qr − 1, 2qr − 1} for some odd prime q and integer r ≥ 1. If k = 3, then 2 = ϕ(k + 1) = 2k + 1 + p p − 1 = 7 + p p − 1 =⇒ p = 9, which has no solutions. If k + 1 = qr or k + 1 = 2qr, then qr − qr−1 = ϕ(k + 1) = 2k + 1 + p p − 1 ≤ 4qr − 1 + p p − 1 = 4qr p − 1 + 1 =⇒ 1 ≤ 4 p − 1 + 1 qr + 1 q . Because q ≥ 3, r ≥ 1, and p ≥ 5, we must have p ∈ {5, 7, 11}. If p = 5, then ϕ(k + 1) = k+3 2 , so k is odd and qr−1(q − 1) = qr + 1, which is impossible. If p = 7, then 1 ≤ 4 p − 1 + 2 q =⇒ q ≤ 6 =⇒ q ∈ {3, 5}, and if p = 11, then q ≤ 10 3 =⇒ q = 3. Furthermore, if p = 7 and q = 5, then r ≤ 1 =⇒ k ∈ {4, 9}, if p = 11 and q = 3, then r ≤ 1 =⇒ k ∈ {2, 5}, both of which are easy to check. If p = 7 and q = 3, then 3 r − 3 r−1 = k + 4 3 =⇒ k = 3 r+1 − 3 r − 4, which yields no solutions. Finally, we conclude that f (n + p) = f (n) has no solutions, as desired.■ 3. The condition that no three points are collinear is the key to this problem. Without it, the case in which xi = yi = i for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n would clearly force k ≥ n − 1 in general (even if we relax it to not all points being collinear, a similar construction gets k ≥ n − 2), so we should expect an answer substantially less than n. We can easily see that k2 = 1, k3 = 1, and k4 = 2, so kn = ⌊n/2⌋ is a reasonable guess. The idea of taking y = Q(x) for a polynomial in x as in the previous paragraph gets us 2kn ≥ n − 1 in general when deg Q = 2 (i.e. take (xi, yi) = (i, Q(i))). Now we just need to construct an example for kn = ⌊n/2⌋. Since ⌊2m/2⌋ = m = ⌊(2m + 1)/2⌋, it suﬃces to construct for n = 2m + 1 odd (just add an arbitrary triple (xn+1, yn+1, cn+1) for n = 2m). We can set up an interpolation scheme (similar to Lagrange interpolation/CRT) by deﬁning lines AiAj ≡ Li,j(x, y) = ri,jx + si,jy + ti,j so that Li,j(Al) = 0 iﬀ l ∈ {i, j}. Taking all indices mod 2m + 1, P (x, y) = 2m+1∑ i=1 ci m∏ j=1 Li+j,i+j+m(x, y) Li+j,i+j+m(xi, yi) is clearly a working polynomial of degree m, as desired.■ 4. By deﬁnition of r, WLOG 0 ≤ r < p1 < p2 < · · · < pn. Assume for the sake of contradiction that r ≥ n − 1. Then p1 ≥ r + 1 ≥ n, so 0 < 1 p1 + · · · + 1 pn − p1 p1 · · · pn < 1 p1 + · · · + 1 pn − r p1 · · · pn ≤ n · 1 n − 0 = 1, contradicting the fact that 1 p1 + · · · + 1 pn − r p1 · · · pn is an integer.■ 5. Fix a positive integer r and consider a prime p > a r 1 + a r 2 + ar 3 + br 1 + br 2 + br 3. Taking n such that n ≡ r (mod p − 1) and n ≡ ar 3−ar 1 ar 1+ar 2+ar 3 (mod p) (which exists by CRT), we have (n + 1)a n 1 + nan 2 + (n − 1)a n 3 ≡ n(a r 1 + a r 2 + a r 3) − (ar 3 − ar 1) ≡ 0 (mod p). 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Thus 0 ≡ (n + 1)bn 1 + nbn 2 + (n − 1)b n 3 ≡ n(br 1 + br 2 + br 3) − (br 3 − b r 1) (mod p), so b r 3 − br 1 br 1 + br 2 + br 3 ≡ n ≡ a r 3 − a r 1 ar 1 + ar 2 + ar 3 (mod p) for all suﬃciently large primes p, whence (a r 1 + a r 2 + a r 3)(b r 3 − br 1) − (br 1 + b r 2 + br 3)(a r 3 − a r 1) = 0 =⇒ 2a r 3b r 1 + a r 3b r 2 + a r 2b r 1 = 2ar 1br 3 + ar 2br 3 + ar 1br 2 for all positive integers r. The conclusion easily follows with some casework, since we must have the multisets {a3b1, a3b1, a3b2, a2b1} and {a1b3, a1b3, a2b3, a1b2} equal (clearly the largest elements must be equal or else one side will dominate the other as r → ∞, etc.).■ 2011 Blue and Black Homework Solutions Combinatorics 1. Since 4 does not divide 10, some kid must have two colors of pencils. Then we can ﬁnd the remaining two colors from two other children, so n ≤ 3. If we distribute the pencils as AAAA, AAAA, BBBB, BBBB, AACC, BBCC, CCDD, CCDD, DDDD, we clearly need three kids, so n ≥ 3, as desired.■ 2. Suppose otherwise, and note that ai+1 + ai+4 > ai+2 + ai+3 ⇐⇒ ai+1 − ai+2 > ai+3 − ai+4 (indices taken (mod 100)). Thus a1 − a2 ≤ a3 − a4 ≤ · · · ≤ a99 − a100 ≤ a1 − a2 and a2 − a3 ≤ a4 − a5 ≤ · · · ≤ a100 − a1 ≤ a2 − a3, so α = a1 − a2 = · · · = a99 − a100 and β = a2 − a3 = · · · = a100 − a1 for some α, β. But 50α + 50β = 0, so a1 = a3, which is not allowed.■ 3. It’s natural to replace 17 by numbers k ≥ 2 to ﬁnd a pattern. We also expect d to be very large (i.e. close to 100 2), since otherwise the construction would be very diﬃcult. For k = 2, it’s easy to get rid of all rows except for at most 1 odd row. In the odd row, it’s easy to get rid of all squares but at most 1 odd square. The construction for d2 = 100 2 − 1 is trivial. In general, let the n rows modk have sums a1, . . . , an. Let the i th partial sum be si = a1 + · · · + ai. We’ll prove by induction on n ≥ 0 that we can color rows such that at most k − 1 rows remain uncolored. If k divides any of the partial sums si then we can color rows 1 through i and then use the inductive hypothesis, so suppose that k divides none of the si. Now let f (i) denote the largest index j ∈ [i, n] such that sj ≡ si (mod k) (this exists since si ≡ si), and consider the sequence b1, . . . , bℓ such that b1 = 1 and bm = f (bm−1 + 1) for m ≥ 1. By the deﬁnition of f , we see that sb1, sb2 , . . . , sbℓ (mod k) are pairwise distinct and bℓ = n. Yet k does not divide any of sb1 , sb2, . . . , sbℓ by assumption, so ℓ ≤ k − 1. Thus we can color the ℓ sets of rows (bm, f (bm)] for 1 ≤ m ≤ ℓ to leave exactly ℓ ≤ k − 1 rows uncolored, as desired. Similarly, in each of the uncolored rows we can color the squares so that at most k − 1 squares remain uncolored, so d(n, k) ≥ n2 − (k − 1)2. The construction is easy.■ 4. 5.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
