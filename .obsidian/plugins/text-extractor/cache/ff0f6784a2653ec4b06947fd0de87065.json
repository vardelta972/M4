(1 point) Note that 3 111890 = 3 111888+2 = 3 111·1008+2 = 9 (3 1008)111. Since 1009 is prime, by Fermat’s Little Theorem we have that 3 1008 ≡ 1 (mod 1009). Hence 9 (3 1008)111 ≡ 9 · 1 ≡ 9 (mod 1009). 2. (1 point) Since 2011 is prime, by Wilson’s theorem 2010! ≡ −1 ≡ 2011 − 1 ≡ 2010 (mod 2011). Thus dividing out 2010 from each side we see that 2009! ≡ 1 (mod 2011). 3. (2 point) Suppose n+1 is prime. Then Wilson’s theorem says that n! ≡ −1 (mod n+1), so n!+1 ≡ 0 (mod n+1). Clearly in this case our answer would be n+1. Now suppose n+1 is composite. If we think for a bit, we realize that n! ≡ 0 (mod n+1) for composite n, as the product n! contains two factors of n + 1. In this case, n! + 1 is relatively prime to 1, 2, . . . , n, n + 1, so the gcd with (n + 1)! is 1. Thus our answer is: If n + 1 is composite, 1; if n + 1 is prime, n + 1. 4. (2 points) From problem 2, we know that 2009! ≡ 1 (mod 2011), so this problem is the same as computing 1 2009 (mod 2011). To do this, note that 2009 ≡ −2 (mod 2011), so 1005 · −2 ≡ −2010 ≡ 1 (mod 2011). 5. (2 points) Because 101 is prime, we know that 9 100 ≡ 1 (mod 101) by Fermat’s Little Theorem. Since 9 1011 = 9 100·109 = (9 100)109, we get our answer to be 1 (mod 101). 6. (2 points) What this problem is really asking for is 13 1022 (mod 31). Because 31 is prime, we know that 13 30 ≡ 1 (mod 31), and hence 13 1022 = 13 30·34+2 ≡ 13 2 ≡ 14 (mod 31). 7. (3 points) Last three digits means we want to look at the number mod 1000. First, we show that 7 10000 ≡ 1 (mod 1000), as our desired three digits can then be found simply by inverting 7. To simplify the exponent, let’s try to ﬁnd an analog of Fermat’s Little Theorem for (mod n), where we let n be any integer instead of only primes. Notice we will only be able to cancel numbers from both sides the way we did when n was prime if the number being canceled is relatively prime to n. In addition, a will have to be relatively prime to n (do you see why?). Let S = {1, k0, k2, . . . , n − 1} be the set of all integers less than and relatively prime to n. We can do something similar to what we did before, namely a · k0a · k1a · · · (m − 1)a ≡ 1 · k0 · k1 · · · (n − 1) (mod n) We need a way to count the numbers less than and relatively prime to n. Therefore, we deﬁne a function ϕ(n) that returns the desired number. This is known as Euler’s totient function. Now we can do what we did before and cancel 1 · k0 · k1 · · · (n − 1) from both sides, yielding aϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) 1 This is known as Euler’s generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem. We ﬁnd ϕ(1000) = 1000 − 500 − 200 + 100 = 400, so 7 10000 = 7 400·25 = (7 400)25 ≡ 1 as desired. Now we can quickly compute 7 −1 by noting 7 · 143 = 1001 ≡ 1 (mod 1000). 8. (3 points) We cleverly rewrite n4−n2+57 ≡ n4−74n2+1225 ≡ (n−5)(n−7)(n+5)(n+7) (mod 73). Thus our solutions are 5, 7, 66, 68 . 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
