Sep. 11, start of class Instructions: Read the homework guidelines and policies. Feel free to use a calculator or computer for the computational problems. Written assignment 1.7 The Diophantus Chord Method Exercise 1.6. Use the rational slope method to ﬁnd all rational points on the ellipse X 2 + 2Y 2 = 1. 1.8 Gaussian Integers Exercise 1.7. Exercises 1.8.4, 1.8.5, 1.8.6. 2.1 The gcd by subtraction Exercise 2.1. Exercises 2.1.1, 2.1.3, 2.1.5. Exercise 2.2. Compute gcd(84, 63) using the method in Section 2.1. Write out each step. 2.2 The gcd by division with remainder Exercise 2.3. Compute gcd(42, 8) using the division method. Write out each step. 2.3 Linear representation of the gcd Exercise 2.4. Exercise 2.3.2. (You may use either the tableau method, the method in the text, or any other equivalent method you like. Just write down each step and explain your method if it is not one of two mentioned above.) 2.5 Consequences of unique prime factorization Proposition 2.1. If N is nonsquare, then √N is irrational. Exercise 2.5. Does (the proof of ) Proposition 2.1 (cf. Section 2.5) require that the prime factor- ization is unique? Explain. Exercise 2.6. Prove the following (slighly generalized) assertion from Section 2.5: Unique prime factorization implies that each prime power divisor of a natural number n (i.e., a prime power that divides n) actually appears in the prime factorization of n. (Hint: it’s easy, but you need to write down what it means to be a divisor.) Exercise 2.7. Exercises 2.5.1 and 2.5.2. 2.6 Linear Diophantine equations Exercise 2.8. Exercises 2.6.1, 2.6.2, 2.6.3, 2.6.4. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
