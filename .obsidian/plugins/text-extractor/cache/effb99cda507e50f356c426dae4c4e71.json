A 2n × 2n board is divided into 4n2 small squares in the manner of a chessboard. Each small square is painted with one of four colours so that every 2 × 2 block of four small squares involves all four colours. Prove that the four corner squares of the board are painted with diﬀer- ent colours. Note that the punchline could instead be either “How many such con- ﬁgurations are possible?”” or “Show that there are 3 × 24n−1 such paintings of the square”. The arguments are similar to the one below. Suppose that there is a 3 × 1 horizontal (without loss of generality, vertical is similar) run of three diﬀerent colours. The painting of that row determines the paining of the rest of the square, since the colours of squares adjacent to the central square (of the three) are determined, and then this information propagates to the rest of the board. The manner of the propagation ensures that horizontal rows alternate be- tween two patterns, so in the vertical direction each column will consist of alternating colours. Also, considering a corner four (say the top left corner coloured A, and the other three squares coloured B, C, D in anticlockwise order. The third column must begin AB or BA, the fourth column must begin CD or DC etc. So the ﬁnal column must begin CD or DC. The ﬁrst and ﬁnal columns must alternate between A and B and between C and D respectively, so we are done in this case. Finally suppose that there is no consecutive run of three colours (hor- izontal or vertical) anywhere on the board. Therefore the painting consists n2 copies of the top left 2 × 2 square tiling the board. In this case too, we are done. 2. Which positive integers n have the property that {1, 2, . . . , n} can be partitioned into two subsets A and B so that the sum of the squares of the elements of A is the sum of the squares of the elements of B? Notice that m2 − (m − 1)2 = (m − 2)2 − (m − 3)2 − 5 for each integer m, so m 2−(m−1) 2−(m−2) 2+(m−3) 2−(m−4) 2+(m−5) 2+(m−6) 2−(m−7) 2 = 0. Therefore if the result holds for N , then it holds for N + 8. The sum of the ﬁrst n squares is even if, and only if, n is 0 or 3 modulo 4. This is a necessary condition for the condition to hold. By inspection, the result does not hold when n = 3, 4. It holds when n = 7 by putting m = 7 in the displayed formula above, and discarding the irrelevant 02 term. It holds when n = 8 by putting m = 8 in the displayed formula above. When n = 12, the result holds because half the sum of the ﬁrst 12 squares is 325 = 12 2 + 102 + 82 + 42 + 12. The result holds when n = 11 because half the sum of the ﬁrst 11 squares is 253 = 11 2 + 92 + 52 + 42 + 32 + 12. Therefore the result holds when n is at least 8 and is divisible by 4, and when n is at least 7 and leaves remainder 3 on division by 4, and does not hold for any other positive integer n. 3. This problem concerns polynomials in X with real coeﬃcients. Let f (X) = 2013X + 1. Suppose that g(X) and h(X) are polynomials such that f (g(X)) = g(f (X)) and f (h(X)) = h(f (X)). Prove that g(h(X)) = h(g(X)). Let k = 2013, and c = −1/2012 be the unique ﬁxed point of f (i.e. f (c) = c). First we study g. Now g(c) = g(f (c)) = f (g(c)) so g(c) = c. Therefore g = (X −c)q+c where q (or q(X)) is a real polynomial. Now f (g(X)) = g(f (X)) and we can write f as k(X − c) + c. Therefore k(X − c)q + c = k(X − c)q(f (X)) + c and so q(X) = q(f (X)). Now 1 < f (1) = 2014, and inductively f i(1) < f i+1(1) for every positive integer i. It follows that q(X) − q(1) has inﬁnitely many roots and so is the zero polynomial. Thus q(X) is u, a constant polynomial. Therefore g = u(X − c) + c. Conversely if g = u(X − c) + c for some constant u, then f (g(X)) is uk(X − c) + c and this is also g(f (X)). The polynomials g which composition-commute with f are precisely the polynomials of degree at most 1 such that g(c) = c. Now suppose that g is u(X − c) + c and h = v(X − c) + c are any two such polynomials, then g(h(X)) = uv(X − c) + c = h(g(X)) as required.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
