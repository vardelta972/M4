Find the number of permutations (a 1 , a 2 , . . . , a n ) of {1, 2, . . . , n} for which k | 2(a 1 + a 2 + . . . + a k ), for every 1 ≤ k ≤ n. 2. Find all functions f : R + → R + such that for any x, y, z ∈ R + with x + y ≥ z, f (x + y − z) + f (2 √xz) + f (2√yz) = f (x + y + z). 3. (IMO Short list 2001, N4) Let p ≥ 5 be a prime number. Prove that there exists an integer a with 1 ≤ a ≤ p − 2 such that neither a p−1 − 1 nor (a + 1) p−1 − 1 is divisible by p 2 . 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
