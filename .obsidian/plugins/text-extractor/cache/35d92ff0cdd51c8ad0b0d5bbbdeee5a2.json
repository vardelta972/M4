The notation used for this is the Legendre symbol ( a p ) , which is deﬁned to equal 0 if a is a multiple of p, 1 if a is a nonzero quadratic residue, and −1 otherwise. Then the following facts suﬃce to compute any Legendre symbol: • ( a p ) = ( b p ) for a ≡ b mod p. • ( ab p ) = ( a p ) ( b p ). • ( −1 p ) = (−1)(p−1)/2. • ( 2 p ) = (−1)(p2−1)/8. • Quadratic Reciprocity: ( q p ) = (−1)(p−1)(q−1)/4 ( p q ) for any odd primes p and q. Example: 7 is a square mod p ̸= 2, 7 if and only if p ≡ 1, 3, 9, 19, 25, or 27 mod 28. 2 What is a quadratic form? A quadratic form is a homogeneous polynomial of degree 2 in some number of variables: f (x1, . . . , xk) = ∑ 1≤i≤j≤k aijxixj. Here the coeﬃcients aij can live in any ring, but usually we’ll be interested in integer quadratic forms. Example: x2 + y2 + yz + z2. A (real) quadratic form f (x1, . . . , xk) is positive-deﬁnite if f (x1, . . . , xk) ≥ 0 for all x1, . . . , xk and f (x1, . . . , xk) = 0 only when x1 = x2 = · · · = xk. A (real) quadratic form is indeﬁnite if f takes on both positive and negative values. Examples: x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 is positive-deﬁnite, x2 − 2y2 is indeﬁnite. Binary quadratic forms are particularly pleasant to work with because they factor over a quadratic extension of the rationals: x2 + ny2 = (x + y√−n)(x − y√−n). Even if you don’t know very much about the algebraic number theory of quadratic extensions, this can still be used to construct identities like (a 2 + nb2)(c 2 + nd2) = (ac − nbd) 2 + n(ad + bc) 2. 1 3 Representing numbers We say that a quadratic form f (x1, . . . , xk) represents a number n if there exist x1, . . . , xn (in our coeﬃcient ring, so usually integers) such that f (x1, . . . , xk) = n. Determining the set of numbers represented by a given quadratic form can be quite a diﬃcult problem, and a lot of beautiful number theory was developed by people who were working on this. Here are some answers to questions of representability for certain quadratic forms: • The Two Squares Theorem: A positive integer n is the sum of two squares if and only if every prime p congruent to 3 mod 4 divides n with even multiplicity. In fact, \f \f \f{(x, y) ∈ Z 2 : x2 + y2 = n}\f \f \f = 4(d1(n) − d3(n)), where di(n) is the number of positive divisors of n congruent to i mod 4. • The Three Squares Theorem: A positive integer is the sum of three squares if and only if it is not of the form 4k(8m + 7). • The Four Squares Theorem: Any positive integer is the sum of four squares. In fact, \f \f \f{(x1, x2, x3, x4) ∈ Z 4 : x2 1 + x2 2 + x2 3 + x2 4 = n} \f \f \f = 4 ∑ d|n,4∤d d. • The 290 theorem: If a positive-deﬁnite quadratic form represents all positive integers up through 290, then it represents all positive integers. • The Hasse-Minkowski theorem: If a quadratic form represents an integer over R and over Qp for each p, then it represents that integer over Q. • Primes represented by binary quadratic forms have been particularly studied: – An odd prime p is the sum of two squares if and only if it is 1 mod 4. – An odd prime p is representable by x2 + 2y2 if and only if it is 1 or 3 mod 8. – A prime p ̸= 3 is representable by x 2 + 3y2 if and only if it is 1 mod 3. – A prime p ̸= 5 is representable by x2 + 5y2 if and only if it is 1 or 9 mod 20. – A prime p ̸= 2, 5 is representable by 2x2 + 2xy + 3y2 if and only if it is 3 or 7 mod 20. – A prime p is representable by x2 + 14y2 if and only if ( −14 p ) = 1 and (x2 + 1) 2 ≡ 8 mod p has a solution. • Pell equations: x2 − dy2 represents 1 in inﬁnitely many diﬀerent ways for any nonsquare positive d. These solutions to the equation x2 − dy2 = 1 come in a single inﬁnite family generated by the smallest nontrivial solution x0 + y0√d. The generalized Pell equation x2 − dy2 = n is more subtle; there could be no solutions or multiple disjoint inﬁnite families of solutions. 2 4 Problems 1. Prove that any prime p ≡ 1 mod 4 is the sum of two squares. (If you’ve seen this, try the corresponding statements for x2 + 2y2 and x2 + 3y2.) 2. (Bulgaria 96) Prove that for any natural number n ≥ 3, there exist odd numbers x and y such that 7x2 + y2 = 2 n. 3. (Romania TST 2004) Let p be an odd prime and deﬁne f (x) = p−1∑ k=1 ( k p ) xk−1. Show that: if p ≡ 3 mod 4, then x − 1 divides f (x) but (x − 1) 2 does not; if p ≡ 5 mod 8, then (x − 1) 2 divides f (x) but (x − 1)3 does not. 4. Show that the equation 2y2 = x4 − 17z4 has no positive integer solutions. 5. (ELMO 2003) Let f (x, y, z = 2xy + 2yz + 2zx − x2 − y2 − z2 and suppose that f represents a positive integer n. Show that there exist positive integers a, b, c that are the side lengths of a triangle and that satisfy f (a, b, c) = n. 6. (ISL 01/N4) Let a > b > c > d be positive integers and suppose that ac + bd = (b + d + a − c)(b + d − a + c). Prove that ab + cd is not prime. 7. Show that the equation x5 − y2 = 52 has no positive integer solutions. 8. (ISL 04/N7) Let p be an odd prime and n a positive integer. In the coordinate plane, eight distinct points with integer coordinates lie on a circle with diameter of length p n. Prove that there exists a triangle with vertices at three of the given points such that the squares of its side lengths are integers divisible by pn+1. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
