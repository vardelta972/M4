Suppose there are four boxes containing $10, $20, $50 and $100 bills, respectively. You may take 2 bills from one box, 3 bills from another, 4 bills from another, and 5 bills from the remaining box. What is the maximum amount of money you can get? Clearly, you’d want to take as many bills as possible from the box with largest-value bills! So you would take 5 $100 bills, 4 $50 bills, 3 $20 bills, and 2 $10 bills, for a grand total of 5 · $100 + 4 · $50 + 3 · $20 + 2 · $10 = $780. (1) Suppose instead that your arch-nemesis (who isn’t very good at math) is picking the bills instead, and he asks you how many bills he should take from each box. In this case, to minimize the amount of money he gets, you’d want him to take as many bills as possible from the box with lowest-value bills. So you tell him to take 5 $10 bills, 4 $20 bills, 3 $50 bills, and 2 $100 bills, for a grand total of 5 · $10 + 4 · $20 + 3 · $50 + 2 · $100 = $480. (2) The maximum is attained when the number of bills taken and the denominations are similarly sorted as in (1) and the minimum is attained when they are oppositely sorted as in (2). The Rearrangement Inequality formalizes this observation. Theorem 1.1 (Rearrangement): Let x1, x2, . . . , xn and y1, y2, . . . , yn be real numbers (not necessarily positive) with x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn, and y1 ≤ y1 ≤ · · · ≤ yn, and let σ be a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , n}. (That is, σ sends each of 1, 2, . . . , n to a diﬀerent value in {1, 2, . . . , n}.) Then the following inequality holds: x1yn + x2yn−1 + · · · + xny1 ≤ x1yσ1 + x2yσ2 + · · · + xnyσn ≤ x1y1 + x2y2 + · · · + xnyn. Proof. We prove the inequality on the right by induction on n. The statement is obvious for n = 1. Suppose it true for n − 1. Let m be an integer such that σm = n. Since xn ≥ xm and yn ≥ yσn, 0 ≤ (xn − xm)(yn − yσn) (3) =⇒ xmyn + xnyσn ≤ xmyσn + xnyn. OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 Hence x1yσ1 + · · · + xm yσm|{z} yn + · · · + xnyσn ≤ x1yσ1 + · · · + xmyσn + · · · + xnyn. (4) By the induction hypothesis, x1yσ1 + · · · + xmyσn + · · · + xn−1yσ(n−1) ≤ x1y1 + · · · + xmym + · · · + xn−1yn−1. Thus the RHS of (4) is at most x1y1 + · · · + xn−1yn−1 + xnyn, as needed. To prove the LHS, apply the above with −yi instead of yi (noting that negating an inequality reverses the sign). Remark 1.2: Equality is attained on the RHS if and only if, for every r, the following are equal as multisets: {ym | xm = r} = {yσm | xm = r}. To see this, note that otherwise, using the procedure above, at some time we will have to switch two unequal numbers y′ k, y′ m with unequal corresponding x’s, xk ̸= xm, and we get inequality (see (3)). Similarly, equality is attained on the LHS if and only if for every r, {yn+1−m | xm = r} = {yσm | xm = r}. In particular, if the a1, . . . , an are all distinct and b1, . . . , bn are all distinct, then equality on the right-hand side occurs only when σ(m) = m for all m, and equality on the left-hand side occurs only when σ(m) = n + 1 − m for all m. The rearrangement inequality can be used to prove the following. Theorem 1.3 (Chebyshev): Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be two similarly sorted sequences. Then a1bn + a2bn−1 + · · · + anb1 n ≤ a1 + a2 + · · · + an n · b1 + b2 + · · · + bn n ≤ a1b1 + · · · + anbn n Proof. Add up the following inequalities (which hold by the Rearrangement Inequality): a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≤ a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn a1b2 + a2b3 + · · · + anb1 ≤ a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ... a1bn + a2b1 + · · · + anbn−1 ≤ a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn After factoring the left-hand side and dividing by n2, we get the right-hand inequality. By replacing bi with −bi and using the above result we get the left-hand inequality. 2 Problems 1. Given that a, b, c ≥ 0, prove a3 + b3 + c3 ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a. 2. Powers: For a, b, c > 0 prove that 2 OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 (a) aabbcc ≥ abbcca. (b) aabbcc ≥ (abc) a+b+c 3 . 3. Suppose a1, a2, . . . , an > 0 and let s = a1 + · · · + an. Prove that a1 s − a1 + · · · + an s − an ≥ n n − 1. In particular, conclude Nesbitt’s Inequality a b + c + b a + c + c a + b ≥ 3 2 for a, b, c > 0. 4. Prove the following for x, y, z > 0: (a) x2 y + y2 x ≥ x + y. (b) x2 y2 + y2 z2 + z2 x2 ≥ x z + y x + z y . (c) xy z2 + yz x2 + zx y2 ≥ x y + y z + z x. 5. (IMO 1978/2) Let a1, . . . , an be pairwise distinct positive integers. Show that a1 12 + a2 22 + · · · + an n2 ≥ 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n. 6. (modiﬁed ISL 2006/A4) Prove that for all positive a, b, c, ab a + b + bc b + c + ac a + c ≤ 3(ab + bc + ca) 2(a + b + c) . 7. Prove that for any positive real numbers a, b, c the following inequality holds: a2 + bc b + c + b2 + ac c + a + c2 + ab a + b ≥ a + b + c. 8. (MOSP 2007) Let k be a positive integer, and let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive real numbers. Prove that ( n∑ i=1 1 1 + xi ) ( n∑ i=1 xi ) ≤ ( n∑ i=1 xk+1 i 1 + xi ) ( n∑ i=1 1 xk i ) . 9. The numbers 1 to 100 are written on a 10 × 10 board (1–10 in the ﬁrst row, etc.). We are allowed to pick any number and two of its neighbors (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally—but our choice must be consistent), increase the number with 2 and decrease the neighbors by 1, or decrease the number by 2 and increase the neighbors by 1. At some later time the numbers in the table are again 1, 2, . . . , 100. Prove that they are in the original order. 3 OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 3 Solutions 1. The sequences a, b, c and a2, b 2, c 2 are similarly sorted. Therefore, by the rearrange- ment inequality, a2 · a + b2 · b + c2 · c ≥ a 2 · b + b2 · c + c2 · a. 2. Since ln is an increasing function, we take the ln of both sides to ﬁnd that the inequalities are equivalent to a ln a + b ln b + c ln c ≥ b ln a + c ln b + a ln c a ln a + b ln b + c ln c ≥ a + b + c 3 (ln a + ln b + ln c). Note the sequences (a, b, c) and (ln a, ln b, ln c) are similarly sorted, since ln is an increasing function. Then the ﬁrst inequality follows from Rearrangement and the second from Chebyshev. 3. Since both sides are symmetric, we may assume without loss of generality that a1 ≤ · · · ≤ an. Then s − a1 ≥ · · · ≥ s − an and 1 s−a1 ≤ · · · ≤ 1 s−an . By Chebyshev’s inequality with (a1, . . . , an) and ( 1 s−a1 , . . . , 1 s−an ), we get a1 s − a1 + · · · + an s − an ≥ 1 n(a1 + · · · + an) ( 1 s − a1 + · · · + 1 s − an ) = 1 n ( s s − a1 + · · · + s s − an ) = 1 n ( a1 s − a1 + · · · + s s − an + n ) . This gives n − 1 n ( a1 s − a1 + · · · + an s − an ) ≥ 1 =⇒ a1 s − a1 + · · · + an s − an ≥ n n − 1 . 4. (a) Without loss of generality, x ≥ y. Then x2 ≥ y2 and 1 y ≥ 1 x, i.e. (x2, y2) and ( 1 y , 1 x) are similarly sorted. Thus x2 · 1 y + y2 · 1 x ≥ x2 · 1 x + y2 · 1 y . (b) Letting a = x y , b = y z , c = z x, the inequality is equivalent to a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca. This is true by the rearrangement inequality applied to the similarly sorted sequences (a, b, c) and (a, b, c). 4 OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 (c) Let a = x 1 3 y 1 3 z 2 3 , b = x 1 3 z 1 3 y 2 3 , and c = y 1 3 z 1 3 x 2 3 . Then the inequality to prove becomes a3 + b3 + c3 ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a which was proved in problem 1. 5. Let b1, . . . , bn be the numbers a1, . . . , an in increasing order. Since b1 ≤ · · · ≤ bn and 1 12 ≥ · · · ≥ 1 n2 , by the rearrangement inequality, a1 12 + a2 22 + · · · + an n2 ≥ b1 12 + b2 22 + · · · + bn n2 . However, since the positive integers bm are distinct and in increasing order, we must have bm ≥ m. This gives the RHS is at least 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · 1 n. 6. Since the inequality is symmetric we may assume a ≤ b ≤ c. Then a + b ≤ a + c ≤ b + c. (5) We claim that ab a + b ≤ ac a + c ≤ bc b + c. (6) Indeed, the two inequalities are equivalent to a2b + abc ≤ a2c + abc abc + ac2 ≤ abc + bc2 both of which hold. Thus by Chebyshev applied to (5) and (6), we get ( ab a + b + ac a + c + bc b + c ) ((a + b) + (a + c) + (b + c)) ≤ 3(ab + bc + ca). (7) Dividing by 2(a + b + c) gives the desired inequality. (Note: The original problem asked to prove ∑ i<j aiaj ai + aj ≤ n 2(a1 + · · · + an) ∑ i<j aiaj when a1, . . . , an. This can be proved by summing (7) over all 3-element subsets {a, b, c} of (the multiset) {a1, . . . , an}, then dividing. This is a rare instance of a general inequality following directly from the 3-variable case!) 7. Since the inequality is symmetric, we may assume without loss of generality that a ≤ b ≤ c. Then a2 ≤ b2 ≤ c2 1 b + c ≤ 1 a + c ≤ 1 a + b . 5 OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 Hence by the rearrangement inequality, a2 b + c + b2 c + a + c2 a + b ≥ b2 b + c + c2 c + a + a2 a + b . Adding bc b+c + ac c+a + ab a+b to both sides gives a2 + bc b + c + b2 + ac c + a + c2 + ab a + b ≥ b2 + bc b + c + c2 + ac c + a + a2 + ab a + b = b(b + c) b + c + c(c + a) c + a + a(a + b) a + b = a + b + c. 8. We apply Chebyshev’s inequality twice: ( n∑ i=1 1 1 + xi ) ( n∑ i=1 xi ) ≤ [ 1 n ( n∑ i=1 1 xk i ) ( n∑ i=1 xk i 1 + xi )] ( n∑ i=1 xi ) = ( n∑ i=1 1 xk i ) [ 1 n ( n∑ i=1 xk i 1 + xi ) ( n∑ i=1 xi )] ≤ ( n∑ i=1 1 xk i ) ( n∑ i=1 xk+1 i 1 + xi ) . Indeed, without loss of generality x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xn. In the ﬁrst application of Cheby- shev we use that the following are oppositely sorted: 1 xk 1 ≥ · · · ≥ 1 xk n xk 1 1 + x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xk n 1 + xn . The second inequality comes from the fact that f (x) = xk 1+x is an increasing function for k ≥ 1, x ≥ 0: if x ≤ y then xk ≤ yk and xk−1 ≤ yk−1 together give xk + xky ≤ yk + xyk xk 1 + x ≤ yk 1 + y . (A simple derivative calculation also does the trick.) In the second application of Chebyshev we use that the following are similarly sorted: xk 1 1 + x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xk n 1 + xn x1 ≤ · · · ≤ xn. 9. Look for an invariant! Let aij = 10(i − 1) + j, the original number in the (i, j) position in the array. Let bij be the numbers after some transformations. Then P = ∑ 1≤i,j≤10 aijbij 6 OMC 2011 Rearrangement Inequality Lecture 23 is invariant. (Indeed, two opposite neighbors of aij are aij ± d for some d; the sum changes by ±(2aij − (aij − d) − (aij + d)) = 0 at each step.) Initially, P = ∑ 1≤i,j≤10 a2 ij. Suppose that bij are a permutation of the aij’s. Then ∑ 1≤i,j≤10 a2 ij = ∑ 1≤i,j≤10 aijbij. By the equality case of the rearrangement inequality, since the aij are all distinct and the bij are all distinct, the aij and bij must be sorted similarly, i.e. aij = bij for all i, j.
