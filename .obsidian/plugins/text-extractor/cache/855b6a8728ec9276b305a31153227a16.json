Hence the need for the reals. Example below. 1.1.1 Prove √5 /∈ Q Proof. Suppose p ∈ Z, q ∈ N such that x = p q ≥ 0. Then p ≥ 0 so p ∈ N and ( p q )2 = 5. Then p 2 = 5q2. We know every natural number has a unique prime factorisation. Let k be number of factors 5 in the prime factorisation of p. Let l be likewise for q. Then p 2 has 2k factors of 5. Similarly q2 has 2l factors of 5, and 5q2 has 2l + 1 factors of 5. But p2 = 5q2 and by the uniqueness of the prime factors, there must be 2k = 2l + 1 factors. A contradiction since 2k is even, and 2l + 1 is odd. \t 1.2 R is a Field There exists operations · and + st: (A1) x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z (A2) ∃0 ∈ R : 0 + x = x (A3) ∀x ∈ R, ∃y ∈ R : y + x = 0 (A4) x + y = y + x∀x, y ∈ R (A5) (x · y)z = x · (y · z) (A6) (x + y)z = (xz) + (yz) (A7) ∃1 ∈ R : 1x = x, 1 ̸= 0 (A8) xy = yx (A9) ∃y, ∀x : xy = 1 if x ̸= 0. ie. y = x−1 = 1 y 1.3 R is Ordered Let B be a total ordering on R. Then, there is a relation ≤ on R st: (B1) x ≤ x, ∀x ∈ R (B2) if (x ≤ y and y ≤ x) then x = y (B3) if (x ≤ y and y ≤ z) then x ≤ z (B4) ∀x, y ∈ R then x ≤ y or y ≤ x (B5) if x ≤ y then x + z ≤ y + z, ∀x, y, z ∈ R (B6) if x ≤ y and u ≥ 0 then xu ≤ yu 1.3.1 If x ∈ R and x ≤ 0 then −x ≥ 0 Proof. Take z = −x and apply (B5). Then 0 = (−x) + x = x + (−x) ≤ 0 + (−x) = −x. 1.3.2 x ≥ 0 =⇒ x2 ≥ 0 Proof. 0 = 0 · x ≤ x · x = x2 7 1.3.3 x ≤ 0 =⇒ (−x)2 ≥ 0 Proof. Let x ≥ 0. Then −x < 0 and (−x) · (−x) = −(−x · x). Since −(−x · x) + (−x · x) = 0 we know (−x) 2 = x2. It follows that x2 > 0. 1.3.4 1 > 0 Proof. 1 = 1 2 >= 0. Since 1 ̸= 0 then 1 > 0. 1.3.5 If x > 0 then 1 x > 0 Proof. Suppose not. Then 1 x < 0 or 1 x = 0. (i) 1 x = 0 ⇐⇒ 1 = 0 · x = 0 \t (ii) 1 x < 0 =⇒ 1 = 1 x · x ≤ 0 · x = 0. \t 1.4 Bernoulli Inequality Let a ∈ R, a > −1, n ∈ N. Then (1 + a) n ≥ 1 + na. Proof. Let P (n) be the statement that (1 + a) n ≥ 1 + na is true. P(1): (1 + a) n = 1 + a ≥ 1 + 1a = 1 + na, n = 1 is true. Let n ∈ N and suppose P (n) true. ie. (1 + a)n ≥ 1 + na true. (1 + a) n+1 = (1 + a)n(1 + a) ≥ (1 + na)(1 + a) = 1 + a + na + na2 = 1 + (n + 1)a + na2 ≥ 1 + (n + 1)a Therefore P (n) is true ∀n ∈ N by the principle of induction. 1.4.1 Corollary 1 Let c, q ∈ Q > 0 and n ∈ N, ϵ ∈ Q. Suppose qn > c. Then ∃ϵ st. (q − ϵ) n > c. Motivation: (q − ϵ) n = (q (1 − ϵ q ))n = qn (1 − ϵ q )n. We know if a = − ϵ q , we need a > −1 (for Bernoulli inequality to hold) so −ϵ q > −1 =⇒ 1 > ϵ q =⇒ q > ϵ. Then, qn (1 − ϵ q )n ≥ qn (1 + n ( −ϵ q )) = qn (1 − nϵ q ). In order for qn − nϵqn−1 > c ⇐⇒ qn − c > nϵqn−1, we choose: ϵ < qn − c nqn−1 Proof. Take ϵ = 1 2 min(q, qn−c nqn−1 , 1) then ϵ ∈ Q, ϵ > 0, and ϵ ≤ 1 2 · 1 < 1. Moreover, because −ϵ q ≥ −1 2 q q = − 1 2 > −1, (q − ϵ)n = ( q ( 1 − ϵ q ))n = qn (1 − ϵ q )n ≥ qn (1 − nϵ q ) = qn − nϵqn n−1 8 But ϵ ≤ 1 2 and qn−c 2nqn−1 < qn−c nqn−1 , so nqn−1ϵ < qn − c and qn − nqn−1ϵ > c. Hence, (q − ϵ)n ≥ qn − nϵnqn−1 > c as required. 1.4.2 Lemma 1: If a ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N then (1 + a) n ≤ 1 + 3na. Proof. Let P (n) be our lemma statement. P (1) : for n = 1, (1 + a)n = (1 + a) ≤ 1 + 3a = 1 + 3na is true. Suppose P (n) is true. If a ∈ [0, 1] and n ∈ N then (1 + a)n ≤ 1 + 3na. Thus, (1 + a) n+1 = (1 + a) n(1 + a) ≤ (1 + 3na)(1 + a) = 1 + a + 3na + 3na 2 = 1 + a(1 + 3n + 3na) ≤ 1 + a(3 · 3n) = 1 + 3 n+1a 1.4.3 Corollary 2 Let c, p ∈ Q > 0 and n ∈ N. Suppose pn < c then ∃ϵ ∈ Q > 0 such that (p + ϵ)n < c. Motivation: p n + 3nϵp n+1 < c 3 nϵp n−1 < c − pn ϵ < c − p n 3npn−1 Proof. Take ϵ = min(p, c−pn 2·3npn−1 ) Since 0 ≤ ϵ p ≤ 1 we can use Lemma 1 so that (p + ϵ) n = (p ( 1 + e p ))n = pn (1 + ϵ p )n ≤ pn (1 + 3n ϵ p ) = pn + 3nϵp n−1 < pn + 3n · c − pn 3npn−1 · pn−1 = c 1.5 Archmedian Property ∀x, y ∈ R > 0, ∃n ∈ N|nx > y. Proof. Let A = {nx : x ∈ R, n ∈ N}. Suppose the hypothesis is false, then A is bounded above. Let ∃a = sup A, then a − x < a and a − x < mx for some m ∈ N. But then a < mx − x = (m + 1)x \t [since a is an upper bound]. 9 1.6 Maximums and Minimums Deﬁnition: Let X ⊂ R, X ̸= ∅ and M ∈ R. Then M is a maximum for X iﬀ: 1. M ∈ X 2. ∀x ∈ X, x ≤ M Similarly for minimums. Notation: If M ∈ R is a maximum for X, we write M = max X. Similarly for min X. 1.6.1 Lemma 2: X has at most 1 maximum. Proof. Let M1, M2 be maximums for X. Since M1, M2 are maximum, M1, M2 ∈ X. Note that M1 ≤ M2 and M2 ≤ M1. Therefore M1 = M2 via the antisym- metric property and hence the maximum is unique. 1.6.2 In [2, 4) no max exists. Proof. Suppose M is max. But X = M +4 2 ∈ [2, 4) and M < X. \t 1.7 Upper and Lower Bounds Deﬁnition: Let X ⊂ R and M ∈ R. Then M is an upper bound for X if: ∀x ∈ X, x ≤ M . If X has an upper bound, it is bounded above. Similarly for lower bounds. A set is bounded if it is bounded above and below. Consider [2, 4) then X = {M ∈ R : M ≥ 4} is the set of upper bounds for [2, 4). 1.8 Supremum Deﬁnition: Let X ⊂ R and s ∈ R. Then s is called a supremum for X if: 1. s is an upper bound for X. 2. s ≤ M , ∀M ∈ {y : y ≥ x, ∀x ∈ X}. ie. The supremum is the least upper bound. Similarly an inﬁmum is the greatest lower bound. 1.8.1 Lemma 3: If a supremum exists, it is unique. Proof. Let s1, s2 ∈ R and suppose both are supremum. Then s1, s2 are upper bounds. s1 ≤ s2 and s2 ≤ s1 hence s1 = s2. eg. If X = [2, 4] =⇒ sup X = 4, inf X = 2. If X = (2, 4) =⇒ sup X = 4, inf X = 2. If X = ∅ then all x ∈ R are upper and lower bounds (vacuously true). Hence X does not have a supremum or inﬁnum. 10 1.8.2 Example inf N = 1. But, N has no upper bound. Proof. Suppose M ∈ R and M is an upper bound for N. Then 1 ≤ M because 1 ∈ N therefore M > 0 and 1 M > 0. Using the archimedian property we know ∃n ∈ N st. n · 1 M > 1. So n > M and M is not an upper bound. \t . Therefore N is not bounded above. 1.8.3 Lemma 4 Let X ⊂ R and s ∈ R. Then the following are equivalent. 1. s = sup X 2. (a) s is an upper bound for X. (b) ∀ϵ > 0, ∃x ∈ X st. s − ϵ < x. Proof. The “1 =⇒ 2” case: Suppose 1. is true. 2(a) is obviously true. Let ϵ > 0 so that s − ϵ < s. Then s − ϵ is not an upper bound for X. Hence ∃x ∈ X st. x > s − ϵ. The “2 =⇒ 1” case: Suppose 2 is true. Then 2(a) is consistent with 1. Let M ∈ R and suppose M is an upper bound for X. Suppose M < s. Set ϵ = s − M > 0 then M = s − ϵ and by 2(b) there is an x ∈ X st s − ϵ < x. Thus M < x and M is not an upper bound for X. \t Therefore M ≥ s. 1.9 Theorem 1 Every non empty X ⊂ R that’s bounded above has a supremum. Taken as an axiom in this course. With this theorem, ﬁeld properties, orderedness, archimedian property, we have a unique system called the real number system. 1.9.1 Lemma 5: Let x, y ∈ Q > 0 then x < y ⇐⇒ x2 < y2. Proof. “⇒” case: If x < y then x2 = x · x < x · y < y · y = y2 “⇐” case: We know if x < y then x2 < y2 and if y < x then y2 < x 2 and if x = y then x2 = y2. Suppose x2 < y2. If x > y then x2 > y2 \t . If x = y then x2 = y2 \t . Therefore x < y. 1.9.2 Example: When no supremum exists in Q In Q consider X = {x ∈ Q : 0 < x < √5} = {x ∈ Q : x > 0 and x2 < 5}. Then X ̸= ∅ and is bounded above by 3. X has no supremum in Q since √5 doesn’t exist in Q (proved earlier). Claim: X is bounded above and has no supremum in Q. Proof. ∀x ∈ X, x2 < 5 < 3 2 = 9 =⇒ X bounded above and x < 3 (by lemma 5). Suppose X has a supremum in Q. Let q = sup X. We have to consider q2 11 when q2 > 5, q2 < 5, q2 = 5. Already, q2 = 5 is impossible (proved earlier). Suppose q2 < 5 We know if c, q ∈ Q > 0, n ∈ N and qn < c then ∃ϵ ∈ Q > 0, st. (q + ϵ)n < c so that (q + ϵ) n < 5. This implies q + ϵ ∈ X. But q is an upper bound for X, so q ≥ q + ϵ \t . Suppose q2 > 5 We know if c, q ∈ Q > 0, n ∈ N, and qn > c then ∃ϵ ∈ Q > 0 and 0 < ϵ < 1 st. (q − ϵ) n > c. Then q2 > 5 > 1 and q > 1 by lemma 5. We have ϵ ∈ Q st. 0 < ϵ < 1 and (q − ϵ) 2 > 5 then q − ϵ > 1 − 1 > 0. ∀x ∈ X, one has (q − ϵ)2 > 5 > x 2 so q − ϵ > x by lemma so q − ϵ is an upper bound for X. But q = sup X ≤ q − ϵ. \t . 1.10 Modulus Deﬁnition: If x ∈ R deﬁne |x| = {x if x ≥ 0, −x if x < 0. Properties: • |x| ≥ 0 • |x| = 0 ⇐⇒ x = 0 • −|x| ≤ x ≤ |x| • |xy| = |x||y| 1.11 Triangle Inequality |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| ∀x, y ∈ R Proof. −|x| ≤ x ≤ |x| and −|y| ≤ y ≤ |y| =⇒ −(|x| + |y|) ≤ −|x| + y ≤ x + y ≤ |x| + y ≤ |x| + |y| therefore |x + y| ≤ |x| + |y| Note |x + y| is the distance(metric) from x to y. Also: |x − z| = |(x − y) + (y − z)| ≤ |x − y| + |y − z| 1.12 Reverse Triangle Inequality |x − y| ≥ ||x| − |y||∀x, y ∈ R Proof. |x| = |(x − y) + y| ≤ |x − y| + |y| =⇒ |x| − |y| ≤ |x − y| Similarly, |y| − |x| ≤ |y − x| = | − (x − y)| = |x − y| So ||x| − |y|| = {|x| − |y| ≤ |x − y| if |x| − |y| ≥ 0 −(|x| − |y|) ≤ |x − y| if |x| − |y| < 0 Therefore ||x| − |y|| ≤ |x − y| 12 1.13 Neighbourhoods Deﬁnition: Let a ∈ R and U ⊂ R. U is called a neighbourhood of a if ∃ϵ > 0 st. (a − ϵ, a + ϵ) ⊂ U . ie. U is a neighbourhood for a ⇐⇒ ∃ϵ > 0 st. ∀x ∈ R with |x − a| < ϵ one has x ∈ U . Sometimes we denote this by Bϵ(a). 2 Sequences Deﬁnition: A sequence of real numbers is a function X : N → R. Write xn = x(n), n ∈ N. Other notation includes x = (x1, x2, . . .), (xn), (xn)n∈N, {xn} ∞ n=1, xn. 2.1 Convergence Deﬁnition: Let x1, x2, . . . ∈ R and L ∈ R. The sequence x1, x2, . . . converges to L iﬀ: ∀ϵ > 0, ∃N ∈ R, st. ∀n ∈ N∀ n ≥ N : |xn − L| < ϵ ⇐⇒ L − ϵ < xn < L + ϵ 2.1.1 Example xn = 1 n converges to 0. Proof. xn = 1 n . Let ϵ > 0. Take N = 2 ϵ . Then ∀n ∈ N with n ≥ N , |xn − 0| = | 1 n − 0| = 1 n ≤ 1 N = ϵ 2 < ϵ 2.1.2 Let xn = √n2 + 6 − n. Claim {xn} → 0 as n → ∞ Let ϵ > 0. Take N = 7 ϵ . Then ∀n ∈ N with n ≥ N one has that: |xn − 0| = |√ n2 + 6 − n| = √ n2 + 6 − n = √n2 + 6 − √n2 = (√ n2 + 6 − √n2) · ( √n2 + 6 + √n2 √n2 + 6 + √n2 ) = n 2 + 6 − n2 √n2 + 6 + √n2 = 6 √n2 + 6 + √n2 ≤ 6 √n2 = 6 n ≤ 6 N = 6 7 ϵ < ϵ Thus the sequence converges to 0. 2.1.3 Lemma 6 Let x1, x2, . . . and y1, y2, . . . be 2 sequences and let l, m ∈ R such that xn → l and yn → m for n → ∞. Suppose ∀n ∈ N that xn ≤ yn then l ≤ m. Proof. Suppose to the contrary that l > m. Take ϵ = l−m 2 . Since the sequence x1, x2, . . . converges to l then ∃N1 st. ∀n ∈ N with n ≥ N1 we have that l − ϵ < xn < l + ϵ. Since {yn} converges to m, ∃N2 st. m − ϵ < yn < m + ϵ. So, ∃n ∈ N with n ≥ max(N1, N2) st. both l − ϵ < xn < l + ϵ and m − ϵ < yn < m + ϵ hold. Thus we have that yn < m + ϵ = l − ϵ < xn. A contradiction since xn ≤ yn \t . Therefore l ≤ m. 13 2.1.4 Corollary Let a1, a2, . . . be a sequence and l, m ∈ R. Suppose that a1, a2, . . . converges to l and also to m. Then l = m. Proof. Take xn = an and yn = an. Then ∀n : xn ≤ yn. By lemma: l ≤ m and similarly m ≤ l which implies l = m. 2.1.5 Limits The sequence x1, x2, . . . is called convergent if there is an l ∈ R st. x1, x2, . . . converges to l. If the sequence is not convergent then it is divergent. CAVEAT : Don’t assume that a sequence is convergent if you have to show that: (limn→∞ xn = l). Thus limn→∞ xn = l means that x1, x2, . . . converges to l. 2.1.6 Lemma 6 rewritten If limn→∞ xn = l and limn→∞ yn = m and xn ≤ yn ∀n ∈ N then l ≤ m. 2.1.7 If limn→∞ xn = l and limn→∞ yn = m and xn < yn ∀n ∈ N is l < m ? NO. Counterexample: Take xn = 0 ∀n ∈ N and yn = 1 n ∀n ∈ N. NB: If 1 n−37 = xn then limn→∞ 1 n−37 = 0. We ignore ﬁrst 37 terms. It also suﬃces to say that xn ≤ yn for all large n. ie. ∃M st ∀n ∈ N, n ≥ M one has that xn ≤ yn. 2.2 Subsequences Deﬁnition: A subsequence of a sequence (xn) ∞ n=1 is a sequence of the form (xnk ) ∞ n=1 such that 1 ≤ n1 < n2 < n3 < . . .. 2.2.1 Lemma 7: A sequence (xn) converges to a limit l ⇐⇒ every subsequence converges to the same limit l. Proof. =⇒ : Suppose (xn) converges to l and (xnk ) is a subsequence. Since xn → l, ∀ϵ > 0, ∃N : |xn − l| < ϵ, ∀n > N . But nk ≥ k so |xnk − l| < ϵ, ∀k > N hence xnk → l as k → ∞. ⇐= : Conversely if all subsequences converge to l, in particular, (xn) con- verges to l. 2.2.2 Example ((−1)n) = (−1, 1, −1, 1, . . .) does not converge. ie it diverges. We can take subsequences (−1, −1, −1, . . .) and (1, 1, 1, . . .) which converge to −1 and 1 re- spectively. Because of uniqueness of limits in R and lemma 7, we know it is divergent. 14 2.3 Boundedness (xn) is bounded above by M if ∃M : xn ≤ M , ∀n ∈ N. Similarly, bounded below if ∃M > 0: −M ≤ xn, ∀n ∈ N. If it is bounded above and below ie. ∃M > 0: |xn| ≤ M , ∀n ∈ N then it is bounded. eg. ((−1)n) is bounded below by −1 and above by 1 so is bounded. But n = (1, 2, 3, . . .) is bounded below by 1 but not bounded above. 2.3.1 Lemma 8: A convergent subsequence is bounded. Proof. Suppose limn→∞ = l. ie. ∀ϵ > 0, ∃N : |xn − l| < ϵ, ∀n > N ⇐⇒ l − ϵ < xn < l+ϵ. So xn ≤ max(x1, . . . , xN , l+ϵ), ∀n and x ≥ min(x1, . . . , xN , l−ϵ). Note that boundedness does NOT imply convergence. 2.4 Theorem 2 Let (an), (bn) be convergent sequences. Then: (i) lim n→∞(an + bn) = lim n→∞ an + lim n→∞ bn (ii) lim n→∞(can) = c lim n→∞ an, c ∈ R (iii) lim n→∞(anbn) = ( lim n→∞ an) · ( lim n→∞ bn) (iv) If b = lim n→∞ bn ̸= 0, then (∃N : bn ̸= 0, ∀n > N ) and lim n→∞ ( an bn ) = lim an lim bn (v) lim n→∞ |an| = \f \f \f lim n→∞ an\f \f \f Proof. : Let a := limn→∞ an and b := limn→∞ bn. (i) We want to make |(an + bn) − (a + b)| small by making |xn − a|, |xn − b| small. |(an + bn) − (a + b)| ≤ |an − a| + |bn − b| Since an → a, bn → b, ∃N1, N2 : ∀n > N1, |an − a| < ϵ 2 , and ∀n > N2, |bn − a| < ϵ 2 : |(an + bn) − (a + b)| ≤ |an − a| + |bn − b| < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ, ∀n > max(N1, N2) (ii), (iii) Note if we take bn = c in (iii) then we have (ii). Since bn → b, b is bounded so that |bn| ≤ M , ∀n ∈ N. |anbn−ab| = |anbn−abn+abn−ab| since an → a, ∃N1 : |an−a| < 1 2 ϵ M , ∀n > N1 . Suppose a ̸= 0, then since bn → b then ∃N2 : |bn − b| < 1 2 ϵ |a| , ∀n > N2 so that: |a||bn − b| < 1 2 ϵ, ∀n > N2 holds for all a 15 Hence for all n > max(N1, N2): |anbn − ab| ≤ |bn||an − a| + |a||bn − b| < M · 1 2 ϵ M + |a| 1 2|a| ϵ = ϵ (iv) In view of (iii) we need only to show that 1 bn → 1 b as n → ∞. Since bn → b and |b| > 0, then ∃N : |b − bn| ≤ |b| 2 , ∀n > N . So by triangle inequality: |b| − |bn| ≤ |b − bn| ≤ |b| 2 , ∀n > N 0 < |b| 2 ≤ |bn| ⇐⇒ 1 |bn| ≤ 2 |b| , ∀n > N Since bn → b, ∃N1 > N : |b − bn| < ϵ|b| 2 2 , ∀n > N1. Hence: \f \f \f \f 1 bn − 1 b \f \f \f \f = |b − bn| · 1 |bn| · 1 |b| ≤ ϵ|b2| 2 · 2 |b| · 1 |b| = ϵ (v) Since an → a then ∃N : |an − a| < ϵ, ∀n > N . By triangle inequality we have that: ||an| − |a|| ≤ |an − a| < ϵ, ∀n > N 2.4.1 Example: Find limn→∞ an an = 3n2 + 2n + 1 2n2 + 1 + 3 n = 3 + 2 n + 1 n2 2 + 1 n2 + 3 n Using all the rules: lim n→∞ an = 3 + 2 limn→∞ 1 n + (limn→∞ 1 n )2 2 + limn→∞( 1 n )2 + 3 lim n→∞ 1 n = 3 2 2.5 Sandwich / Squeeze Theorem Let (an), (bn), (cn) be sequences with an ≤ bn ≤ cn ∀n ∈ N and lim an = lim cn = l. Then (bn) converges to l. Proof. Let ϵ > 0. Since an → l, cn → l then ∃N1, N2 : l − ϵ < an < l + ϵ, n > N1 and l − ϵ < cn < l + ϵ, n > N2. For n > max(N1, N2) we have l −ϵ ≤ an ≤ bn ≤ cn ≤ l +ϵ hence |bn −l| < ϵ. 2.5.1 Example: Let bn = (−1)n sin(n2) n Then −1 n ≤ bn ≤ 1 n . So by sandwich theorem, lim bn exists and is 0, as lim 1 n = 0. 2.5.2 Example: lim |xn| = 0 then lim xn = 0 Because −|xn| ≤ xn ≤ |xn| and lim |xn| = lim(−|xn|) = 0, then lim xn = 0. 16 2.5.3 Example: Calculate lim n√n Recall Bernoulli inequality. Let a = 1√n . Then: ( 1 + 1 √n )n ≥ √n ⇐⇒ n ≤ (1 + 1 √n )2n ⇐⇒ n√n ≤ (1 + 1 √n )2 ⇐⇒ 1 ≤ n√n ≤ (1 + 1 √n )2 Assuming lim 1√n = 0, lim(1 + 1√n )2 = (1 + 0)2 = 1: lim n→∞ n√n = 1 2.5.4 Example: lim n√a, a > 0 Suppose a ≥ 1: √1 ≤ n√a ≤ n√n ie. lim n√a = 1 for a ≥ 1. If a < 1, lim n√a = lim 1 n√ 1 a = 1 and 1 a > 1 by the quotient rule of limits. 2.6 Deﬁnition: Increasing or Decreasing Sequences We say (xn) is increasing if xn+1 ≥ xn and decreasing if xn+1 ≤ xn for all n ∈ N. We say (xn) is monotone if it is increasing or decreasing. 2.7 Monotone Convergence Theorem Suppose (xn) is increasing and bounded above, then lim xn = sup xn = sup{xn : n ∈ N}. Proof. Let ϵ > 0, l = sup xn. Then l − ϵ is not an upper bound of {xn} ∞ n=1. ie. ∃N : xN > l − ϵ. Since (xn) is increasing, xn ≥ xN , ∀n > N . ie. l − ϵ < xN ≤ xn ≤ l < l + ϵ Since l = sup xn then |xn − l| < ϵ, ∀n ≥ N . 2.7.1 Example: If (xn) is decreasing and bounded below then (xn) converges to the inﬁmum. ie. lim xn = inf{xn} Let (yn) : yn = −xn. Since yn is increasing and bounded above by -(lower bound for xn) then: lim n→∞ yn = sup{yn} ⇐⇒ lim n→∞(−xn) = sup{−xn} ⇐⇒ − lim n→∞ xn = − inf{xn} ⇐⇒ lim n→∞ xn = inf{xn} 17 2.7.2 Example: Calculate limit of (an) given by a1 = 1, an+1 =√an + 1, n ≥ 1. Claim: (an) is bounded above by 2, increasing, and hence has a limit. increasing: Using Induction. n = 1, a2, = √a1 + 1 = √1 + 1 = √2, 1 = a1 < a2 = √2. Now suppose that an−1 ≤ an then an = √1 + an−1 ≤ √1 + an = an+1 thus it’s increasing. bounded above by 2 : Use induction again. a1 = 1 ≤ 2. Suppose an−1 ≤ 2. Then an = √1 + an−1 ≤ √1 + 2 = √3 < √4 = 2. Hence an ≤ 2, ∀n ∈ N by induction. Therefore an is increasing, bounded above by 2 and therefore there is a limit lim an = a by the monotone convergence theorem. Now an+1 = √1 + an =⇒ (an+1)2 = 1 + an, ∀n ≥ 1, and (an+1)2 → a 2, 1 + an → 1 + a by the sum and product rules of limits. So then, a 2 = 1 + a ⇐⇒ a 2 − a − 1 = 0 ⇐⇒ a = 1 ± √5 Now an ≥ 1, ∀n so lim an = a ≥ 1 and therefore: a = lim an = 1 + √5 2 2.7.3 Example: Find a sequence of rationals converging to √a, a > 0, a ∈ Q x = √a ⇐⇒ x 2 = a ⇐⇒ x2 − a = 0 Visualise a quadratic with the roots being √a, −√a. Let x1 > 0 and choose xn+1 using Newton’s iterative method(assume for time being we’ve done diﬀer- entiation). Then the slope of the tangent line is 2xn. Then the tangent line equation can be constructed: y − (x2 n − a) xn+1 − xn = 2xn We know it intersects the x-axis when y = 0 so, −(x2 n − a) = 2xn(xn+1 − xn) −x2 n + a = 2xnxn+1 − 2x2 n x 2 n − 2xnxn+1 + a = 0 Solving for xn+1: xn+1 = a + x2 n 2xn = 1 2 ( a xn + xn ) and xn > 0, ∀n ∈ N. 18 Claim: xn is decreasing for n ≥ 2. xn+1 − xn = 1 2 ( a xn + xn ) − xn = − 1 2 xn + 1 2 a xn = − 1 2 ( xn − a xn ) < 0(since xn, a > 0) ie. xn+1 < xn, ∀n ≥ 1 ⇐⇒ (xn) decreasing. xn − a xn is increasing because if we consider the quadratic, we get complex roots if the discriminant less than 0, and we get repeated roots if the discriminant is 0. But since we have distinct roots here, we have that the discriminant xn − a xn is greater than 0. Claim: x2 n − a > 0, ∀n ≥ 2 Now, x2 n − 2xnxn+1 + a = 0 is a quadratic with root xn > 0 (and real). Since this has real coeﬃcients, its distinct roots are real if: discriminant = (−2xn+1) 2 − 4a > 0 =⇒ x2 n+1 − a > 0 =⇒ decreasing with xn ≥ √a. Thus by the monotone convergence theorem, it has a limit x and: x2 n−2xnxn+1+a = 0 → x2−2x2+a = 0 =⇒ x2 = a =⇒ x = ±√a =⇒ x = √a Since xn > 0 =⇒ lim xn ≥ 0 we infer x = √a. It can’t be both positive and negative, due to uniqueness of limits. 2.8 Cauchy Sequences Deﬁnition: A sequence x1, x2, . . . is called a Cauchy sequence if: ∀ϵ > 0, ∃N ∈ R st. ∀n, m ∈ N and n, m ≥ N |xn − xm| < ϵ 2.8.1 Lemma 9: Every convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence Proof. Let x1, x2, . . . be a convergent sequence. Let ϵ > 0 and l = limn→∞ xn exists (since the sequence is convergent). Since ϵ 2 > 0, ∃N : ∀n ∈ N, n > N we have |xn − l| < ϵ 2 . Then ∀n, m ∈ N, with n, m ≥ N one has that |xn − l| < ϵ 2 and |xm − l| < ϵ 2 . So that: |xn − xm| = |(xn − l) − (xm − l)| ≤ |xn − l| + |xm − l| < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ A Cauchy sequence in R is not necessarily convergent in Q. For example: ∃(xn), xi ∈ Q, i ∈ N st limn→∞ xn = √5 (in R). Then (xn) is a Cauchy sequence in R and hence in Q. But the sequence is not convergent in Q since √5 /∈ Q. 19 2.8.2 Theorem 3: Every sequence in R has a monotone subsequence. Proof. Let x1, x2, . . . ∈ R. An element n ∈ N is called a lighted index if ∀k > n, xk ≤ xn. Case 1 : There are inﬁnite many lighted indices. Call these n1 < n2 < n3 < . . .. Let i ∈ N. Since n is a lighted index and ni+1 < ni, taking k = ni+1 and n = ni gives xni+1 ≤ xni . So xn1, xn2, . . . is a decreasing sequence. Case 2 : There are ﬁnite many lighted indices. There exists an N ∈ N st. ∀n ≥ N the index n is not lighted. ie. ∀n ≥ N , ∃k > n: xk > xn. Now choose n1 = N . Then ∃k ∈ N, k > n st. xk > xn1 . Choose n2 = k. Then ∃n3 > n2 st. xn3 > xn2 and so on. Then xn1, xn2, . . . is a strictly increasing subsequence. 2.8.3 Corollary: (Bolzano / Weierstraß) Theorem Every bounded sequence in R has a convergent subsequence. Proof. Let (xn) be a bounded sequence in R. By theorem 3, (xn) has a mono- tone subsequence xn1, xn2, . . .. Then (xni), i ∈ N is also bounded. Since every bounded monotone sequence is convergent, then our subsequence (xni) is con- vergent. 2.8.4 Lemma 10: Every Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence is convergent. Proof. Let (xn) be a Cauchy sequence and assume that xn1, xn2, . . . is a conver- gent subsequence. Let l = limk→∞ xnk exist. Let ϵ > 0 and since lim xnk = l implies ∃N : ∀k ≥ N1, |xnk − l| < ϵ 2 . Since (xn) is a Cauchy sequence ∃N2 ∈ N st. ∀n, m ≥ N2 one has |xn − xm| < ϵ 2 . Now set N = N2. Then ∀n ∈ N with n ≥ N one has with k = max(N1, N2) that nk ≥ k ≥ N2 and N ≥ N2 so that |xn − xnk | < ϵ 2 . Moreover, k ≥ N1 so |xnk − l| < ϵ 2 . Hence we have: |xn − l| = |xn − xnk + xnk − l| ≤ |xn − xnk | + |xnk − l| < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ 2.8.5 Lemma 11: Every Cauchy sequence is bounded. Proof. Let (xn) be our sequence. Let ϵ = 37. By our assumption, there exists an N ∈ N st. ∀n, m ∈ N with n, m ≥ N one has |xn − xm| < 37. Take m = N. Then ∀n ≥ N : |xn| = |(xn − xN ) + xN | ≤ |xn − xN | + |xN | < 37 + |xN | Thus ∀n ∈ N , |xn| ≤ max(|x1|, . . . , |xN |, 37 + |xN |). Hence (xn) is bounded. 20 2.8.6 Theorem 4 (Cauchy): Every Cauchy sequence is convergent in R Proof. Let (xn) be a Cauchy sequence. Then by lemma 11, every Cauchy se- quence is bounded and so (xn) is bounded. By the Bolzano-Weierstraß, every bounded sequence in R has a convergent subsequence, so the sequence (xn) has a convergent subsequence. By lemma 10 we have that every Cauchy sequence which has a convergent subsequence is convergent. Therefore every Cauchy sequence is convergent in R. 2.9 Deﬁnition: Contractive Sequences A sequence is called contractive if: ∃C < 1 : ∀n ∈ N, |xn+2 − xn+1| ≤ C|xn+1 − xn| 2.9.1 Lemma 12: Every contractive sequence is a Cauchy sequence. Proof. Suppose n, m ∈ N with n > m. Then: |xn − xm| = |(xn − xn−1) + (xn−1 − xn−2) + . . . + (xm+1 − xm)| ≤ |xn − xn−1| + |xn−1 − xn−2| + . . . + |xm+3 − xm+2| + |xm+2 − xm+1| + |xm+1 − xm| ≤ (C n−m−1 + . . . + C 2 + C + 1)|xm+1 − xm| This is because |xm+3 − xm+2| ≤ C|xm+2 − xm+1| ≤ C 2|xm+1 − xm| and similarly for the rest. Let k = n − m − 1 then, S = 1 + C + C 2 + . . . + C k CS = C + C 2 + . . . + C k + C k+1 (1 − C)S = 1 − C k+1 by subtracting second equation from the ﬁrst S = 1 − C k+1 1 − C So that, (C n−m−1 + . . . + C 2 + C + 1)|xm+1 − xm| = 1 − C n−m 1 − C |xm+1 − xm| ≤ 1 − C n−m 1 − C · C m−1|x2 − x1| where |xm+1 − xm| ≤ C|xm − xm−1| ≤ . . . ≤ C m−1|x2 − x1|. So that ∀n, m ∈ N with n > m: |xn − xm| ≤ 1 − C n−m 1 − C · C m−1|x2 − x1| ≤ 1 1 − C · C m−1|x2 − x1| since 0 < C < 1 Now as lim C n = 0 then there is an N st. ∀n ≥ N one has C n < (1−c)ϵ |x2−x1| . Note that we don’t care about the |x2 − x1| = 0 case since then |xn − xn−1| = 0 and it is obviously Cauchy. 21 So ∀n, m ∈ N with n, m ≥ N + 1 one has: Case 1 : If n > m then: |xn − xm| ≤ 1 1 − C · C m−1 · |x2 − x1| ≤ 1 1 − C · C N |x2 − x1| < 1 1 − C · (1 − C)ϵ |x2 − x1| · |x2 − x1| = ϵ Case 2 : If n < m then similarly, |xn − xm| < ϵ. Case 3 : If n = m then |xn − xm| = 0 < ϵ. 2.9.2 Corollary: Every contractive sequence is convergent Because every contractive sequence is Cauchy and every Cauchy sequence is convergent. 2.9.3 An application example in numerical analysis Consider the equation x3 − 7x + 2 = 0 for x ∈ (0, 1). We have that 7x = x3 + 2 and x = 1 7 (x3 + 2). Deﬁne x1 = 1 2 . Now, ∀n ∈ N, xn+1 = 1 7 (x3 n + 2). Claim: xn ∈ (0, 1), ∀n ∈ N. Use induction. n = 1: x1 = 1 2 ∈ (0, 1) is true. Suppose xn ∈ (0, 1). Then xn+1 = 1 7 (x3 n + 2) ≤ 1 7 (1 + 2) = 3 7 which is also in (0, 1). Therefore xn ∈ (0, 1) for all n ∈ N. Claim: Sequence is contractive. Take n ∈ N. Then |xn+2 − xn+1| = | 1 7 (x3 n+1 + 2) − 1 7 (x3 n + 2)| = 1 7 |x3 n+1 − x 3 n|. Recall that a 2 − b 2 = (a − b)(a + b); a 3 − b 3 = (a − b)(a 2 + ab + b 2); a 4 − b4 = (a − b)(a3 + a2b + ab 2 + b 3). So then: 1 7 |x3 n+1 − x3 n| = 1 7 |xn+1 − xn||x2 n+1 + xn+1xn + x 2 n| ≤ 1 7 |xn+1 − xn|(|x2 n+1| + |xn+1xn| + |x 2 n|) ≤ 3 7 |xn+1 − xn| So the sequence is contractive with C = 3 7 < 1. If lim xn = l then |xn−xm| ≤ 1 1−C · C m−1|x2 − x1|, ∀n > m. Now ﬁx m and take the limit. Then |l − xm| ≤ C m−1 1 − C |x2 − x1| , ∀m ∈ N Now all you have to do is calculate m using a computer. 22 2.10 R is dense Proof. Let x ∈ R. Let xn = 10 −n⌊10nx⌋ ∈ Q. We claim: lim n→∞ xn = x Now, 10 −n(10 nx − 1) ≤ 10−n⌊10 nx⌋ ≤ 10−n10 nx x − 10−n ≤ xn ≤ x 3 Series Partial Sums: Given a sequence x1, x2, . . . ∈ R. The sequence x1, x2, . . . is convergent if lim xn exists. Now we deﬁne: s1 = x1 s2 = x1 + x2 s3 = x1 + x2 + x3 sn = x1 + . . . + xn = n∑ k=1 xk nth partial sum Deﬁnition: The series ∑ xk is the sequence s1, s2, . . . of partial sums. The series ∑ xk is called convergent if lim sn exists. Otherwise it’s called divergent. If the series ∑ xk is convergent then lim sn is called the sum. Notation: ∞∑ k=1 xk := lim n→∞ sn ∈ R In other literature, some people use that same notation for the series, so it can be a little confusing where each iteration gives you another partial sum in the sequence. Note that xk is called the kth term in the series ∑ xk. Sometimes ∑∞ k=5 xk is used to denote the limit of the sequence s5 + s6 + . . .. 3.1 Lemma 13 Let x1, x2, . . . and y1, y2, . . . be real sequences. Suppose the series ∑ xk and∑ yk are both convergent. Then ∑ (xk + yk) is convergent. Proof. Deﬁne s (x) n = n∑ k=1 xk , s (y) n = n∑ k=1 yk , s (x+y) n = n∑ k=1 (xk + yk) Then s (x+y) n = s (x) n + s (y) n using a result in linear algebra because we know real numbers are commutative. lim n→∞ s (x+y) n = lim n→∞(s (x) n + s (y) n ) = lim n→∞ s (x) n + lim n→∞ s (y) n 23 Therefore s (x+y) n is convergent and ∑ (xk + yk) is convergent. Hence ∞∑ k=1 (xk + yk) = ∞∑ k=1 xk + ∞∑ k=1 yk 3.1.1 Example: Geometric Series Fix r ∈ R and set xk = rk, ∀k ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . .}. Set: sn = n∑ k=0 xk = n∑ k=0 rk = 1 + r + r2 + . . . + rn = { 1−rn+1 1−r if r ̸= 1 n + 1 if r = 1 Recall that lim( 1 1+a ) n = lim 1 (1+a)n = 0 or if r ∈ (0, 1) with a = 1 r − 1 > 0 then lim rn = 0. Note if 0 < r < 1 then lim rn+1 = 0. If r = 0 then lim rn+1 = 0. If −1 < r < 0 then lim |rn+1| = lim |r| n+1 = 0. Hence lim rn+1 = 0. Now, if r = 1 then lim rn+1 = 1. If r > 1 then the sequence rn+1 is divergent. We can see that using the Bernoulli inequality if we pick rn+1 ≥ 1 + (n + 1)(r − 1) So that it is increasing for all n ∈ N and r > 1. If r < −1 then it is also divergent as |rn+1| is divergent. If r = 1, then rn+1 = (−1)n+1 which we also know is divergent. Therefore, the sequence (sn) is { convergent if −1 < r < 1 divergent if r ≥ 1, r ≤ 1 So the series ∑ rk is convergent ⇐⇒ |r| < 1 ⇐⇒ −1 < r < 1. Moreover, ∞∑ k=0 rk = 1 1 − r if |r| < 1 3.1.2 Example: Telescopic Series Let xk = 1 k(k+1) , k ∈ N. Note that 1 k(k+1) = 1 k − 1 k+1 , ∀k ∈ N. Then one has that ∀n ∈ N, sn = x1 + x2 + . . . + xn−1 + xn = ( 1 1 − 1 2 ) + ( 1 2 − 1 3 ) + . . . + ( 1 n − 1 n + 1 ) = 1 − 1 n + 1 So then lim sn = lim(1 − 1 n+1 ) = 1 exists. Thus the series ∑ 1 k(k+1) is con- vergent and ∑ 1 k(k+1) = 1. The motivation for the week is to see if ∑ 1 n2 converges. 24 3.2 Lemma 14: N th Term Test If the series ∞∑ k=1 xk is convergent then lim n→∞ xn = 0 Proof. Suppose the series ∑ xk is convergent, s = lim sn ∈ R exists. Note that, sn − sn−1 = (x1 + . . . + xn) − (x1 + . . . + xn−1) = xn Then lim n→∞ xn = lim n→∞(sn − sn−1) = ( lim n→∞ sn) − ( lim n→∞ sn−1) = s − s = 0 3.2.1 Corollary If we do not have lim xn = 0 then ∑ xk is divergent. This is just the con- trapositive statement of the lemma. Note however this does not mean that if lim xn = 0 then the series is convergent. A counter example is the harmonic series ∑ 1 n which diverges. NB:If yn = xn+5 then y1 + . . . + yn = x6 + . . . + xn+5 = x1 + . . . + xn − 5∑ k=1 xk ∞∑ k=1 yk = ∞∑ k=1 xk − 5∑ k=1 xk 3.3 Theorem 5 Suppose x1, x2, . . . are in [0, ∞). Then the series ∑ xk is convergent ⇐⇒ the sequence s1, s2, . . . of partial sums is bounded above. Proof. Since x1, x2, . . . ≥ 0 the sequence s1, s2, . . . is increasing. So ∑ xk is convergent if s1, s2, . . . is convergent. If this monotone sequence is bounded above, then by the monotone convergence theorem, it is convergent. 3.3.1 Interlude: Consider ∑ 1 n s1 = 1 s2 = 1 + 1 2 = 3 2 s3 = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 ≥ 3 2 + 1 2 = 4 2 s8 = 1 + . . . + 1 4 + 1 5 + 1 6 + 1 7 + 1 8 ≥ 4 2 + 1 2 = 5 2 s16 = 5 2 + 1 2 = 6 2 s2n = n + 2 2 Where sn is the sequence of partial sums, so sn is not bounded above. In particular, it is a divergent (Theorem 5). Note that lim 1 k = 0 but ∑ 1 k is divergent. Also that lim( 1 2 ) k = 0 and ∑ ( 1 2 )k is convergent. 25 3.4 Theorem 6: Comparison Test Suppose that (xn) and (yn) are sequences. Suppose 0 ≤ xn ≤ yn ∀n ∈ N. I : Suppose ∑ yn is convergent. Then the series ∑ xk is convergent. Proof. Since ∑ yk is convergent, the sequence ∑n k=1 yk is bounded above, so ∃M ∈ R: ∀n ∈ N ∑n k=1 yk ≤ M . But then ∀n ∈ N: ∑n k=1 xk ≤ ∑n k=1 yk ≤ M . hence ∑n k=1 xk is also bounded above. Thus by Theorem 5, ∑ xk is convergent. II : Suppose ∑ xk is divergent. Then ∑ k yk is divergent. This is just the contrapositive of the above statement. 3.4.1 Example: ∑ 1 k2 Recall that ∑ 1 k(k+1) is convergent. 1 n(n + 1) ≥ 1 n(n + n) = 1 n · 2n = 1 2 · 1 n2 So that 0 ≤ 1 2 · 1 n2 ≤ 1 n(n+1) . Then by the comparison test, the series ∑ ( 1 2 · 1 k2 ) is convergent. So that ∑ 1 k2 is convergent (using lemma 15 below). 3.4.2 Lemma 15: ∑ xk is convergent ⇐⇒ ∑ cxk is convergent for some constant c ̸= 0 Proof. Let s 1 n = ∑n k=1 xk and s 2 n = ∑n k=1 cxk for some c ∈ R. Note that: s 2 n = cx1 + cx2 + . . . + cxn = c(x1 + . . . + xn) = cs 1 n “⇒”: If lim s 1 n = S1 then lim s 2 n = lim(cs 1 n) = c lim(s 1 n) = c ∗ S1 and hence convergent. “⇐”: If lim s 2 n = lim(cs 1 n) = c lim(s 1 n) = S2 then in particular, lim(s 1 n) is also convergent and lim s 1 n = S2 c . 3.5 Theorem 7 Suppose (xn) : xn > 0 and (yn) : yn ≥ 0, ∀n ∈ N. Suppose M ∈ [0, ∞) and ∀n ∈ N : yn xn ≤ M . If the series ∑ xk is convergent, then the series ∑ yk is convergent. Proof. ∀n ∈ N one has 0 ≤ yn ≤ M xn. The series ∑ xk is convergent hence also the series ∑ M xk is convergent. So by comparison, ∑ yk is also convergent. 3.5.1 Corollary 1: Limit Comparison Test Suppose xn > 0 and yn > 0 ∀n ∈ N. Suppose also that lim yn xn exists. If the series ∑ xk is convergent, then the series ∑ yk is convergent. Proof. Since lim yn xn exists, we know it is bounded. So in particular, ∃M : ∀n ∈ N yn xn ≤ M . Now apply Theorem 7. 26 3.5.2 Corollary 2: Also Limit Comparison Test Suppose xn > 0 and yn > 0 ∀n ∈ N. Suppose L := lim yn xn exists. I : If L > 0 then the series ∑ xk is convergent ⇐⇒ ∑ yk convergent. Proof. “⇒”: Use Corollary 1. “⇐”: lim xn yn = 1 L exists. So use Corollary 1. II : If L = 0 then if xn is convergent, =⇒ ∑ yn convergent. Proof. Use Corollary 1. 3.5.3 Example: ∑ n+5 n3+2n+1 , xn = n+5 n3+2n+1 Set yn = 1 n2 then xn > 0 and yn > 0 ∀n ∈ N. Moreover, lim n→∞ yn xn = lim n→∞ ( 1 n2 · n3 + 2n + 1 n + 5 ) = 1 + 2 n2 + 1 n3 1 + 5 n = 1 > 0 But ∑ 1 k2 = ∑ yk is convergent. Hence by the comparison test the series ∑ xk is also convergent. 3.6 Deﬁnition: Absolute Convergence A series ∑ xk is called absolutely convergent if the series ∑ |xk| is convergent. 3.7 Theorem 8: Every absolutely convergent series is con- vergent. Proof. Let ∑ xk be an absolutely convergent series. Then the series ∑ |xk| is convergent. Now, deﬁne yk := |xk| and zk := |xk| − xk. Then xk = yk − zk ∀k ∈ N. obviously the series ∑ yk is convergent. Note however that: 0 ≤ zk = |xk| − xk ≤ |xk| + |xk| = 2|xk| Thus the series ∑ 2|xk| is convergent, and by comparison the series ∑ zk is convergent. Therefore ∑ xk = ∑ (yk − zk) is also convergent. 3.8 Ratio Test 1 Suppose x1, x2, . . . ∈ R, xn ̸= 0 ∀n ∈ N. 1a: If ∃r < 1 (ie. ﬁxed r) st. ∀n ∈ N \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f ≤ r. Then the series ∑ xk is absolutely convergent. Note that only the tail is important as per usual. ie. for all large n. Proof. ∀n ∈ N one has |xn+1| ≤ r|xn| so by induction, ∀n ∈ N one has 0 ≤ |xn| ≤ rn−1|x1| < 1 therefore ∑ |x1| r rn is convergent. By comparison, the series ∑ |xk| is also convergent. So the series ∑ xk is absolutely convergent and hence convergent. 1b: Suppose ∀n ∈ N : \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f ≥ 1. Then the series is divergent. Proof. ∀n ∈ N one has that |xn+1| ≥ |xn| so by induction |xn| ≥ |x1| ∀n ∈ N. Since |x1| > 0 one does not have lim xn = 0. So the series ∑ xk is divergent by the n-th term test. 27 3.9 Ratio Test 2 Suppose x1, x2, . . . ∈ R, xn ̸= 0 ∀n ∈ N. Suppose ρ := lim \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f exists. Case 1 If ρ < 1 then the series ∑ xk is absolutely convergent. Case 2 If ρ > 1 then the series is divergent. Case 3 If ρ = 1 then it is inconclusive. Proof. If ρ < 1, set r = 1+ρ 2 so that ρ < r < 1. Choose ϵ = r − ρ > 0 then there is an N ∈ N : ∀n ≥ N ρ − ϵ < \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f < ρ + ϵ. In particular, \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f < ρ + ϵ = r ∀n ≥ N . Then using 1a. the series is absolutely convergent. If ρ > 1 then similarly, \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f ≥ 1 ∀large n so that the series ∑ xk is divergent by 1b. 3.9.1 Example: For ρ = 1 ∑ 1 nρ with ρ ∈ N is ﬁxed. xn = 1 nρ . lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f xn+1 xn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ nρ (n + 1)ρ = lim n→∞ ( n n + 1 )ρ = 1 ρ = 1 NB: If ρ = 1 then the series is divergent and if ρ > 1 the series is conver- gent(integral test). 3.9.2 Example 2 Let xn = n n−1 Then | xn+1 xn | = n+1 n n n−1 = n+1 n · n−1 n = n 2−1 n2 < 1 ∀n ∈ N. However, ∑ xn is divergent because lim xn = 1 ̸= 0 (n-th term test). 4 Power Series Deﬁnition: Let the coeﬃcients of the power series c ∈ R and c0, c1, c2, . . . ∈ R be ﬁxed. Then the series ∑∞ k=0 ck(x − c) k where x ∈ R is called a power series about c. Note that we only consider terms for k ≥ 0 so no negative ones. 4.1 Problem Given a power series, determine for which x ∈ R this series converges. Clearly it is the case for x = c. However for the x = c case, we have interesting issues to deal with. First k cannot be negative or we will have division by zero. Secondly, remember the case where 0 0 = 1. We may assume c = 0 otherwise translate and use y = x − c. 4.2 Theorem 9 Let ∑∞ k=0 ckxk be a power series. Let x0 ∈ R. If ∑ ck · xk 0 is convergent, then ∀y ∈ R with |y| < |x0| then the series ∑ ck · yk is also convergent. 28 Proof. We may assume that |x0| > 0. We know that the series ∑ ckxk 0 is convergent. Therefore lim cnxn 0 = 0 so the sequence (cnxn 0 ) is bounded. That means ∃M ∈ R : ∀n ∈ N |cnxn 0 | ≤ M . Then ∀n ∈ N: |ckyk| = |ckxk 0| ( |y| |x0| )k ≤ M ( |y| |x0| )k The geometric series ∑ M ( |y| |x0| )k is convergent. Then, by comparison, the series ∑ |ckyk| is also convergent so therefore the series ∑ ckyk is absolutely convergent and hence convergent. 4.2.1 Corollary 1 If ∑ ckxk 0 is divergent, then ∑ ckyk is divergent for all y ∈ R with |y| > |x0|. This is just the contrapositive. 4.2.2 Corollary 2 Let ∑∞ k=0 ck(x − c) k be a power series. Then there is a unique R called the convergence radius, 0 ≤ R ≤ ∞ st. ∀x ∈ R : |x − c| < R the series ∑ ckxk is convergent, and that if |x − c| > R then it is divergent. It is called the convergence radius because it looks like a circle in C or R2. Proof. We may assume c = 0. If ∑ ckxk is convergent, for all x ∈ R then set R = ∞. Deﬁne otherwise R = sup{|x| : x ∈ R and ∑ ckxk is convergent }. If it is convergent only at x = 0 then set R = 0. Remark : If x = R or x = −R then we are unsure if it converges or diverges. 4.2.3 Example : ∞∑ k=0 xk is convergent ⇐⇒ |x| < 1. If R = 1 then it is divergent at both R and −R ∞∑ k=1 xk k2 is convergent ⇐⇒ |x| ≤ 1. If R = 1, convergent at both R and −R. ∞∑ k=1 xk k is convergent ⇐⇒ −1 ≤ x < 1. If R = 1 Convergent at −R and divergent at R. 4.2.4 More Examples ∑∞ n=0 xn n! . Use the ratio test. If x ̸= 0 then lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f \f \f xn+1 (n+1)! xn n! \f \f \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f xn+1 xn · n! (n + 1)! \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ |x| 1 n + 1 = 0 < 1 This implies ∀x ∈ R the power series is convergent. So R = ∞. 29 4.2.5 Some common functions as power series • exp:R → R exp(x) = ∑∞ n=0 xn n! = ex. • sin(x) = ∑∞ n=0(−1)n x2n+1 (2n+1)! , R = ∞. • cos(x) = ∑∞ n=0(−1)n x 2n (2n)! , R = ∞. 4.2.6 Another example Find R, given ∑ n 3n xn. Let x ∈ R and x ̸= 0, then lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f \f (n+1)xn+1 3n+1 nxn 3n \f \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ \f \f \f \f n + 1 n · 3 n 3n+1 · xn+1 xn \f \f \f \f = lim n→∞ ( (1 + 1 n ) · 1 3 · |x| ) = |x| 3 Let ρ = |x| 3 here. Then the series is convergent if ρ < 1. ie. if |x| < 3. Similarly it is divergent if ρ > 1 ie .|x| > 3. After testing at R and −R we conclude it is divergent at both. 4.3 Theorem 10 Let x1, x2, . . . ≥ 0. 4.3.1 If the series ∑ xk is convergent then the set S is bounded above and sup S ≤ ∑∞ n=1 xn Proof. Let J ⊂ N, J ̸= ∅, J ﬁnite. Say, J = {i1, . . . , ik}. If N = max(i1, . . . , ik) then ∑ n∈J xn = xi1 + . . . + xik ≤ x1 + . . . + xN = sn ≤ ∞∑ n=1 xn So ∑∞ n=1 xn is an upper bound for S. Moreover, sup S ≤ ∑∞ n=1 xn. 4.3.2 If the set S is bounded above, then the series ∑ xn is conver- gent and ∑∞ n=1 xn ≤ sup S. Proof. For all n ∈ N one has sn = x1 + . . . + xn = ∑ k∈{1,...,n} xk ≤ sup S So the partial sums are bounded above. Hence the series ∑ xn is convergent and ∑∞ n=1 xn ≤ sup S. 4.3.3 If the series ∑ xn is convergent, then ∑∞ n=1 xn = sup S. 4.3.4 Corollary (Rearrangement Theorem) Let π : N → N be a bijection. Suppose x1, . . . ≥ 0 then ∑ xn is convergent ⇐⇒ the series ∑ xπ(n) := ∑ yn is convergent. Moreover, ∞∑ n=1 xn = ∞∑ n=1 xπ(n) 30 5 Limits of Functions Deﬁnition: An interval is a subset S of a totally ordered set T with the property that whenever x, y ∈ S and x < z < y then z ∈ S. 5.1 Open Sets Let A ⊂ R. The set A is open if ∀x0 ∈ A: ∃δ > 0, (x0 − δ, x0 + δ) ⊂ A. ie. There exists a neighbourhood of x0 contained in A. 5.1.1 Examples A union of open intervals is open. Suppose A is such a union, and x0 ∈ A. Then x0 ⊂ (a, b) ⊂ A. WLOG, suppose (a, b) is ﬁnite (and if it isn’t we can replace it by (x0 − 1, x0 + 1) ∩ (a, b) ). Let δ = min{x0 − a, b − x0}. Then (x0 − δ, x0 + δ) ⊂ (a, b) ⊂ A. in particular, an open interval is open. 5.2 Cluster Points A cluster point is sometimes called a limit point or an accumulation point. We say x0 is a cluster point of A ⊂ R if ∀δ > 0: ∃a ∈ A 0 < |x0 − a| < δ ie. ∀δ > 0, (x0 − δ, x0 + δ) ∩ A\\{x0} ̸= ∅. The 0 < |x0 − a| guarantees that a ̸= x0. 5.2.1 Theorem 11 x0 is a cluster point of A ⊂ R ⇐⇒ there is a sequence (an) of distinct points in A\\{x0} which converges to x0. Proof. “⇒”: Suppose x0 is a cluster point of A. Claim: We can choose a sequence (an) with 0 < |x0 − an| < 1 n and so by sand- wich theorem, an → x0 as n → ∞. Suppose ﬁrst n terms have been chosen. Let δ = min{ 1 n+1 , |a1 − x0|, |a2 − x0|, . . . , |an − x0|} and choose an+1 ∈ A with 0 < |x0 − an+1| < δ so that |an+1 − x0| < δ ≤ 1 n+1 . For j = 1, . . . , n |aj − x0| > |an+1 − x0| so that an+1 /∈ {a1, . . . , an}. ie. that they are distinct. “⇐”: Suppose we have such a sequence in A\\{x0}. Then for δ > 0, ∃N so that 0 < |an − x0| < δ, ∀n > N hence x0 is a cluster point of A. 5.2.2 Examples 1. If A is an interval, then every point in A is a cluster point, as is every ﬁnite end point. 2. A ﬁnite set has no limit points 3. The inﬁnite set N has no limit points. 31 4. The set A = { 1 n : n ∈ N} has only one limit point 0 /∈ A. 5. (0, 1) ∩ Q has cluster points [0, 1] 5.3 Deﬁnition of limits of a function Let x0 be a cluster point of A ⊂ R and if f : A → R and L ∈ R then we say L is the limit of f at x0 if: ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0 |f (x) − L| < ϵ , ∀x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0| < δ If A is an interval with endpoints a, b respectively, then we often write: lim x→a f (x) = lim x→a+ f (x) lim x→b f (x) = lim x→b− f (x) We write lim x→x0 f (x0) = L or f (x) → L as x → x0 5.4 Limits of functions are unique Proof. Suppose f has limits L1, L2 at x0. ie. ∀e > 0, ∃δ1 > 0, δ2 > 0 |f (x) − L1| < ϵ 2 ∀x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0| < δ1 |f (x) − L2| < ϵ 2 ∀x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0| < δ2 Let δ = min{δ1, δ2}. Then ∀x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0| < δ |L1 − L2| = |L1 − f (x) + f (x) − L2| ≤ |f (x) − L1| + |f (x) − L2| < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ So then ∀ϵ > 0, 0 ≤ |L1 − L2| < ϵ =⇒ |L1 − L2| = 0 =⇒ L1 = L2. 5.4.1 Example 1 Suppose f is the linear polynomial given by f (x) = α + β, α, β ∈ R and x0 ∈ R. Then we claim that: lim x→x0 f (x) = αx0 + β |f (x) − (αx0 + β)| = |αx + β − (αx0 + β)| = |αx − αx0| = |α||x − x0| Let ϵ > 0, then if α = 0, |f (x) − (αx0 + β)| = 0 < ϵ =⇒ limit is B. If α ̸= 0 then choose δ = ϵ |α| > 0. So for 0 < |x − x0| < δ we have |f (x) − (αx0 + β)| = |α||x − x0| < |α|δ = |α| ϵ |α| = ϵ Therefore, lim x→x0 f (x) = αx0 + β 32 5.4.2 Example 2 Claim: lim x→x0 x2 = x2 0 Consider: |x2 − x2 0| = |(x − x0)(x + x0)|. Suppose |x − x0| < 1. Then |x + x0| = |x − x0 + 2x0| ≤ |x − x0| + 2|x0| < 1 + 2|x0| Let ϵ > 0 and choose δ = min{ ϵ 2|x0|+1 , 1}. Then if 0 < |x − x0| < δ we have |x + x0| ≤ 2|x0| + 1. So, |f (x)−x2 0| = |x2−x2 0| = |x−x0||x+x0| ≤ |x−x0|(2|x0|+1) < ϵ 2|x0| + 1 (2|x0|+1) = ϵ Therefore lim x→x0 x2 = x2 0 5.5 Theorem 12 Let f : A → R, A ⊂ R, x0 is a cluster point of A, and L ∈ R. Then the following are equivalent: 1. limx→x0 f (x) = L 2. Given any ϵ-neighbourhood (L − ϵ, L + ϵ) of the point L, ∃δ > 0 with f ((x0 − δ, x0 + δ) ∩ A\\{x0}) ⊂ (L − ϵ, L + ϵ) = Bϵ(L). 3. For every sequence (an) of the points in A\\{x0} which converges to x0, limn→∞ f (an) = L. Proof. (1) →(2): Suppose limx→x0 f (x) = L. ie ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0, 0 < |x−x0| < δ, |f (x) − L| < ϵ ⇐⇒ x ∈ (x0 − δ, x0 + δ) ∩ A\\{x0} =⇒ f (x) ∈ (L − ϵ, L + ϵ) Where |x − x0| < δ ⇐⇒ (x0 − δ, x0 + δ) and A\\{x0} ⇐⇒ x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0|. (2) → (3): Suppose (2) holds. Let (an) be a sequence in A\\{x0} converging to x0. For ϵ > 0 choose δ > 0 given by (2). Since an → x0, ∃N : ∀n > N : |an − x0| < δ So for n > N |an − x0| < δ =⇒ |f (an) − L| < ϵ. ie. lim n→∞ f (an) = L (3) → (1): We will prove this via a contrapositive statement. Suppose (i) is false. Then We prove (iii) is false. (i) false ⇐⇒ ∃ϵ > 0 for which there is no δ > 0 such that |f (x) − L| < ϵ. ie. ∀δ > 0, ∃x ∈ A, 0 < |x − x0| < δ, |f (x) − L| ≥ ϵ. Take δ = 1 n then choose points an ∈ A, 0 < |an − x0| < 1 n and |f (an) − L| ≥ ϵ. Since |an − x0| > 0, (an) is a sequence in A\\{x0}, and also since |an − x0| < 1 n → 0 as n → ∞. Hence by squeeze theorem, an → x0 and |f (an) − L| ≥ ϵ, ∀n ∈ N . Therefore f (an) does not have a limit L. 33 5.5.1 Example 1 The limit limx→∞ f (x) is unique and is given by limn→∞ f (an) where (an) is any sequence in A\\{x0} which converges to x0. 5.5.2 Example 2: Show limx→1 x+1 x2+3 = 1 2 Suppose xn → 1 as n → ∞. Then limn→∞ xn+1 x2 n+3 = lim xn+1 (lim xn)2+3 = 1+1 1+3 = 1 2 . So by (iii) → (i) we have that limx→1 x+1 x2+3 = 1 2 . 5.5.3 Example 3: Consider limx→0+ 1 x , where f (x) = 1 x , ∀x > 0 Let xn = 1 n and xn → 0 as n → ∞ and also that (xn > 0 ∀n ∈ N) ie. ∀x > 0. Then the sequence 1 xn = n does not converge (as it is unbounded). So then 1 x has no limit as x → 0 +. 5.6 Theorem 13 Suppose x0 is a cluster point of A and f, g : A → R have limits at x0. Then: (i) lim x→x0(f + g)(x) = lim x→x0 f (x) + lim x→x0 g(x) (ii) lim x→x0(cf (x)) = lim x→x0 c · lim x→x0 f (x) = c · lim x→x0 f (x) , c ∈ R (iii) lim x→x0(f g)(x) = ( lim x→x0 f (x))( lim x→x0 g(x)) (iv) lim x→x0 ( f g ) (x) = limx→x0 f (x) limx→x0 g(x) if lim x→x0 g(x) ̸= 0 NB: If limx→x0 g(x) ̸= 0 then, ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0 |g(x) − L| < ϵ ⇐⇒ L − ϵ < g(x) < L + ϵ For x close to x0, g(x) ̸= 0 so limx→x0 ( f g ) is “well deﬁned”. Proof. (i) Suppose an → x0 where (an) is in A\\{x0}. Then (f + g)(x) = f (an) + g(an). By the sequential convergence criterion for the limit of f and g to exist, f (an) → f (x) and g(an) → g(x). So by the sequential criterion, f +g has the limit limx→x0 f (x)+limx→x0 g(x). Similarly, for (ii), (iii), (iv). 5.7 Squeeze Theorem Suppose x0 is a cluster point of A ⊂ R, f, g, h : A → R and f (x) ≤ g(x) ≤ h(x) ∀x ∈ A (or just neighbourhood of x0) and limx→x0 f (x) = limx→x0 h(x) = L. Then: lim x→x0 g(x) = L The proof is via sequential criterion again. 34 5.7.1 Example 1: limx→0+ x · sin( 1 x ) = 0 Since −1 ≤ sin( 1 x ) ≤ 1, for x ̸= 0 and −x ≤ x · sin( 1 x ) ≤ x, ∀x > 0 and limx→0+ |x| = 0 then by the squeeze theorem we have that: lim x→0+ x · sin( 1 x ) = 0 5.7.2 Example 2: f (x) = sin( 1 x ) has no limit at x = 0 Since we take xn = 1 π 2 +nπ , then f ( 1 xn ) = sin( π 2 + nπ) = (−1)n+1 diverges. So f has no limit as x → 0. 5.8 Deﬁnition: Limits to Inﬁnity Suppose A ⊂ R and (a, ∞) ⊂ A for some a ∈ R. Then we say f : A → R has a limit L ∈ R if ∀ϵ > 0, ∃M ∈ R: |f (x) − L| < ϵ , ∀x > M and we write L = lim x→∞ f (x) Similarly, if (−∞, b) ⊂ A for some b ∈ R we say lim x→−∞ f (x) = L if ∀ϵ > 0, ∃M |f (x) − L| < ϵ , ∀x < M 5.8.1 Remark Similar to limits of sequences of functions, the limits as n → ±∞ are unique if they exist and they also satisfy the usual rules. 5.8.2 Example 1: Show limx→∞ 1√x = 0 Let ϵ > 0, and x > 0. | 1 √x − 0| = | 1 √x | = 1 √x < ϵ ⇐⇒ x > 1 ϵ2 Let ϵ > 0, and choose M = 1 ϵ2 then ∀x > M = 1 ϵ2 | 1 √x − 0| = 1 √x < ϵ Therefore lim x→∞ 1 √x = 0 35 5.8.3 Example 2: limx→−∞ x x+1 | x x+1 − 1| = 1 |x+1| and for x < −1 we have 1 |x+1| = 1 −x−1 so 1 −x−1 < ϵ ⇐⇒ x < −1 − 1 ϵ . Let ϵ > 0 then choose M = −1 − 1 ϵ | x x + 1 − 1| = 1 |x + 1| < ϵ , ∀x < M = −1 − 1 ϵ 5.8.4 Calculate limx→∞ 2x3−3x+6 x3−5x+1 Note by product rule, limx→∞ 1 x = (limx→∞ 1√x )(limx→∞ 1√x ) = 0 · 0 = 0. So by the product, sum and quotient rules lim x→∞ 2x 3 − 3x + 6 x3 − 5x + 1 = lim x→∞ 2 − 3( 1 x )2 + 6( 1 x ) 3 1 − 5( 1 x )2 + ( 1 x )3 = 2 − 3 · 0 + 6 · 0 1 − 5 · 0 + 0 = 2 6 Continuity f is continuous at x0 if f (x) comes close to f (x0) as x comes close to x0. 6.1 Deﬁnition Let A ∈ R and f : A → R and x0 be a point of A. Then we say f is continuous at x0 if ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0 |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ , ∀x ∈ A, |x − x0| < δ We say f is continuous on B ⊂ A if f is continuous at every point in B. “f is continuous” if it is continuous on A. 6.1.1 Example 1 If f is continuous on B then f is continuous on any subset C ⊂ B. 6.1.2 Example 2 Let f : N → R be any function. Then f is continuous. Since if ϵ > 0, take δ ≤ 1 and x0 ∈ N |x − x0| < δ ≤ 1 =⇒ x = x0 =⇒ |f (x) − f (x0)| = |f (x0) − f (x0)| = 0 < ϵ 6.1.3 Example 3 Let f : R → R and f (x) = { 1 x ∈ Q 0 x /∈ Q Then f is continuous at NO points. This is because, if x0 is ﬁxed, x0 ∈ R and δ > 0 then we can choose q ∈ Q and y ∈ R\\Q, |x0 − q|, |x0 − y| < δ and |f (x0) − f (q)|, |f (x0) − f (y)| = {0, 1} and so we cannot have |f (x0) − f (x)| < 1 for any x ∈ (x0 − δ, x0 + δ), ∀δ > 0. 36 6.2 Theorem 14 Let f : A → R and x0 ∈ A. The following are equivalent. 1. f is continuous at x0. 2. ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0 [f (Bδ(x0) ∩ A) ⊂ Bϵ(f (x0))]. 3. For every sequence (xn) in A with limn→∞ xn = x0 one has limn→∞ f (xn) = f (x0). 4. If x0 is a cluster point for A then limx→x0 f (x) = f (x0). Proof. I ⇐⇒ II : Let ϵ > 0. Since f is continuous at x0, there is a δ > 0 so that ∀x ∈ A with |x − x0| < δ one has: |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ So ∀x ∈ Bδ(x0) ∩ A we have x ∈ A and x ∈ Bδ(x0) so |x − x0| < δ. Then |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ, that is, f (x) ∈ Bϵ(f (x0)). Thus, f (Bδ(x0) ∩ A) ⊂ Bϵ(f (x0)) II → III : Let x1, x2, . . . ∈ A and assume that limn→∞ xn = x0. Let ϵ > 0 then by II, ∃δ > 0: f (Bδ(x0) ∩ A) ⊂ Bϵ(f (x0)) Since limn→∞ xn = x0 and δ > 0 there exists N ∈ N st. ∀n ∈ N, n > N |xn − x0| < δ. Now let n ∈ N, n ≥ N . Then |xn − x0| < δ. so xn ∈ Bδ(x0) and xn ∈ A imply xn ∈ Bδ(x0) ∩ A. So f (xn) ∈ f (Bδ(x0) ∩ A) ⊂ Bϵ(f (x0)). Therefore |f (xn) − f (x0)| < ϵ and limn→∞ f (xn) = f (x0). III → I : Let ϵ > 0. we have to show ∃δ > 0 ∀x ∈ A with |x − x0| < δ that |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ. Suppose it is false. Then, ∀δ > 0, ∃x ∈ A with |x − x0| < δ so that |f (x) − f (x0)| ≥ ϵ. Let n ∈ N. Choose δ = 1 n . Then ∃xn ∈ A with |xn − x0| < 1 n and |f (xn) − f (x0)| ≥ ϵ. Hence x1, x2, . . . ∈ A and limn→∞ xn = x0. So by III, limn→∞ f (xn) = f (x0). Then there is an N ∈ N such that ∀n ≥ N , |f (xn) − f (x0)| < ϵ. ϵ ≤ |f (xN ) − f (x0)| < ϵ ⇐⇒ ϵ < ϵ\t Therefore f is continuous at x0. I → IV : Trivial. IV → I : Case 1: Suppose x0 is not a cluster point. Then ∃δ > 0 ∀a ∈ A so that |x − x0| = 0 or |x − x0| ≥ δ. Let ϵ > 0, take δ > 0 then ∀x ∈ A with |x−x0| < δ, one has that |x−x0| = 0 ⇐⇒ x = x0. Then |f (x)−f (x0)| = 0 < ϵ. Case 2: Suppose x0 is a cluster point. Let ϵ > 0. Since limx→x0 f (x) = f (x0) we know that there is a δ > 0 such that ∀x ∈ A with 0 < |x − x0| < δ one has that |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ. Now let x ∈ A and assume that |x − x0| < δ. Case 2a: If |x − x0| = 0 then x = x0 hence |f (x) − f (x0)| = 0 < ϵ (case 1) Case 2b: If |x − x0| > 0 then 0 < |x − x0| < δ so |f (x) − f (x0)| < ϵ. 37 6.2.1 Corollary 1 If f, g : A → R x0 ∈ A, f, g both continuous at x0. Then the following are continuous at x0: 1. (f + g)(x)(from III). 2. (f · g)(x) = (limn→∞ f (xn))(limn→∞ g(xn)) = f (x0) · g(x0) 3. f g (x) = (limn→∞ f (xn)) (limn→∞ g(xn)) = f (x0) g(x0) , if g(x0) ̸= 0. Proof. If x1, x2, . . . ∈ A with limn→∞ xn = x0 then limn→∞ f (xn) = f (x0) and limn→∞ g(xn) = g(x0) So limn→∞(f +g)(xn) = limn→∞ f (xn)+limn→∞ g(xn) = f (x0) + g(x0). Similarly, for the other proofs. 6.2.2 Corollary 2 Every polynomial and rational function is continuous. Rational function is one where you divide a polynomial with another. 6.2.3 Corollary 3 Let f : A → R, g : B → R. Suppose f (A) ⊂ B. Suppose x0 ∈ A, f is continuous at x0 and g continuous at f (x0). Then gof (x) is continuous at x0. Proof. Let x1, x2, . . . ∈ A and suppose limn→∞ xn = x0. Since f is continuous at x0, one has limn→∞ f (xn) = f (x0) hence limn→∞ g(f (xn)) = g(f (x0)). Because g is continuous at f (x0), and g(f (x0)) ⇐⇒ gof (x0) then gof (x) is continuous at x0. 6.2.4 Example 1 f : R → R, f (x) = {x sin 1 x if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 Claim: f is continuous. We only need to show it is continuous at 0. Let ϵ > 0 and choose δ = ϵ. Then ∀x ∈ R with |x − 0| < δ one has: case 1 : When x = 0, |f (x) − f (0)| = 0 < ϵ. case 2 : When x ̸= 0, |f (x) − f (0)| = |x sin 1 x | − 0| = |x sin 1 x | = |x|| sin 1 x | ≤ |x| < δ = ϵ. So f is continuous at 0. 6.2.5 Corollary 4 Deﬁne g : R → R. g(x) = {x2 sin 1 x if x ̸= 0 0 if x = 0 then g is also continuous. Proof. g(x) = x · f (x) is a product of continuous functions and therefore con- tinuous. 38 6.2.6 Example 2 Deﬁne f : R → R. f (x) = {1 if x ∈ Q 0 if x ̸= Q Let x0 ∈ R then f is not continuous at any point x0. Proof. ∀n ∈ N let xn = 10 −n⌊10 nx0⌋ ∈ Q. Then 10 −n(10 nx0−1) ≤ 10−n⌊10nx0⌋ ≤ 10−n10nx0. =⇒ x0 − 10n ≤ xn ≤ x0 So by the squeeze theorem, limn→∞ xn = x0. If f is continuous at x0 then f (x0) = limn→∞ f (xn) = limn→∞ 1 = 1. Claim: There is a sequence of irrational numbers tending to 0. ie. ∃y1, y2, . . . ∈ R\\Q st. limn→∞ yn = x0. If that is so, then it follows that f (x0) = limn→∞ f (yn) = limn→∞ 0 = 0. \t . Proof of claim: case 1: x0 ̸= 0, yn = 1 10n√2 ⌊10n√2x0⌋. Then we reason similarly to above proof. case 2: x0 = 0, then yn = 10 −n√2. 6.2.7 Example 3 f : R → R. f (x) = |x| then f is continuous. Proof. Let xn ∈ R. Let ϵ > 0 Choose δ = ϵ. Then ∀x ∈ R with |x − x0| < δ one has (with reverse triangle inequality) |f (x) − f (x0)| = ||x| − |x0|| ≤ |x − x0| < δ = ϵ 6.3 Boundedness Theorem Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous. Then f is bounded. Recall a function f : A → R is bounded ⇐⇒ ∃M ∈ R: ∀x ∈ A, [|f (x)| ≤ M ]. Proof. Suppose it is false. ie. ∀M , ∃x ∈ A [|f (x)| > M ]. Then ∀n ∈ N (with M = n), ∃xn ∈ [a, b] st, |f (xn)| > n. Then the sequence x1, x2, . . . is bounded and so by Bolzano-Weierstraß, has a convergent subsequence xn1, xn2, . . . of x1, x2, . . . which converges to some x0 ∈ R. But xnk ≥ a ∀k ∈ N so x0 = limk→∞ xnk ≥ a. Similarly, x0 ≤ b, so that x ∈ [a, b]. But f is continuous at x0 so f (x0) = limk→∞ f (xnk ). Hence there exists an N ∈ N so that ∀k ≥ N |f (xnk ) − f (x0)| < 1 Then for all k ≥ N , k ≤ nk < |f (xnk )| ≤ |f (x0)| + 1. This is a contradiction if k > max(N, |f (x0)| + 1). 39 6.4 Global Maximum and Minimums Deﬁnition: Let f : A → R, M ∈ R and a ∈ A. Then f has a global maximum M at a if f (a) = M and ∀x ∈ A, f (x) ≤ M . Similarly for global minimums. 6.4.1 Min-Max Theorem (Weierstraß) Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous. Then f has a global maximum and global minimum. Proof. Since f is bounded, set M = sup{f (x) : x ∈ [a, b]}. We have to show ∃x0 ∈ [a, b] st. f (x0) = M and ∀x ∈ [a, b], f (x0) ≤ M . Suppose not. Then f (x) < M for all x ∈ [a, b]. Deﬁne g : [a, b] → R, g(x) = 1 M −f (x) . Then g is continuous. By the bound- edness theorem, g is bounded above. So there is an N ∈ R such that for all x ∈ [a, b] : g(x) ≤ N and N > 0. Then ∀x ∈ [a, b] one has 1 M −f (x) = g(x) ≤ N . So that M − f (x) ≥ 1 N ⇐⇒ M − 1 N ≥ f (x). Since M − 1 N is an upper bound for {f (x) : x ∈ [a, b]} hence M − 1 N ≥ M as M is the supremum. \t . The Min-Max theorem and Boundedness theorem combine to give the ex- treme value theorem which says that given a function f : [a, b] → R is con- tinuous, then the function is bounded and there exists x0 ∈ [a, b] such that f (x0) = M is the maximum, and similarly for the minimum. 6.5 Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT I) Let f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function. Suppose f (a) < 0 and f (b) > 0 then there must exist a c ∈ (a, b) so that f (c) = 0. Proof. Note that {x ∈ [a, b] : f (x) < 0} is non empty since it contains a and bounded above by b. Set s = sup{x ∈ [a, b] : f (x) < 0}. We claim that f (s) = 0. First, since f (a) < 0, ∃δ > 0 st. ∀x ∈ [a, a + δ) one has |f (x) − f (a)| < −f (a) 2 . Then for all x ∈ [a, a + δ), 3 2 f (a) < f (x) < 1 2 f (a) < 0. Therefore, [a, a + δ) ⊂ {x ∈ [a, b] : f (x) < 0}. Hence a + δ ≤ s and s ̸= a. Case 1 : Suppose f (s) < 0, then s ̸= b. Arguing as above, ∃δ > 0 st for all x ∈ [s, s + δ) one has f (x) < 0. Then s + δ ≤ s \t . Case 2 : Suppose f (s) > 0, then s ̸= a. Arguing as above, δ > 0, such that ∀x ∈ (s − δ, s] one has f (x) > 0. So s − δ is an upper bound for {x ∈ [a, b] : f (x) < 0}. Thus, s ≤ s − δ \t . Therefore, f (s) = 0. 6.6 Bolzano Intermediate Value Theorem (IVT II) Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous and k ∈ R with either f (a) < k < f (b) or f (b) < k < f (a). Then ∃c ∈ (a, b) st. f (c) = k. Proof. Suppose f (a) ≤ k ≤ f (b). If f (a) = b, then take c = a. If f (b) = k, then take c = b. If f (a) < k < f (b) apply IVT(I) to g : [a, b] → R, g(x) = f (x) − k. Then ∃c ∈ (a, b) with g(c) = 0 so that f (c) = k. Suppose f (a) ≥ k ≥ f (b). Then consider g : [a, b] → R and g(x) = −f (x). Then g(a) ≤ −k ≤ g(b) so that ∃c ∈ [a, b]: g(c) = −k, so that f (c) = k. 40 6.6.1 Corollary 1 Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous. Then ∃m, M ∈ R with m ≤ M such that f ([a, b]) = [m, M ]. Recall that {37} = [37, 37]. Proof. Since f is bounded (boundedness theorem), ∃m, M : m ≤ f (x) ≤ M , ∀x ∈ [a, b]. Namely, ∃m, M with m ≤ M so that f ([a, b]) ⊂ [m, M ]. Using Bolzano IVT, ∀k ∈ [m, M ], ∃c ∈ [a, b]: f (c) = k such that f ([a, b]) = [m, M ]. 6.6.2 Corollary 2 Let I ⊂ R, be an interval with f : I → R be a continuous function. Then f (I) is also an interval. Proof. Apply corollary 1. 6.7 Monotone Functions Increasing Function Deﬁnition: Let A ⊂ R and f : A → R. Then f is called increasing iﬀ. ∀x, y ∈ A, and x ≤ y we have f (x) ≤ f (y). “Strictly increasing” means x < y =⇒ f (x) < f (y). Similarly for decreasing. 6.7.1 Lemma 16 Let I ⊂ R be an interval and f : I → J be increasing. Let x0 ∈ I be an interior point of I. ie. ∃ϵ > 0: (x − ϵ, x + ϵ) ⊂ I. Then sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} = limx↑x0 f (x) = limx→x− 0 f (x). Note that limx↑x0 f (x) := limx→x − 0 f (x) (diﬀerent notation only). In particular, the supremum and the limit exist and are equal. Proof. {f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} ̸= ∅ and bounded by f (x0) so sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} exists. We shall prove that limx↑x0 f (x) = s. Let ϵ > 0. Set s = sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0}. Then s − ϵ is not an upper bound for the set {f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0}. So, ∃y ∈ I with y < x0: f (y) > s−ϵ. Set δ = x0 −y > 0. Then ∀x ∈ I with x < x0 and |x − x0| < δ [equivalently, x ∈ (x0 − δ, x0) so y < x]. Since x ∈ I, x < x0, and f (x) is increasing, one has s − ϵ < f (y) ≤ f (x) ≤ s ≤ s + ϵ. Thus, lim x→x− 0 f (x) = s WLOG, same applies for lim x→x+ 0 f (x) = i = inf{f (x) : x ∈ I, x > x0} 41 6.7.2 Corollary 1 Let I ⊂ R be an interval and f : I → J be an increasing function where J = f (I). Then f is continuous iﬀ J is an interval. Proof. “⇒”: Already done. A continuous function maps intervals into intervals. “⇐”: Let x0 ∈ I. we show that f is continuous at x0. Case 1 : Suppose x is an interior point of I. We claim that limx→x− 0 f (x) = f (x0). If sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} < f (x0) then f (I) is not an interval because there is no x ∈ I with f (x) = f (x0)+s 2 where s = sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0}. This is because if k = f (x0)+s 2 then ∀x < x0 we have f (x) ≤ s < k and x ≥ x0 gives f (x) ≥ f (x0) > k, placing k between f (x0) and f (s) causing a gap where the interval will not cover. Hence it would not be an interval. So that means, since f is increasing, one has sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} = f (x0). Then by lemma, lim x→x− 0 f (x) = sup{f (x) : x ∈ I, x < x0} = f (x0) Similarly the same argument follows for limx→x+ 0 f (x) = f (x0). Hence limx→x0 f (x) = f (x0) and f is continuous at x0. See Warren’s notes to prove that a limit exists iﬀ limit from above and below are equal. Idea is trivial - just restrict cluster point to be taken from one side of the delta neigh- bourhood for the one sided limits. Case 2 : If x0 is a boundary point, a similar argument follows. 6.7.3 Corollary 2: Continuity Inverse Theorem Let I ⊂ R be an interval, f : I → J be a strictly increasing bijection that is continuous. Let g : J → I be the inverse of f . Then g is strictly increasing and continuous. Proof. We know g is trivially strictly increasing and J is an interval. (see 6.6.2 above, Corollary 2). Moreover, g(J) = I is an interval. By corollary 1, g is continuous. 6.7.4 Example Fix n ∈ N. Deﬁne f : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) by f (x) = xn. Clearly, f (x) is continuous and strictly increasing. So f ([0, ∞)) [notation for range] is an interval. Then f ([0, ∞)) ⊂ [0, ∞). Moreover by Bernoulli inequality, f (k + 1) = (1 + k)n ≥ 1 + nk ≥ k, ∀k ∈ (−1, ∞) Hence k ∈ f ([0, ∞)) for all k ∈ (0, ∞) by the intermediate value theorem. This is possible because we can take the restriction on [0, k + 1] and then apply IVT so that ∃c ∈ (0, k + 1): f (c) = k, then since k ∈ f ([0, k + 1]) ⊂ f ([0, ∞)) so that it is surjective. Injective part follows because it is strictly increasing. Therefore f ([0, ∞)) = [0, ∞) so that f : [0, ∞) → [0, ∞) is a bijection. By corollary 2, the inverse of f is continuous. We denote this: n√x = g(x), ∀x ∈ [0, ∞). 42 6.8 Uniform Continuity Recall: f : A → R is a function. Then f is continuous iﬀ. f is continuous at every point a ∈ A. ⇐⇒ (∀a ∈ A)(∀ϵ > 0)(∃δ > 0)(∀x ∈ A)[|x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − f (a)| < ϵ] So that δ is allowed to depend on a ∈ A and ϵ > 0. In general, it depends on both. Deﬁnition Let f : A → R be a function. Then f is called uniformly continuous iﬀ (∀ϵ > 0)(∃δ > 0)(∀a ∈ A)(∀x ∈ A)[|x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − f (a)| < ϵ] Where δ can only depend on ϵ > 0 and NOT on a ∈ A. 6.8.1 Lemma 17 Every uniformly continuous function is continuous. This is trivial. The converse is not true. 6.8.2 Converse Counter Example 1 We will show a continuous function which is not uniformly continuous. Deﬁne f : (0, 1] → R, f (x) = 1 x . We claim f is not uniformly continuous. Now, suppose for a contradiction it is. Proof. Choose ϵ = 1, then ∃δ > 0 st. ∀x, ϵ ∈ A with |x − a| < δ |f (x) − f (a)| < ϵ = 1 But take a = 1 2 δ and x = 1 n where n ∈ N, and n > 1 δ . Then when |x − a| < δ, 1 > |f (x) − f (a)| = |n − 2 δ |, ∀n > 1 δ So that n < 1 + 2 δ for all n > 1 δ . \t . Because natural numbers are not bounded above. 6.8.3 Lemma 18 Let f : A → R. The following are equivalent: 1. f is not uniformly continuous. 2. ∃ϵ > 0, ∀δ > 0, ∃a ∈ A, ∃x ∈ A, [|x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − f (a)| ≥ ϵ] 3. ∃ϵ > 0, ∃(xn) ∈ A, ∃(yn) ∈ A, [limn→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 and ∀n ∈ N |f (xn) − f (yn)| ≥ ϵ] Proof. I ⇐⇒ II : Follows by deﬁnition. 43 II =⇒ III : Suppose (II) valid. Let ϵ > 0, ∀δ > 0, ∃x, y ∈ A [|x − a| < δ =⇒ |f (x) − f (y)| ≥ ϵ]. For all n ∈ N choose δ = 1 n then there are xn, yn ∈ A st. |xn − yn| < δ = 1 n and |f (xn) − f (yn)| ≥ ϵ. Thus, we have lim n→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 III =⇒ II : Assume (III). Then ∃ϵ > 0 and x1, x2, . . . , y1, y2, . . . ∈ A st. limn→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 and ∀n ∈ N[|f (xn) − f (yn)| ≥ ϵ]. Let δ > 0. Since limn→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 ∃n ∈ N st. |xn − yn| < δ. Then choose x = xn and y = yn then II is satisﬁed. 6.8.4 Example Let f : (0, 1] → R and f(x) = 1 x . Choose ϵ = 1, xn = 1 n , yn = 1 n+2 . Then limn→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 but ∀n ∈ N one has |f (xn) − f (yn)| = |n − (n + 2)| = 2 ≥ ϵ Hence f is not uniformly continuously. 6.8.5 Theorem 15 Let f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function. Then f is uniformly continuous. Proof. Suppose not. ie. f is not uniformly continuous. Then there are ϵ > 0, (yn), (xn) ∈ [a, b] such that limn→∞ |xn − yn| = 0 and for all n ∈ N: |f (xn) − f (yn)| ≥ ϵ. By Bolzano-Weierstraß, the bounded sequence (xn) has a convergent subsequence (xnk ) with limit L = limk→∞ xnk . Since [a, b] is closed, one has L ∈ [a, b]. Now limk→∞(xnk − ynk ) = 0 since limk→∞ |xn − yn| = 0. Hence lim k→∞ ynk = lim k→∞ xnk = L exists. Since f is continuous at L then we have lim k→∞ f (xnk ) = lim k→∞ f (ynk ) = f (L) Hence lim k→∞(f (xnk ) − f (ynk )) = 0 Therefore, there is a k ∈ N st. |f (xnk ) − f (ynk )| < ϵ \t 6.8.6 Lipschitz Functions A function f : A → R is called “Lipschitz”, Lipschitz-function, Lipschitz- continuous or satisﬁes a Lipschitz condition iﬀ. (∃L ≥ 0)(∀x, y ∈ A)[|f (x) − f (y)| ≤ L|x − y|] 44 6.8.7 Lemma 19 Every Lipschitz funciton is uniformly continuous. Proof. Let ϵ > 0. Choose δ = ϵ L+1 . Then, ∀a, x ∈ A with |x − a| < δ, one has |f (x) − f (a)| ≤ L|x − a| ≤ (L + 1)|x − a| < (L + 1)δ = ϵ 6.8.8 Example Deﬁne f : [1, ∞). f (x) = √x. We claim that f is Lipschitz. Proof. Let x, y ∈ [1, ∞) then |f (x)−f (a)| = \f \f \f \f(√x − √y) ( √x + √y √x + √y )\f \f \f \f = \f \f \f \f x − y √x + √y \f \f \f \f = |x − y| √x + √y ≤ |x − y| 2 So then one can choose L = 1 2 . Therefore f is uniformly continuous, on [1, ∞) by the Lipschitz proposition. 6.8.9 Example Deﬁne f : [0, ∞) → R, f (x) = √x. Claim: f is uniformly continuous. Proof. Let ϵ > 0. Since f : [0, 2] → R is continuous, closed and bounded, ∃δ1 > 0, ∀x, y ∈ [0, 2], with |x − y| < δ1: |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ. Moreover, ∃δ2 > 0 st. ∀x, y ∈ [1, ∞): [|x − y| < δ2 =⇒ |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ]. Now take, δ = min(δ1, δ2, 1) > 0. Let x, y ∈ [0, ∞) and suppose |x − y| < δ. Then either: 1. x, y ∈ [0, 2] which implies |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ; or 2. x, y ∈ [1, ∞) which implies |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ Therefore, f is uniformly continuous. 7 Diﬀerentiation Deﬁnition: Let I ⊂ R and c a cluster point of I. The function f : I → R is said to be diﬀerentiable at c if and only if: lim x→c f (x) − f (c) x − c exists. We denote the limit by f ′(c). 7.1 Notation d n dxn (f (x)) = f ′(x) (Leibnitz) Dnf (x) = f ′(x) f (n)(x) = f ′(x) ˙f (x) = f ′(x) (Newton) 45 7.2 Theorem 16 If f is diﬀerentiable at c then f is continuous at c. Proof. Claim: If c is a cluster point of I, f is continuous at c. Sequential continuity: ⇐⇒ lim x→c f (x) = f (c) ⇐⇒ lim x→c(f (x) − f (c)) = 0 Since: f (x) − f (c) = f (x) − f (c) x − c · (x − c) → f ′(c) · (0 − 0) = 0 as x → c then f is continuous at c. 7.2.1 Example Let f (x) = |x|, x ∈ R. For c = 0, f (x) − f (0) x − 0 = |x| x = sign(x) :=  | | 1 x > 0 0 x = 0 −1 x < 0 Since limx→0± f (x)−f (0) x−0 = ±1 the limit of f (x)−f (0) x−0 does not exist. So f (x) = |x| is not diﬀerentiable at x = 0. 7.3 Theorem 17 If f, g : I → R, c a cluster point of I and f, g diﬀerentiable at c, then so are: 1. αf (x), α ∈ R with (αf )′(c) = αf ′(c) 2. (f + g)(x) with (f + g)′(c) = f ′(c) + g′(c) 3. (f g)(x) with (f g)′(c) = f (c)g′(c) + f ′(c)g(c) [Product Rule] 4. f g (x) when g′(c) ̸= 0 with g(c)f ′(c)−g′(c)f (c) (g′(c))2 [Quotient Rule] Proof of ﬁrst two left as exercises. Proof of (c): Proof. (f g)(x) − (f g)(c) x − c = f (x)g(x) − f (c)g(c) x − c = f (x)g(x) − f (x)g(c) + f (x)g(c) − f (c)g(c) x − c = f (x) g(x) − g(c) x − c + g(c) f (x) − f (c) x − c 46 Since f is diﬀerentiable at c, f is continuous at c and f (x) → f (c) as x → c. So using rules for taking limits, lim x→c (f g)(x) − (f g)(c) x − c = ( lim x→c f (x))( lim x→c g(x) − g(c) x − c ) + ( lim x→c g(c))( lim x→c f (x) − f (c) x − c ) = f (c)g′(c) + g(c)f ′(c) Proof of (d): Proof. f g (x) − f g (c) x − c = ( f (x)g(c)−f (c)g(x) g(x)g(c) ) x − c = f (x)g(c)−g(c)f (c) x−c + g(c)f (c)−f (c)g(x) x−c g(x)g(c) = 1 g(x)g(c) (g(c) f (x) − f (c) x − c + f (c) −(g(x) − g(c)) x − c ) → 1 [g(c)]2 (g(c)f ′(c) + f (c)(−g′(c))) 7.4 Chain Rule Deﬁnition: Let g : I → R and f : J → R, f (J) ⊂ I. Suppose f is diﬀerentiable at c, g diﬀerentiable at f (c) so that g ◦f is diﬀerentiable at c. Then, (g ◦f )′(c) = g′(f (c)) · f ′(c). 7.4.1 Lemma 20 If f is diﬀerentiable at c then there exists a function ϕ such that f (x) − f (c) = ϕf,c(x)(x − c) where ϕf,c is continuous at c with lim x→c ϕf,c(x) = f ′(c) Proof. Let ϕ(x) := { f (x)−f (c) x−c x ̸= c f ′(c) x = c Therefore ϕ(x) satisﬁes the conditions of the lemma. Back to the chain rule proof: Proof. Since g is diﬀerentiable at f (c) then by the lemma above, g(f (x)) − g(f (c)) = ϕg,f (c)(f (x))(f (x) − f (c)) where ϕg,f (c) is continuous at f (c) with lim y→f (c) ϕg,f (c)(y) = g′(f (c)) 47 Since f is diﬀerentiable at c, f (x) − f (c) = ϕf,c(x)(x − c) where ϕf,c is continuous at c and lim x→c ϕf,c(x) = f ′(c) Hence (g ◦ f )(x) − (g ◦ f )(c) x − c = g(f (x)) − g(f (c)) f (x) − f (c) · f (x) − f (c) x − c = ϕg,f (c)(f (x))·ϕf,c(x) Since f is diﬀerentiable at c, f is continuous at c. so (ϕg,f (c) ◦ f )(x) is a compo- sition of continuous functions at f (c) and is thus continus at c. In particular, lim x→c (ϕg,f (c) ◦ f )(x) = ϕg,f (c)(f (c)) = g′(f (c)) Hence the Newton quotient is a product of functions which have limits as x → c so by the product rule of limits, lim x→c (g ◦ f )(x) − (g ◦ f )(c) x − c = g′(f (c)) · f ′(c) 7.4.2 Remark One can show(but we won’t) that sin ′(x) = cos(x) and cos ′(x) = − sin(x). 7.4.3 Example Let f : R → R with f (x) = {x2 sin( −1 x ) x ̸= 0 0 x = 0 . Claim: f is diﬀerentiable at every point in R. Proof. For x ̸= 0 we diﬀerentiate using the usual rules to obtain: f ′(x) = x2 cos( −1 x ) · ( −1 x2 ) + 2x sin( −1 x ) = 2x sin( −1 x ) − cos( −1 x ) f ′(x) does not have a limit as x → 0, however, f is diﬀerentiable at 0 since, lim x→0 f (x) − f (0) x − 0 = lim x→0 x sin( 1 x ) = 0 So f is diﬀerentiable at 0 with f ′(0) = 0. Note that even though f (x) is continuous, f ′(x) is not continuous at 0. 48 7.5 Inverse Function Theorem Let I be an interval and f : I → R and f strictly monotone on I. Let g : J → R, J = f (I) be its strictly monotone inverse. If f is diﬀerentiable at c and f ′(c) ̸= 0, then g is diﬀerentiable at f (c) and g′(f (c)) = 1 f ′(c) This is an equivalent formulation to (f −1) ′) = 1 f ′◦f −1 (like in Warren’s notes) except here we’ve taken the composition into account from the start. Proof. Since f is diﬀerentiable at c, ∃ϕ: f (x) − f (c) = ϕ(x)(x − c) with ϕ continuous at c and ϕ(c) = f ′(c). Let y = f (x) and d = f (c). Since g = f −1 then g(y) = x and g(d) = c. So that y − d = ϕ(g(y))(g(y) − g(d)) Since ϕ(g(d)) = ϕ(c) = f ′(c) ̸= 0 and ϕ is continuous, we can choose a neigh- bourhood of c, (c − δ, c + δ) ∩ I on which ϕ is non zero. Let y ∈ f ((c−δ, c+δ)∩I) and y = f (x). Then ϕ(g(y)) = ϕ(g(f (x))) = ϕ(x). So, g(y) − g(d) y − d = 1 ϕ(g(y)) Then (ϕ ◦ g) is continuous at d, and g is continuous at d, with lim y→d (ϕ ◦ g)(y) = (ϕ ◦ g)(d) = ϕ(c) = f ′(c) So lim y→d f (y) − f (d) y − d = 1 f ′(c) 7.5.1 Example Let f (x) = x3 then it has an inverse g such that g(f (x)) = x. Suppose g is diﬀerentiable at f (0) = 0. We expect the value of derivative to be 1 since g(f (x)) = x. But by the chain rule 1 = g′(f ′(0)) = g′(f (0))f ′(0) = 0.\t . 7.6 Relative Maximum Let f : I → R. Then f has a relative maximum at c ∈ I if there is a neighbour- hood of c, so that v = (c − δ, c + δ) ∩ I with f (x) ≤ f (c), ∀x ∈ V . Similarly, for minimums. 49 7.6.1 Interior Extremum Theorem Let I be an interval and f : I → R. If f has a relative extremum at an interior point c ∈ I and if f ′(c) exists, then f ′(c) = 0. Proof. WLOG, suppose f has a local maximum at c. If not, consider −f . Suppose f ′(c) ̸= 0. Further suppose f ′(c) > 0. Since lim x→c f (x) − f (c) x − c = f ′(c) > 0 there is a neighbourhood of c with f (x)−f (c) x−c > 0, ∀x ∈ (c − δ, c + δ) ∩ I. So for x > c, we have f (x) − f (c) > 0(x − c) = 0 ⇐⇒ f (x) > f (c). Therefore c is not a local maxima. Similarly, if f ′(c) < 0 we have a similar contradiction. 7.6.2 Example 1 Consider the Weierstraß function(with the crazy zigzagging fractals). Then there are relative minimums and maximums but they are not diﬀerentiable at those points. 7.6.3 Example 2 f (x) = x2, g(x) = |x|. They have relative extrema at 0. f ′(c) = 0 exists but g′(c) does not exist at 0. 7.7 Rolle’s Theorem If f : [a, b] → R is continuous and diﬀerentiable on (a, b), and f (a) = f (b) = 0, then ∃c ∈ (a, b) with f ′(c) = 0. Proof. Either f = 0 =⇒ f ′ = 0, or f ̸= 0 on [a, b] in which case (WLOG), we can assume f takes a positive value(otherwise consider −f ). Since f is continuous, then by the maximum-minimum theorem, f attains its supremum. ie. ∃c ∈ (a, b): f (c) = sup{f (x) : x ∈ [a, b]} > 0. So c is a global and hence relative maximum of f . Then by the relative extrema theorem, we must have f ′(c) = 0. 7.8 Mean Value Theorem If f : [a, b] → R is a continuous function on [a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b) then ∃c ∈ (a, b) for which f ′(c) = f (b)−f (a) b−a . Proof. Let ϕ be f minus the line from (a, f (a)) to (b, f (b)). ϕ(x) = f (x) − f (a) − f (b) − f (a) b − a (x − a) Then ϕ satisﬁes the conditions of Rolles’ theorem so that ∃c ∈ (a, b): 50 ϕ(c) = 0 = f ′(c) − f (b) − f (a) b − a ⇐⇒ f ′(c) = f (b) − f (a) b − a 7.9 Corollary 1 If f : I → R is continuous, I an interval, and f ′ = 0 on the interval of I, then f is a constant. Proof. Suppose [a, x] ⊂ I then the restriction of f to [a, x] ⊂ I satisﬁes the conditions of the mean value theorem. Then, ∃c ∈ (a, x): f (x) − f (a) = f ′(c)(x − a) = 0 =⇒ f (x) = f (a) Similarly if x < a then f (x) = f (a). Therefore f is constant. 7.9.1 Example f (x) = { 1 if 0 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 if 2 ≤ x ≤ 3. Then f ′ = 0 on [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] but f is not constant. 7.10 Corollary 2 Let f : I → R, f diﬀerentiable and I an interval. Then f is increasing on I ⇐⇒ f ′ ≥ 0. Proof. “⇐”: Suppose f ′ ≥ 0. Let x1 < x2 and x1, x2 ∈ I. Then [x1, x2] ⊂ I. We can apply MVT to the restriction of f to [x1, x2]. ∃c ∈ (x1, x2): f (x2) − f (x1) = f ′(c)(x2 − x1) ≥ 0 Therefore f is increasing. “⇒”: Suppose f is increasing on I. Since f is increasing, f (x) − f (c) x − c ≥ 0, x ̸= c (1) Then if x > c, f (x) ≥ f (c) =⇒ f (x) − f (c) ≥ 0 =⇒ f (x)−f (c) x−c ≥ 0. If x < c, f (c) ≥ f (x) =⇒ f (c)−f (x) c−x ≥ 0. Since f ′(c) exists, take limit of (1) above. f ′(c) = lim x→c f (x) − f (c) x − c ≥ 0 (The idea is that f (x) ≤ g(x) and if the limits exist then lim f ≤ lim g.) Therefore f ′ ≥ 0. Similarly for decreasing functions. 51 7.11 Corollary 3 Let I be an interval and f : I → R. If f ′ > 0 then f is strictly increasing. Proof. By MVT, x1 < x2 =⇒ f (x2)−f (x1) = f ′(c)(x2 −x1) > 0 =⇒ f (x2) > f (x1) and f is strictly increasing. Converse is not true. eg. f (x) = x3 is strictly increasing but at 0, f ′ = 0 and not > 0. 7.11.1 Example If f ′ is bounded on an interval I, then f (original function) is Lipschitz contin- uous. Proof. Suppose |f ′(x)| ≤ M , ∀x ∈ I. By Cauchy MVT, f (x) − f (y) = f ′(c)(x − y). [c is the interior of the interval with end points x, y] This implies |f (x) − f (y)| = |f ′(c)||x − y| ≤ M |x − y|. Converse is almost but not quite true(almost everywhere diﬀerentiable). 7.12 Darboux’s Theorem If f is diﬀerentiable on [a, b] then f ′ need not be continuous, but f ′ satisﬁes the intermediate value property. ie. If f ′(a) < f ′(b) and f ′(a) < k < f ′(b), then ∃c ∈ (a, b) with f ′(c) = k. Proof. Let g(x) = kx − f (x). We want to show g′(c) = 0 for some c ∈ (a, b) =⇒ f ′(c) = k. Let c ∈ [a, b] be a point where the continuous function g attains its maximum. If c ∈ (a, b) then we must have g′(c) = k − f ′(c) = 0. Suppose c = a. g′(a) = k − f ′(a) > 0. Since g′(a) > 0, ∃δ > 0: g(x) > g(a), for all a ≤ x < a + δ. This contradicts g(a) being maximum so we can’t have c = a and similarly c cannot be b either. 7.13 Cauchy’s Mean Value Theorem Let f, g : [a, b] → R be continuous on [a, b] and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). If ∀x ∈ (a, b), g′(c) ̸= 0 then ∃c ∈ (a, b): (f (b) − f (a)) · g′(c) = f ′(c)(g(b) − g(a)). Proof. Let ϕ(x) := \f \f \f \f \f \f f (x) g(x) 1 f (a) g(a) 1 f (b) g(b) 1 \f \f \f \f \f \f Then ϕ(x) = f (x)(g(a) − g(b)) − g(x)(f (a) − f (b)) + \f \f \f \ff (a) g(a) f (b) g(b) \f \f \f \f If x = b or x = a then the matrix above is linearly dependent so that the determination is 0. ie. ϕ(a) = ϕ(b) = 0 52 ϕ is continuous on [a, b], and diﬀerentiable on (a, b). By Rolle’s theorem, ∃c ∈ (a, b): ϕ′(c) = 0 = f ′(c)(g(a) − g(b)) − g′(c)(f (a) − f (b)) 7.14 L’Hˆopital’s Rule Suppose f, g : (a, b) → R which are diﬀerentiable on (a, b) with lim x→a+ f (x) = lim x→a+ g(x) = 0 and ∃δ > 0: g′(x) ̸= 0 for all x ∈ (a, a + δ). If lim x→a+ f ′(x) g′(x) = L ∈ R then lim x→a+ f (x) g(x) = L Proof. Let ϵ > 0. Suppose limx→a+ f ′(x) g′(x) = L. Then ∃δ > 0: ∀a < u < a + δ L − ϵ < f ′(a) g′(a) < L + ϵ where g′(a) ̸= 0, ∀a < u < a + δ. By the Cauchy MVT, for a < α < β < a + δ, ∃u ∈ (α, β): f ′(u) g′(u) = f (β) − f (α) g(β) − g(α) Since a < u < a + δ, ∀a < α < β < a + δ L − ϵ < f (β) − f (α) g(β) − g(α) < L + ϵ Take the limit of the above inequality as α → a+ then by the squeeze theorem, ∀a < β < a + δ L − ϵ ≤ f (β) − limα→a+ f (α) g(β) − limα→a+ g(α) = f (β) g(β) ≤ L + ϵ ie. lim β→a+ f (β) g(β) = L The x → a− argument similarly follows. Since all ∞ ∞ cases can be manipulated into 0 0 cases, we’re done. 7.14.1 Example Suppose f : [a, b) → R and f ′(x) exists on [a, b). Either: • limx→a+ f ′(x) does not exist; or • limx→a+ f ′(x) = f ′(a). 53 (NB: limx→a+ f ′(x) cannot exist and be diﬀerent to f ′(a).) Proof. Suppose limx→a+ f (x) exists, then f ′(a) = lim x→a+ f (x) − f (a) x − a is indeterminate of the type 0 0 . So by L’Hˆopital’s rule, f ′(a) = lim x→a+ f (x) − f (a) x − a = lim x→a+ f ′(x) 7.15 Interpolation One can show that if x0, . . . , xn ∈ R with each element of the sequence not necessarily distinct, then there exists a unique polynomial pn(fundamental the- orem of algebra) of degree n interpolating the values of a function f at x0, . . . , xn when we count multiplicities (which means that when we interpolate repeatedly on the same point, we match up the values of f (x0), . . . , f (n)(x0) to it. ie the Taylor situation). Special cases: 1. If all points are distinct, then the interpolation conditions are pn(xj) = f (xj), j = 0, . . . , n. pn is called the Lagrange interpolant. 2. When all points are equal. ie. x0 = x1 = . . . = xn. The interpolation conditions are p (j) n (x0) = f (j)(x0), j = 0, . . . , n and pn is called the Taylor interpolant to f at x0. The Taylor interpolant has the form: pn(f, x) := pn(x) = f (x0) + f ′(x0)(x − x0) + . . . + f (n)(x0) n! (x − x0) n 7.15.1 Taylor (Mean Value Form) Theorem Suppose f : [a, b] → R, f (n) exists and is continuous on [a, b], and f (n+1) exists on (a, b). ie. (f n is diﬀerentiable on (a, b).) Then the error in Taylor interpolation of degree n at x0 ∈ [a, b] is given: f (x) − pn(x) = f (n+1)(c) (n + 1)! (x − x0)n+1 where c is between x and x0. Proof. If x = x0 then there is nothing to prove. WLOG, suppose x > x0. Let ϕ(x) = f (x) − pn(x) − B(x−x0) n+1 (n+1)! . Choose B, so that ϕ(x) = 0. ie. B = (f (x)−pn(x)) (n+1)! (x−x0)n+1 ). We want to show B = f (n+1)(c) ie. ϕ(n+1)(c) = 0 and f (n+1)(c) − B = 0. Now ϕ(x0) = ϕ(1)(x0) = . . . = ϕ(n)(x0) = 0 and ϕ(x) = 0. (NB: ϕ(n) is continuous on [a, b] and ϕ(n+1) exists on (a, b).) 54 Apply Rolle’s theorem to ϕ on [x0, x] to get c1 ∈ (x0, x): ϕ(c1) = 0. Since ϕ(1)(x0) = ϕ(1)(c1) = 0, apply Rolle’s theorem again to get c2 on [x0, c1] with x0 < c2 < c1 < x and ϕ(2)(c2) = 0. Continuing, we ﬁnd that with c1 > c2 > . . . > cn+1 > x0 : ϕ(n+1)(cn+1) = 0 which leads us to c = cn+1 with x0 < c < x implying ϕ(n+1)(c) = 0. 7.15.2 Example cos(x) ≥ 1 − 1 2 x2, ∀x. The Taylor approximation of order 2 at x0 = 0 is p2(x) = 1 − 1 2 x2. So by the remainder theorem (Taylor MV): cos(x) − (1 − 1 2 x2) = cos(3)(c) 3! x3 = sin(c) 6 x3 where c is between 0 and x so that the inequality holds if error ≥ 0. For x ∈ [0, π], c ∈ [0, π], sin(c) ≥ 0, sin(c) 6 x3 ≥ 0. If x ∈ [−π, 0], c ∈ (−π, 0), x < 0 and x3 < 0, sin(c) < 0, and sin(c) 6 x3 ≥ 0. If |x| > π, cos(x) − (1 − 1 2 x2) ≥ −1 − 1 + 1 2 |x| 2 > −2 + 1 2 π2 > 0 7.16 Classiﬁcation of Extrema Suppose f (n) exists, and is continuous in the neighbourhood of x0. Further suppose f ′(x0) = . . . = f (n−1)(x0) = 0 for n ≥ 2 and f (n)(x0) ̸= 0. Then: 1. If n is even, f (n)(x0) > 0, then f has a local minima at x0. 2. If n is even, f (n)(x0) < 0, then f has a local maxima at x0. 3. If n is odd, then f has neither local maxima or local minima at x0. Proof. First case will be considered. The other ones follow using similar argu- ments. Let pn−1 be the Taylor approximation at x0 so that pn−1(x) = f (x0). Then the error is: f (x) − f (x0) = f (n)(c) n! (x − x0) n We have used the fact that the f (k)(c) k! (x−x0) k terms disappear for 1 ≤ k ≤ n−1 due to f ′(x0) = . . . = f (n−1)(x0) = 0. Because f (n) is continuous at x0, we can choose a neighbourhood of x0 for which f (n)(x) > 0, x ∈ (x0 − δ, x + δ). Since c is between x and x0 then f (n)(c) > 0. Thus, f (x) = f (x0) + f (n)(c) n! (x − x0) n Because f (n)(c) n! > 0 and (x − x0) n > 0 (as x ̸= x0) implies f (x) > f (x0) we have a local minima. 55 8 Riemann Integration 8.1 Introduction Basic idea for Riemann integration is to ﬁrst deﬁne lower and upper sums of partitioned intervals over the domain or restriction. We deﬁne rectangles that are the width of the interval, sprouting from the x axis and let the area of a rect- angle reaching the supremum and inﬁmum (respectively) represent the height of those rectangles and sum across the intervals. By reducing the width of the partitioned rectangles into arbitrarily small values, we compare the upper and lower sums. If the sums are equal, we say the function is Riemann integrable. Deﬁnition: A partition(P ) of [a, b] is a set {x0, . . . , xn} with a = x0 < x1 < . . . < xn = b Corresponding to P , we deﬁne the lower sum: s(f, P ) := n∑ j=1( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) where inf (xj−1,xj ) f := inf x∈(xj−1,xj ) f (x) We are ignoring the end points because we can. The ﬁnite number of end- points will have an area of 0 eﬀectively, as they can be arbitrarily bounded by any ϵ > 0. Now deﬁne the upper sum: S(f, P ) := n∑ j=1( sup (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) Deﬁne Q to be a “reﬁnement” of P if P ⊂ Q. Sometimes this is denoted P ≤ Q. 8.1.1 Lemma 21 If Q is a reﬁnement of P then: s(f, P ) ≤ s(f, Q) ≤ S(f, Q) ≤ S(f, P ) Proof. Suppose Q is obtained from P by adding one point, say x∗, where P = {x0, . . . , xn} and xk−1 < x ∗ < xk. 56 Then, s(f, P ) = ∑ j̸=k( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) + ( inf (xk−1,xk) f )(xk − xk−1) = ∑ j̸=k( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) + ( inf (xk−1,xk) f )((xk − x∗) + (x∗ − xk−1)) ≤ ∑ j̸=k( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) + ( inf (xk−1,x∗) f )(x∗ − xk−1) + ( inf (x∗,xk) f )(xk − x∗) = s(f, Q) ≤ S(f, Q) [since ( inf (xj−1,xj ) f ) ≤ ( sup (xj−1,xj ) f )] ≤ S(f, P ) (by similar argument) In general, we can obtain Q from P by adding one point at a time. P = P1 ⊂ P2 ⊂ . . . ⊂ Pn = Q where Pj is obtained from Pj−1 by adding one point. Therefore, s(f, P ) = s(f, P1) ≤ s(f, P2) ≤ . . . ≤ s(f, Q) and s(f, Q) ≤ S(f, Q) = S(f, Pn) ≤ S(f, Pn−1) ≤ . . . ≤ S(f, P1) = S(f, P ) Deﬁnition: The “common reﬁnement” of partitions P, P ′ is P, P ′ ⊂ P ∪P ′ = Q. 8.1.2 Corollary If P, P ′ are partitions, then s(f, P ) ≤ S(f, P ′). Proof. Let Q = P ∪ P ′ be the common partition. s(f, P ) ≤ s(f, Q) ≤ S(f, Q) ≤ S(f, P ′) 8.1.3 Examples s(f, P ) ≤ S(f, {a, b}) and S(f, P ) ≤ S(f, {a, b}). 8.1.4 Lower and Upper Integrals NB: P is any partition so that sup and inf are taken over all partitions. Lower Integral ∫ b a f = sup P a partition s(f, P ) 57 Upper Integral ∫ b a f = inf P S(f, P ) Since s(f, P ) ≤ S(f, P ) ∀P, P ′, sup P s(f, P ) = ∫ b a f ≤ S(f, P ′) =⇒ ∫ b a f ≤ inf P S(f, P ′) = ∫ b a f 8.1.5 Example The upper and lower sums are not necessarily the same so the Riemann inte- gration condition cannot solely depend on one. Suppose it did. Then consider f =: [0, 1] → {0, 1} and f (x) = { 1 x ∈ Q 0 x /∈ Q s(f, P ) = ∑ j ( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj − xj−1) = ∑ j 0(xj − xj−1) = 0 Similarly, S(f, P ) = ∑ j sup f (xj − xj−1) = ∑ 1(xj − xj−1) = 1 Thus, ∫ 1 0 f = 0, and ∫ 1 0 f = 1, a contradiction. 8.2 Riemann Integrable We say f is Riemann integrable if ∫ b a f = ∫ b a f and the Riemann integral is ∫ b a f = ∫ b a f (x)dx = ∫ b a f = ∫ b a f 58 8.3 Riemann Condition f is Riemann integrable ⇐⇒ ∀ϵ > 0, ∃Pϵ partition (where P depends on ϵ): S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) < ϵ Proof. “⇒”: Suppose f is Riemann integrable. Let ϵ > 0. Choose partitions P1, P2, and Q = P1 ∪ P2 be the common reﬁnement such that: S(f, Q) − ∫ b a f ≤ S(f, P1) − ∫ b a f < ϵ 2 ∫ b a f − s(f, Q) ≤ ∫ b a f − s(f, P2) < ϵ 2 Then S(f, Q) ≤ S(f, P1) Similarly, −s(f, Q) ≤ −s(f, P2). =⇒ S(f, Q) − s(f, Q) = S(f, Q) − ∫ b a f + ∫ b a f − s(f, Q) < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ “⇐”: Suppose Cauchy condition holds. ∀ϵ > 0, ∃Pϵ: S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) < ϵ Let Q be a reﬁnement of P , then S(f, Q) ≤ S(f, P ) < s(f, P ) + ϵ Take the inﬁmum over Q. Then, ∫ b a f ≤ inf Q S(f, P ) ≤ s(f, P ) + ϵ Take another reﬁnement Q, then s(f, Q) ≥ s(f, P ) ≥ ∫ b a f − ϵ so that ∫ b a f ≥ sup Q s(f, P ) ≥ ∫ b a f − ϵ This means 0 ≤ ∫ b a f − ∫ b a f ≤ ϵ Since ϵ is arbitrary, we must have ∫ b a f − ∫ b a f = 0 therefore, it is Riemann integrable. 59 8.4 Theorem 18 Let f, g be Riemann Integrable and c ∈ R. Then: (I): cf is R-integrable and ∫ b a cf = c ∫ b a f (II): f + g is R-integrable and ∫ b a (f + g) = ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g (III): If f ≥ 0 then ∫ b a f ≥ 0 (IV): If f ≤ g then ∫ b a f ≤ ∫ b a g (monotonicity) (V): |f | is R-integrable and \f \f \f \f \f ∫ b a f \f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∫ b a |f | (VI): f 2 is R-integrable. (VII): f g is R-integrable. (I): Proof. Suppose c ≥ 0 (if c = 0, then ∫ cf = ∫ 0 = 0 = 0 ∫ f ). S(cf, P ) = n∑ j=1( sup (xj−1,xj ) cf )(xj −xj−1) = c n∑ j=1( sup (xj−1,xj ) f )(xj −xj−1) = cS(f, P ) So, ∫ b a f = inf P S(cf, P ) = inf P cS(f, P ) = c inf P S(f, P ) = c∫ b a f Then the argument proceeds similarly. Since f is Riemann integrable, ∫ b a cf = c ∫ b a f = c ∫ b a f = ∫ b a cf Therefore ∫ b a cf = c ∫ b a f Now consider when c < 0. Since inf = − sup S(cf, P ) = s(cf, P ) So by argument above, s(cf, P ) = cs(f, P ) and similarly for the other case. 60 (II): Proof. S(f +g, P ) ≤ S(f, P )+S(g, P ). Similarly, s(f, P )+s(g, P ) ≤ s(f +g, P ). In particular, S(f + g, P ) − s(f + g, P ) ≤ S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) + S(g, P ) − s(g, P ) Since f and g are Riemann integrable, for ϵ > 0, ∃P1, P2 S(f, P1) − s(f, P1) < ϵ 2 and S(g, P2) − s(g, P2) < ϵ 2 Let Q = P1 ∪ P2. S(f + g, Q) − s(f + g, Q) ≤ S(f, Q) − s(f, Q) + S(g, Q) − s(g, Q) ≤ S(f, P1) − s(f, P1) + S(g, P2) − s(g, P2) < ϵ 2 + ϵ 2 = ϵ Therefore f + g is Riemann integrable via the Cauchy criterion. For second part of proof, let ϵ > 0. Since f, g is Riemann integrable, there exists a common partition P with S(f, P ) − ∫ b a f < ϵ 2 and S(g, P ) − ∫ b a g < ϵ 2 so that S(f + g, P ) − ( ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) ≤ S(f, P ) + S(g, P ) − ( ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) < ϵ Let Q be a reﬁnement of P. S(f + g, Q) ≤ S(f + g, P ) ≤ ϵ + (∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) Take the inﬁmum over Q, then ∫ b a (f + g) ≤ ϵ + (∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) By similar argument, ( ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) − ϵ ≤ ∫ b a (f + g) Putting the two sides together, and using the fact that f + g is Riemann inte- grable, ( ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) − ϵ ≤ ∫ b a (f + g) = ∫ b a (f + g) ≤ ( ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g) + ϵ Since ϵ is arbitrary, it must be that ∫ b a (f + g) = ∫ b a f + ∫ b a g 61 III: Proof. f ≥ 0 =⇒ S(f, P ) ≥ 0. (Converse is not true.) Thus, ∫ b a f = inf P S(f, P ) ≥ 0 IV: Proof. f ≤ g =⇒ ∫ b a f ≤ ∫ b a g f ≤ g =⇒ g − f ≥ 0 as g − f is Riemann integrable by I,II. ∫ b a (g − f ) = ∫ b a g − ∫ b a f by III =⇒ ∫ b a f ≤ ∫ b a g Before proving V, we ﬁrst need a lemma. 8.4.1 Lemma 22 If f : A → R and f bounded, then sup A |f | − inf B |f | ≤ sup A f − inf A f Proof. Let a, b ∈ A. Consider |f (a) − f (b)| = f (a) − f (b) or f (b) − f (b). By the reverse triangle inequality, |f (a)| − |f (b)| ≤ |f (a) − f (b)| ≤ sup{f (a) − f (b) : a, b ∈ A} ≤ sup a∈A f (a) + sup b∈A(−f (b)) = sup A f − inf A f Furthermore, |f (a)| ≤ |f (b)| + sup A f − inf A f =⇒ sup A |f | ≤ |f (b)| + sup A f − inf A f and |f (b)| ≥ sup A |f | − sup A f + inf A f =⇒ inf A |f | ≥ sup A |f | − sup A f + inf A f Rearranging, sup A |f | − inf A |f | ≤ sup A f − inf A f 62 V: Proof. By lemma 22 above, sup (xj−1,xj ) |f | − inf (xj−1,xj ) |f | ≤ sup (xj−1,xj ) f − inf (xj−1,xj ) f =⇒ S(|f |, P ) − s(|f |, P ) ≤ S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) By the Cauchy criterion, ∃P : S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) < ϵ hence |f | is Riemann in- tegrable. Further note that −|f | ≤ f ≤ |f |. Since |f |, −|f |, f are Riemann integrable, by IV, we get − ∫ b a |f | = ∫ b a −|f | ≤ ∫ b a f ≤ ∫ b a |f | Therefore \f \f \f \f \f ∫ b a f \f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∫ b a |f | (since ∫ b a |f | ≥ 0) as required. VI: Proof. Observe (|f | 2) = f 2. WLOG, assume f ≥ 0. S(f 2, P ) − s(f 2, P ) = n∑ j=1[( sup (xj−1,xj ) f 2 − inf (xj−1,xj ) f 2)(xj − xj−1)] = n∑ j=1[(( sup (xj−1,xj ) f ) 2 − ( inf (xj−1,xj ) f )2)(xj − xj−1)] = n∑ j=1[(sup f − inf f )(sup f + inf f )(xj − xj−1)] Since −M ≤ f ≤ M =⇒ inf f ≤ sup f ≤ M =⇒ inf f + sup f ≤ 2M , n∑ j=1[(sup f − inf f )(sup f + inf f )(xj − xj−1)] ≤ 2M (S(f, P ) − s(f, P )) Let ϵ > 0. Since f is Riemann integrable, choose P : S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) < ϵ 2M giving us S(f 2, P ) − s(f 2, P ) < 2M · ϵ 2M = ϵ Therefore f 2 is Riemann integrable. VII: Proof. Observe f g = ((f + g)2 − (f − g) 2) (polarisation). By I,II,VI, we have that f g is Riemann integrable. 63 8.5 Lemma 23 If f is monotone, f is Riemann integrable. Proof provided in Warren’s notes, and is also a tutorial question. 8.6 Lemma 24 Let f : [a, b] → R be continuous, then f is Riemann integrable. Proof. Since f is continuous, it is uniformly continuous. ∀ϵ > 0 ∃δ ∀|x − y| < δ |f (x) − f (y)| < ϵ b − a Let P be a partition with the largest subinterval of length less than δ. Then sup (xj−1,xj ) f − inf (xj−1,xj ) f < ϵ b − a This implies S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) ≤ n∑ j=1( ϵ b − a )(xj − xj−1) = ϵ Hence by the Cauchy criterion, f is Riemann integrable. 8.7 Theorem 19 Let a < c < b. Then f is Riemann integrable on [a,b] ⇐⇒ f is Riemann integrable on [a, b] and [c, b] in which case ∫ b a f = ∫ c a f + ∫ b c f Proof. Deﬁne χ[a,c](x) = {1 x ∈ [a, c] 0 otherwise to be the characteristic function for [a, c]. Let P be a partition of [a, b] which contains c. S(f · χ[a,c], P ) = S(f · χ[a,c], P ∩ [a, c]) Taking the inﬁmum over P , ∫ b a f · χ[a,c] = ∫ c a f · χ[a,c] = ∫ c a f Similarly, for lower integral. Case: “⇒”: WLOG consider [a, c]. Suppose f is Riemann integrable over [a, b]. Since P is a partition of [a, b] containing c, S(χ[a,c], P ) =   xn∑ j=1 1(xj − xj−1)   = c − a where xk = c. 64 Then f · χ[a,b] and χ[a,c] are Riemann integrable by VII. ie. f is Riemann integrable over [a, c] and [c, b]. Then ∫ c a f = ∫ b a f · χ[a,c] = ∫ b a f χ[a,c] = ∫ c a f Case: “⇐”: Suppose f is Riemann integrable over [a, c] and [c, b]. ie. f ·χ[a,c] and f ·χ[c,b] are integrable over [a, b]. Since f = f ·χ[a,c] +f ·χ(c,b], f is integrable by II. Finally in both cases the linearity of the integral gives ∫ b a f = ∫ b a (f · χ[a,c] + f · χ(c,b]) = ∫ b a χ[a,c] · f + ∫ b a χ(c,b]f = ∫ c a f + ∫ b c f 8.8 First Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC 1) If f : [a, b] → R is Riemann integrable, and let F : [a, b] → R such that F (x) := ∫ x a f Then, 1. F is continuous (assignment question) 2. If f is continuous at x, then F is diﬀerentiable at x with F ′(x) = f (x). 8.8.1 Deﬁnition Let ∫ a a f := 0 , ∫ a b f = − ∫ b a f with this we have the proposition: ∫ b a f = ∫ c a f + ∫ b c f ∀a, b, c ∈ R Now we can prove the FTC. Proof. Let x, y ∈ [a, b], x ̸= y. Since ∫ y a f − ∫ x a f = ∫ y a f + ∫ a x f = ∫ y x f and that as y draws near x, f (y) draws near f (x), we can infer F (y) − F (x) y − x = 1 y − x ( ∫ y a f − ∫ x a f ) = 1 y − x ∫ y x f As f is continuous at x, ∀ϵ > 0, ∃δ > 0 ∀t : |x − t| < δ f (x) − ϵ < f (t) < f (x) + ϵ 65 If |y − x| < δ, then for all t in the interval with endpoints x, y f (x) − ϵ < f (t) < f (x) + ϵ So integrating over the interval with endpoints x, y ∫ y x (f (x) − ϵ) ≤ ∫ y x f ≤ ∫ y x (f (x) + ϵ) If x < y then (y − x)(f (x) − ϵ) ≤ ∫ y x f ≤ (y − x)(f (x) + ϵ) Divide by y − x and we get f (x) − ϵ ≤ 1 y − x ∫ y x f ≤ f (x) + ϵ Therefore lim y→x F (y) − F (x) y − x = f (x) If x > y then a similar argument follows for the left hand limit. 8.9 Second Fundamental Theorem of Calculus (FTC 2) Suppose f : [a, b] → R is diﬀerentiable on [a, b] and suppose f ′ is Riemann integrable. Then f (b) − f (a) = ∫ b a f ′ Proof. Let P be a partition of [a, b]. f (b) − f (a) = n∑ j=1(f (xj) − f (xj−1)) Since f is diﬀerentiable, then by the mean value theorem, f (xj) − f (xj−1) = f ′(x∗ j )(xj − xj−1) for some x∗ j ∈ (xj−1, xj) So f (b) − f (a) = n∑ j=1 f ′(x∗ j )(xj − xj−1) Now inf (xj−1,xj ) f ′ ≤ f ′(x∗ j ) ≤ sup (xj−1,xj ) f ′ 66 and multiply by (xj − xj−1) and sum over j to get s(f ′, P ) = n∑ j=1( inf (xj−1,xj ) f ′)(xj − xj−1) ≤ n∑ j=1 f ′(x∗ j )(xj − xj−1) = f (b) − f (a) ≤ n∑ j=1( sup (xj−1,xj ) f ′)(xj − xj−1) = S(f ′, P ) ∫ b a f ′ ≤ f (b) − f (a) ≤ ∫ b a f ′ Since f ′ is Riemann integrable, ∫ b a f ′ = ∫ b a f ′ Therefore, f (b) − f (a) = ∫ b a f ′ 8.10 Substitution Rule Suppose f : [a, b] → R is continuous. Suppose also that ϕ : [α, β] → R with ϕ diﬀerentiable and ϕ′ continuous, and ϕ([α, β]) = [a, b]. Then ∫ β α f (ϕ(t))ϕ′(t)dt = ∫ ϕ(β) ϕ(α) f (x)dx Proof. Let F : [a, b] → R and F (u) := ∫ u ϕ(α) f (x)dx By FTC 1, since f is continuous on [a, b] and F is diﬀerentiable on [a, b] we have F ′(u) = f (u) ∀u ∈ [a, b]. Then by FTC 2, ∫ ϕ(β) ϕ(α) f (x)dx = ∫ ϕ(β) ϕ(α) F ′(x)dx = F (ϕ(β)) − F (ϕ(α)) By FTC 1 again, F (ϕ(β)) − F (ϕ(α)) = ∫ β α (F ◦ ϕ) ′ Since F is diﬀerentiable and ϕ is diﬀerentiable, then by the chain rule (F ◦ ϕ)′ = F ′(ϕ) · ϕ′ hence ∫ β α (F ◦ ϕ) ′ = ∫ β α f (ϕ(t))ϕ′(t)dt 67 9 Pointwise and Uniform Convergence 9.1 Pointwise Deﬁnition: Let A ⊂ R and ∀n ∈ N let fn : A → R be a function. Let f : A → R. Then lim n→∞ fn = f pointwise ⇐⇒ ∀a ∈ A[ lim n→∞ fn(a) = f (a)] 9.1.1 Example A = [0, 1], fn(x) = xn. Then ∀x ∈ [0, 1] lim n→∞ fn(x) = {0 x < 1 1 x = 1 So deﬁne f : A → R f (x) = { 0 x ∈ [0, 1) 1 x = 1 Then lim n→∞ fn = f pointwise 9.1.2 Problems Is it the case that 1. If ∀n, fn is continuous =⇒ f is continuous? 2. If fn diﬀerentiable =⇒ f diﬀerentiable? 3. If fn and f diﬀerentiable, lim n→∞ f ′ n(a) = f ′(a) ? 4. If fn is integrable =⇒ f integrable and lim n→∞ ∫ b a fn = ∫ b a f Unfortunately pointwise convergence is not strong enough for these proper- ties to hold in general. Consider the counter examples in Warren’s notes, as well as these: 1. Let fn : [0, 1] → R be deﬁned by fn(x) := xn. Then we have a family of curves where the gradient curves out from the y = x line more and more as n increases. Let f (x) := {0 x ∈ [0, 1) 1 x = 1 Then lim n→∞ fn = f pointwise 68 but obviously not continuous at x = 1. Another example is to deﬁne a sequence of functions that are 0 everywhere except at 1 2 − 1 n where it linearly ascends towards 1 and reaches it at 1 2 and then descends symmetrically back down to 0 at 1 2 + 1 n . Then the pointwise function is 0 everywhere except at x = 0, then there’s discontinuity as the value is 1. 2. Deﬁne fn : R → R and fn(x) = arctan(nx). Then lim n→∞ f (x) =  | | π 2 x > 0 0 x = 0 −π 2 x < 0 Then fn is diﬀerentiable for all n ∈ N but f is not continuous or diﬀerentiable (in general). 3. f : R → R, fn(x) = 1 n · arctan(nx). Then ∀x ∈ R lim n→∞ fn(x) = 0 so f (x) = 0 ∀x ∈ R. But f ′ n(x) = 1 n · n 1+(nx)2 = 1 1+(nx)2 . Then f ′ n(0) = 1 ̸= 0 = f ′(0) ∀n ∈ N 4. Deﬁne fn : [0, 1] → R so that the function linearly ascends to a peak of 2n before symmetrically falling down to 0 again at 1 n where it remains for the rest of the function. Then lim n→∞ fn = 0 pointwise (except maybe at 0, where it ascends towards inﬁnity) But ∫ 1 0 fn = 1 ∀n ∈ N so lim n→∞ ∫ 1 0 fn = 1 ̸= 0 = ∫ 1 0 f Consider also [0, 1] ∩ Q = {q1, q2, . . .} with qi ̸= qj if i ̸= j. Then it is countable (as Q is countable). For all n ∈ N deﬁne fn : [0, 1] → R with fn = χ{q1,...,qn}. Then fn(x) = {1 x ∈ {q1, . . . , qn} 0 otherwise Deﬁne f = χQ∩[0,1] then lim n→∞ fn = f pointwise Clearly fn is Riemann integrable ∀n ∈ N since it’s a ﬁnite number of disconti- nuities, but f is not Riemann integrable. 69 9.2 Uniform Deﬁnition: lim n→∞ fn = f uniformly ⇐⇒ ∀ϵ > 0 ∃N ∈ N ∀a ∈ A ∀n ≥ N |fn(a) − f (a)| < ϵ where N is allowed to depend on ϵ and not on a. 9.2.1 Example 1 fn : [0, 1] → R , fn(x) = (1 − x)xn. Clearly, ∀x ∈ [0, 1] lim n→∞ fn(x) = 0 It is also clear that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence. Take f : [0, 1] → R f (x) = 0 ∀x ∈ [0, 1]. Claim: limn→∞ fn = f uniformly. fn(x) = xn − xn+1 =⇒ f ′ n(x) = nxn−1 − (n + 1)xn = xn−1(n − (n + 1)x) since fn(0) = fn(1) = 0 and fn ≥ 0 it follows that fn has a maximum at x = n n+1 . ie. maximum is fn( n n+1 ) = 1 n+1 · ( n n+1 )n. Let ϵ > 0 Take N = 1 ϵ . ∀x ∈ [0, 1] and ∀n ≥ N |fn(x) − f (x)| = |fn(x)| ≤ 1 n + 1 · ( n n + 1 ) n < 1 n + 1 < 1 N = ϵ 9.2.2 Lemma 25 Let ∑ an be an absolutely convergent series. Then \f \f \f \f \f ∞∑ n=1 an \f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∞∑ n=1 |an| Proof. Let N ∈ N. Then \f \f \f \f \f N∑ n=1 an \f \f \f \f \f ≤ N∑ n=1 |an| Since x 7→ |x| is continuous \f \f \f \f \f ∞∑ n=1 an \f \f \f \f \f = \f \f \f \f \f lim N →∞ N∑ n=1 an \f \f \f \f \f = lim N →∞ \f \f \f \f \f N∑ n=1 an \f \f \f \f \f ≤ lim N →∞ N∑ n=1 |an| = ∞∑ n=1 |an| 9.2.3 Example 2 Power series. Let c0, c1, . . . ∈ R and consider the power series ∑ cnxn. Let R ∈ [0, ∞] be the convergence radius. Suppose R > 0. Let r > 0, r ∈ R : r < R. For all n ∈ N deﬁne Sn : [−r, r] → R Sn(x) = n∑ k=0 ckxk 70 Further deﬁne S : [−r, r] → R S(x) = ∞∑ k=0 ckxk This is convergent since |x| < R. Clearly limn→∞ Sn = S pointwise. Claim: limn→∞ Sn = S uniformly. Proof. Let ρ ∈ R : r < ρ < R. Then the power series(∑ ckρk) is convergent. Then by N th term test, lim k→∞ ckρk = 0 Therefore (ckρk) is bounded. Then there exists M ∈ R: ∀k ∈ N |ckρk| ≤ M . Let ϵ > 0. Take N = [f ix]. Then for all n ∈ N with n ≥ N and all x ∈ [−r, r] |Sn(x) − S(x)| = \f \f \f \f \f n∑ k=0 ckxk − ∞∑ k=0 ckx k\f \f \f \f \f = \f \f \f \f \f ∞∑ k=n+1 ckxk\f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∞∑ k=n+1 |ckxk| = ∞∑ k=n+1 |ck||x| k ≤ ∞∑ k=n+1 M ( |x| ρ )k ≤ ∞∑ k=N M ( r ρ )k = M ( r ρ )N ( 1 1 − r ρ ) < ϵ For a chosen N large enough. Therefore limn→∞ Sn = S uniformly. 9.3 Theorem 20 If fn is continuous for all n ∈ N and limn→∞ fn = f uniformly then f is continuous. Proof. Let a ∈ A. We shall prove that f is continuous at a. Let ϵ > 0. Since limn→∞ fn = f uniformly, then ∃N : ∀x ∈ A ∀n ≥ N |fn(x) − f (a)| < ϵ 3 . Now choose n = N . fn continuous ⇐⇒ ∃δ > 0: |x−a| < δ =⇒ |fn(x)−fn(a)| < ϵ 3 . Then ∀x ∈ A |x − a| < δ one has |f (x) − f (a)| = |f (x) − fn(x) + fn(x) − fn(a) + fn(a) − f (a)| ≤ |f (x) − fn(x)| + |fn(x) − fn(a)| + |fn(a) − f (a)| < ϵ 3 + ϵ 3 + ϵ 3 = ϵ 9.3.1 Corollary x 7→ ∞∑ k=0 ckxk is continuous on (−R, R) 71 Proof. Let a ∈ (−R, R). Then there exists an r ∈ R: |a| < r < R. Now deﬁne Sn, S : [−r, r] → R as before then S is continuous on [−r, r]. Since a ∈ (−r, r) it follows that x 7→ ∑∞ k=0 ckxk is continuous at a. ie. If f : (−R, R), f (x) = ∑∞ k=0 ckxk then the restriction of f to [−r, r] is continuous at r but f is not necessarily continuous over all (−R, R). 9.3.2 Example If fn : (−1, 1) → R, fn(x) = ∑n k=0 xk , f (x) = 1 1−x . Then limn→∞ fn = f pointwise but not uniformly on (−1, 1). 9.4 Theorem 21 Suppose a < b, fn, f : [a, b] → R. Then ∀n ∈ N: Suppose fn is Riemann integrable and limn→∞ fn = f uniformly. Then f is Riemann integrable and∫ f = lim ∫ fn. ie. ∫ b a lim n→∞ fn = lim n→∞ ∫ b a fn Proof. Let ϵ > 0. Since limn→∞ fn = f uniformly, ∃N ∈ N: ∀x ∈ [a, b] one has |fn(x) − f (x)| < ϵ Since fn is Riemann integrable there exists a partition P of [a, b]: S(fn, P ) − s(fn, P ) < ϵ Let P = {a1, . . . , am}. S(f, P ) = ( m∑ i=1 sup (ai−1,ai) f (x) ) (ai − ai−1) ≤ ( m∑ i=1 sup (ai−1,ai) fn(x) + ϵ ) (ai − ai−1) = S(fn, P ) + m∑ i=1 ϵ(ai − ai−1) = S(fn, P ) + ϵ(b − a) Similarly, s(f, P ) ≥ s(fn, P ) − ϵ(b − a). Hence S(f, P ) − s(f, P ) ≤ S(fn, P ) + ϵ(b − a) − s(fn, P ) + ϵ(b − a) < ϵ + 2ϵ(b − a) = ϵ(1 + 2(b − a)) Since ϵ is arbitrary, eﬀectively we can adjust the inequalities to make it less than any ϵ we choose. Therefore, f is Riemann integrable. Secondly, let ϵ > 0. By uniform convergence, ∃N ∈ N: ∀n ≥ N ∀x ∈ [a, b] |fn(x) − f (x)| < ϵ 72 Then ∀n ≥ N \f \f \f \f ∫ f − ∫ fn \f \f \f \f = \f \f \f \f ∫ (f − fn)\f \f \f \f ≤ ∫ |f − fn| = ∫ b a |f (x) − fn(x)|dx ≤ ∫ b a ϵ dx = ϵ(b − a) Therefore lim n→∞ ∫ fn = ∫ f 9.4.1 Example Let 0 < r < 1. Sn, S : [0, r] → R, Sn(x) = ∑n k=0(−1)kx2k. S(x) = ∑∞ k=0(−1) kx2k. Recall that ∞∑ k=0 xk = 1 1 − x , (radius 1) =⇒ ∞∑ k=0 (−x2) k = 1 1 + x2 , (radius 1) where “radius” refers to the convergence radius. Then limn→∞ Sn = S uni- formly. ∫ r 0 1 1 + x2 dx = arctan(r) = ∫ r 0 S(x)dx = lim n→∞ ∫ r 0 Sn(x)dx = lim n→∞ ∫ r 0 n∑ k=0 (−1)kx2kdx = lim n→∞ n∑ k=0 (−1)k 1 2k + 1 r2k+1 = ∞∑ k=0 (−1)k 2k + 1 r2k+1 Similarly for [−r, 0]. 9.5 Theorem 22 Suppose f1, f2, . . . : [a, b] → R are diﬀerentiable(and hence fn are continuous). Let f : [a, b] → R. Suppose limn→∞ fn(x) = f (x) for all x ∈ [a, b] (ie. point- wise). Suppose also that ϕ : [a, b] → R and limn→∞ f ′ n = ϕ uniformly. Then f is diﬀerentiable and f ′(x) = ϕ(x) ∀x ∈ [a, b]. ie. ( lim n→∞ fn) ′ = lim n→∞(f ′ n) Proof. For all x ∈ [a, b] one has ∀n ∈ N fn(x) − fn(a) = ∫ x a f ′ n Take limn→∞ then fn(x) → f (x), and fn(a) → f (a). So that by FTC 2, f (x) − f (a) = ∫ x a ϕ 73 f ′ n is continuous ∀n so ϕ is continuous by theorem 20. Since x → ∫ x a ϕ is diﬀerentiable(by FTC 1), the derivative is ϕ(FTC 2). So ϕ = (f − f (a)) ′ and thus f is diﬀerentiable and ϕ(x) = f ′(x) ∀x ∈ [a, b]. 74","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
