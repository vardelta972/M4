The diﬃculty will gradually increase over the course of the year, building up to problems comparable to those you will be asked to solve in the September problems for selection to the Christchurch camp in January. I welcome you to try them, and to send me any solutions you ﬁnd. I’ll try to acknowledge these, and might include (with credit!) any particularly clever or nice solutions from you in the “oﬃcial solutions”. These will appear on the web in about two months time, or can be obtained from me by email earlier if you provide evidence that you’ve tried the problems seriously.

Call a number mystical if it is possible to begin with the sum of its digits, and then by a sequence of operations where we replace n = a+b, by m = a×b (where a and b are positive integers) eventually obtain the number again. For example, 35 is mystical because, starting from 8 = 3 + 5 we can write 8 = 6 + 2, getting 12 = 6 × 2, and then 12 = 7 + 5 getting 35 = 7 × 5. Is 2009 mystical? 2. There are ﬁve paper triangles on a table – each is equilateral of side length 10 cm. Show that, no matter how they are oriented, it is possible to cover any one of them up using the other four, simply by sliding them (i.e. without any rotation). Does this remain true if the triangles are all congruent, but not necessarily equilateral? 3. A 20 kg block of cheese was on display at the local A and P show. Towards the end of the day, they started selling oﬀ bits of it. After each of the ﬁrst ten customers bought a chunk the exhibitor announced “if everyone buys an amount equal to the average amount sold to each customer so far, there’s just enough left for 10 more pieces”. Could that announcement be correct (in all ten cases)? If so, how much cheese was left after the ﬁrst 10 purchases? 4. Can the product of two consecutive positive integers equal the product of two consecutive even positive integers? April 6, 2009 http://www.mathsolympiad.org.nz","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
