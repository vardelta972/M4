Find all functions f from the set of non-zero real numbers to itself satisfying f (x) + f (y) = f (xyf (x + y)) for all x, y ̸= 0 with x + y ̸= 0. 2. Consider the sequence (an)n≥1 of real numbers where a1 ∈ (1, 2) and an+1 = an + n an for all n ≥ 1. Prove that there is at most one pair of terms in this sequence with integer sum. 3. For a positive integer n ≥ 5, let ai, bi (i = 1, 2, . . . , n) be integers satisfying the following two conditions: • The pairs (ai, bi) are distinct for i = 1, 2, . . . , n; • |a1b2 − a2b1| = |a2b3 − a3b2| = . . . = |anb1 − a1bn| = 1. Prove that there exist indices i, j such that 1 < |i − j| < n − 1 and |aibj − ajb1| = 1. 2 Combinatorics 1. One or more powers of 2 are written on each of n sheets of paper. The sum of the numbers on each sheet are the same. If each number appears at most 5 times among the n sheets, what is the largest possible value for n? 2. The numbers 1 and -1 are written in the cells of a 2000 × 2000 grid. If the sum of the entries in the grid is positive, show that one can select 1000 rows and 1000 columns such that the sum of the numbers written in cells of their intersections is at least 1000. 3. In a country, every pair of cities is either joined by a two-way road or not joined by any road. The country has the property that for any pair of cities there is a sequence of roads one can take to get from the ﬁrst city to the second city. However, if any sequence of an odd number of distinct roads beginning and ending at the same city is closed down, the country no longer has this property. Prove that the cities in the country can be partitioned into 4 districts such that there is no road between two cities in the same district. 1 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions 3 Geometry 1. ABC is an isosceles triangle with AC = BC. Let O be its circumcenter, let I be its incenter, and let D be the point on BC such that lines OD and BI are perpendicular. Prove that lines ID and AC are parallel. 2. Consider the parallelogram ABCD with obtuse angle A. Let H be the foot of the perpen- dicular from A to the side BC. The median from C in triangle ABC meets the circumcircle of triangle ABC at the point K. Prove that points K, H, C, D lie on the same circle. 3. Let M be the midpoint of the internal bisector AD of △ABC. Circle ω1 with diameter AC intersects segment BM at E and circle ω2 with diameter AB intersects segment CM at F . Show that B, E, F, C lie on a circle. 4 Number Theory 1. A perfect number greater than 28 is divisible by 7. Prove that it is also divisible by 49. (Note: A number n is “perfect” if the sum of the divisors of n is equal to 2n. For example, 28 is perfect since 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 + 28 = 2 · 28.) 2. Find (with proof) all monic polynomials P (x) with integer coeﬃcients that satisfy the fol- lowing two conditions. (a) P (0) = 2014. (b) If x is irrational, then P (x) is also irrational. Note: A polynomial is monic if its highest degree term has coeﬃcient 1. 3. Let an be the leftmost digit of 2n and let bn be the leftmost digit of 5n. Prove that the reverse of any k consecutive terms in the sequence an appears as k consecutive terms in the sequence bn. 2 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions 5 Algebra Solutions 1. Suppose f (z) ̸= 1 z for some z ̸= 0. Let x = 1 f (z) and y = z − x. Clearly x ̸= 0; we also know y ̸= 0 since we assumed f (z) ̸= 1 z , and we know x + y = z ̸= 0. Therefore, f (x) + f (y) = f (xyf (x + y)) =⇒ f ( 1 f (z) ) + f (z − x) = f ( 1 f (z) · (z − x) · f (z) ) =⇒ f ( 1 f (z) ) = 0, which is a contradiction. It follows that f (x) = 1 x is the only possible solution. Checking, we see it does indeed satisfy the conditions of the problem. (Nordic 2003) 2. Suppose an > n for some n. Then an+1 = an + n an = (an − n)(an − 1) an + n + 1 > n + 1. It is given that an > n for n = 1, so it follows from induction that an > n for all n. Therefore, an+1 = an + n an < an + 1. Deﬁne bn = an − n. We have just shown that the sequence (bn) is always positive and decreasing. Furthermore, ai + aj is an integer if and only if bi + bj is an integer, so it suﬃces to prove there exists at most pair (i, j) such that bi + bj is an integer. Now, a2 = a2 1+1 a1 = (a1−2)(a1−0.5) a1 + 2.5 < 2.5, so b2 < 0.5. Therefore, if i, j > 1, we have bi + bj > 0 and bi + bj ≤ 2b2 < 1, so bi + bj cannot possibly be an integer. It remains to consider b1 + bi. In this case, we know b1 + bi > 0 and b1 + bi ≤ 2b1 < 2, so this is an integer if and only if bi = 1 − b1. However, (bn) is decreasing, so there is at most one i with this property. (Russia 2009) 3. Throughout this write-up, indices will always be taken mod n. Deﬁne Pi to be the 2-dimensional vector (ai, bi). Let |Pi| denote the length of Pi and let Ki,j denote the area of the triangle with sides Pi and Pj. Recall that Ki,j = 1 2 · |aibj − ajbi|. Thus, we are given Ki,i+1 = 1 2 for all i and we need to show Ki,j = 1 2 for some i, j with |j − i| ̸= 1. First suppose Pi and Pj lie on the same line for some i, j. Assume without loss of generality that |Pi| ≤ |Pj|. Then, using the base times height formula for the area of a triangle, we have Ki,j+1 = Kj,j+1 · |Pi| |Pj | . This quantity is positive so it is at least 1 2 . (Recall that the formula for Ki,j is an integer multiple of 1 2 ). Furthermore, it is at most Kj,j+1 = 1 2 , so in fact Ki,j+1 = 1 2 , and similarly Ki,j−1 = 1 2 . Since n ≥ 5, we cannot have j adjacent to both i + 1 and i − 1. Therefore, one of Ki,j−1 or Ki,j+1 solves the problem. Otherwise, let i be such that |Pi| is maximal. Since Pi−1 and Pi are not collinear, we can express Pi+1 as a linear combination of the vectors Pi−1 and Pi: Pi+1 = uPi−1 + vPi for some 3 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions real numbers u, v. Using the base times height formula for the area of a triangle again, we have 1 2 = Ki,i+1 = |u| · Ki−1,i = |u| 2 , which implies u = ±1. Now, gcd(ai, bi) = 1 or else |aibi+1 −ai+1bi| could not possibly be 1. Since vPi = −Pi+1 ±Pi−1 has integer coordinates, it then follows that v must also be an integer. If v = 0, then Pi−1 and Pi+1 are collinear, which we already covered. If |v| ≥ 2, then |Pi+1| = |uPi−1 + vPi| ≥ |v| · |Pi| − |u| · |Pi−1| ≥ |Pi|. Equality holds only if Pi−1, Pi are collinear, which is impossible. Thus, |Pi+1| > |Pi| in this case, and that contradicts the choice of i. The only remaining possibility is v = ±1, but then Ki−1,i+1 = |v| · Ki−1,i = 1 2 and the problem is solved. (Korea 2001) 6 Combinatorics Solutions 1. Suppose that we have n sheets with the same sum S. There exists k such that 2k ≤ S < 2k+1. The sum of all numbers must then be at least n · 2k. On the other hand, we cannot have any power of 2 larger than 2k or the sum on that sheet would be too large. Since each number appears at most 5 times, the sum of all numbers must be at most 5 · (1 + 2 + . . . + 2k) < 10 · 2k. Therefore, n · 2k < 10 · 2k and hence n < 10. Conversely, if n = 9, we can use the following arrangement: (a) 2 sheets containing 1, 1, 2, 4. (b) 1 sheet containing 2, 2, 4. (c) 1 sheet containing 4, 4. (d) 5 sheets containing 8. Therefore, the maximum value of n is 9. (St. Petersburg 1998) 2. Lemma: The numbers 1 and -1 are written in the cells of a grid with n rows and m columns. Let S denote the sum of the entries in the grid. If m is odd, it is possible to delete one row and end up with sum at least min(S + 1, n − 1). If m is even, it is possible to delete one row and end up with sum at least min(S, n − 1). Proof: If every row has positive sum, then we can drop an arbitrary row, and there will remain n − 1 rows, each with sum at least 1, and the claim is proven. Otherwise, there exists some row with non-positive sum. If m is odd, then this row actually has sum at most -1, and therefore if we drop it, the remaining sum will be at least S + 1. If m is even, then we still know this row has sum at most 0, and therefore if we drop it, the remaining sum will be at least S. This covers all cases, and the lemma is proven. Note that the same argument can be applied to removing columns as well. Now we use the lemma repeatedly to solve the problem: • We start with a 2000 × 2000 grid with S ≥ 1. • By the lemma, we can delete 1 column to get a 2000 × 1999 subgrid with S ≥ 1. • By the lemma, we can delete 1000 rows to get a 1000 × 1999 subgrid with S ≥ 1000. • By the lemma, we can delete 999 columns to get a 1000 × 1000 subgrid with S ≥ 1000, completing the proof. 4 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions (Russia 1995) Comment: Can you solve the problem if 2000 × 2000 is replaced with 1500 × 1500? The same approach works. 3. Let G be the graph with vertices corresponding to cities and with edges corresponding to roads between cities. In graph theoretic terms, we are given that G is connected (there is sequence of edges joining any two vertices) and that removing any odd cycle will disconnect G. We need to show it is 4-colourable (the vertices can be assigned colours 0, 1, 2, 3 such that no two vertices with the same colour have an edge between them). Suppose we remove edges from G one by one without disconnecting it, stopping only when it is impossible to remove any more edges. Let G1 be the subgraph of G containing only the edges we removed, and let G2 be the subgraph of G containing only the edges we did not remove. Since we can remove all of the edges in G1 without disconnecting the graph, the problem conditions guarantee that G1 has no odd cycles. Furthermore, G2 has no cycles at all. If it did have a cycle, we could remove one of the edges in the cycle without disconnecting the graph, which contradicts the deﬁnition of G2. We will now use the following very useful theorem from graph theory: if a graph has no odd cycles, then it is 2-colourable.1 It follows that G1 and G2 are both 2-colourable. In particular, there are functions f1, f2 mapping cities to {0, 1} such that f1(u) = f1(v) only if there is no edge between u and v in G1, and f2(u) = f2(v) only if there is no edge between u and v in G2. Let f (v) = 2 · f1(v) + f2(v). This assigns every vertex a colour in {0, 1, 2, 3}, and if f (u) = f (v), then f1(u) = f1(v) and f2(u) = f2(v), which means u and v are not connected by an edge in either G1 or G2. It follows that f is a valid 4-colouring of G, and the problem is solved. (Russia 2010) 7 Geometry Solutions 1. Since ABC is isosceles, I and O both lie on the perpendicular bisector of AB. Therefore, 1You can prove this as follows. First assume the graph is connected. If it is not, we can apply the proof independently to each connected component. Pick an arbitrary vertex u and colour it 0. Now, consider another vertex v. If there is both an even-length path from u to v and an odd length path from u to v, we could combine them to get an odd-length cycle. Therefore, we have either that all paths from u to v are even length, or all paths are odd length. In the former case, we colour v with 0; in the latter case, we colour it with 1. Do you see why this is a valid 2-colouring? 5 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions ∠DOI = 90◦ − ∠BIO = ∠ABI = ∠DBI, from which it follows that DBOI is a cyclic quadrilateral. This means ∠BDI = 180◦ − ∠BOI = 180◦ − ∠BOC = 2∠BCI = ∠BCA, and hence ID and AC are parallel. (Russia 1996) 2. Let M be the midpoint of AB and let E be the point such that AHBE is a rectangle. Note that, since AHBE is a rectangle, H, M, E are collinear. Now, ∠DEH = ∠AEH = ∠ABH = ∠ABC = 180◦ − ∠DCB = 180◦ − ∠DCH, so DCHE is cyclic. Consider the circumcircles of DCHE, AHBE, and ABC. The radical axis of DCHE and AHBE is HE, and the radical axis of ABC and AHBE is AB, so the radical center of the three circles is M . In particular, M is on the radical axis of DCHE and ABC. Since C is also on the radical axis, we know the radical axis is equal to line CM , and so K is also on the radical axis. Since K is on circle ABC, it follows that K is also on circle DCHE, and the problem is solved. (Russia 2012) 3. Let C′ be the point on line AB such that C′C is parallel to AD, and let P be the midpoint of C′C. The homothety about B that takes AD to C′C also takes M to P . This implies that P lies on line BEM . 6 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions Now, ∠CC′A = ∠DAB = ∠DAC = ∠C′CA, so AC = AC′. Since P is the midpoint of C′C, we conclude that ∠AP C = 90◦ and hence P lies on ω1. Since C′C||AD, this also implies ∠P AD = 90◦ Using the above facts, we have ∠BEC = 180◦ − ∠P EC = 180◦ − ∠P AC = 90◦ + ∠DAC = 90◦ + ∠BAC 2 . The same argument applies to ∠BF C, so we have shown ∠BEC = ∠BF C, and the problem is solved. (Ukraine 2013) 8 Number Theory Solutions 1. Let n be a perfect number divisible by 7 but not 49. Then we can prime factorize n as 2k · 7 · ∏ pei i for some (possibly empty) set of primes pi and some non-negative integer k. Recall2 that the sum of the divisors of n is then given by (2k+1 − 1) · 8 · ∏ ( pei+1 i −1 pi−1 ). Since n is perfect, we have (2 k+1 − 1) · 8 · ∏ ( p ei+1 i − 1 pi − 1 ) = 2 · 2 k · 7 · ∏ pei i The right-hand side must be a multiple of 8, so k ≥ 2. Then 8 7 ≥ 2k+1 2k+1−1 , which implies (2k+1 − 1) · 8 ≥ 2 · 2k · 7. Furthermore pei+1 i −1 pi−1 > p ei i for all i. This means that if k ≥ 2, (2 k+1 − 1) · 8 · ∏ ( p ei+1 i − 1 pi − 1 ) ≥ 2 · 2 k · 7 · ∏ pei i with equality only if k = 2 and there are no primes pi. However, this occurs only when n = 28, so the problem is solved. (Russia 2000) 2. Clearly P (x) = x + 2014 satisﬁes the two conditions. We now show that is the only solution. Suppose by way of contradiction that we have a polynomial P (x) = xd + ad−1xd−1 + . . . + a1x + 2014 that satisﬁes the two conditions and has degree d ≥ 2. Let M = max(|a1|, |a2|, . . . , |ad−1|), and let p be a prime such that p > max(P (1), M d). Since P (1) < p and P (x) > p + 2014 for large x, there must exist some x > 1 such that P (x) = p + 2014. We know this x must be rational, or else we would have found x such that x is irrational and P (x) is rational. Thus, we have shown there is a rational number x that satisﬁes the following: xd + ad−1xd−1 + . . . + a1x − p = 0. By the rational root theorem, it must be that x ∈ {−p, −1, 1, p}. Since we know x > 1, it follows that x = p, and hence pd + ad−1pd−1 + . . . + a1p − p = 0. 2The general formula is that if n = ∏ pei i , then the sum of the divisors of n is ∏ ( p ei+1 i −1 pi−1 ). To prove this, note that pei+1 i −1 pi−1 = 1 + pi + p2 i + . . . + pei i , and see what monomials appear when you multiply everything out. 7 of 8 Winter Camp 2014 Buﬀet Contest Solutions However, pd + ad−1pd−1 + . . . + a1p − p ≥ pd − M pd−1 − M pd−2 − . . . − M p − p ≥ pd − M dpd−1 > 0, which is a contradiction. (Bay Area 2004) 3. Lemma: For every real number ϵ > 0 and every integer A, there exist integers n and m with n > A and 10m ≤ 5n < 10m · (1 + ϵ). Proof: Let B be a positive integer such that (1 + ϵ)B > 10. Then 10 1 B < 1 + ϵ. Consider the numbers {0 · log10 5}, {1 · log10 5}, . . . , {B · log10 5}, where {x} denotes the frac- tional part of x. There are B + 1 such numbers and all lie in the range [0, 1]. Furthermore, they are all distinct: if {u · log10 5} = {v · log10 5}, then 5u−v is a power of 10, but that is impossible for u ̸= v. Therefore, there must exist non-negative integers u, v ≤ B such that 0 < {u · log10 5} − {v · log10 5} ≤ 1 B . Let x = {u · log10 5} − {v · log10 5}, and let C be a positive integer larger than A + B x . Then there must exist some non-negative integer k such that kx ≤ {C · log10 5} < (k + 1)x. Let n = C + k(v − u). Note that n > A since |k(v − u)| ≤ 1 x · B < C − A. Furthermore, {n · log10 5} = {C · log10 5} + k · {v · log10 5} − k · {u · log10 5} =⇒ {n · log10 5} < x ≤ 1 B . Letting m = ⌊n log10 5⌋, we have: m ≤ n · log10 5 < m + 1 B =⇒ 10 m ≤ 5 n < 10 m · 10 1 B =⇒ 10 m ≤ 5 n < 10 m · (1 + ϵ), which completes the proof of the lemma. Now consider a sequence au, au+1, . . . , av. For each i ∈ {u, u + 1, . . . , v}, there exist integers ei such that (ai + 1) · 10ei − 1 ≥ 2i ≥ ai · 10ei. Let ϵ = 1 + 1 2v and A = v. Choose n and m according to the lemma. Then, for i ∈ {u, u + 1, . . . , v}, we have 5n−i ≥ 10 m · 5 −i = 10 m−i · 2 i ≥ ai · 10 m−i+ei, and similarly 5n−i < 10 m−i · 2i · (1 + ϵ) ≤ 10 m−i · (2 i + 1) ≤ (ai + 1) · 10 m−i+ei. Therefore, bn−i = ai, and the proof is complete. 8 of 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
