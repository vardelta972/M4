The perpendicu- lar bisectors of BC and BA intersect AC at X and Y respectively. Prove that circumcentre of triangle ABC is incentre of triangle BXY . Solution: Let D and E be the mid-points of BC and AB respectively. Since X lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC, we have XB = XC. Since XD ⊥ BC and XB = XC, it follows that XD bisects ∠BXC. Similarly, Y E bisects ∠BY A. Hence the point of intersection of XD and Y E is the incentre of △BXY . But this point of intersection is also the circumcentre of △ABC, being the point of intersection of perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB. 2. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers. Prove that y2 + z2 x + z2 + x2 y + x2 + y2 z ≥ 2(x + y + z). Solution: We write the inequality in the form x2 y + y2 x + y2 z + z2 y + z2 x + x2 z ≥ 2(x + y + z). We observe that x2 + y2 ≥ 2xy. Hence x2 + y2 − xy ≥ xy. Multiplying both sides by (x + y), we get x3 + y3 = (x + y)(x2 − xy + y2) ≥ (x + y)xy. Thus x2 y + y2 x ≥ x + y. Similarly, we obtain y2 z + z2 y ≥ y + z, z2 x + x2 z ≥ x + y. Adding three inequalities, we get the required result. 3. Find all pairs of (x, y) of positive integers such that 2x + 7y divides 7x + 2y. Solution: Let d = gcd(x, y). Then x = dx1 and y = dy1. We observe that 2x + 7y divides 7x + 2y if and only if 2x1 + 7y1 divides 7x1 + 2y1. This means 2x1 + 7y1 should divide 49x1 + 14y1. But 2x1 + 7y1 divides 4x1 + 14y1. Hence 2x1 + 7y1 divides 45x1. Similarly, we can show that 2x1 + 7y1 divides 45y1. Hence 2x1 + 7y1 divides gcd(45x1, 45y1) = 45 gcd(x1, y1) = 45. Hence 2x1 + 7y1 = 9, 15 or 45. If 2x1 + 7y1 = 9, then x1 = 1, y1 = 1. Similarly, 2x1 + 7y1 = 15 gives x1 = 4, y1 = 1. If 2x1 + 7y1 = 45, then we get (x1, y1) = (19, 1), (12, 3), (5, 5). Thus all solutions are of the form (x, y) = (d, d), (4d, d), (19d, d), (12d, 3d), (5d, 5d). 4. For any positive integer n > 1, let P (n) denote the largest prime not exceeding n. Let N (n) denote the next prime larger than P (n). (For example P (10) = 7 and N (10) = 11, while P (11) = 11 and N (11) = 13.) If n + 1 is a prime number, prove that the value of the sum 1 P (2)N (2) + 1 P (3)N (3) + 1 P (4)N (4) + · · · + 1 P (n)N (n) = n − 1 2n + 2 . Solution: Let p and q be two consecutive primes, p < q. If we take any n such that p ≤ n < q, we see that P (n) = p and N (n) = q. Hence the term 1 pq occurs in the sum q − p times. The contribution from such terms is q−p pq = 1 p − 1 q . Since n + 1 is prime, we obtain 1 P (2)N (2) + 1 P (3)N (3) + 1 P (4)N (4) + · · · + 1 P (n)N (n) = ( 1 2 − 1 3 ) + ( 1 3 − 1 5 ) + · · · + ( 1 p − 1 n + 1 ) = 1 2 − 1 n + 1 = n − 1 2n + 2 . Here p is used for the prime preceeding n + 1. 5. Let ABC be a triangale with AB > AC. Let P be a point on the line AB beyond A such that AP + P C = AB. Let M be the mid-point of BC and let Q be the point on the side AB such that CQ ⊥ AM . Prove that BQ = 2AP . Solution: Extend BP to F such P F = P C. Then AF = AP + P F = AP + P C = AB. Hence A is the mid-point of BF . Since M is the mid-point of BC, it fol- lows that AM ∥ F C. But AM ⊥ CQ. Hence F C ⊥ CQ at C. Therefore QCF is a rigt-angled triangle. Since P C = P F , it follows that ∠P CF = ∠P F C. Hence ∠P QC = ∠P CQ which gives P Q = P C = P F . This implies that P is the mid-point of QF . Thus we have AP + AQ = P F and BQ + QA = AP + P F . This gives 2AP + AQ = P F + AP = BQ + QA. We conclude that BQ = 2AP . 2 6. Suppose n is odd and each square of an n × n grid is arbitrarily ﬁlled with either by 1 or by −1. Let rj and ck denote the product of all numbers in j-th row and k-th column respectively, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n. Prove that n∑ j=1 rj + n∑ k=1 ck ̸= 0. Solution: Suppose we change +1 to −1 in a square. Then the product of the numbers in that row changes sign. Similarly, the product of numbers in the column also changes sign. Hence the sum S = n∑ j=1 rj + n∑ k=1 ck decreases by 4 or increases by 4 or remains same. Hence the new sum is congruent to the old sum modulo 4. Let us consider the situation when all the squares have +1. Then S = n + n = 2n = 2(2m + 1) = 4m + 2. This means the sum S is is always of the form 4l + 2 for any conﬁguration. Therefore the sum is not equal to 0. ———-00———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
