While you do not need to turn these in, I recommend doing them for general understanding of the material. Additionally, you may as well expect a problem or two similar to Exercises 3.17–3.19 on the Exam. 3.7 Quadratic Diophantine equations Exercise 3.16. Exercise 3.7.1. Exercise 3.17. Show that if p = x2 + 4y2, then p is of the form 4n or 4n + 1. Exercise 3.18. Using congruences, prove that k3 + 2k is always divisible by 3. Exercise 3.19. Show that if p = x3 + y3, then p is not of the form 9n + 4 or 9n + 5. 3.8 *Primitive roots Proposition 3.16. If 1/n is strictly periodic with period length r, then 10 has order r in (Z/nZ)×. Exercise 3.20. Without dividing, determine the period length of 1/11. (For p > 5, we have gcd(p, 10) = 1, and one can show 1/p will be strictly periodic, so you may use the above propo- sition.) Check what the decimal expansion is on a calculator. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
