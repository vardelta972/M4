But math is not quite complete without the complex numbers. In the reals there is no solution to the polynomial equation x2 = −1, as the square of any real number is positive. However, we can “create” a solution: let’s adjoin a number to R whose square is −1. Call it i, and let the resulting number system be C. Since we want addition and multiplication to work out, we have to include in C all numbers of the form z = a + bi, where a and b are real. Deﬁnition 1.1: The set of numbers in the form a + bi, where a and b are real, is called the complex numbers C. We call a the real part of z and b the imaginary part, denoted by ℜ(z) = Re(z) and ℑ(z) = Im(z), respectively. A good way to imagine complex numbers is to think of them as points on a plane (the complex plane), by graphing a + bi as the point (a, b). The x-axis consists of the real numbers a ∈ R, while the y-axis consists of the imaginary numbers bi, b ∈ R. However, the complex numbers have much more structure than just ordered pairs of real numbers—for instance, we can multiply complex numbers as we show below. Let’s see how basic operations work in C. To add or subtract complex numbers, we simply add the real and imaginary components: (1+2i)−(3−5i) = (1−3)i+(2−(−5))i = −2 + 7i. We multiply complex numbers by the distributive law, and recall that i2 = −1: for example (1 + 2i)(3 − 5i) = 1 · 3 + 1 · −5i + 2i · 3 + 2i · −5i = 3 + 6i − 10i 2 = 13 + 6i. To deﬁne division, we need the following: Deﬁnition 1.2: The conjugate of a complex number z = a + bi, where a, b are real, is ¯z = a − bi. Note that the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always real: (a + bi)(a − bi) = a2 − (bi)2 = a2 + b2. This allows us to divide complex numbers: to evaluate a+bi c+di we multiply both the numer- ator and the denominator by the complex conjugate of c + di, c − di. For example, 1 + 2i 3 − 5i = (1 + 2i)(3 + 5i) (3 − 5i)(3 + 5i) = 3 + 11i + 10i2 32 + 52 = − 7 34 + 11 34i. OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Note that complex conjugation preserves addition and multiplication, i.e. ¯z1+¯z2 = z1 + z2 and ¯z1 ¯z2 = ¯z1 ¯z2. Indeed, let z1 = a + bi and z2 = c + di. Then ¯z1 + ¯z2 = (a − bi) + (c − di) = (a + c) − (b + d)i = z1 + z2. ¯z1 ¯z2 = (a − bi)(c − di) = (ac − bd) − (ad + bc)i = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc)i = z1z2. The absolute value of z = a + bi is deﬁned by |z| = √ a2 + b2. It is the distance from z to 0 when we plot z in the complex plane. Now negative numbers have square roots too, since ( √ai)2 = −a. With this, we can solve any quadratic equation by completing the square or using the quadratic formula. But what about general polynomials equations? Do we have to adjoin more elements to C so that every cubic polynomial ax3 + bx2 + cx + d = 0 where a, b, c, d ∈ C, has a solution? Due to the following miracle, we do not: Theorem 1.3 (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra): Every nonconstant polynomial with coeﬃcients in C has a zero in C. (See lecture 8 for a proof.) This shows that C is a very “natural” number system to do algebra over. 1.2 Motivations So what are complex numbers good for? Who cares about polynomial equations that can’t be solved over the reals—after all, complex solutions don’t make sense in real life, right? Complex numbers were ﬁrst developed to solve cubic polynomial equations—the for- mula hinged on the use of complex numbers even when the solutions of the equation were real. At ﬁrst mathematicians were hesitant to adopt complex numbers, but complex numbers soon proved their use in a variety of other ways. A math problem (for exam- ple, a diﬀerential equation) might require as an intermediate step to solve a polynomial equation that may not have real solutions. But if we know how to work with complex numbers, we can proceed just as we would in the real case, and the simpliﬁed answer may in fact not have complex numbers at all, but would be hard to obtain otherwise. Calculus over the complex numbers turns be much nicer—so that it is often advanta- geous to extend the domain of real functions to the complex numbers, and then look at their properties. This is the case with the infamous zeta function, which has applications to number theory. Many problems that don’t look like they involve complex numbers turn out to be much easier if we use them. For instance, to ﬁnd Pythagorean triples we want to solve a2 + b2 = c2 over the integers. We may rewrite this as c2 − b2 = a 2 and factor as (c − b)(c + b) = a2, and then use number theory. Suppose we want to do the same with a3 + b3 = c3. 2 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 (Think Fermat’s Last Theorem!) We rewrite this as c3 − b3 = a3 and factor (c − b)(c2 + cb + b2) = a3. However, the left side is not completely factored. If, however, we were working over the complex numbers, we could factor this further: (c − b)(c − ωb)(c − ω2b) = a3 for some complex number ω. Then we could solve this by using number theory but over complex numbers instead (this is part of what is called algebraic number theory). 1.3 Examples Let’s warm up with some problems. Example 1.4: Find the sum 1 + i + i 2 + i3 + · · · + i 2011. Solution. We calculate 1 = 1, i = i, i 2 = −1, i 3 = −i, i 4 = 1. Hence the powers of i cycle through 1, i, −1, and −i. So we group the sum into four terms at a time (1 + i + i 2 + i 3) + (i 4 + i 5 + i6 + i 7) + · · · + (i 2008 + i2009 + i 2010 + i 2011) and note that the sum in each group is 1 + i − 1 − i = 0. Hence the answer is 0. Example 1.5: Show that if f is a polynomial with real coeﬃcients and f (z) = 0, then f (¯z) = 0. Conclude that the roots of f (with multiplicity) can be grouped into complex conjugate pairs. Proof. Let f (z) = anzn +· · ·+a1z +a0. Using the fact that conjugation preserves addition and multiplication, f (¯z) = an ¯zn + · · · + a1 ¯z + a0 = anzn + · · · + a1 ¯z + a0 = anzn + · · · + a1z + a0 since am real = anzn + · · · + a1z + a0 = f (z). Thus if f (z) = 0 then f (¯z) = 0. Thus the nonreal roots of f come in complex conjugate pairs. Example 1.6 (AIME1 2009/2): There is a complex number z with imaginary part 164 and a positive integer n such that z z + n = 4i. Find n. 3 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Solution. We can write z = a + 164i where a is real. Then a + 164i (a + n) + 164i = 4i. Clearing the denominator gives a + 164i = −656 + 4(a + n)i. Hence matching the real and imaginary parts, a = −656 and 164 = 4(a+n) = 4(−656+n). We get 41 = −656 + n or n = 697. 1.4 Problem Set 1 1.

Given that z0 = 1 137 + i and z2002 = a + bi, where a and b are real, ﬁnd a + b. 10. [2.5] Let Λ ∗ = {a + bi|a, b ∈ Z, (a, b) ̸= 0}. Evaluate ∑ λ∈Λ∗ 1 λ6 . (Note: You may assume the sum is absolutely convergent, i.e. well-deﬁned.) 11. [4] (USAMO 1989/3) Let P (z) = zn + c1zn−1 + · · · + cn be a polynomial in z, with real coeﬃcients ck. Suppose that |P (i)| < 1. Prove that there exist real numbers a and b such that P (a + bi) = 0 and (a2 + b2 + a) 2 < 4b2 + 1. 4 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 2 Polar form 2.1 Basic Facts and Examples Consider the complex plane. When we write a complex number as a + bi, we graph the point by going horizontally a units and vertically b units. This is called the rectangular form of the complex number. Addition of complex numbers corresponds nicely to addition of vectors. Conjugation corresponds to reﬂection over the x-axis (real axis). But what does multiplication and division? To answer this question, we need to write our complex numbers in a diﬀerent form. We could instead specify a location z on the complex plane by the distance r from 0, and the angle θ made with the positive real axis. Drawing a triangle, we see that z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) which we abbreviate as z = r cis θ. This is called the polar form, z is called the modulus, and θ is called the argument. Let’s try to multiply complex numbers in this form. Let z1 = r1 cis α and z2 = r2 cis β. Then using the addition identities for sine and cosine, z1z2 = r1r2(cos α + i sin α)(cos β + i sin β) = r1r2[(cos α cos β − sin α sin β) + i(cos α sin β + cos β sin α)] = r1r2[cos(α + β) + i sin(α + β)]. We state this as a theorem. Theorem 2.1 (De Moivre): (r1 cis α)(r2 cis β) = r1r2 cis(α + β). In particular, (r cis θ) n = rn cis(nθ). Using this theorem we can ﬁnd nth roots of a complex number z, i.e. ﬁnd the solutions to xn = z. Writing z = r cis θ and x = s cis ϕ, this is equivalent to (s cis ϕ) n = r cis θ. Using De Moivre’s Theorem, this is equivalent to sn cis nϕ = r cis θ. Hence we need sn = r and nϕ equal to θ as angles. This means they are allowed to diﬀer by a multiple of 2πi. Hence r = n√s and nϕ = θ + 2πik ϕ = θ n + 2πik n for some integer k. Taking k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1—the n possibilities for k modulo n—give n distinct possible values of ϕ (other values diﬀer from one of these by a multiple of 2πi). Thus each nonzero complex number has n nth roots. For example, the third roots of i = 8 cis π 2 are 2 cis ( π 6 + 2πk 3 ) for k = 0, 1, 2, i.e. 2 cis π 6 = √ 3 2 + 1 2 i 2 cis 5π 6 = − √3 2 + 1 2i 2 cis 3π 2 = −i. 5 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Example 2.2: Let z ̸= 0 and n > 1. Show that the sum of the nth roots of z equals 0. Solution 1. Let x be a nth root of z, and ω = cis 2π n . Then 1, ω, . . . , ωn−1 are the nth roots of 1 so z, zω, . . . , zωn−1 are the nth roots of z. So the sum is z(1 + ω + · · · + ωn−1) = z · ωn − 1 ω − 1 = 0 since ωn = 1. Solution 2. Let x1, . . . , xn be the nth roots of z and ω = cis 2π n above. Then x1ω, . . . , xnω are also the nth roots of unity, so are equal to x1, . . . , xn in some order. Thus the sum s equals both x1 + · · · + xn and ω(x1 + · · · + xn). Since s = sω, s = 0. Example 2.3 (AIME2 2008/9): A particle is located on the coordinate plane at (5, 0). Deﬁne a move for the particle as a counterclockwise rotation of π 4 radians about the origin followed by a translation of 10 units in the positive x-direction. Given that the particle’s position after 150 moves is (p, q), ﬁnd the greatest integer less than or equal to |p| + |q|. Solution. Think of the coordinate plane as the complex plane, and let zn be the par- ticle’s position after n moves, as a complex number. A counterclockwise rotation of π 4 corresponds to multiplication by t = cis π 4 , and translation by 10 units in the positive x-direction corresponds to adding 10. Thus zn = tzn−1 + 10. Calculating the ﬁrst few terms, z0 = 5 z1 = 5t + 10 z2 = (5t + 10)t + 10 = 5t2 + 10t + 10 so we see that zn = 5t n + 10t n−1 + · · · + 10, easily proved by induction. Since t is an eighth root of 1, by Example (2.2) the sum of the eighth roots 1 + t + t2 + · · · + t7 equals 0. Since t 8 = 1, 0 = 1 + t + · · · + t 7 = t 8 + · · · + t15 = · · · = t 144 + · · · + t 151. Hence z150 = 5t150 + 10t 149 + · · · + 10 = 10[(1 + t + · · · + t 7) + · · · + (t 144 + · · · t 152)] − 10t151 − 5t 150 = −10t 7 − 5t 6 = −10 cis 7π 4 − 5 cis 3π 2 = −10 (√2 2 − √2 2 i ) + 5i. Thus |p| + |q| = 10 √2 + 5 ≈ 10 · 1.41 + 5 = 19.1. The answer is 19. Example 2.4: Let Pn(x) = (x + n)(x + n − 1) · · · (x + 1) − (x − 1)(x − 2) · · · (x − n). Show that all the zeros of Pn(x) are purely imaginary, i.e. have real part 0. 6 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Proof. Since a polynomial of degree at most n − 1 has at most n − 1 zeros, it suﬃces to show that there are n − 1 pure imaginary roots. Let x = yi and θk(y) = tan−1 y k . Making this substitution and rewriting in polar form, Pn(x) = 0 is equivalent to (iy + n)(iy + n − 1) · · · (iy + 1) = (iy − 1)(iy − 2) · · · (iy − n) ⇐⇒ cis θn(y) · · · cis θ1(y) = cis(π − θ1(y)) · · · cis(π − θn(y)) ⇐⇒ cis(θ1(y) + · · · θn(y)) = cis(nπ − (θ1(y) + · · · + θn(y))) ⇐⇒ 2(θ1(y) + · · · + θn(y)) ≡ nπ (mod 2π). (1) Note that each θk is a continuous function of y, and that 2(θ1(y) + · · · + θn(y)) → −2n · π 2 = −nπ as y → −∞ 2(θ1(y) + · · · + θn(y)) → 2n · π 2 = nπ as y → ∞ Thus 2(θ1(y) + · · · + θn(y)) attains the value nπ − 2kπ for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Hence there are n − 1 values of y such that (1) holds and hence there are n − 1 purely imaginary roots of Pn, as needed. 2.2 Trigonometry The polar form of complex numbers can be used to simplify trig expressions and prove trig identities. Example 2.5: Show that cos 3θ = 4 cos3 θ − 3 cos θ and sin 3θ = 3 sin θ − 4 sin 3 θ. Solution. By De Moivre’s Theorem, cos 3θ + i sin 3θ = (cos θ + i sin θ)3 = cos 3 θ + 3 cos 2 θ(i sin θ) + 3 cos θ(i sin θ)2 + (i sin θ)3 = (cos 3 θ − 3 cos θ sin 2(θ)) + (3 cos2 θ sin θ − sin3 θ)i Matching the real and imaginary parts, cos 3θ = cos 3 θ − 3 cos θ sin2(θ) = cos3 θ − 3 cos θ(1 − cos 2(θ)) = 4 cos3 θ − 3 cos θ and sin 3θ = 3 cos2 θ sin θ − sin 3 θ = 3(1 − sin 2 θ) sin θ − sin 3 θ = 3 sin θ − 4 sin 3 θ. Example 2.6: Show that cos 0 ◦ + cos 1 ◦ + cos 2 ◦ + · · · + cos 89 ◦ = 1+cot .5◦ 2 . Solution. Let ω = cos 1◦ + i sin 1 ◦. Then ωn = cos n ◦ + i sin n◦. Hence the desired sum equals the real part of 1 + ω + ω2 + · · · + ω89. Using the geometric series formula, 1 + ω + ω2 + · · · + ω89 = ω90 − 1 ω − 1 = i − 1 (cos 1◦ − 1) + i sin 1◦ = (i − 1)((cos 1 ◦ − 1) − i sin 1 ◦) (cos 1◦ − 1)2 + sin2 1◦ = (i − 1)((cos 1 ◦ − 1) − i sin 1 ◦) 2 − 2 cos 1◦ = 1 − cos 1 ◦ + sin 1 ◦ + (cos 1 ◦ − 1 + sin 1◦)i 2 − 2 cos 1◦ . 7 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 This has real part 1 − cos 1 ◦ + sin 1 ◦ 2 − 2 cos 1◦ = 1 2 ( 1 + sin 1 ◦ 1 − cos 1◦ ) = 1 + cot .5 ◦ 2 where we used the trig identity cot θ 2 = sin θ 1−cos θ . 2.3 Calculus viewpoint Using calculus we can write cos θ+i sin θ in a more suggestive form. The Taylor expansions of cos and sin are cos x = 1 − x2 2! + x4 4! − x6 6! + · · · sin x = x − x3 3! + x5 5! − x7 7! + · · · Thus cos x + i sin x = 1 + ix − x2 2! − i x3 3! + x4 4! + i x5 5! + · · · = 1 + (ix) + (ix) 2 2! + (ix) 3 3! + (ix) 4 4! + (ix)5 5! · · · = e ix. Therefore we can write cis θ as eiθ. Thus De Moivre’s Theorem simply corresponds to the fact that e iθ1eiθ2 = e i(θ1+θ2)—the familiar rule for exponents. 2.4 Problem set 2 1. [1] Show that cos θ = e iθ + e−iθ 2 sin θ = e iθ − e−iθ 2i . 2.

Prove that c1 = c2 = · · · = cn = 1. 12. [5] (APMO 2009/5) Larry and Rob are two robots traveling in one car from Argovia to Zillis. Both robots have control over the steering and steer according to the following algorith: Larry makes a 90◦ left turn after every l kilometers driving from the start; Rob makes a 90◦ right turn after every r kilometers driving from the start, where l and r are relatively prime positive integers. In the event of both turns occuring simultaneously, the car will keep going straight without changing direction. Assume that the ground is ﬂat and the car can move in any direction. Let the car start from Argovia facing towards Zillis. For which choices of the pair (l, r) is the car guaranteed to reach Zillis, regardless of how far it is from Argovia? 3 Roots of Unity The nth roots of unity, i.e. roots of 1, satisfy the equation xn − 1 = 0. The nth roots of unity, not counting 1, satisfy xn − 1 x − 1 = xn−1 + · · · + x + 1 = 0. If we plug in x = cis 2π n , the terms of this sum are all the nth roots of unity, and we get Example 2.2. This simple idea—the sum of the nth roots of unity satisfy the equations above, and that their sum is zero—can be very useful. Example 3.1: n points Q1, . . . , Qn are equally spaced on a circle of radius 1 centered at O. Point P is on ray OQ1 so that OP = 2. Find the product n∏ k=1 P Qk in closed form, in terms of n. Solution. Letting ray OQ1 be the positive real axis, Qi represent the nth roots of unity ωi in the complex plane. Hence P Qi equals |2 − ωi|. The roots of xn − 1 = 0 are just the nth roots of unity, so xn − 1 = ∏n−1 i=0 (x − ωi). Plugging in x = 2 gives ∏n k=1 |P Qi| = 2 n − 1. Plugging in roots of unity can help in factoring polynomials and establishing divisi- bility, as the following example shows: Example 3.2: Find all integers n ≥ 1 such that xn+1 + xn + 1 is divisible by x2 + x + 1. Solution. In order for xn+1 + xn + 1 to be divisible by x2 ± x + 1, we must have that all zeros of x2 + x + 1 are zeros of xn+1 + xn + 1. The zeros are exactly the two third roots of unity not equal to 1. Let ω be such a root of unity. Then we need ωn+1 + ωn + 1 = 0. However, we know ω3 = 1, so the above equation is equivalent to ω(n+1) mod 3 + ωn mod 3 + 1 = 0. For n ≡ 0 (mod 3) this equals ω + 2, for n ≡ 1 (mod 3) this equals ω2 + ω + 1 = 0, and for n ≡ 2 (mod 3) this equals ω + 2. Hence the answer is all n with n ≡ 2 (mod 3). 10 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Example 3.3: [MOSP 2007] Let n be a positive integer which is not a prime power. Prove that there exists an equiangular polygon whose side lengths are 1, . . . , n in some order. Proof. Since n is not a prime power, we can write n = pq, where p and q are relatively prime. Let ω = cis 2π n . The existence of such an equiangular polygon is equivalent to the existence of a permutation a1, . . . , an of the numbers 1, . . . , n such that n−1∑ k=0 akωk = 0 (2) Indeed, given such an equiangular polygon, place it on the complex plane so that the real axis be parallel to one of its sides. Think of the sides of the polygon as vectors forming a loop, and translate them to the origin. Then we get n vectors equally spacced apart; they are in the direction of the nth roots of unity and have lengths 1, . . . , n in some order. The sum of the vectors must be 0 because they formed a loop. Hence we get the equation above. Conversely, we can easily reverse the above construction. We use the two factors of n to cause “double” cancelation. Note that (pr + 1)ωrp + (pr + 2)ωrp+q + · · · + (pr + p)ωrp+(p−1)q (3) = prωrp(1 + ωq + · · · + ω(p−1)q) + ωrp(1 + 2ω + · · · + pωp−1) = ωrp(1 + 2ωq + · · · + pω(p−1)q). We used the fact 1 + ωq + · · · + ω(p−1)q = 0 as the terms are the pth roots of unity. Now adding the above expression for r = 1, . . . , q gives q∑ r=1 ωrp(1 + 2ωq + · · · + pω(p−1)q) = (1 + ωp + · · · + ω(q−1)p)(1 + 2ωq + · · · + pω(p−1)q) = 0 becuase 1 + ωp + · · · + ω(q−1)p = 0 as the terms are the qth roots of unity. However, adding up (3) without simplifying for r = 1, . . . , q, we get the pq exponents of ω range over the numbers rp + kq, where 1 ≤ r ≤ q and 0 ≤ k ≤ q. Since p, q are relatively prime, these numbers are all distinct modulo n = pq. (If r1p + k1q = r2p + k2q then (r1 − r2)p = (k2 − k1)q with |r1 − r2| < q, |k2 − k1| < p so they must equal 0.) Thus taking the exponents modulo pq, we get a sum of the form (2), as needed. 3.1 Problems 1. [1] Factor x5 + x + 1. 2.

[5] (USAMO 1999/3) Let p > 2 be prime and let a, b, c, d be integers not divisible by p, such that {ra/p} + {rb/p} + {rc/p} + {rd/p} = 2 for any integer r not divisible by p. Prove that at least two of the numbers a + b, a + c, a + d, b + c, b + d, c + d are divisible by p. (Note: {x} = x − ⌊x⌋ denotes the fractional part of x.) 4 Complex numbers in combinatorics We give two applications of complex numbers to combinatorics problems. For other beautiful problems of a similar nature, the reader is referred to [1, §8]. Example 4.1: Show that an a × b rectangle can be tiled by 1 × n blocks if and only if either n|a or n|b. 12 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Solution. If n|a or n|b then the rectangle can obviously be tiled. Now suppose that an a × b rectangle can be tiled by 1 × n blocks. Label the squares of the rectangle (x, y) with 0 ≤ x ≤ a − 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ b − 1. Let ω be a primitive nth root of unity. Label (x, y) with ωx+y. Each 1 × n tile covers numbers of the form ωt, ωt+1, . . . , ωt+n−1 for some t; these numbers sum to 0. However the sum of all numbers in the board is (1 + ω + · · · + ωa−1)(1 + ω + · · · + ωb−1) = ωa − 1 ω − 1 · ωb − 1 ω − 1 . This is 0 only if ωa = 1 or ωb = 1, i.e. n|a or n|b. Example 4.2 (TST 2004/2): Assume n is a positive integer. Consider sequences a0, a1, . . . , an for which ai ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} for all i and an = a0. (a) Call a sequence good if for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n, ai − ai−1 ̸≡ i (mod n). Suppose that n is odd. Find the number of good sequences. (b) Call a sequence great if for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n, ai − ai−1 ̸≡ i, 2i (mod n). Suppose that n is an odd prime. Find the number of great sequences. Solution. Let f be a function from {1, 2, . . . , n} to the set of subsets of {0, 1, . . . , n}. Deﬁne a non-f sequence to be a sequence a0, a1, . . . , an such that 1. ai ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n} for i = 0, . . . , n, 2. an = a0, and 3. ai − ai−1 is not congruent to a number in f (i) modulo n. Claim 4.3: The number of non-f sequences is n times the number of sequences d1, d2, . . . , dn such that 1. di ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , n − 1} for each i, 2. d1 + · · · dn ≡ 0 (mod n), and 3. di ̸∈ f (i). Proof. Given a non-f sequence ai, associate with it a sequence as above, with di = (ai − ai−1) mod n. Each sequence di satisfying the above is associated with n non-f sequences: a0 can be chosen arbitrarily (there are n choices), and once ai−1 has been deﬁned, ai must be the unique integer in {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} so that ai ≡ ai−1 + di (mod n). Claim 4.4: Let P (x) = 1 + x + · · · + xn−1, and deﬁne bk such that n∏ i=1  P (x) − ∑ j∈f (i) xj   = ∑ k≥0 bkxk. Then the number of valid sequences {di} n i=1 is ∑ j≥0 bjn. 13 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 Proof. Note that P (x) − ∑ j∈f (i) xj contains only powers of x whose exponents are allow- able values for di. Take a term in the expansion of the left-hand-side, suppose it takes the term xdi from P (x) − ∑ j∈f (i) xj. Then the term is xd1+d2+···+dn. Now {di}n i=1 is a valid sequence iﬀ d1 + d2 + · · · + dn ≡ 0 (mod n). Hence summing the coeﬃcients of xk for n|k gives the number of valid sequences. Combining this with the previous claim, the number of non-f sequences in n ∑ j≥0 bjn. (a) A good sequence is exactly a non-f sequence for f (i) = {i mod n}. Let Q(x) = n∏ i=1  P (x) − ∑ j∈f (i) xj   = n−1∏ i=0 [ P (x) − xi] . Now Q(1) = n−1∏ i=0(P (1) − 1) = n−1∏ i=0(n − 1) = (n − 1) n and for any ω ̸= 1 a nth root of unity, Q(ω) = n−1∏ i=0(P (ω) − ωi) = n−1∏ i=0(−ωi) = −ω n(n−1) 2 = −1 since the fact that n is odd gives n| n(n−1) 2 . Now Q(x) + 1 is zero for all nth roots of unity ω ̸= 1, so is divisible by P (x). Writing Q(x) + 1 = ∑ k≥0 ckxk, the fact that P (x)|Q(x) gives that the sums Sr = ∑ k≡r (mod n) ck are all equal (ﬁll in the details—basically any term times P (x) is spread among terms whose exponents make up a complete residue class modulo n). Hence, since the sum of coeﬃcients of Q(x) + 1 is Q(1) + 1, ∑ k≥0 ckn = Q(1) + 1 n = (n − 1)n + 1 n . Then the desired sum for Q(x) is (n−1)n+1 n − 1 and multiplying by n we get there are (n − 1) n − n + 1 good sequences. (b) A great sequence is a non-f sequence for f (i) = {i mod n, 2i mod n}. The calcula- tions are left to the reader. The following lemma will be useful below. Lemma 4.5: If ω ̸= 1 is pth root of unity, and a0, . . . , ap−1 are rational numbers such that a0 + a1ω + · · · + ap−1ωp−1 = 0 then a0 = · · · = ap−1. This lemma follows from the fact that 1 + x + . . . + xp−1 is the irreducible (minimal) polynomial of ω, which we will prove in a later lecture. 14 OMC 2011 Complex Numbers Lecture 11 4.1 Problem set 4 1.
