In particular, the commitment of all those who delivered fascinating and informative lectures during the aforementioned camps should be credited here. Many other publications by the United Kingdom Mathematics Trust have influenced this work, written mainly by Christopher Bradley and Geoff Smith. Thanks also go to Louise Beach for advocating the use of the duck-egg blue colour scheme for highlighting theorems due to its soothing effect. Finally, I would especially like to thank everyone who shaped the book with their praise, comments and corrections, including my parents, Joseph Myers, James Aaronson, James Pogmore, Sam Cappleman-Lynes, MÃ¡rton Mester and the legendary Suzanna Eames. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
