How many positive integers less than 1000 have the property that the sum of the digits of each such number is divisible by 7 and the number itself is divisible by 3? 2. Suppose a, b are positive real numbers such that apa + bpb = 183,apb + bpa = 182. Find 9 5 (a + b). 3. A contractor has two teams of workers: team A and team B. Team A can complete a job in 12 days and team B can do the same job in 36 days. Team A starts working on the job and team B joins team A after four days. The team A withdraws after two more days.

Find the number of positive integers n, such that pn + pn +1 < 11. 8 A pen costs 11 and a notebook costs 13. Find the number of ways in which a person can spend exactly 1000 to buy pens and notebooks. 9. There are ﬁve cities A, B, C, D, E on a certain island. Each city is connected to every other city by road. In how many ways can a person starting from city A come back to A after visiting some cities without visiting a city more than once and without taking the same road more than once? (The order in which he visits the cities also matters: e.g., the routes A ! B ! C ! A and A ! C ! B ! A are different.) 10. There are eight rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor of a hotel, with four rooms on each side of the corridor, symmetrically situated (that is each room is exactly opposite to one other room). Four guests have to be accommodated in four of the eight rooms (that is, one in each) such that no two guests are in adjacent rooms or in opposite rooms. In how many ways can the guests be accommodated? 11. Let f (x)=sin x 3 + cos 3x 10 for all real x. Find the least natural number n such that f \u0000n⇡ + x\u0000 = f (x) for all real x. 12.
