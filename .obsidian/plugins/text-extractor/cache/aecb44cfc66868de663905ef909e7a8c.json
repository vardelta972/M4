Given n positive real numbers x1, . . . , xn with x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = 1 prove that ( 1 x2 1 − 1 ) ( 1 x2 2 − 1) · · · ( 1 x2 n − 1) ≥ (n2 − 1)n 2. Recall that for any positive integer m, ϕ(m) denotes the number of positive integers less than m which are relatively prime to m. Let n be an odd positive integer such that both ϕ(n) and ϕ(n + 1) are powers of two. Prove n + 1 is power of two or n = 5. 3. Let ω be a semicircle with diameter AB and center O. A line intersects ω at C and D and intersects the line AB at M with |M B| < |M A| and |M D| < |M C|. The circumcircles of triangles ∆AOC and ∆DOB meet again at K. Prove that ∠M KO = 90. 4. A 2n × n matrix of 1’s and -1’s is such that its 2n rows are pairwise distinct. An arbitrary subset of the entries of the matrix are changed to 0. Prove that there is a nonempty subset of the rows of the altered matrix that sum to the zero vector. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
