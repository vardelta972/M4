Functional equations are diﬀerent from algebraic equations in that they generally cannot be reduced into solving an expression in terms of f (x). As functional equations are mainly based on recursion, various substitutions can be used to ﬁnd the solutions of a functional equation, but there are various clever manipulations involved in them. 1 Deﬁnitions Deﬁnition 1.1. In a function f : X → Y , X is called the codomain and Y is called the image of f . We also denote Y = Im(f ). Deﬁnition 1.2. In a function f : X → Y , the kernel of f denoted by Ker(f ) is the subset of X that satisfy f (x) = 1. Deﬁnition 1.3. A function f : X → Y is said to be surjective if, for every element y in Y , there exists an element x in X such that f (x) = y. Deﬁnition 1.4. A function f is injective if f (a) = f (b) implies a = b. Deﬁnition 1.5. A function f is bijective if it is both surjective and injective. Deﬁnition 1.6. A function f is monotonic if it is either nonincreasing or nondecreasing. It is monotonically increasing if, for all x and y in the codomain of f such that x ≤ y, then f (x) ≤ f (y). It is monotonically decreasing if f (x) ≥ f (y). Deﬁnition 1.7. A function f is continuous at c if for any ϵ > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that for all x in the codomain of f with |x − c| < δ, the value of f satisﬁes |x − f (c)| < ϵ. A function is continuous if it is continuous everywhere. 2 Techniques Unfortunately, functional equations can only be mastered through practice. However, there are various techniques that one can use in solving functional equations. • Prove that f is injective by assuming that f (a) = f (b) for some a, b ∈ X, and then proving that a = b. • Prove that f is surjective by letting the value of a function equal a variable. • If f (0) = 0, we can let c be some number such that f (c) = 0. Substituting c in the functional equation may prove that c is unique. • Transform the original functional equation into a special one by considering a new function. 1 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park 3 Substitutions Most Olympiad functional equation problems will not fall due to pure substitutions. As such, cleverer manipulations must be made, often implicitly. A technique discussed above is to use the fact that there exists c such that f (c) = 0, and then substituting this new variable in the equation. This is exempliﬁed in the following example. Example 3.1 (MOP 2013). Find all functions f : R → R such that for all x, y ∈ R, f (f (x + y)f (x − y)) = x2 − yf (y). Solution. Let P (x, y) be the above assertion. Note that P (0, 0) implies that f (f (0) 2) = 0, so there exists a constant c such that f (c) = 0. Now P (2c, c) and P (c, 0) give f (0) = 4c 2 and f (0) = c 2, so c = 0. Hence f (0) = 0. Now from P (x, x) we obtain f (f (2x)f (0)) = x2 −xf (x), so xf (x) = x2 for all real x. It follows that f (x) = x for all real x. Other substitutions can boil down functional equations easily. Example 3.2. Find all functions f : R → R such that (x − y)f (x + y) − (x + y)f (x − y) = 4xy(x2 − y2) for all x, y ∈ R. Solution. Let u = x + y and v = x − y. The original equation gives us vf (u) − uf (v) = (u + v)(u − v)uv, so dividing through by uv yields f (u) u − f (v) v = u2 − v2, which rearranges to f (u) u − u2 = f (v) v − v2 for all u, v ∈ R. Hence the value f (x) x −x2 is constant for all x ∈ R, so f (x) x −x2 = c implies that f (x) = x3 +cx for some constant c ∈ R. 4 Special Functional Equations 4.1 Cauchy’s Functional Equation Cauchy’s functional equation is the functional equation f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y). Functions that satisfy this condition are called additive functions. By induction, it is not diﬃcult to prove that f ( ∑ x) = ∑ f (x) where the sum is taken over any variables. It is also clear that f (x) = cx for some constant c if x is an integer. This notion can be extended to the rationals: Lemma 4.1. If f : Q → R is an additive function, then f (x) = cx for some constant c ∈ R. Unfortunately, with only the fact that f is additive, we cannot conclude that f is a linear function over the reals. In fact, there are extremely complicated additive functions that do not satisfy f (x) = cx. However, with additional information, we can deduce that f is linear: 2 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park Theorem 4.2. If f : R → R is an additive function, and it is monotonic, continuous at a point, or bounded on some interval, then f (x) = cx for some constant c ∈ R. In Olympiad mathematics, functional equations that involve Cauchy’s functional equation will likely not require the continuity case, as continuity is technically a concept taught in Calculus. Moreover, new functions can be deﬁned in order to satisfy Cauchy’s functional equation. Example 4.1. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (f (x)2 + y) = x2 + f (y). Solution. Let P (x, y) be the above assertion. Suppose that f (a) = f (b) for a, b ∈ R. Then P (a, y) and P (b, y) gives a 2 + f (y) = f (f (a) 2 + y) = f (f (b) 2 + y) = b 2 + f (y), and so a 2 = b2. Consider the function g : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) such that g(x) = f (√x) 2. The given condition becomes f (g(x) + y) = x + f (y) for x > 0. Now notice that f (g(p) + g(q) + y) = p + f (g(q) + y) = p + q + f (y) = f (g(p + q) + y) so that g(p) + g(q) + y = ±(g(p + q) + y) for all positive reals p and q and reals x and y. However, g(p)+g(q)+y = −(g(p+q)+y) is impossible to hold for all reals y, so it follows that g(p)+g(q)+y = g(p+q)+y, or that g is additive. Since the image of g is positive, it is evident that g is bounded below, and thus g(x) = cx for some positive real c. It follows that f (x) = ±√cx. If f (y) = −√cy for some y, then c(cx 2 + y) 2 = f (cx 2 + y) 2 = (x2 − √cy) 2 which is clearly not true for all x and y. Hence, f (y) = √cy and a quick check reveals that c = 1. Therefore, the only solution is f (x) = x. Functions that satisfy f (xy) = f (x)f (y) are called multiplicative functions. Note that we can derive the so-called multiplicative Cauchy’s functional equation by taking the logarithm of Cauchy’s functional equation and setting g(x) = log f (x). When a function is both additive and multiplicative, then an interesting result occurs: Theorem 4.3. If f is both additive and multiplicative, then f is the identity function. Note that we can also derive the exponential and logarithmic Cauchy’s functional equations by setting g(x) = f (log x) and g(x) = ef (x). 4.2 Jensen’s Functional Equation Jensen’s functional equation is the functional equation f ( x + y 2 ) = f (x) + f (y) 2 . This functional equation is similar to Jensen’s Inequality in the two-variable case. Like Cauchy’s functional equation, this equation alone cannot give a solution for all reals. However, given additional information about f , we can deduce that f must be linear. Theorem 4.4. If f : I → R satisﬁes f ( x+y 2 ) = f (x)+f (y) 2 and it is monotonic, continuous at a point, or bounded on some interval, then f (x) = cx + d for some constants c, d ∈ R. 3 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park Example 4.2. Find all functions f : (0, ∞) → (0, ∞) such that for all x, y ∈ (0, ∞), f ( 2xy x + y ) = 2f (x)f (y) f (x) + f (y) . Solution. Consider the function g(x) = 1 f ( 1 x ) . The given condition then becomes g ( x+y 2 ) = g(x)+g(y) 2 . Since f is bounded, g is also bounded, and thus by Theorem 4.4 it follows that f (x) = cx + d for some constants c, d ∈ (0, ∞). Therefore, g(x) = 1 c x +d = x c+dx . 4.3 Pexider’s Functional Equation Pexider’s functional equation is the functional equation f (x + y) = g(x) + h(y). This is an obvious generalization to Cauchy’s functional equation, and it is clear that Pexider’s equation alone will not yield any desirable results. However, if the condition that f , g, and h are all continuous is added, then f , g and h are all linear: Theorem 4.5. If f, g, h : R → R are continuous functions such that f (x + y) = g(x) + h(y) for all x, y ∈ R, then f (x) = ax + b + c, g(x) = ax + b, and h(x) = ax + c where a, b, c ∈ R are constants. Example 4.3. Find all continuous functions f : R → R that satisfy f (f (x + y)) = f (x) + f (y) for all x, y ∈ R. Solution. Applying Pexider’s functional equation to functions f ◦ f, f, f gives us (f ◦ f )(x) = ax + b + c, f (x) = ax + b, and f (x) = ax + c. Hence b = c and so a = 0, 1, implying that f (x) = 0 and f (x) = x + b, b ∈ R. 4.4 D’Alembert’s Functional Equation D’Alembert’s functional equation is the functional equation f (x + y) + f (x − y) = 2f (x)f (y). The motivation behind this functional equation is the fact that cosx satisﬁes the identity cos(x + y) + cos(x − y) = 2 cos x cos y. Note, however, that the hyperbolic cosine function cosh x = ex+e−x 2 also satiﬁes D’Alembert’s functional equation. In fact: Theorem 4.6. If f : R → R is a continuous function that satsiﬁes f (x + y) + f (x − y) = 2f (x)f (y), then either f (x) = 0, f (x) = cos ax, or f (x) = cosh ax, where a ∈ R is a constant. 4 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park 5 Extremal Element Method Although the extremal principle is a technique that is most eﬀectively used in combinatorics, some functional equation problems can also be solved using the extremal principle. The most common case in which the extremal principle is used in functional equations is when the range of a function is bounded, and thus has a minimal/maximal element. Example 5.1. Find all functions f : Z → N such that 6f (k + 3) − 3f (k + 2) − 2f (k + 1) − f (k) = 0 for any k ∈ Z. Solution. The most important diﬀerence between Z and N is that N is bounded, and thus every subset of N has a minimal element. Let a = min{Im(f )}, and f (x) = a. Letting k = x − 3 yields 6a = 6f (x) = 3f (x − 1) + 2f (x − 2) + f (x − 3) ≥ 3a + 2a + a = 6a and so equality occurs everywhere where f (x − 1) = f (x − 2) = f (x − 3) = a. A simple induction shows that all constant functions satisfy the condition. 6 Injectivity, Surjectivity, and Bijectivity Surjectivity is generally easier to prove than injectivity. If a variable is allowed to vary freely while the other side of an equation is the image of a function, then the function is surjective. As an example, the functional equation f (yf (x)) = x − y is an example of such an equation because we may let x span the real numbers, and thus every real number has an inverse image; that is, f is surjective. Injectivity is proven by assuming that f (a) = f (b) for some a and b, and then proving that a = b. In the previous example, f is also injective because a − y = f (y(f (a))) = f (y(f (b))) = b − y, implying that a = b. Since f is both surjective and injective, f is bijective. The fact that a function is bijective provides crucial information. If f is bijective, then an inverse of the function exists; that is, the inverse of any value is unique. In addition, it says that such an inverse always exists. In a problem, you generally cannot assume something like “assume that there exists t such that f (t) = 2014.” However, if f has been found to be bijective, then we can make such an assumption. Example 6.1. Find all functions f : R → R such that f (f (x) + yz) = x + f (y)f (z) for all x, y, z ∈ R. Suppose that f (a) = f (b) for some a, b ∈ R. Then a + f (y)f (z) = f (f (a) + yz) = f (f (b) + yz) = b + f (y)f (z), 5 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park so a = b, implying that f is injective. f is also surjective because ﬁxing y and z and letting x vary shows that f can attain any value. Therefore, f is bijective. Let P (x, y, z) be the above assertion. Let q ∈ R be such that f (q) = 1. P (0, y, q) yields f (f (0) + yq) = f (y), so f (0) + yq = y for all y ∈ R, which is impossible unless f (0) = 0 and q = 1. Hence f (0) = 0 and f (1) = 1. The assertion P (x, 0, z) now yields f (f (x)) = x. Finally, P (f (u), y, 1) yields f (u + v) = f (u) + f (y), and P (0, y, z) yields f (yz) = f (y)f (z). Since f is both additive and multiplicative, f (x) = x. 7 Polynomials In some problems, it is given that the functional equation is a polynomial. This provides a signiﬁcant amount of information, such as the function cannot equal some value inﬁnitely many times, and in the case of integer polynomials, the fact that the diﬀerence of two integers divides the diﬀerence of the values of the function evaluated at the two integers. In addition, polynomials are continuous and inﬁnitely diﬀerentiable. Most importantly, we can compare coeﬃcients, as polynomials are ﬁnite. Example 7.1. Find all nonconstant polynomials P ∈ R[x] such that P (x3 + 1) = P (x + 1)3 for all x ∈ R. Solution 1. Let Q(x) = P (x + 1) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0x0. The given condition states that Q(x3) = Q(x)3, or anx3n + an−1x3n−3 + · · · + a0x 0 = (anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0x0) 3. Let am be a nonzero coeﬃcient of Q such that m < n is maximal. Comparing the coeﬃcient of x2n+m yields 0 = 3a 2 kam, which is a contradiction. Thus anx3n = Q(x 3) = Q(x03 = a 3 nx3n, so an = ±1. Hence P (x) = (x − 1) k or P (x) = −(x − 1) k. Solution 2. We have P (33 k +1) = P (33 k−1 +1)3 = · · · = P (4) 3k for all k ∈ N. Let P (x) = anxn +an−1xn−1 + · · · + a0x0. Since P is continuous, the limit lim x→∞ P (x) anxn = 1 is well-deﬁned. Therefore, 1 = lim k→∞ P (33 k + 1) an(33k + 1) = lim k→∞ P (33 k + 1) an33k = 1 an lim k→∞ ( P (4) 3n )3k . Comparing the leading coeﬃcients of the given condition yields an = ±1. We thus have P (4) = ±3 k, and so P (3 3 k + 1) = P (4) 3 k = an(33 k )n. Thus P (x) = (x − 1)k or P (x) = −(x − 1) k for all x = 3 3 k + 1, k ∈ N. The fact that P is a polynomial extends this to all real numbers. Regardless of what type of polynomial P is, the codomain of P is all complex numbers. That is, even if P ∈ Z[x], we may still substitute complex numbers in x (although this may rarely help). Example 7.2. If P , Q, R, and S are polynomials such that P (x5) + xQ(x5) + x2R(x5) = (x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1)S(x), prove that P (1) = 0. 6 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Functional Equations Robin Park Solution. Let ω be a ﬁfth root of unity not equal to 1. Substituting x = 1, ω, ω2, ω3, ω4 in P (x5) + xQ(x5) + x2R(x5) = (x 4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1)S(x) and adding the resulting equations gives us 5P (1) = 5S(1). Now substituting them in xP (x5) + x2Q(x5) + x3R(x5) = x(x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1)S(x) yields 0 = 5S(1), so P (1) = 0, as desired. 8 Miscellaneous Theorems/Lemmas Theorem 8.1 (Brouwer).
