Given positive real numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn whose sum is an integer, prove that one can choose a nonempty proper sublist of the xi such that the fractional part of the sum of this sublist is at most 1/n. 2. (IMO, 1987) Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be real numbers satisfying x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n = 1. Prove that for every integer k ≥ 2 there are integers a1, a2, . . . , an, not all zero, such that |ai| ≤ k − 1 for all i, and |a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn| ≤ (k − 1) √n/(kn − 1). 3. Given a set of n nonnegative numbers whose sum is 1, prove that there exist two disjoint subsets, not both empty, whose sums diﬀer by at most 1/(2 n − 1). Is this bound optimal for every n? 4. Let n be an odd positive integer and let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be nonnegative real numbers satisfying x1 + · · · + xn = y1 + · · · + yn. Show that there exists a proper, nonempty subset J ⊂ {1, . . . , n} such that n − 1 n + 1 ∑ j∈J xj ≤ ∑ j∈J yj ≤ n + 1 n − 1 ∑ j∈J xj. 5. Fix c with 1 < c < 2 and, for x1 < x2 < · · · < xn, call the (unordered) set {x1, x2, . . . , xn} “biased” if there exist 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n−1 such that xi+1−xi > c(xj+1−xj). Suppose s1, s2, . . . are distinct real numbers and 0 ≤ si ≤ 1 for all i. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many n such that the set {s1, s2, . . . , sn} is biased. 6. (Poland, 1998) For i = 1, 2, . . . , 7, ai and bi are nonnegative numbers such that ai + bi ≤ 2. Prove that there exist distinct indices i, j such that |ai − aj| + |bi − bj| ≤ 1. 7. Let n ≥ 3 be odd. Given numbers a1, . . . , an, b1, . . . , bn from the interval [0, 1], show that there exist distinct indices i, j such that 0 ≤ aibj − biaj ≤ 2/(n − 1). 8. (Hungary, 1997) We are given 111 unit vectors in the plane whose sum is zero. Show that there exist 55 of the vectors whose sum has length less than 1. 9. (IMO, 1997) Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be real numbers satisfying |x1 + · · · + xn| = 1 and |xi| ≤ (n + 1)/2 for all i. Show that there exists a permutation (yi) of (xi) such that |y1 + 2y2 + · · · + nyn| ≤ (n + 1)/2. 10. (Spain, 1997, adapted) The real numbers x1, . . . , xn have a sum of 0. Prove that there exists an index i such that xi + xi+1 + · · · + xj ≥ 0 for all i ≤ j < i + n, where the indices are deﬁned modulo n. 1 11. (Austria-Poland, 1995) Let v1, v2, . . . , v95 be three-dimensional vectors with all coor- dinates in the interval [−1, 1]. Show that among all vectors of the form s1v1 + s2v2 + · · · + s95v95, where si ∈ {−1, 1} for each i, there exists a vector (a, b, c) satisfying a2 + b2 + c2 ≤ 48. Can the bound of 48 be improved? 12. (Iran, 1999) Suppose that r1, r2, . . . , rn are real numbers. Prove that there exists S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , n} such that 1 ≤ |S ∩ {i, i + 1, i + 2}| ≤ 2 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 2, and \f \f \f \f ∑ i∈S ri \f \f \f \f ≥ 1 6 n∑ i=1 |ri|. 13. (USA, 1996) For any nonempty set S of real numbers, let σ(S) denote the sum of the elements of S. Given a set A of n positive numbers, consider the collection of all distinct sums σ(S) as S ranges over the nonempty subsets of A. Prove that this collection of sums can be partitioned into n classes so that, in each class, the ratio of the largest sum to the smallest sum does not exceed 2. 14. (Russia, 1997) 300 apples are given, no one of which weighs more than 3 times any other. Show that the apples may be divided into groups of 4 such that no group weighs more than 3/2 times any other group. 15. (Iran, 1999) Suppose that −1 ≤ x1, . . . , xn ≤ 1 are real numbers such that x1 + · · · + xn = 0. Prove that there exists a permutation σ such that, for every 1 ≤ p ≤ q ≤ n, |xσ(p) + xσ(p+1) + · · · + xσ(q−1) + xσ(q)| ≤ 2 − 1 n . 16. (Iran, 1996) For S = {x1, . . . , xn} a set of n real numbers, all at least 1, we count the number of reals of the form ∑n i=1 ϵixi, ϵ ∈ {0, 1} lying in an open interval I of length 1. Find the maximum value of this count over all I and S. 17. (Beatty’s Theorem) If α and β are positive irrationals satisfying 1/α + 1/β = 1, show that every interval (n, n + 1), where n is a positive integer, contains exactly one integer multiple of either α or β. 18. (Putnam, 1994) Let (rn) be a sequence of positive reals with limit 0. Let S be the set of all numbers expressible in the form ri1 + · · · + ri1994 for positive integers i1 < i2 < · · · < i1994. Prove that every interval (a, b) contains a subinterval (c, d) whose intersection with S is empty. 19. Let x1, . . . , xn be arbitrary real numbers. Prove that the number of pairs {i, j} satisfying 1 < |xi − xj| < 2 does not exceed n2/4. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
