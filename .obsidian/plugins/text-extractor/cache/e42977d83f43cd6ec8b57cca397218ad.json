All polynomial inequalities can be reduced to this, but most of the time you don’t want to try that. 2 Dumbassing If, when faced with a complicated three-variable homogenous polynomial inequality, your ﬁrst instinct is to clear all denominators and expand all expressions, then you’re a dumbass. This is not taken as an insult by sophisticated dumbass-ers, who value this technique highly, as it is very often applicable to simpler inqualities. In fact, sophisticated dumbassing methods exist (“Chinese dumbass notation”). You should remember that this is an option, but not one that you should choose readily. Unless you are careful, you’re likely to make a mistake somewhere and spend a long time trying to prove something incorrect (or trivial but unapplicable). Additionally, a dumbassing solution will likely make your grader angry at you and generally harsher on errors. 3 Convexity & Jensen’s Inequality Let I be the interval [a, b] and I ′ be the interval (a, b). A function f is said to be convex on I if and only if λf (x) + (1 − λ)f (y) ≥ f (λx + (1 − λ)y) for all x, y ∈ I and 0 ≤ λ ≤ 1. Functions with the inequality ﬂipped are said to be concave on I. (Weighted) Jensen’s inequality states that for any convex function f , reals x1, x2, · · · , xn, and positive reals ω1, ω2, · · · , ωn with n∑ i=1 ωi = 1, we have ω1f (x1) + ω2f (x2) + · · · + ωnf (xn) ≥ f (ω1x1 + ω2x2 + · · · + ωnxn) . This is called “unweighted Jensen’s” or just “Jensen’s” if all the weights ωi are 1/n. 3.1 How do I know a function is convex? You can immediately tell if you know calculus by taking the second derivative. Sometimes convex functions are called “concave up” and concave functions are called “concave down.” It’s well known that if f ′′(x) is greater than or equal to 0 for all x in an interval I, then f is convex on I. If the inequality is reversed, the function is concave. Note also that if −f is convex, then f is concave. Some functions you should immediately be able to recognize and claim as convex or concave are: constant functions (both convex and concave); powers of x so f (x) = x r are convex on the interval 0 < x < ∞ when r ≥ 1, concave when 0 < r ≤ 1; powers of 1 x are convex on 0 < x < ∞ for r > 0; the exponential function f (x) = e x is convex everywhere; and the logarithm f (x) = log x is concave on 0 < x < ∞. 1 4 Sturm’s Principle aka Smoothing Sometimes, it is most fruitful to turn to results from analysis when trying to prove an inequality. Sturm’s principle states that given a function f deﬁned on a set M and a point x0 ∈ M , if f has a maximum on M , and if no other point x in M is a maximum of f , then x0 is the maximum of f (replace all the instances of “maximum” there with “minimum” and it’s still true). To decide if a function f has a maxima or minima, we fall to the Theorem of Weierstrass: a continuous function on a bounded and closed domain assumes its maximum and minimum. As an example, let α1, α2, . . . , αn be positive real numbers, n ≥ 2, such that α1 + α2 + · · · + αn = 1. Then we want to prove that α1 1 + α2 + · · · + αn + α2 1 + α1 + · · · + αn + · · · + αn 1 + α1 + · · · + αn−1 ≥ n 2n − 1 If not all of the αis were equal, then one of them (say αj) must be less than 1 n and one of them (say αk) must be greater. Add a smallest number ϵ so that either αj + ϵ = 1 n or αk − ϵ = 1 n . Then stop and choose another pair. Continue this algorithm until all numbers become 1 n . At this point, the value of the expression is 1 n 1 2 − 1 n · n = n 2n − 1 . Since the process kept decreasing the value of the expression, initially it must have been greater than or equal to n 2n − 1 , which proves the inequality. 5 The AM-GM Inequality ω1a1 + ω2a2 + · · · + ωnan ≥ a ω1 1 a ω2 2 · · · a ωn n for any positive x1, x2, · · · , xn and ω1, ω2, · · · , ωn with n∑ i=1 ωi = 1. This is a direct result of weighted Jensen on the exponential function, and we have equality when all the variables are equal. This is called the weighted AM-GM inequality. When all the ωi are 1/n, it becomes the unweighted AM-GM inequality. An expression of the form x x is a big hint to use the weighted AM-GM inequality. 6 The AM-HM Inequality ω1a1 + ω2a2 + · · · + ωnan ≥ 1 ω1 a1 + ω2 a2 + · · · + ωn an for any positive x1, x2, · · · , xn and ω1, ω2, · · · , ωn with n∑ i=1 ωi = 1. This is proven by applying weighted AM-GM twice. 7 The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality The following inequality has far more uses than its statement seems to allow. ∥u∥∥v∥ ≥ |u · v| for every u, v. In other words, (a 2 1 + a 2 2 + · · · + a 2 n) (b2 1 + b2 2 + · · · + b2 n) ≥ (a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) 2 . This holds for any real numbers a1, a2, · · · , an, b1, b2, · · · , bn. 2 8 Schur’s Inequality Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals and r > 0. Then a r(a − b)(a − c) + br(b − c)(b − a) + c r(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0 with equality if and only if a = b = c or some two of a, b, c are equal and the other is 0. This inequality can be made considerably sharper, but such results are nonstandard. 9 Techniques 9.1 Induction Don’t forget about induction when working with inequalities in n variables. Remember that when the problem is about x1, x2, · · · , xn, you don’t always have to apply the inductive hypothesis to x1, x2, · · · , xn−1 - sometimes you might want to apply it to diﬀerent numbers. 9.2 Equality cases Several of the inequalities you will prove will involve ≥ and ≤ relations rather than > and < rela- tions. Find when the two sides of the inequality are equal and make sure only to apply inequalities that respect this equality case. 9.3 Homogenization Polynomial inequalities of several variables with certain constraints can be homogenized. For example, x 2 + y2 + z2 ≥ 3 for x + y + z = 3 can be replaced with the homogeneous x 2 + y2 + z2 ≥ (x + y + z)2 3 . Note that in the homogeneous inequality, the constraint can be dropped. 9.4 Substitution Often, constraints can be rewritten as substitutions. For example, the constraint that abc = 1 can be rewritten as a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x for some x, y, z. Also, if a, b, c are the sides of a triangle, then there are positive p, q, r with a = p + q, b = q + r, c = r + p. 9.5 Assuming an order When given variables in a symmetric inequality, it is sometimes beneﬁcial to assume (without loss of generality) that the variables are in sorted order. 10 Problems 1.
