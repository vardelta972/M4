(a) Let n be a positive integer. In how many ways can one write a sum of at least two positive integers that add up to n? Consider the same set of integers written in a diﬀerent order as being diﬀerent. (For example, there are 3 ways to express 3 as 3 = 1 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 1 + 2.) (b) Let m, n be positive integers. Determine the number of m-tuples of positive integers (x1, x2, . . . , xm) satisfying x1 + x2 + · · · + xm = n. (c) Let m, n be positive integers. Determine the number of m-tuples of nonnegative integers (x1, x2, . . . , xm) satisfying x1 + x2 + · · · + xm = n. 2. Determine the number of paths from (0, 0) to (m, n) following the gridlines and moving in the up or right directions. 1.1 Catalan numbers Let us deﬁne the nth Catalan number Cn by Cn = 1 n + 1 (2n n ) . So (C0, C1, . . . ) = (1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, . . . ). There are a huge number of combinatorial interpretations of these numbers1, and we’ll discuss some of them in lecture, and leave a few more as exercise in the next section. There are two main way of handling these problems: bijection and recurrence. The bijections often tend to be very elegant, while the recurrence method tend to be more routine. We focus on the bijection perspective but we also brieﬂy discuss the recurrence method. 1. Show that the number of lattice paths from (0, 0) to (n, n) using only up moves and right moves, and never stepping above the x = y line, is Cn. E.g., for n = 4, 1See http://www-math.mit.edu/~rstan/ec/ for a list of (currently) 161 interpretations. 1 Winter Camp 2008 Combinatorics Yufei Zhao 2. Show that the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, ((())) (()()) (())() ()(()) ()()() 3. Show that the number of plane trees with n + 1 vertices is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, 4. Show that the number of complete binary trees with n internal vertices is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, 5. Show that the number of ways that n + 1 factors can be completely parenthesized is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, (((ab)c)d) ((a(bc))d) ((ab)(cd)) (a((bc)d)) (a(b(cd))) A word about recursion. Try to show that every interpretation above gives the recurrence relation Cn = Cn−1C0 + Cn−2C1 + · · · + C1Cn−2 + C0Cn−1. This is not too hard. It is mostly about how to break up a “Catalan problem” into two smaller “Catalan subproblems.” Now, if we turn the table around and ask: given recurrence relation (and the initial conditions of course), how can we arrive at the formula Cn = 1 2n+1 (2n n )? This is also rather diﬃcult unless you have seen it before. The most standard way is through generating functions (if you know generating functions, you should try to work out this computation yourself). 1.2 More Catalan exercises 1. Show that the number of triangulations of a convex (n + 2)-gon is Cn. E.g., for n = 4, 2. Show that the number of ways to tile a stairstep shape of height n with n rectangles is Cn. E.g., for n = 4, 2 Winter Camp 2008 Combinatorics Yufei Zhao 3. Show that the number of ways of stacking coins in the plane so that the bottom row consists of n consecutive coins is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, 4. Show that the number of ways of drawing n nonintersecting chords joining 2n given points on a circle is Cn. E.g., for n = 3, 5. Show that Cn equals to the number of (unordered) pairs of lattice paths with n + 1 steps each, starting at (0, 0), using steps (1, 0) or (0, 1), ending at the same point, and only intersecting at the beginning and end. E.g., for n = 3, r r r rr r r r r r r r rrr r r r r r rrr r r r r r rr rr r r r r rrrr 1.3 More bijections 1. A triangular grid is obtained by tiling an equilateral triangle of side length n by n2 equilateral triangles of side length 1. Determine the number of parallelograms bounded by line segments of the grid. 2. Form a 2000 × 2002 screen with unit screens. Initially, there are more than 1999 × 2001 unit screens which are on. In any 2 × 2 screen, as soon as there are 3 unit screens which are oﬀ, the 4th screen turns oﬀ automatically. Prove that the whole screen can never be totally oﬀ. 3. (Putnam 2003) A Dyck n-path is a lattice path of n upsteps (1, 1) and n downsteps (1, −1) that starts at the origin and never dips below the x-axis. A return is a maximal sequence of contiguous downsteps that terminates on the x-axis. For example, the Dyck 5-path illustrated has two returns, of length 3 and 1 respectively.

(Canada 2005) Consider an equilateral triangle of side length n, which is divided into unit triangles, as shown. Let f (n) be the number of paths from the triangle in the top row to the middle triangle in the bottom row, such that adjacent triangles in our path share a common edge and the path never travels up (from a lower row to a higher row) or revisits a triangle. An example of one such path is illustrated below for n = 5. Determine the value of f (2005). 3 Winter Camp 2008 Combinatorics Yufei Zhao 37th Canadian Mathematical Olympiad Wednesday, March 30, 2005 1. Consider an equilateral triangle of side length n, which is divided into unit triangles, as shown. Let f (n) be the number of paths from the triangle in the top row to the middle triangle in the bottom row, such that adjacent triangles in our path share a common edge and the path never travels up (from a lower row to a higher row) or revisits a triangle.

Let S be a set of n ≥ 3 points in the interior of a circle. a) Show that there are three distinct points a, b, c ∈ S and three distinct points A, B, C on the circle such that a is (strictly) closer to A than any other point in S, b is closer to B than any other point in S and c is closer to C than any other point in S. b) Show that for no value of n can four such points in S (and corresponding points on the circle) be guaranteed. 4. Let ABC be a triangle with circumradius R, perimeter P and area K. Determine the maximum value of KP/R3. 5. Let’s say that an ordered triple of positive integers (a, b, c)is n-powerful if a ≤ b ≤ c,gcd(a, b, c)=1, and a n + bn + cn is divisible by a + b + c. For example, (1, 2, 2) is 5-powerful. a) Determine all ordered triples (if any) which are n-powerful for all n ≥ 1. b) Determine all ordered triples (if any) which are 2004-powerful and 2005-powerful, but not 2007- powerful.

Determine the number of paths in S starting at (1, 1) and ending at (n, 1), with unit steps and passing through all the points in S exactly once each. 6. (IMO Shortlist 2002) Let n be a positive integer. Each point (x, y) in the plane, where x and y are non-negative integers with x + y < n, is colored red or blue, subject to the following condition: if a point (x, y) is red, then so are all points (x′, y′) with x′ ≤ x and y′ ≤ y. Let A be the number of ways to choose n blue points with distinct x-coordinates, and let B be the number of ways to choose n blue points with distinct y-coordinates. Prove that A = B. 7. (USAMO 1996) An n-term sequence (x1, x2, . . . , xn) in which each term is either 0 or 1 is called a binary sequence of length n. Let an be the number of binary sequences of length n containing no three consecutive terms equal to 0, 1, 0 in that order. Let bn be the number of binary sequences of length n that contain no four consecutive terms equal to 0, 0, 1, 1 or 1, 1, 0, 0 in that order. Prove that bn+1 = 2an for all positive integers n. 8. Along a one-way street there are n parking lots, and n cars numbered 1 to n enter the street in that order. Each driver of the ith car heads to his favorite parking lot ai ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, and, if it is free, he occupies it. Otherwise, he continues to the next free lot and occupies it. But if all succeeding lots are occupied, he leaves for good. How many sequences (a1, a2, . . . , an) are there such that every driver can park? 9. (IMO Shortlist 2002) Let n be a positive integer. A sequence of n positive integers (not necessarily distinct) is called full if it satisﬁed the following condition: for each positive integer k ≥ 2, if the number k appears in the sequence then so does the number k − 1, and moreover the ﬁrst occurrence of k − 1 comes before the last occurrence of k. For each n, show that there are n! full sequences. 10. (IMO Shortlist 2005) In an m × n rectangular board of mn unit squares, adjacent squares are ones with a common edge, and a path is a sequence of squares in which any two consecutive squares are adjacent. Each square of the board can be colored black or white. Let N denote the number of colorings of the board such that there exists at least one black path from the left edge of the board to its right edge, and let M denote the number of colorings in which there exist at least two non-intersecting black paths from the left edge to the right edge. Prove that N 2 ≥ M · 2 mn. 2 Counting in two ways 1. (IMC 2002) Two hundred students participated in a mathematical contest. They had six problems to solve. It is known that each problem was correctly solved by at least 120 participants. Prove that there must be two participants such that every problem was solved by at least one of these two students. 2. (IMO 1998) In a competition, there are a contestants and b judges, where b ≥ 3 is an odd integer. Each judge rates each contestant as either “pass” or “fail”. Suppose k is a number such that, for any two judges, their ratings coincide for at most k contestants. Prove that k a ≥ b − 1 2b . 4 Winter Camp 2008 Combinatorics Yufei Zhao 3.

Suppose that there exists a 2n-element set T such that (a) each element of T is an m-element subset of Sm; (b) each pair of elements of T shares at most one common element; and (c) each element of Sm is contained in exactly two elements of T . Determine the maximum possible value of m in terms of n. 7. (China TST 1992) Sixteen students took part in a math competition where every problem was a multiple choice question with four choices. After the contest, it is found that any two students had at most one answer in common. Determine the maximum number of questions. 8. (IMO Shortist 2000) Let n ≥ 4 be a ﬁxed positive integer. Let S = {P1, P2, . . . } be a set of n points in the plane such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic. Let at, 1 ≤ t ≤ n, denote the number of circles PiPjPk that contain Pt in their interiors, and let m(S) = a1 + a2 + · · · + an.
