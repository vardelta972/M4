Prove that there exist quadratic poly- nomials g(x) and h(x) such that f (x)f (x + 1) = g(h(x)). (University of Toronto Math Competition 2010) Solution: The standard approach would be to write f (x) = ax2 + bx + c and play around with the coeﬃcients of f (x)f (x + 1). It is doable, but quite messy. Let us look at the roots. Let f (x) = a(x − r)(x − s), then: f (x)f (x + 1) = a 2 · (x − r)(x − s + 1) · (x − s)(x − r + 1) = = a 2([x2 − (r + s − 1)x + rs] − r)([x2 − (r + s − 1)x + rs] − s) and we are done by setting g(x) = a2(x − r)(x − s), h(x) = x2 − (r + s − 1)x + rs. Warm-up Problem 2: The polynomial f (x) = xn + a1xn−1 + a2xn−2 + · · · + an−1x + an = 0 with integer non-zero coeﬃcients has n distinct integer roots. Prove that if the roots are pairwise coprime, then an−1 and an are coprime. (Russian Math Olympiad 2004) Solution: Assume gcd(an−1, an) ̸= 1, then both an−1 and an are divisible by some prime p. Let the roots of the polynomial be r1, r2, · · · , rn. Then r1r2 · · · rn = (−1)nan. This is divisible p, so at least one of the roots, wolog r1, is divisible by p. We also have: r1r2 · · · rn−1 + r1r3r4 · · · rn−1 + · · · + r2r3 · · · rn = (−1) n−1an−1 ≡ 0 mod p All terms containing r1 are divisible by p, hence r2r3 · · · rn is divisible by p. Hence gcd(r1, r2r3 · · · rn) is divisible by p contradicting the fact that the roots are pairwise coprime. The result follows. 1 Algebra Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: A polynomial P (x) of degree n with complex coeﬃcients has n complex roots. It can be uniquely factored as: P (x) = a(x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn) Vieta’s Formulas: Let P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 with complex coeﬃcients have roots r1, r2, · · · , rn. Then: n∑ i=1 ri = (−1) 1 an−1 an ; ∑ i<j rirj = (−1) 2 an−2 an ; · · · r1r2 · · · rn = (−1) n a0 an 1 Winter Camp 2011 Polynomials Alexander Remorov Bezout’s Theorem: A polynomial P (x) is divisible by (x − a) iﬀ P (a) = 0. Lagrange Interpolation: Given n points (x1, y1), · · · , (xn, yn), there is a unique polynomial P (x) satisfying P (xi) = yi. Its explicit formula is: P (x) = n∑ i=1 yi ∏ 1≤j≤n,j̸=i x − xj xi − xj A few general tricks related to polynomials: • Look at the roots. If you want to show a polynomial is identically 0, it is sometimes useful to look at an arbitrary root r of this polynomial, and then show the polynomial must have another root, e.g. r + 1, thus producing a sequence of inﬁnitely many roots. • Look at the coeﬃcients. This is particularly useful when the coeﬃcients are integers. It is often a good idea to look at the leading coeﬃcient and the constant term. • Consider the degrees of polynomials. If P (x) is divisible by Q(x) where P, Q are polynomials, then deg(Q) ≤ deg(P ). A straight-forward fact, yet a useful one. • Perform clever algebraic manipulations, such as factoring, expanding, introducing new poly- nomials, substituting other values for x, e.g. x + 1, 1 x , etc. 1.1 Warm-up 1. Let P (x) and Q(x) be polynomials with real coeﬃcients such that P (x) = Q(x) for all real values of x. Prove that P (x) = Q(x) for all complex values of x. 2. (a) Determine all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x2) = P 2(x). (b) Determine all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x2) = P (x)P (x + 1). (c) Suppose P (x) is a polynomial such that P (x − 1) + P (x + 1) = 2P (x) for all real x. Prove that P (x) has degree at most 1. 3. (USAMO 1975) A polynomial P (x) of degree n satisﬁes P (k) = k k + 1 for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., n. Find P (n + 1). 1.2 Problems 1. (Brazil 2007) Let P (x) = x2 + 2007x + 1. Prove that for every positive integer n, the equation P (P (. . . (P (x)) . . .)) = 0 has at least one real solution, where the composition is performed n times. 2. (Russia 2002) Among the polynomials P (x), Q(x), R(x) with real coeﬃcients at least one has degree two and one has degree three. If P 2(x) + Q2(x) = R2(x) prove that one of the polynomials of degree three has three real roots. 3. Let P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that |a0| is prime and |a0| > |a1 + a2 + · · · + an|. Prove that P (x) is irreducible (that is, cannot be factored into two polynomials with integer coeﬃcients of degree at least 1). 2 Winter Camp 2011 Polynomials Alexander Remorov 4.

(Russia 1997) Does there exist a set S of non-zero real numbers such that for any positive integer n there exists a polynomial P (x) with degree at least n, all the roots and all the coeﬃcients of which are from S? 6. (Putnam 2010) Find all polynomials P (x), Q(x) with real coeﬃcients such that P (x)Q(x + 1) − P (x + 1)Q(x) = 1. 7. (IMO SL 2005) Let a, b, c, d, e, f be positive integers. Suppose that S = a + b + c + d + e + f divides both abc + def and ab + bc + ca − de − ef − f d. Prove that S is composite. 8. (USAMO 2002) Prove that any monic polynomial (a polynomial with leading coeﬃcient 1) of degree n with real coeﬃcients can be written as the average of two monic polynomials of degree n with n real roots. 9. (Iran TST 2010) Find all two-variable polynomials P (x, y) such that for any real numbers a, b, c: P (ab, c 2 + 1) + P (bc, a 2 + 1) + P (ca, b 2 + 1) = 0 10. (China TST 2007) Prove that for any positive integer n, there exists exactly one polynomial P (x) of degree n with real coeﬃcients, such that P (0) = 1 and (x + 1)(P (x))2 − 1 is an odd function. (A function f (x) is odd if f (x) = −f (−x) for all x). 2 Number Theory By Z[x] we denote all the polynomials of one variable with integer coeﬃcients. Arguably the most useful property when it comes to polynomials and integers is: If P (x) ∈ Z[x], and a, b are integers, then (a − b)|(P (a) − P (b)) Recall that polynomial in Z[x] is irreducible over the integers if it cannot be factored into two polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Eisenstein’s Criterion: Let P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + ... + a1x + a0 ∈ Z[x] be a polynomial and p be a prime dividing a0, a1, ..., an−1, such that p ∤ an and p2 ∤ a0. Then P (x) is irreducible. Proof : Assume P (x) = Q(x)R(x), where Q(x) = bkxk + bk−1xk−1 + ... + b1x + b0, R(x) = clxl + cl−1xl−1 + ... + c1x + c0. Then b0c0 is divisible by p but not p2. Wolog p|b0, p ∤ c0. Since p|a1 = b1c0 + b0c1 it follows that p|b1. Since p|a2 = b2c0 + b1c1 + b0c2 it follows that p|b2. By induction it follows that p|bk which implies that p|an, a contradiction. Lemma [Schur] Let P (x) ∈ Z[x] be a non-constant polynomial. Then there are inﬁnitely many primes dividing at least one of the non-zero terms in the sequence P (1), P (2), P (3), .... Proof : Assume ﬁrst that P (0) = 1. There exists an integer M such that P (n) ̸= 1 for all n > M (or else P (x)−1 has inﬁnitely many roots and therefore is constant). We also have P (n!) ≡ 1( mod n!), and by taking arbitrarily large integers n we can generate arbitrarily large primes dividing P (n!). 3 Winter Camp 2011 Polynomials Alexander Remorov If P (0) = 0, the result is obvious. Otherwise consider Q(x) = P (xP (0)) P (0) and apply the same line of reasoning to Q(x); the result follows. For polynomials in Z[x] it is often useful to work modulo a positive integer k. If P (x) = ∑n i=0 aixi ∈ Z[x] and k is a positive integer we call P (x) = ∑n i=0 aixi the reduction of P (x) (mod k), where ai = ai (mod k). Some useful facts about reduced polynomials: 1. Let P (x), Q(x), R(x), S(x) ∈ Z[x], such that P (x) = (Q(x) + R(x))S(x). Then P (x) = (Q(x) + R(x))(S(x)). 2. Let p be a prime and P (x) ∈ Z[x]. Then the factorization of P (x) is unique modulo p (more formally, in Fp[x] up to permutation.) Note that this result does not hold when p is not a prime. For example, x = (2x + 3)(3x + 2) mod 6 if x, 2x + 3, 3x + 2 are prime. Also remember that all roots of P (x) modulo p are in the set {0, 1, . . . , p − 1}. 2.1 Warm-Up 1. (a) Let p be a prime number. Prove that P (x) = xp−1 + xp−2 + ... + x + 1 is irreducible. (b) Prove Eisenstein’s Criterion by considering a reduction modulo p. 2. (Iran 2007) Does there exist a sequence of integers a0, a1, a2, ... such that gcd(ai, aj) = 1 for i ̸= j, and for every positive integer n, the polynomial n∑ i=0 aix i is irreducible? 3. (a) (Bezout) Let P (x), Q(x) be polynomials with integer coeﬃcients such that P (x), Q(x) do not have any roots in common. Prove that there exist polynomials A(x), B(x) and an integer N such that A(x)P (x) + B(x)Q(x) = N . (b) Let P (x), Q(x) be monic non-constant irreducible polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. For all suﬃciently large n, P (n) and Q(n) have the same prime divisors. Prove that P (x) ≡ Q(x). 2.2 Problems 1. (a) (USAMO 1974)Let a, b, c be three distinct integers. Prove that there does not exist a polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients such that P (a) = b, P (b) = c, P (c) = a. (b) (IMO 2006) Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coeﬃcients and let k be a positive integer. Let Q(x) = P (P (. . . P (P (x)) . . .)), where the polynomial P is composed k times. Prove that there are at most n integers t such that Q(t) = t. 2. (Romania TST 2007) Let P (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial of degree n ≥ 3 with integer coeﬃcients such that P (m) is even for all even integers m. Furthermore, a0 is even, and ak + an−k is even for k = 1, 2, ..., n − 1. Suppose P (x) = Q(x)R(x) where Q(x), R(x) are polynomials with integer coeﬃcients, deg Q ≤ deg R, and all coeﬃcients of R(x) are odd. Prove that P (x) has an integer root. 3. (USA TST 2010) Let P (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that P (0) = 0 and gcd(P (0), P (1), P (2), . . .) = 1. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many positive integers n such that gcd(P (n) − P (0), P (n + 1) − P (1), P (n + 2) − P (2), . . .) = n. 4 Winter Camp 2011 Polynomials Alexander Remorov 4.

(China TST 2006) Prove that for any n ≥ 2, there exists a polynomial P (x) = xn+an−1xn−1+ ... + a1x + a0 such that: (a) a0, a1, ..., an−1 all are non-zero. (b) P (x) is irreducible. (c) For any integer x, |P (x)| is not prime. 6. (Russia 2006) A polynomial (x + 1)n − 1 is divisible by a polynomial P (x) = xk + ak−1xk−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 of even degree k, such that all of its coeﬃcients are odd integers. Prove that n is divisible by k + 1. 7. (USAMO 2006) For an integer m, let p(m) be the greatest prime divisor of m. By convention, we set p(±1) = 1 and p(0) = ∞.
