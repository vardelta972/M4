(IMO Short list 1988, #22) Suppose integers x1, x2, . . . , xp exist. We will show that p = 2 or 6. Note that: LHS = p∑ i=1 x2 i − 4 4p + 1 · ( p∑ i=1 xi )2 = 1 4p + 1 · p∑ i=1 x2 i + 4 4p + 1 ·  p · p∑ i=1 x 2 i − ( p∑ i=1 xi )2  = 1 4p + 1 · p∑ i=1 x2 i + 4 4p + 1 ·   ∑ 1≤i<j≤p(xi − xj) 2   . Suppose xi takes on at least 3 values, with a numbers taking on the minimum value, c numbers taking on the maximum value, and b numbers taking on intermediate values. Then,∑ 1≤i<j≤p(xi − xj)2 ≥ ac · 22 + ab · 12 + bc · 12 ≥ 4a + b + c ≥ p + 3, and LHS > 1. Therefore, xi can take on at most 2 diﬀerent values. If all the xi are equal to some value n, then LHS = pn2 4p+1 . If p = 1, then this has no solutions because 5 is not a square. If p > 1, then the factor of p in the numerator can never be canceled out, so there are no solutions in this case either. Assume now that p > 2. Let a numbers take the value A, and b numbers take the value B. Suppose that |A − B| > 1, then LHS ≥ 4 4p + 1 · (4ab) ≥ 16(p − 1) 4p + 1 > 1 since p > 1. So we can assume that |A − B| = 1. Now assume that neither A nor B are equal to 0. Then LHS ≥ (p − 1) + 4 4p + 1 + 4(p − 1) 4p + 1 = 5p − 1 4p + 1 which is bigger than 1 since p > 2. So we can further assume A = 0. Then LHS = b + 4ab 4p + 1 . 1 If b = 1, then a = p − 1 and LHS = 4p−3 4p+1 ̸= 1. If b ∈ [2, p − 2], then p ≥ 4, ab ≥ 2p − 4, and LHS ≥ 8p−14 4p+1 > 1. If b = p − 1, then a = 1 and LHS = 5p−5 4p+1 , which is 1 only if p = 6. This proves that p must equal 2 or 6. Conversely, if p = 2, we can take {x1, x2} = {1, 2}, and if p = 6, we can take {x1, x2, . . . , x6} = {0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1}. 2. (IMO Short list 2008, C5) If k = l = 1, the claim is trivial, so we will assume that k + l > 2. Consider a permutation {y1, y2, . . . , yk+l} of S. Now look at the k + l k-element subsets Ai = {yi, yi+1, . . . , yi+k−1}, i = {1, 2, ..., k + l} where all indices are taken mod k + l. Claim 1: At least 2 of the Ai are nice. Deﬁne f (Ai) = 1 k ∑ xj ∈Ai xj − 1 l ∑ xj ∈S\\Ai xj. Notice that f (A1) + f (A2) + · · · + f (Ak+l) = 0. (This is because each element xj appears in Ai for k diﬀerent values of i, and it appears in S\\Ai for l diﬀerent values of i.) Also, |f (Ai+1) − f (Ai)| = \f \f \f \f xi+k − xi k + xi+k − xi l \f \f \f \f ≤ 1 k + 1 l . Therefore if Ai and Ai+1 are of diﬀerent signs1, then either |f (Ai)| or |f (Ai+1| is at most 1 2 · ( 1 k + 1 l ) = k+l 2kl , and therefore one of Ai, Ai+1 is nice. Since the sum of the f (Ai) is 0, we must have at least 1 negative and 1 positive sign (unless they’re all 0 which is silly). If there exist 2 disjoint sets {i, i + 1}, {j, j + 1} such that f (Ai), f (Ai+1) and f (Aj), f (Aj+1) are of opposite signs, then by above we have at least two nice sets. Otherwise, exactly one f (Ai) is of a diﬀerent sign from the rest. Assume wlog that f (A1) ≥ 0 and for i ̸= 1, f (Ai) < 0. If A1 is not nice, than both Ak+l and A2 are nice, so we have found our two nice sets. Otherwise, f (A1) ≤ k+l 2kl , and ∑ i̸=1 |f (Ai)| = f (A1) ≤ k+l 2kl , so every set must be nice. This ﬁnishes the proof of Claim 1. Now, consider choosing a random permutation {y1, y2, . . . , yk+l}, and then choosing a random Ai corresponding to this permutation. By Claim 1, this chooses a nice set with probability at least 2 k+l . On the other hand, this is equivalent to ﬁrst choosing the shift i and then the permutation {y1, y2, . . . , yk+l}, but once i is ﬁxed, we will be equally likely to choose any possible set. Therefore, this entire process chooses a set uniformly at random, so it follows that at least 2 k+l · (k+l k ) sets are nice. 3. Ukraine 2008,11.8 Solution 1: Denote the angles of triangle ABC by a, b, c, and let ∠A1BC = ∠A1AB = x,∠A1CB = ∠A1AC = y. Then ∠ABA1 = b − x, and so ∠BA1A = 180 − b. Similarly, ∠CA1A = 180 − c, and so ∠BA1C = 180 − a. Therefore, if we let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC, CBA1H are concyclic. 1We consider 0 to be of positive sign. 2 Denote the circle they lie on by S1. Do a dilation centered at A with factor 1 2 , and let S1 transform to S2. Then denoting the midpoints of ABC by A′, B′, C′, we know that S2 contains B′, C′, and the midpoint of AH, so it must be the nine-point circle. So S2 passes through B0, B′, C0 and C′ as well. Notice that since S1 passed through A1, A2 lies on the nine-point circle. We will prove A2A0, B2B0, C2C0 are concurrent using Sine-Ceva’s theorem on triangle A0B0C0. Let B′′ denote the image of B0 under the dilation centered at A with factor 2. We have sin ∠A2A0B0 = sin ∠A2B′B0 by concyclicity = sin ∠A1CB′′ by dilating around A = sin ∠A1CA = AA1 · sin ∠AA1C AC by sine law for AA1C = AA1 AC sin c Similarly, sin ∠A2A0C0 = AA1 AB sin b. Applying Sine-Ceva to A0B0C0, sin ∠A2A0B0 sin ∠B2B0C0 sin ∠C2C0A0 sin ∠A2A0C0 sin ∠B2B0A0 sin ∠C2C0B0 = 1, so the 3 lines are concurrent and we’re done. A B C A0 B0 C0 H A1 A2 B’C’ B’’ C’’ Solution 2: Let A′ denote the intersection of AA2 and BC. The given condition implies that the circum- circle of △AA1B is tangent to BC at B, and the circumcircle of △AA1C is tangent to BC at 3 C. Since A′ is on the radical axis of these two circles, it follows that BA′ = CA′, and hence A′ is the midpoint of BC. Also let B′ and C′ denote the midpoints of AC and AB. Now, as in the other solution, note that A2 lies on the nine-point circle, and hence C0, A2, B0, A′, and A0 are concyclic. Therefore, ∠C0A0A2 = ∠C0A′A2 = ∠C0A′A. By the sine law, sin ∠C0A′A = AC0 · sin ∠BAA′ A′C0 . Now, BC0C is a right triangle with circumcenter A′ so A′C0 = A′B, and sin ∠C0A′A = (AC cos A) · sin ∠BAA′ A′B = (AC cos A) · sin ∠AA′B AB . Similarly, sin ∠B0AA′ = (AB cos A) · sin ∠AA′C AC , so sin ∠C0A′A sin ∠B0A′A = AC2 AB2 . Therefore, sin ∠C0A0A2 sin ∠B0A0A2 · sin ∠A0C0C2 sin ∠C0B0B2 · sin ∠B0B0B2 sin ∠A0C0C2 = AC2 AB2 · AB2 BC2 · BC2 AC2 = 1. The result now follows from Sine Ceva on △A0B0C0.
