Let’s start with a couple of warm up problems. Problem. Let a, m, n be positive integers. Prove that gcd(an − 1, am − 1) = agcd(m,n) − 1. Solution. Using the identity xk−1 x−1 = xk−1 + · · · + x + 1, we know that ae − 1 | ad − 1 whenever e | d, so agcd(m,n)−1 divides both an − 1, and am − 1. On the other hand, if r divides both an − 1 and am − 1, then r must be relatively prime to a, so a can be inverted mod r. There exists integers s, t such that sn + tm = gcd(m, n). So agcd(m,n) ≡ asn+tm ≡ (a n) s(am) t ≡ 1 (mod r). Any common divisor of an − 1 and am − 1 must be a divisor of agcd(m,n) − 1 as well. This proves that gcd(an − 1, am − 1) = agcd(m,n) − 1. Another approach is to use the Euclidean algorithm. If m > n, say, then gcd(a n − 1, a m − 1) = gcd(a n − 1, a m − 1 − a m−n(an − 1)) = gcd(an − 1, a m−n − 1). So the the Euclidean algorithm process that gives us gcd(n, m) = d also gives us gcd(an − 1, am − 1) = ad − 1. For a prime number p and a nonnegative integer k, write pk ∥ n to mean that pk | n and pk+1 ∤ n. In this case we say that n is exactly divisible by pk. Problem. Let k be a nonnegative integer. Prove that 3k+1 ∥ 23k + 1. From Euler’s theorem, we know that 3k+1 | 22·3k − 1 = (23k + 1)(23k − 1). We have 23k − 1 ≡ (−1)3k − 1 ≡ 1 (mod 3). So 3k+1 | 23k + 1. However, this doesn’t show us that 3k+2 ∤ 23k + 1, so we adopt a diﬀerent approach. Solution. We use induction on k. We can check for k = 0. Suppose that k ≥ 1 and 3k ∥ 23k−1 +1. We would like to show 3k+1 ∥ 23k + 1. It suﬃces to show that (23k + 1)/(23k−1 + 1) is divisible by 3 but not 9. We can check this by hand when k = 1. For k ≥ 2, we have 23k + 1 23k−1 + 1 = (2 ·3k−1) 2 − 2 3k−1 + 1 ≡ (−1) 2 − (−1) + 1 ≡ 3 (mod 3k) by the induction hypothesis, and hence it is divisibly by 3 but not 9. The previous problem showed us a useful technique, whose idea is captured in the following lemma. 1 Trinity Training 2011 a n ± 1 Yufei Zhao Lemma. (Exponent lifting trick) Let a ≥ 2, k ≥ 1, ℓ ≥ 0 be integers, p a prime number. Suppose (p, k) ̸= (2, 1), and pk ∥ a − 1 and p ℓ ∥ n. Then p k+ℓ ∥ a n − 1. When n = pℓ, we obtain the conclusion that pkpℓ ∥ apℓ − 1, so that pℓ is “lifted” into the exponent. We give two proofs of the lemma. The ﬁrst proof uses induction following ideas in the previous problem, whereas the second proof does not use induction. First proof. Write n = pℓm, where p ∤ m. Use induction on ℓ. When ℓ = 0, am − 1 = (a − 1)(a m−1 + am−2 + · · · + a + 1) where am−1 + am−2 + · · · + a + 1 ≡ 1m−1 + 1m−2 + · · · + 1 + 1 = m (mod pk), and hence not divisible by p. Thus pk ∥ am − 1. This concludes the base case ℓ = 0. For the inductive step, it suﬃces to show that pk+ℓ ∥ an − 1 implies pk+ℓ+1 ∥ anp − 1. This amounts to showing that anp−1 an−1 is divisibly by p by not p2. We have anp − 1 an − 1 = an(p−1) + an(p−2) + · · · + a n + 1 ≡ 1 + 1 + · · · + 1 + 1 = p (mod pk+ℓ). We are done unless k + ℓ = 1, i.e., (k, ℓ) = (1, 0), which we deal with separately. Assume (k, ℓ) = (1, 0). Let am − 1 = pb where p ∤ b. We would like to show that p2 ∥ apm − 1. We have apm − 1 = (1 + pb)p − 1 = p 2b + p∑ i=2 ( p i )p ib i. Since p ̸= 2 (excluded as (p, k) ̸= (2, 1)), p3 divides all the terms except for the ﬁrst term. Therefore apm − 1 is divisible by p2 but not p3. Second proof. Write a = pkb + 1 where p ∤ b. We have an − 1 = (p kb + 1)n − 1 = np kb + n∑ i=2 ( n i ) pkib i. We have pk+ℓ ∥ npkb. It suﬃces to show that pk+ℓ+1 | (n i )pkibi for each i ≥ 2. Note that ( n i ) pkib i = n i (n − 1 i − 1 ) pkib i = npk pk(i−1) i ( n − 1 i − 1 ) b i. This number is always divisible by pk+ℓ+1 since the exponent of p in pk(i−1) i is always positive for i ≥ 2 as (p, k) ̸= (2, 1). Practice problems: 1. A primitive root mod n is a number g such that the smallest positive integer k for which gk ≡ 1 mod n is ϕ(n). 2 Trinity Training 2011 a n ± 1 Yufei Zhao (a) Show that 2 is a primitive root mod 3n for any n ≥ 1. (b) Show that if g is an odd primitive root mod p such that p2 ∤ gp−1 − 1, then g is also a primitive root mod pn and 2pn for any n ≥ 1. 2. (Cyclotomic polynomials) For a positive integer n, deﬁne the polynomial Φn(x) by Φn(x) = ∏ 1≤k≤n gcd(n,k)=1 (x − e 2πik n ). (a) Prove the polynomial identity ∏d|n Φd(x) = xn − 1, where the product is taken over all divisors d of n. (b) Prove that Φn(x) is an integer polynomial. (c) Let m and n be positive integers, and let p be a prime divisor of Φn(m). Prove that either p | n or n | p − 1. (d) (Special case of Dirichlet’s theorem) Prove that for every positive integer n, there are inﬁnitely many primes p with p ≡ 1 (mod n). 3. (IMO 2003) Let p be a prime number. Prove that there exists a prime number q such that for every integer n, np − p is not divisible by q. 4. (a) Prove that Φm(x) and Φn(x) are always relatively prime as polynomials for m ̸= n. (b) Show that if for some integer x, Φm(x) and Φn(x) are not relative prime, then m/n is an integer power of a prime. 5. Let p1, p2, . . . , pk be distinct primes greater than 3. Let N = 2p1p2···pk + 1. (a) (IMO Shortlist 2002) Show that N has at least 4n divisors. (b) Show that N has at least 22k−1 divisors. (Hint: use cyclotomic polynomials) 6. (IMO 1990) Determine all positive integers n such that 2n + 1 n2 is an integer. 7. (IMO 2000) Does there exist a positive integer N which is divisible by exactly 2000 diﬀerent prime numbers and such that 2N + 1 is divisible by N ? 8. Let N be a positive integer ending in digits 25, and m a positive integer. Prove that for some positive integer n, the rightmost m digits of 5n and N agree in parity (i.e., for 1 ≤ k ≤ m, the k-th digit from the right in n is odd if and only if the k-th digit from the right in N is odd). 9. (Hensel’s lemma) Let f (x) = cnxn + cn−1xn−1 + · · · + c2x2 + c1x + c0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Its derivative f ′ is a polynomial deﬁned by f ′(x) = ncnxn−1 + (n − 1)cn−1xn−2 + · · · + 2c2x + c1. Suppose that a ∈ Z satisﬁes p | f (a) and p ∤ f ′(a). Prove that for any integer k, there exists an integer b satisfying pk | f (b) and p | b − a. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
