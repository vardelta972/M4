General Combinatorics (Extremal Principle:) A problem can often be solved by considering a notion of a minimum (or a maximum) condition in the problem. We shall demonstrate this principle with a sample problem. Problem: A set S of points on a plane has the property that if A, B ∈ S, then the midpoint of A and B is also in S. Prove that either |S| = 1 or S is inﬁnite. Proof: For X, Y in the plane, denote the distance between X and Y by d(X, Y ). Suppose S is ﬁnite. Choose A, B ∈ S such that d(A, B) is minimum. Let X be the midpoint of A and B. Hence, X ∈ S and d(A, X) = 1 2 d(A, B) < d(A, B), contradicting the minimality of d(A, B). Hence, S is inﬁnite. □ Warning: Do not take the minimum value of an inﬁnite set without care. For example, if S is an inﬁ- nite set of real numbers in (0, 1), the minimum value and the maximum value of S may not exist. The term you may be looking for are inﬁmum and supremum. The inﬁmum of S is the largest real number r such that x ≥ r for all x ∈ S. The supremum of S is the smallest real number R such that x ≤ R for all x ∈ S. However, if S is an inﬁnite set of positive integers, then the minimum of S exists. This is called the well- ordering principle. (Intermediate Value Theorem:) Let f be a continuous function on the real numbers with f (0) < 0 and f (1) > 0. Then f (r) = 0 for some r ∈ (0, 1). (Discrete Version:) Let f be a function on the integers such that f (0) < 0, f (m) > 0 for some m > 0 and f (n + 1) ≤ f (n) + 1 for all n ∈ Z. Then f (t) = 0 for some t ∈ Z, 0 < t < m. This is a notion of an existence proof which is non-constructive, i.e. we have no idea what r is, we just know it exists. Let’s demonstrate this with an example. Problem: Alice begins at the bottom of a hill at 9am and begins running to the top of the hill, arriving there at noon. On the next day, Alice begins at the top of the hill at 9am and begins running to the bottom of the hill, arriving there at noon. Alice’s speed can change and she may even change directions in the middle of her run. Prove that there exists a time between 9am and noon such that Alice was at the same position at this time on the two days. Proof: Let f, g denote the function of her ﬁrst run and her second run, with 0 in the range of the functions denoting the bottom of the hill and 1 the top of the hill, i.e. f (9) = 0, f (12) = 1, g(9) = 1, g(12) = 0. Note that f, g are continuous. You need to prove there exists t ∈ (9, 12) such that f (t) = g(t). Let h(t) = f (t) − g(t). Note that h is also continuous. Then h(9) = −1, h(12) = 1. Then there exists t ∈ (9, 12) such that h(t) = 0, i.e. f (t) − g(t) = 0. □ 1 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 2 In-Lecture Problems: 1. Given 2n points in a plane with no three collinear, with n red points and n blue points, prove that there exists a pairing of the red and blue points such that the n segments joining each pair are pairwise non-intersecting. 2. A ﬁnite set S of points on a plane satisﬁes the property the area of any triangle with vertices in S has area at most one. Prove that S can be covered by a triangle with area four. 3. In a 1 × 6n grid, 4n squares are coloured red and 2n squares are coloured blue. Prove that there exists 3n consecutive squares in the grid that contains 2n red squares and n blue squares. Colouring and Patterns Problems often involved constructing a combinatorial object that involves patterns of colours and numbers. These problems often require a natural feel for the integers and for symmetry. Problem: Each point on the plane is coloured one of two colours. Prove that there exists two points of distance 1 of the same colour. Solve the same problem with three colours instead of two colours. Prove that the same statement does not hold for seven colours. Solution: Take an equilateral triangle of length 1. By Pigeonhole Principle, two of these points have the same colour. For the second part, let A, B, C be vertices of an equilateral triangle of length 1. Let D be the reﬂection of A through BC. Rotate B, C, D about A to images B′, C ′, D′ such that DD′ = 1. Prove that you cannot colour A, B, C, D, B′, C ′, D′ with three colours. For the ﬁnal part, tile the plane with regular hexagons of length 1/2 and colour the hexagons using seven colours accordingly. □ Problem: A mathematics competition has 5 problems and n contestants, where each contestant is assigned an integer score of at least 1 and at most 7 on each problem. It turns out every pair of contestants have at most one problem whose scores are common. Find the maximum possible value of n. Solution: We’ll let the reader prove that n ≤ 7 2 = 49. Let Ci,j, 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 7 be the 49 contestants. Assign contestant Ci,j a score of ki + j mod 7 on problem k (where the arithmetic is performed on {1, 2, · · · , 7}) This works. Hence, the maximum possible value of n is 49. □ In-Lecture Problems 1. The squares of a 8 × 8 board are tiled with 21 triminos (3 × 1 pieces) with one empty square. Find all possible locations of this empty square. 2. Let n be an odd positive integer. n computers are in a room and each pair of computers is joined by a cable. Each computer and cable are to be assigned a colour so that no two computers are assigned the same colour, no computer is assigned the same colour as a cable joining it, and no two cables joined to a common computer are assigned the same colour. Prove that this can be done in n colours. 3. Each point on the circumference of a circle is coloured either red or blue. Prove that there exist three distinct points on this circumference X, Y, Z all of the same colour such that |XY | = |XZ|. 2 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 3 Other Techniques: This is a check-list of other topics in combinatorics you should know for math olympiads. This wouldn’t be covered in the lecture due to lack of time. If you have any questions, or want a mini-lecture on one of these topics outside of lecture time, feel free to ask me and I will accomodate you. Pigeonhole Principle: Given a sequence of n2 + 1 distinct real numbers, prove that the sequence contains a decreasing subsequence of length n + 1 or an increasing subsequence of length n + 1. Binomial Theorem, Bijections, Luca’s Theorem: a.) For any non-negative integer n, prove that n∑ k=0 k(n k) = n · 2 n−1. b.) Let n be a positive integer. Let f (n) be the number of factors of 2 in n! and g(n) be the number of 1’s in the binary expansion of n. Prove that f (n) + g(n) = n. Double Counting - Counting Objects in Two Diﬀerent Ways: Given a permutation (x1, · · · , xn) of (1, 2, · · · , n), a ﬁxed point is said to be an element xi such that xi = i. Let f (n, k) be the number of permutations of (1, 2, · · · , n) with exactly k ﬁxed points. Prove that n∑ k=0 kf (n, k) = n!. Graph Theory Techniques: (Often applied to problems involving people and/or grids) a.) Let n be positive integers. A group of 2n people are in a room where each pair is classiﬁed as friends or strangers. It turns out that no three people are all mutually friends. Find the maximum possible number of pairs of people that are friends. b.) Let n ≥ 3 be a positive integer. Let G be a grid whose entries are all 0, 1 or −1 such that each row and each column contains exactly one 1 and one −1. Prove that the rows and the columns of the grid can be re-ordered such that the resulting grid is the negative of G. Partitions and Generating Functions: Given a positive integer n, a partition of n is deﬁned to be an unordered tuple of positive integers (x1, · · · , xt) whose sum of entries is n. For example, the partitions of 5 are (4, 1), (3, 2), (3, 1, 1), (2, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1, 1). Let f (n) be the number of partitions of n where each part is odd. Let g(n) be the number of partitions of n where the parts are pairwise distinct. Prove that f (n) = g(n). Linear Recurrence Relations: Let a, b, c be the roots of the polynomial x 3 − x 2 + 4x + 7. Prove that a n + bn + c n is an integer for all positive integers n and ﬁnd all n ∈ N such that a n + bn + c n is divisible by 4. Partially-Ordered Sets, Chains and Anti-Chains: ( (LYM) Lubell-Yamamoto-Meshalkin Inequality:) Let S be a set of subsets of {1, 2, · · · , n} such that no subset in S contains another subset in S. Let ak be the subsets in S of size k. Prove that n∑ k=0 ak(n k) ≤ 1. 3 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 4 2. Combinatorial Geometry Combinatorial geometry problems are simply Euclidean geometry problems with combinatorial aspects to them. These notes will not cover the elementary Euclidean geometry facts. We ﬁrst want to deﬁne convex sets. These sets become extremely insightful ways to view points on a plane to solve problems. We will denote a plane by R2. A set S ⊆ R2 is said to be convex if for every A, B ∈ S, the line segment joining A, B is also in S. Formally, for every λ ∈ [0, 1], λ · A + (1 − λ) · B ∈ S. For example, triangles, rectangles, circles, ellipses are convex sets. Figures with ”holes” in it or a horseshoe are not convex sets. Any polygon with an internal angle larger than 180 o is not convex. Given a set of points S in a plane, the convex hull of S is the intersection of all convex sets containing S. It is seen as the ”smallest” convex set containing S. We are interested in the case where S is ﬁnite. The convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points is a convex polygon, whose vertices are in S. The remaining vertices of S are on the boundary or interior of the polygon. A ﬁnite set S in R2 is said to be in general position if no three points in S are collinear. S is said to be in convex position if the points in S are vertices of a convex polygon. In-Lecture Problems 1. A set S of n points are in convex position if and only if every set of four points are in convex position. 2. Five points in R2 are in general position, Prove that four of these points that are in convex position. 1 3. Let S be a set of n points on a plane in general position. Prove that the points in S can be labeled P1, P2, · · · , Pn such that the broken line P1P2P3, · · · , Pn does not intersect itself. As you notice, it is extremely useful to study the convex hull of a ﬁnite set of points in R2. It often trivializes the analysis required to solve a problem. Other Tips: • Let P be a convex n-gon in C (or R2) and α1, · · · , αn ∈ C (or R2) be the complex number for the coordinates of P . Prove that the interior and boundary of P is deﬁned by { n∑ i=1 λiαi | λi ∈ R, λi ≥ 0, n∑ i=1 λi = 1 } . • If S is a ﬁnite set of points in R2, you can place the points onto the Cartesian plane such that no two points have the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate. (Why?) If there are n2 + 1 points, then there exists a sequence of n + 1 points with increasing x-coordinates such that the y-coordinates are increasing or the y-coordinates are decreasing. (Why?) • Recall Pick’s Theorem: On the Cartesian plane, given a simple polygon with vertices on lattice points, let x be number of lattice points interior of the polygon and i be the number of lattice points on the boundary of the polygon. Then the area of the polygon is x + i/2 − 1. (Why?) 1Erdos-Szekeres Theorem states that for any k ∈ N, there exists a positive integer N such that any N points in general position contains k points in convex position. An open problem is to ﬁnd the smallest possible N , for each k. The Erdos-Szekeres Conjecture states the minimum is N = 2k + 1. 4 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 5 General Combinatorics Problem 1. Given 2n points on the plane, prove that there exists a line in the plane such that there are n points on each side of the line. 2. A 5 × 5 grid of light bulbs contains a light switch for each row and each column. The light switch toggles every light in the corresponding row or a column. Prove that given any initial state of the light bulbs, you can hit a ﬁnite sequence of light switches such that in each row and each column, there are more lights on than lights oﬀ. 3. Given a set S of n points in the plane, prove there exists at least √n points in S such that no three are vertices of an equilateral triangle. 4. Consider two system of points in the plane {A1, A2, · · · , An} and {B1, B2, · · · , Bn} having diﬀerent centroids. Prove that there is a point P in the plane such that n∑ i=1 |P Ai| = n∑ i=1 |P Bi|. 5. Let n, k be positive integers such that n ≥ 2k. You are to colour each subset of {1, 2, · · · , n} of size k such that every pair of disjoint subsets of size k are assigned diﬀerent colours. Prove that this can be done in n − 2k + 2 colours. 2 6. There are computers are in a room where some pairs of computers are joined by a cable. Let m be the number of cables. The computers are to be coloured in a manner such that no two computers joined by a cable are assigned the same colour. Prove that this can be done with at most 1 2 + √ 2m + 1 4 colours. 7. (Romania TST 1999) A is a set with n elements. Let A1, A2, · · · , Am be subsets of A such that |Ai| = 3 and |Ai ∩ Aj| ≤ 1 for distinct i, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , m}. Prove that there exists a subset X of A such that |X| ≥ ⌊√2n⌋ and X does not contain Ai for each i. 8. The sets A1, A2, · · · , A35 are given with the property that |Ai| = 27 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 35, such that the inter- section of every three of them has exactly one element. Show that the intersection of A1, A2, · · · , A35 is non-empty. 9. Each of six people initially knows a piece of gossip that the other ﬁve does not know. When a telephone call takes place between two of these people, they tell each other every piece of gossip they know at the time. What is the minimum number of phone calls required so that in the end, all six people know all six pieces of gossip? 10. (Sperner’s Theorem:) Let S be a set of subsets of {1, 2, · · · , n} such that no subset in S contains another subset in S. Prove that |S| ≤ ( n ⌊n/2⌋ ). 2This is in fact the minimum number of colours required. But this fact is much harder to prove. 5 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 6 Convexity and Collinearity Problems 1. (Romania 2003) Find all functions f from a plane onto itself so that for every 4-tuple of points A, B, C, D that are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, f (A), f (B), f (C), f (D) are the vertices of a concave quadrilateral. 2.

Given a set of n ≥ 3 in general position, a subset K of S is called good if points in K are vertices of a convex polygon with no other points of S in its interior. For each 3 ≤ k ≤ n, let ck be the number of good subsets of S of size k. Prove that the sum n∑ k=3(−1) kck is dependent only on n and not the conﬁguration of S. 6 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 7 Convex Polygons and Diagonals Problems In this section, convex hulls are not as useful as before. The convex hull is our given polygon. Time to rely on your puzzle solving skills and intuition from Euclidean geometry. Also recall Ptolemy’s Inequality: Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral. Then AB · CD + BC · AD ≥ AC · BD. 1. (Romania TST 2007) Given a convex 2n-gon P with vertices P1, P2, · · · , P2n and an interior point Q that does not lie on any diagonals on the 2n-gon, prove that there is a side so that none of the lines QPi, i = 1, 2, · · · , 2n intersect that side at its interior. 2. (USA 2003) A convex polygon P in the plane is dissected into smaller convex polygons by drawing all of its diagonals. The lengths of all sides and all diagonals of the polygon P are rational numbers. Prove that the length of all sides of the polygons in the dissection are also rational numbers. 3. (Romania TST 2008) For any convex n-gon, there exists n − 2 points in the interior such that every triangle formed by three vertices of the n-gon contains at exactly one of these points in its interior. 4.

A diagonal is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of P into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of P. The sides of P are also called good. Suppose P has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of P. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a conﬁguration. 9. (Iran 2005) A simple polygon is one where the perimeter of the polygon does not intersect itself (but is not necessarily convex). Prove that a simple polygon P contains a diagonal which is completely inside P such that the diagonal divides the perimeter into two parts both containing at least n/3 − 1 vertices. (Do not count the vertices which are endpoints of the diagonal.) 10. (IMO 2006) Assign to each side b of a convex polygon of P the maximum area of a triangle that has b as a side and is contained in P. Show that the sum of the areas assigned to the sides of P is at least twice the area of P. 7 IMO Winter Camp 2009 - Combinatorics and Combinatorial Geometry 8 Covering Problems Not much to say here. It really is Euclidean geometry with extra care and imagination. 1. Prove that a connected ﬁgure P ⊆ R2 with diameter 1 can be covered by a hexagon with side length 1√3 . (The diameter of P is the smallest r such that d(x, y) ≤ r for all x, y ∈ P .) 2. A ﬁnite set of points S in R2 has the property that every three points can be contained in a disc of radius 1. Prove that every point in S can be contained in a disc of radius 1. 3. a.) Prove that a ﬁnite collection of squares of total area 3 can be arranged to cover a unit square. b.) Prove that a ﬁnite collection of squares of total area 1/2 can be placed inside a unit square without overlap. 4. (USA 2007) A square grid on the Euclidean plane consists of all points (m, n), where m and n are integers. Is it possible to cover all grid points by an inﬁnite family of discs with non-overlapping interiors if each disc in the family has radius at least 5? 5. (Putnam 1998) Let D1, D2, · · · , Dn be a collection of open discs (circles without the boundary) in the plane whose union contains a given set E. For i = 1, 2, · · · , n, let D′ i be the open disc concentric with Di with three times the radius as Di. Prove that there exists a subset S of {1, 2, · · · , n} such that Di, Dj are disjoint whenever i, j ∈ S and E ⊆ ⋃ i∈S D′ i. Miscellaneous (Yet Beautiful) Combinatorial Geometry Problems 1. (Romania TST 1996) Let n ≥ 3 be a ﬁxed positive integer. A function f : R2 → R has the property that for any points P1, P2, · · · , Pn which are vertices of a regular n-gon, we have n∑ i=1 f (Pi) = 0. Prove that f (P ) = 0 for all points P ∈ R2. 2.
