Let n be a positive integer. Given n non-overlapping circular discs on a rectangular piece of paper, prove that one can cut the piece of paper into convex polygonal pieces each of which contains exactly one disc. 2. In the coordinate plane, color the lattice points which have both coordinates even black and all other lattice points white. Let P be a polygon with black points as vertices. Prove that any white point on or inside P lies halfway between two black points, both of which lie on or inside P . 3. For n an odd positive integer, the unit squares of an n × n chessboard are colored alternately black and white, with the four corners colored black. A tromino is obtained by remove a unit square from a 2 × 2 unit square grid. For which values of n is it possible to cover all the black squares of the given chessboard with non-overlapping trominos? When it is possible, what is the minimum number of trominos needed? 4.

MOSP In ternal Usec⃝Copyright2011AmericanMathCompetitions Chapter 2 Black and blue groups homework 1. Let p be a prime. How many irreducible polynomials of degree 4, with coeﬃcients (mod p), are there? 2. Let n be a positive integer. Consider a variant on the well-known Towers of Hanoi game: We have n discs on a peg stacked in order of size with the smallest disc on top. A move consists of taking the disc from the top of a peg and moving to another peg such that at no point is a larger disc on top of a smaller one. In this variant, there are four pegs, including the one the discs start on, and we want to move all the discs onto one of the empty pegs. Let xn be the minimum number of moves required to achieve this. Determine whether or not there exist positive reals a, b with b > 1 such that xn ≥ a · bn for all positive integers n. 3. The usual procedure for shuﬄing a deck of n cards involves ﬁrst splitting the deck into two blocks and then merging the two blocks to form a single deck in such a way that the order of the cards within each block is not changed. A trivial cut in which one block is empty is allowed. (a) How many diﬀerent permutations of a deck of n cards can be produced by a single shuﬄe? (b) How many of these single shuﬄe permutations can be inverted by another such single shuﬄe, putting the deck back in order? 4.

In triangle ABC three distinct triangles are inscribed, similar to each other, but not neces- sarily similar to triangle ABC, with corresponding points on corresponding sides of triangle ABC. Prove that if two of these triangles share a vertex, than the third one does as well. 3 MOSP In ternal Usec⃝Copyright2011AmericanMathCompetitions 4 2013 Mathematical Olympiad Summer Program Homework 7.
