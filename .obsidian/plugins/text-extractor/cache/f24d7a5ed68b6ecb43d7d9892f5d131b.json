See this for much more about Catalan numbers and many other topics. 1 Background The nth Catalan number is deﬁned as Cn = 1 n+1 (2n n ). 1.1 Basics 1. Show that Cn is always an integer (without appealing to what is below?) 2. Express Cn as a linear combination of binomial coeﬃcients, with integer coeﬃcients. 3. Prove that Cn satisﬁes the recurrence relation C0 = 1 and Cn+1 = ∑n i=0 CiCn\u0000i for n \u0015 0. 4. What is the generating function expression for Cn? (That is, what is ∑1 i=0 xiCi?) 1.2 Examples Show that each of the following are in fact the Catalan numbers. You can show these directly via counting arguments, via recurrence relations, induction, relating one sequence to another sequence that has already been shown to equal the Catalan numbers, etc. Try approaching each example several ways. These are very rich objects and there are many fruitful ways to deal with them. 1. Cn is the number of ways of writing n pairs of matched parentheses. For n = 3 we have ((())) ()(()) ()()() (())() (()()): 2. Cn is the number of ways of completely paranthesizing n + 1 numbers. For n = 3 we have ((ab)c)d (a(bc))d (ab)(cd) a((bc)d) a(b(cd)): 3. The previous question can be seen as asking for the number of full binary trees with n + 1 leaves. A full binary tree is where every vertex has either 2 children, or is a leaf. We consider “left children” to be diﬀerent from “right children” when counting trees. 4. Cn is the number of binary trees on n vertices. 1 5. Cn is the number of trees on n + 1 vertices, where the children of each vertex are in a ﬁxed order. 6. Cn is the number of monotonic paths on an n \u0002 n grid of squares that do not cross above the diagonal. A path is monotonic if all moves are either up or right. 7. Cn is the number of monotonic paths on an n + 1 \u0002 n + 1 grid that do not cross above the diagonal, where every (maximal) vertical segment that ends on the diagonal has odd length. 8. Cn is the number of monotonic paths on an n + 1 \u0002 n + 1 grid that do not cross above the diagonal, and where no “left turn” occurs on the line two below the diagonal. 9. Cn is the number of (unordered) pairs of monotonic length-n + 1 paths on the lattice that begin and end at the same point but do not intersect otherwise. 10. Cn is the number of (unordered) pairs of monotonic length-n \u0000 1 paths on the lattice that begin and end at the same point and where the bottom path never crosses “above” the top path. 11. Cn is the number of ways a convex n + 2-gon can be cut into triangles vertices by non- intersecting edges. 12. Cn is the number of permutations of f1; : : : ; ng with no length-3 increasing subsequence. 13. Cn is the number of Young Tableaus for the 2 \u0002 n rectangle, that is, the number of ways of arranging the numbers 1; : : : ; 2n in a 2 \u0002 n rectangle such that every row and column is increasing. 14. Cn is the number of sequences of n integers such that 1 \u0014 ai\u00001 \u0014 ai \u0014 i. 15. Cn is the number of sequences of n \u0000 1 integers satisfying 1 \u0014 ai\u00001 < ai \u0014 2i. 16. Cn is the number of sequences of n integers such that a1 = 0 and 0 \u0014 ai+1 \u0014 ai + 1. 17. Cn is the number of sequences of n \u0000 1 integers such that ai \u0014 1 and all partial sums are non-negative. 18. Cn is the number of sequences of n integers such that ai \u0015 \u00001, all partial sums are non- negative, and a1 + : : : + an = 0. 19. Cn is the number of ways to “stack coins” in the plane, where the bottom row consists of n consecutive coins. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
