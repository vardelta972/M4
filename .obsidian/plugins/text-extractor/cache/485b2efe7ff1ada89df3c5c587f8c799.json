Deﬁne the elementary symmetric polynomials s1, . . . , sn by (x + x1) · · · (x + xn) = x n + · · · + sn−1x + sn. The symmetric averages di are then deﬁned by di = si/(n i ). Trick 1 (Symmetric Polynomials) If x1, . . . , xm are real numbers and m > n, then there exist reals x ′ 1, . . . , x ′ m−1 such that d′ i = di for i = 1, . . . , n. In particular, an inequality in symmetric averages d1, . . . , dn need only be proved for the n-variable case. Theorem 1 (Newton) d2 i ≥ di+1di−1. Theorem 2 (Maclaurin) d1 ≥ √d2 ≥ 3√d3 ≥ · · · ≥ n√dn. b Theorem 3 (Bernoulli) For all r ≥ 1 and x ≥ −1, (1 + x) r ≥ 1 + xr A variety of substitutions can be useful when solving inequalities. There is no special prize for using the given variables. Substitutions can be a particularly handy way to deal with constraints; if a constraint is unwieldy, change it! • Positive reals x1, . . . , xn such that the product x1 · · · xn = 1 can be written as xi = yi/yi−1 or xi = yi−1/yi for unconstrained positive reals y1, . . . , yn. • Positive reals x1, . . . , xn such that the product x1 · · · xn = 1 can be written as xi = e yi for reals y1, . . . , yn with sum 0. • Three positive reals a, b, c which are the sides of a triangle can be written a = x + y, b = y + z, c = z + x for unconstrained positive reals x, y, z. • Three positive reals a, b, c such that a + b + c = abc are expressible as a = tan A, b = tan B, c = tan C where ABC is a triangle. (What is the related cotangent substitution?) • Three positive reals a, b, c such that a 2 + b2 + c 2 + 2abc = 1 are expressible as a = cos(A), b = cos B, c = cos C where ABC is an acute triangle. 1 Isolated Fudging Some contest inequalities are solved by blending all of the terms under consideration together with one of the standard inequalities. That strategy sometimes fails, in which case the alternative is manipulating each term by itself (hence the name) so that the resultant sum is simple. One idea is to give a linear approximation, which can be accomplished in several ways. We can compare given terms to k · a r ar + br + cr , 1 which gives a sum independent of r. (The free variable r is calculated by taking derivatives at an equality case, and actually can be at most one value, while k is the desired sum.) Equivalently, we can ﬁx a + b + c and attempt to give a linear approximation. In the following solution, r = 1 can be found by computing ∂ ∂a ( 2a b + c )2/3 \f \f \f \f \f(a,b,c)=(1,1,1) = ( 2 b + c )2/3 · (2/3)a −1/3\f \f \f \f \f(a,b,c)=(1,1,1) = 2/3 and equating it with ∂ ∂a 3a r ar + br + cr = 2r 3 It is then an easy check to see that the choice r = 1 is suitable. Importantly, a complete solution need not, and should not, show the work behind ﬁnding r. (MOP 2002) a, b, c are positive reals. Show that ( 2a b + c )2/3 + ( 2b c + a )2/3 + ( 2c a + b )2/3 ≥ 3 Solution. Consider the inequality ( 2a b + c ) 2 3 ≥ 3a a + b + c This is equivalent to a + b + c ≥ 3 3 √ a ( b + c 2 )2 and is a direct consequence of AM-GM on a, b+c 2 , and b+c 2 . It follows that ∑ cyc ( 2a b + c ) 2 3 ≥ ∑ cyc 3a a + b + c = 3 as desired. □ 2 Mixing Variables The idea behind mixing variables is to blend the given variables into a more convenient form. Examples include (x, y) 7→ ( x+y 2 , x+y 2 ), (x, y) 7→ ( √xy, √xy), (x, y) 7→ (x + y, 0), and (x, y) 7→ (xy, 1). In this sense, mixing variables can be thought of as a variant of smoothing. The requisite computations are often not as clear as they are for Jensen or Karamata, but fortunately they typically do not include Calculus. Moreover, that the computations are less deterministic is a consequence of the number of possibilities. Show that for reals x, y, z, not all of which are positive, 16 9 (x 2 − x + 1)(y2 − y + 1)(z2 − z + 1) ≥ (xyz) 2 − xyz + 1 Solution Suppose without loss of generality that x ≥ y ≥ z. Note that x 2 − x + 1 ≥ |x| 2 − |x| + 1. Thus, if 0 > x, exchanging x and y for x ′ = −x and y′ = −y decreases the left hand side while ﬁxing the right hand side. If instead x ≥ 0 > y, simply exhanging y for y′ = −y decreases the left hand side while increasing the right hand side. Thus, we may assume x ≥ y ≥ 0 ≥ z. We now prove a lemma: Lemma 1 For any reals a ≥ 0 ≥ b, the following inequality holds: 4 3 (a 2 − a + 1)(b2 − b + 1) ≥ (ab) 2 − ab + 1 2 Proof. Let c = −b. The desired inequality is equivalent to 4 3 (a 2 − a + 1)(c 2 + c + 1) ≥ (ac) 2 + ac + 1, where a, c ≥ 0, but this equivalent inequality is easily realized as the sum of three inequalities: 4 3 (a 2 − a + 1)c 2 ≥ a 2c 2 ⇐⇒ (a − 2) 2c 2 ≥ 0 4 3 (a 2 − a + 1)c ≥ ac ⇐⇒ (4a 2 − 7a + 4)c ≥ 0 4 3 (a 2 − a + 1) ≥ 1 ⇐⇒ (2a − 1) 2 ≥ 0. Now we are done, for by the lemma, we have 16 9 (x 2 − x + 1)(y2 − y + 1)(z2 − z + 1) ≥ 4 3 ((xz) 2 − xz + 1) (y2 − y + 1) ≥ (xyz) 2 − xyz + 1, where y ≥ 0 ≥ xz. □ 3 Sum of Squares Sometimes an inequality is so sharp that none of the usual theorems can be used to solve it. Sharpness clearly greater than Schur, or unusual equality cases are good indicators of this situation. For these problems, carefully chosen squares, or sharp bounds following from pure algebra, or both, may be useful. The reasoning is that weighted sums of squares such that both the squares and the weights become small near equality cases give rise to particularly sharp inequalities. A good goal for three variable inequalities is to manipulate to the form ∑ f (a, b, c)(a − b) 2 ≥ 0 for some reasonable function f. A variety of conditions then demonstrate the inequality. (Anh-Cuong) a, b, c are positive reals. Show that a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 3abc ≥ ab √2a2 + 2b2 + bc √2b2 + 2c2 + ca √2c2 + 2a2 Solution. Note that 3a 2+2ab+3b2 4(a+b) ≥ √ a2+b2 2 , which is a consequence of (3a 2 +2ab+3b2) 2 −8(a 2 +b2)(a+b) 2 = a 4 − 4a 3b + 6a 2b2 − 4ab 3 + b4 = (a − b) 4 ≥ 0. It therefore suﬃces to check that a 3 + b3 + c 3 + 3abc ≥ ∑ cyc ab · 3a 2 + 2ab + 3b2 2(a + b) or that ∑ cyc a(a − b)(a − c) ≥ ∑ cyc [ 3a 2 + 2ab + 3b2 2(a + b) − ab(a + b) ] = ∑ cyc ab(a − b) 2 2(a + b) Consider the identity 2 ∑ cyc a r(a − b)(a − c) = ∑ cyc (a r + br − c r)(a − b) 2. Taking r = 1, we need only prove ∑ cyc (a + b − c − ab a + b ) (a − b) 2 ≥ 0 3 This is evident, for we may assume without loss of generality that a ≥ b ≥ c and note that the desired is the sum of the three inequalities (a + b − c − ab a + b ) (a − b) 2 ≥ 0 (c + a − b − ac a + c ) ((a − c) 2 − (b − c) 2) ≥ 0 (b + c − a − bc b + c ) (b − c) 2 + (c + a − b − ac a + c ) (b − c) 2 ≥ 0. □ 4 Problems 1.
