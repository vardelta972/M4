Two years later, in the fall of 2001, I ﬁnished its proof.” (Preda Mihailescu, December 16, 2009) 1was born in 1814, in Bruges (now Belgium, then part of the First French Empire), the only child of a French jeweller by the name of Joseph Catalan. In 1825, he traveled to Paris and learned mathematics at Ecole Polytechnique where he met Joseph Liouville (1833). In 1834 Catalan was expelled from university and went to Chalons-sur-Marne, where he got a job after graduating. Catalan came back to Ecole Polytechnique, and, with the help of Liouville, obtained his degree in mathematics in 1841. He went on to Charlemagne College to teach descriptive geometry. Though he was politically active and strongly left-wing, leading him to participate in the 1848 Revolution, Catalan had an animated career and also sat in the France’s Chamber of Deputies. The University of Liege appointed him chair of analysis in 1865. In 1879, still in Belgium, he became a journal editor where he published as a foot note Paul-Jean Busschop’s theory after refusing it in 1873 - letting Busschop know that it was too empirical. In 1883, he worked for the Belgian Academy of Sciences in the ﬁeld of number theory. He died in Liege in 1894. 2(born May 23, 1955) is a Romanian mathematician, best known for his proof of Catalan’s conjecture. Born in Bucharest, he is the brother of Vintila Mihailescu. After leaving Romania in 1973, he settled in Switzerland. Mihailescu studied mathematics and informatics in Switzerland, receiving his Ph.D. from ETH Zurich in 1997. His thesis, Cyclotomy of rings and primality testing, was written under the direction of Erwin Engeler and Hendrik Lenstra. For several years, Mihailescu did research at the University of Paderborn, Germany. Since 2005 he is a professor at the Georg- August University of Gottingen. Mathematical Reflections 3 (2010) 1 THEOREM. The equation xu − yv = 1 (1) has in natural numbers unique solution (x, y; u, v) = (3, 2; 2, 3). This was proved in the special case x = 3, y = 2, by Gersonides,3 in 1343. Approximately 100 years before Catalan, Leonhard Euler (1707-1783) solved the Diophantine equation x3 − y2 = ±1. (2) Equation (2) was solved in recent years by methods of algebraic number the- ory. In 1844, August Leopold Crelle (1780-1855), editor of Crelle’s Journal, the prestigious magazine (published in German, English, and French) and known to- day as Journal fur die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Journal for Pure and Applied Mathematics), receives a letter from Catalan: “I beg you, sir, to announce in your journal the following theorem that I believe is true, although I have not yet succeeded in completely proving it; perhaps others will be more successful. Two con- secutive whole numbers, other than 8 and 9, cannot be consecutive powers; that is, the equation xm − yn = 1 in which the unknowns are positive integers only admits a single solution....” Editor’s note published in [1] became a famous conjecture. Slowly mathematicians began to obtain interesting results for some special cases. First it was observed that the equation is equivalent to xp − yq = 1 (x > 0, y > 0), where p and q are prime numbers. The case q = 2 was resolved by V.A. Lebesgue in 1850 ([7]). After a little more than 100 years, in 1964, Chao Ko(1910-2002), solved the case p = 2 ([2]). The equation became xp − yq = 1 (xy ̸= 0, where p and q are odd prime numbers) (4) J.W.S Cassels (1922-) wrote equation (4) in the form (x − 1) xp − 1 x − 1 = yq (5) and noted that the greatest common divisor of the two factors in the left-hand side must be 1 (case I) or p (case II). In 1960 ([3]), it was proved that equation (4) has no solutions in case I because the system x − 1 = a q, xp − 1 x − 1 = b q, y = ab has not solution. 3Rabbi Levi Ben Gershon(1288-1344) - Jewish mathematician and astronomer Mathematical Reflections 3 (2010) 2 A study of the number of solutions (x, y) for p and q ﬁxed was done by Alan Baker(1939-)4, who gave logarithmic approximations and Robert Tijdeman (1943 -) who showed in [11] that equation (4) has at most a ﬁnite number of solutions (for p < 7 · 1011 and q < 7 · 1016, where p < q). Both tried to ﬁnd lower bounds for p and q. In [6] it was showed that p, q > 106, then p, q > 3 · 108 and in [8] it was proved that max(p, q) ≈ 8 · 1016 respectively min(p, q) > 107 (conditions of Wieferich5 ). In [9], Preda Mihailescu proved that the congruences of Wieferich6 in fact hold with- out any class number condition. Important for the ﬁnal demonstration, which used results of Galois group and cyclotomic ﬁelds ([10]) was the estimation |x| > qp ([4] and [5]). A sketch of Mihailescu’s proof can be found on the internet at [12]. Remark. In 2010, Preda Mihailescu expected to complete the review process of his proof of Leopoldt 7 ([15],[16]) conjecture. The proof (not yet validated) is available at [17] (also see the explanation at that at [18].) And he will not stop here: “ ... I work at a theory in mathematics that will catch very well; it will be useful and welcome. It is under examination and professionals take time to verify it. If things are as I see them, there will be a deep simpliﬁcation that the mathematicians will deﬁnitely enjoy. I will be able to share more in one year.” Preda Mihailescu, December 16, 2009 REFERENCES 8 1. E. Catalan, Note extraite d’une lettre adressee a l’editeur, J. Reine Angew. Math. 27 (1844), 192. 2.
