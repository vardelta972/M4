Although in higher mathematics, abstract algebra instead of elementary algebra is used in algebraic combinatorics, but for this lecture, we will try to stay with elementary algebra by using generating functions and formal series. 1 Formal Series As generating functions are not polynomials, we may not work in the ring of polynomials with real coeﬃcients R[X]. Hence, we must deﬁne a new ring to work in. Given a commutative ring A (generally we will work with formal series whose coeﬃcients are in R), we may deﬁne another ring called the ring of formal series with coeﬃcients in A and denote this by A[[X]]. Every element of A[[X]] can be written as ∑ n≥0 anX n, where ai are in A. In this ring, we may deﬁne addition and multiplication analogously to those frequently encountered in polynomial rings:  ∑ n≥0 anX n   +  ∑ n≥0 bnX n   = ∑ n≥0 (an + bn)X n  ∑ n≥0 anX n    ∑ n≥0 bnX n   = ∑ n≥0 ( ∑ p+q=n apbq ) X n. In this ring, all polynomial identities belonging to the ring of polynomials are also true. In addition, for a formal series f (X) = ∑ n≥0 anX n, we may deﬁne its formal derivative f ′(X) as f ′(X) = ∑ n≥0 nanX n−1. All properties of the derivative encountered in calculus are true in the ring of formal series; for instance, (f (X) + g(X))′ = f ′(X) + g′(X) and (f (X)g(X)) ′ = f ′(X)g(X) + f (X)g′(X). In addition, geometric expansions are valid; that is, 1 1−X = 1 + X + X 2 + · · · . 2 Recurrence Relations Let a0, a1, a2, · · · be a sequence of numbers. The ordinary generating function, or more commonly just generating function of this sequence is the formal series ∑ k≥0 akX k. For instance, if our sequence was {1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . . }, then our generating function f (X) = 1 + 2X + 3X 2 + 5X 3 + 8X 4 + · · · . The function encodes the information of the sequence inside a single function, and as such in many situations the generating function of a sequence is more desirable than an actual explicit formula. 1 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park Many recurrence relations can be formulated explicitly using generating functions. The general tactic is to multiply both sides of a relation by X n, where n is the index of a variable, and summing up all terms of the relation. As a simple example, let us consider the Fibonacci recurrence: Example 2.1. If an+2 = an+1 + an for n ≥ 0 with a0 = 0 and a1 = 1, ﬁnd the explicit formula for an. Solution. Multiplying both sides by X n gives us an+2X n = an+1X n+anX n. Now deﬁne f (X) = ∑ n≥0 anX n. If we sum the previous express for n ≥ 0, we obtain ∑ n≥0 an+2X n = ∑ n≥0 an+1X n + ∑ n≥0 anX n =⇒ f (X) − a1X − a0 X 2 = f (X) − a0 X + f (X). Solving for f (X) gives us f (X) = X 1−X−X 2 . Partial fractions give us f (X) = 1 ϕ − ϕ−1 ( 1 1 − ϕX − 1 1 − ϕ−1X ) = 1 √5  ∑ n≥0 ϕnX n − ∑ n≥0 ϕ−nX n   = 1 √5  ∑ n≥0 (ϕn − ϕ−n)X n   . The coeﬃcient of X n in f (X) gives us the nth Fibonacci number, so an = 1√5 (ϕn − ϕ−n). As shorthand notation, it is customary to write [X n]f (X) as the coeﬃcient of X n in f (X). Although obtaining Binet’s Formula from generating functions is very elegant, obtaining the general formula for the so-called Catalan numbers is even more elegant. Example 2.2 (Catalan). In how many diﬀerent ways can we parenthesize a non-associative product c1c2 . . . cn? Solution. Note that the Catalan numbers are governed by the recurrence relation an+1 = ∑n k=0 akan−k for n ≥ 0, and a0 = 1. Deﬁne f (X) = ∑ n≥0 anX n. If we multiply the recurrence by X n and sum up all terms, we obtain ∑ n≥0 an+1X n = ∑ n≥0 ( n∑ k=0 akan−k ) X n =⇒ f (X) − 1 X = f (X) 2. Thus Xf (X) 2 − f (X) + 1 = 0, so we may expand f (X) as a power series using f (X) = 1 − √1 − 4X 2X . Note that √1 − 4X = ∑ k≥0 ( 1 2 k)(−4X)k = 1 − 2 ∑ k≥1 (2k−2 k−1 ) ( − 1 4 )k (−4X)k k by the Generalized Binomial Theorem. Thus f (X) = 1 − (1 − 2 ∑ k≥1 (2k−2 k−1 ) ( − 1 4 )k (−4X) k k ) 2X = ∑ k≥1 ( 2k − 2 k − 1 ) X k−1 k = ∑ k≥0 (2k k ) X k k + 1 . Then an = [X n]f (X) = 1 n+1 (2n n ). 2 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park The method listed out in Herbert S. Wilf’s generatingfunctionology 1is as follows: 1. Make sure that the set of values of the free variable k for which the given recurrence relation is true, is clealy delineated. 2. Give a name to the generating function that you look for, and write out that function in terms of an unknown sequence. 3. Multiply both sides of the recurrence by X k and sum over all values of k for which the recurrence holds. 4. Express both sides of the resulting equation explicitly in terms of your generating function f (X). 5. Solve the resulting equation for the unknown generating function f (X). 6. Expand f (X) into a power series by any method you can think of to get an exact formula for the sequence. In particular, if f (X) is a rational function (quotient of two polynomials), then success will result from expanding in partial fractions and then handling each of the resulting terms separately. Trickier recurrence relations may involve derivatives and having to solve a polynomial diﬀerential equation. 3 Combinatorial Identities Combinatorial identities are solved in a very similar manner; multiplying through by X n, summing over all possible n, then proving that the two resulting generating functions are equivalent. The Generalized Binomial Theorem (x + y) n = ∑n k=0 (n k)xkyn−k helps simplify the terms. Example 3.1 (Iran 2008). Prove that for each positive integer n, n∑ k=1 (n + k − 1 2k − 1 ) = F2n, where Fn is the Fibonacci sequence (with F1 = F2 = 1). Solution. We only have to prove that ∑ n≥0 n∑ k=1 ( n + k − 1 2k − 1 ) X n = ∑ n≥0 F2nX n. The left-hand side can be simplifying by swapping the order of summation: n∑ k=1 (n + k − 1 2k − 1 ) = ∑ k≥1 ∑ n≥0 (n + k − 1 2k − 1 )X n = ∑ k≥1 X 1−k ∑ n≥0 ( n + k − 1 2k − 1 )X n+k−1 = ∑ k≥1 X 1−k ∑ r≥0 ( r 2k − 1 ) X r = ∑ k≥1 X 1−k X 2k−1 (1 − X)2k = ∑ k≥1 X k (1 − X)2k = X 1 − 3X + X 2 . 1http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/gfologyLinked2.pdf 3 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park The right-hand side is easier; we know that Fn = 1√5 (ϕn − ϕ−n), so ∑ n≥0 F2nX n = ∑ n≥0 1 √5 (ϕ2n − ϕ−2n)X n = 1 √5  ∑ n≥0 ϕ2nX n − ∑ n≥0 ϕ−2nX n   = 1 √5 ( 1 1 − ϕ2X − 1 1 − ϕ−2X ) = 1 √5 ϕ2X − ϕ−2X (1 − ϕ2X)(1 − ϕ−2X) = X 1 − 3X + X 2 and since the generating functions of both sides are equal, their coeﬃcients must also be equal, as desired. Note that we never actually had to expand the generating functions. Since we worked in the ring of formal series, we know that they have a power series representation, and thus only need to conﬁrm that the two functions are equal. 4 Other Applications of Formal Series Generating functions are also used frequently to count objects that seem diﬃcult to count using bijections or ordinary counting methods, or to prove facts about sequences that are easily done with formal series. Example 4.1 (USAJMO 2013). Let f (n) be the number of ways to write n as a sum of powers of 2, where we keep track of the order of the summation. For example, f (4) = 6 because 4 can be written as 4, 2 + 2, 2 + 1 + 1, 1 + 2 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, and 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. Find the smallest n greater than 2013 for which f (n) is odd. Solution. Let g(n, k) be the number of ways to write n as a sum of exactly k powers of 2. Then g(n, k) = [X n](X + X 2 + X 4 + X 8 + · · · )k. Since f (n) = ∑k≥1 g(n, k), we have ∑ n≥1 f (n)X n = (X + X 2 + X 4 + · · · ) 1 + (X + X 2 + X 4 + · · · ) 2 + · · · = 1 1 − X − X 2 − X 4 − · · · − 1 We claim that f (n) is odd if and only if n = 2 m − 1 for some positive integer m. It remains to prove that the coeﬃcients of X 2 m−1 in the generating function ∑ n≥1 f (n)X n are all odd. Working in the ring F2[[X]], this is equivalent to proving that 1 1 − X 1 − X 2 − X 4 − · · · − 1 = X 1 + X 3 + X 7 + X 15 + · · · ⇐⇒ 1 = (1 + X 1 + X 3 + X 7 + · · · )(1 + X 1 + X 2 + X 4 + · · · ). which is easy to see by a parity argument for each term. Thus our answer is 211 − 1 = 2047. In the previous example, since we were trying to prove that the coeﬃcient were either odd or even, it makes the most sense to work in the ring F2[[X]], since 1 = −1. 4 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park Example 4.2. Suppose that the set of nonnegative integers is partitioned into a ﬁnite number of inﬁnite arithmetical progressions with common diﬀerences r1, r2, . . . rn and ﬁrst terms a1, a2, . . . , an. Then prove that 1 r1 + 1 r2 + · · · + 1 rn = 1. Solution. Since the set of nonnegative integers is partitioned by the progressions starting with ai with diﬀerence ri, (X a1 + X a1+r1 + X a1+2r1 + · · · ) + · · · + (X an + X an+rn + X an+2rn + · · · ) = X 0 + X 1 + X 2 + · · · . Using the formula for a geometric series, we have X a1 1 − X r1 + X a2 1 − X r2 + · · · + X an 1 − X rn = 1 1 − X . Multiplying both sides by 1 − X gives us X a1 1 + X + X 2 + · · · + X r1−1 + X a2 1 + X + X 2 + · · · + X r2−1 + · · · + X an 1 + X + X 2 + · · · + X rn−1 = 1. Now taking the limit as X approaches 1 gives us 1 r1 + 1 r2 + · · · + 1 rn = 1, as desired. The most natural way to proceed in the previous problem was to use an inﬁnite power series, as the fact that the integers is partitioned into arithmetic sequences is a giveaway that a geometric series may be used. Note that in this example, the information was encoded in the exponents, not in the coeﬃcients. 5 Combinatorial Nullstellensatz The Combinatorial Nullstellensatz (also called the polynomial method ) is a technique in combinatorics de- veloped by Noga Alon. The word nullstellensatz is German for “theorem of zeros.” Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz is also a very well-known theorem that is not related to the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. Although there are two parts to the original Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, we are interested in the latter: Theorem 5.1 (Combinatorial Nullstellensatz). Let F be an arbitrary ﬁeld, and let f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) be a polynomial in F [x1, x2, . . . , xn]. Suppose the degree deg f of f is ∑n i=1 ti, where each ti is a nonnegative integer, and suppose the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 xti i in f is nonzero. Then, if S1, S2, . . . , Sn are subsets of F with |Si| > ti, there are s1 ∈ S1, s2 ∈ S2, . . . , sn ∈ Sn so that f (s1, s2, . . . , sn) ̸= 0. A ﬁeld, for our purposes, may simply be deﬁned as a set in which every element has a multiplicative inverse. More formally, however, a ﬁeld is a commutative ring in which each element contains a multiplicative inverse. Examples of ﬁelds include the rational numbers Q, the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, the integers modulo p Fp (where p is prime), and the algebraic numbers Q. The proof of this theorem is shown in Noga Alon’s renowned paper itself 2, and the reader is advised to take a look at the various applications of this theorem in the article. One of the most elegant applications of the Nullstellensatz is to prove the Cauchy-Davenport Theorem. 2http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~nogaa/PDFS/null2.pdf 5 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park Theorem 5.2 (Cauchy-Davenport). If p is prime and A and B are nonempty subsets of Fp, then |A + B| ≥ min{p, |A| + |B| − 1}. Proof. If |A| + |B| > p, for every x ∈ Fp the sets A and x − B = {x − b, b ∈ B} must intersect by the Pigeonhole Principle. Thus there exists a ∈ A and b ∈ B such that a = x − b, so a + b = x. Since x goes through the elements of Fp, we see that |A + B| = p. If |A| + |B| ≤ p, then suppose the result is false and so |A + B| ≤ |A| + |B| − 2. There must exist a subset C of Fp such that A + B ⊆ C and |C| = |A| + |B| − 2. We now implement the polynomial method. Let f (x, y) = ∏ c∈C(x + y − c). By the deﬁnition of C, we have that f (a, b) = 0 for all a ∈ A and b ∈ B. Set t1 = |A| − 1, t2 = |B| − 1, n = 2, S1 = A, and S2 = B in Theorem 5.1. Note that the coeﬃcient of x|A|−1y|B|−1 is (|A|+|B|−2 |A|−1 ), which is nonzero in Fp because |A| + |B| − 2 ≤ p − 2. The Combinatorial Nullstellensatz tells us that there exists an a ∈ A and b ∈ B such that f (a, b) ̸= 0, a contradiction. Therefore, |A + B| > |A| + |B| − 2 and our result is proven. The crux of the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz is to choose the “right” function f . Oftentimes, there may be only one function that actually proves a problem. The following problem from IMO 2007 was criticized for being a #6, but was routine if one knew how to apply the polynomial method; in fact, Noga Alon’s paper itself had a very similar example involving n-hypercubes. Example 5.1 (IMO 2007/6). Let n be a positive integer. Consider S = {(x, y, z)|x, y, z ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n}, x + y + z > 0} as a set of (n + 1)3 − 1 points in three-dimensional space. Determine the smallest possible number of planes, the union of which contains S but does not include (0, 0, 0). Solution. Suppose that planes P1, P2, . . . , Pk satisfy the conditions, where Pi are planes. Let us consider planes of the form aix + biy + ciz = di, where di ̸= 0 (otherwise, (0, 0, 0) would pass through this plane, which we do not want). The most “obvious” polynomial is to use f (x, y, z) = k∏ i=1 (aix + biy + ciz − di). This vanishes everywhere where the planes cover, so this polynomial seems like a good choice. However, it never actually addresses the fact that the point (0, 0, 0) is disallowed - f (0, 0, 0) does not evaluate to 0. So we have to think of another polynomial that vanishes at every point in the cube (including (0, 0, 0)). This motivates us to append another term to f (x, y, z) so that it remains the same at every value in the cube other than (0, 0, 0). Let us take f (x, y, z) = k∏ i=1 (aix + biy + ciz − di) − k∏ i=1 (−di) n∏ i=1 (x − i)(y − i)(z − i) −i3 . At every point other than (0, 0, 0) in the cube, the added term evalutes to 0, so the polynomial still vanishes. At (0, 0, 0), the added term evaluates to −(−dk) k, so it cancels out the remaining term in our original polynomial. Now we are free to use the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. 6 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park Suppose that k < 3n. Then the leading coeﬃcient of f (x, y, z) is − ∏k i=1(−di) (−1)n(n!)3 , which is nonzero, contributed by the term that we added to the original polynomial. We use the subsets S1 = S2 = S3 = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n}, since |S1| = |S2| = |S3| > n. There must exist s1, s2, s3 ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , n} such that f (s1, s2, s3) = 0 by the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz. But f (0, 0, 0) = 0 and every other point in the cube evaluates to 0, so we must have a contradiction. Hence k ≥ 3n and we may construct 3n such planes using x + y + z = i for i = 1, 2, . . . , 3k. 6 Counting Trees A tree is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one simple path. Thus, a tree is acyclic and connected. A tree that connects all vertices of a graph is called a spanning tree. A forest is a disjoint union of trees. 6 5 4 1 2 3 A complete graph Kn on n vertices is a graph in which any two vertices are connected by an edge. Due to the abundance of edges in a complete graph, it is a natural question to ask how many spanning trees are in a complete graph. It is easy to check that for K3, there are 3 spanning trees; for K4, there are 16; for K5, there are 125. Borchardt showed in 1860 that there is a very simple formula for this, which was eventually named under Cayley: Theorem 6.1 (Cayley). The number of spanning trees in a complete graph Kn is nn−2. Proof. Let tn be the number of unordered trees on Kn (we will divide tn by n after we obtain an explicit formula), and let t0 = 0. Deﬁne the exponential generating function f (X) = ∑ n≥0 tn X n n! . It is a known consequence of viewing the tree as a product structure, which I will not get into this lecture, that the generating function can be deﬁned recursively as f (X) = xef (X). In order to extract the power series of f (X), we use a technique called Lagrange inversion: Theorem 6.2 (Lagrange). Suppose f and g are formal series such that g(f (X)) = X. Then [X n]f (X) = 1 n! [ d n−1 dX n−1 ( X g(X) )n] X=0 . 7 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park We are looking for the inverse of the function X eX . Substituting g(X) = X eX gives us [X n]f (X) = 1 n! [ dn−1 dX n−1 enX ] X=0 = [ nn−1enX ] X=0 = nn−1. Thus the number of ordered trees is nn−1 n = nn−2. This gives a nice result for the number of spanning trees in a complete graph. A natural extension is to ﬁnd the number of spanning trees in an arbitrary graph. A celebrated theorem of Kirchoﬀ enumerates these spanning trees given a corresponding matrix called the Laplacian matrix. Before we deﬁne the Laplacian of a graph, we deﬁne the degree matrix and the adjacency matrix of a graph. Given a graph G with n vertices, its degree matrix D is the n × n diagonal matrix deﬁned by dij = { deg vi, if i = j; 0, otherwise. Its adjacency matrix A is the n × n square matrix where its elements aij speciﬁes the number of edges from vertex i to vertex j. Note that in an undirected graph, its adjacency matrix is always symmetric over the main diagonal. Its Laplacian matrix L is deﬁned by L = D − A. Kirchoﬀ’s Matrix Theorem then states: Theorem 6.3 (Kirchoﬀ). For a given connected graph G with n labeled vertices, let λ1, λ2, . . . , λn−1 be the nonzero eigenvalues of its Laplacian matrix. Then the number of spanning trees of G is λ1λ2 · · · λn−1 n . Equivalently, the number of spanning trees is equal to any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix of G. For example, consider the following graph: 1 2 34 5 6 7 89 10 8 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park This graph is called the Petersen graph 3. How many spanning trees are in this graph? One example is the tree connecting vertices labeled 1, 3, 8, 9, 4, 2, 5, 10, 6, 7, in that order. To ﬁnd the number of such trees in the graph, we ﬁrst compute its degree matrix and its adjacentry matrix. It is not diﬃcult to ﬁnd them: D =                 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3  | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  and A =                 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0  | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  . Thus our Laplacian matrix is L =                 3 0 −1 −1 0 −1 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 −1 −1 0 −1 0 0 0 −1 0 3 0 −1 0 0 −1 0 0 −1 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 1 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 −1 −1 0 0 0 0 3 −1 0 0 −1 0 −1 0 0 0 −1 3 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 −1 3 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 0 0 0 −1 3 −1 0 0 0 0 −1 −1 0 0 −1 3  | | | | | | | | | | | | | |  . With suﬃcient computation, one can ﬁnd the determinant of a cofactor matrix of L (it doesn’t matter which cofactor you choose; they should all evaluate to the same answer). This graph has 2000 spanning trees, the most of any 10-vertex cubic graph - that is, all of its vertices having degree 3. Note that we can easily obtain Cayley’s Formula using Kirchoﬀ’s Matrix Theorem. I encourage the reader to actually expand the determinant out for small values of n. 7 The Probabilistic Method The basic idea of the probabilistic method is to prove that an event happens with positive probability. Then, it can be concluded that such an event occurs. Before a few examples are introduced, the following lemma is useful in bounding the probability of an event P[X]: Lemma 7.1. Let A1, A2, · · · , An be a collection of events. Then P [ n⋃ i=1 Ai ] ≤ n∑ i=1 P[Ai]. Proof. This follows from the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion. The following example exempliﬁes the power of the method. Ramsey theory 4, the branch of mathematics 3http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petersen_graph 4More information of Ramsey theory and its graph-theoretic results can be found in this article: http://web.mat.bham.ac. uk/D.Kuehn/RamseyGreg.pdf 9 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park that studies the conditions under which certain properties hold, often make use of the technique of the probabilistic method. We deﬁne the Ramsey number R(k, ℓ) as the smallest integer m such that in any two-coloring of Kn with red and blue, there is either a red Kk or a blue Kℓ. For example, R(3, 3) > 5, since for K5, there is a two-coloring such that there is no red or blue triangle: Theorem 7.2. If (n k)2 1−(k 2) < 1, then R(k, k) > n. Proof. Consider a random two-coloring of Kn. Let R be a set of k vertices on Kn, and let AR be the event that the induced subgraph of Kn on R is monochromatic. Note that P[AR] = 2 2( k 2) = 2 1−( k 2). Thus the probability that at least one of the events AR occuring is P [⋃ R AR ] ≤ ∑ R P[AR] = ( n k )2 1−( k 2) < 1. Hence the probability that none of the events occur is greater than 0, so there exists a two-coloring of Kn without a monochromatic Kk. Note that Theorem 7.2 implies that R(k, k) > ⌊2 k/2⌋ because (⌊2k/2⌋ k )2 1−(k 2) < 21+k/2 k! · ⌊2 k/2⌋k 2k2/2 < 1. Theorem 7.2 shows that there exists a two-coloring of Kn without a monochromatic K2 log2 n. 8 Incidence Matrices In set theory problems, it is often useful to create a matrix (called an incidence matrix ) to represent which elements belong to which set. Given a set X = {x1, x2, . . . , xn} and X1, X2, . . . , Xk a family of subsets of X, we deﬁne the incidence matrix M by (mij)1≤i≤n 1≤j≤k, where mij = {1, if xi ∈ Xj; 0, if xi ̸∈ Xj. Often, contradiction is used by considering the determinant or the rank of the matrix. 10 TJ VMT ARML 2013-2014 Algebraic Combinatorics Robin Park Example 8.1. Let n be even and let A1, A2, . . . , An be distinct subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , n}, each of them having an even number of elements. Prove that among these subsets there are two having an even number of common elements. Solution. Suppose that |Ai ∩ Aj| is odd for all i, j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. Let M = (mij)1≤i≤n 1≤j≤n be the incidence matrix of the family A1, A2, . . . , An. Note that M T ·M =               n∑ k=1 m 2 k,1 n∑ k=1 mk,1mk,2 · · · n∑ k=1 mk,1mk,n n∑ k=1 mk,2mk,1 n∑ k=1 m2 k,2 · · · n∑ k=1 mk,2mk,n ... ... . . . ... n∑ k=1 mk,nmk,1 n∑ k=1 mk,nmk,2 · · · n∑ k=1 m 2 k,n  | | | | | | | | | | | |  =      |A1| |A1 ∩ A2| · · · |A1 ∩ An| |A2 ∩ A1| |A2| · · · |A2 ∩ An| ... ... . . . ... |An ∩ A1| |An ∩ A2| · · · |An|  | | |  . We know that each term not on the main diagonal is odd, so let us work in the ﬁeld F2. Then M T · M =        0 1 · · · 1 1 1 0 · · · 1 1 ... ... . . . ... ... 1 1 · · · 0 1 1 1 · · · 1 0  | | | | |  . The determinant of this matrix is 1 in F2. Thus det M T · M = (det M ) 2 is odd, so det M is odd. But note that in M , if we add all of the rows to the ﬁrst row, we obtain |Ai| in the ﬁrst row. Thus det M is even, a contradiction. 9 Problems 1. Determine an explicit formula for the Lucas numbers. 2.

(TSTST 2013) A country has n cities, labelled 1, 2, 3, . . . , n.
