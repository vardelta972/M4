Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with AB = a, BC = b, CD = c and DA = d. Suppose a 2 + b 2 + c2 + d2 = ab + bc + cd + da, and the area of ABCD is 60 square units. If the length of one of the diagonals is 30 units, determine the length of the other diagonal. Solution a 2 +b2 +c 2 +d2 = ab+bc+cd+da ⇒ (a−b) 2 +(b−c) 2 +(c−d)2 +(d−a)2 = 0 ⇒ a = b = c = d. Thus ABCD is a rhombus and [ABCD] = (1/2)(d1d2) (1) where d1 and d2 are the lengths of the diagonals. Hence d2 = 2[ABCD] d1 = 4 units. 2. Determine the number of 3-digit numbers in base 10 having at least one 5 and at most one 3. Solution We count the number of 3-digit numbers with (i) at least one 5 and having no 3 and (ii) at least one 5 and having exactly one 3 separately. (i) Here we ﬁrst count the whole set and subtract the number of 3-digit numbers having no 5 from it. Since 3 is not there and 0 cannot be the ﬁrst digit, we can ﬁll the ﬁrst digit in 8 ways. But we can ﬁll the second and third digits in 9 ways(as 0 can be included). Thus we get 8 × 9 × 9 such numbers. If no 5 is there, then the number of such numbers is 7 × 8 × 8. Thus the number of 3-digit numbers not containing 3 and having at least one 5 is (8 × 9 × 9) − (7 × 8 × 8) = 8(81 − 56) = 200. (ii) If 3 is there as a digit, then it can be the ﬁrst digit or may be the second or third digit. Consider those numbers in which 3 is the ﬁrst digit. The number of such numbers having at least one 5 is (9 × 9) − (8 × 8) = 81 − 64 = 17. The number of 3-digit numbers in which the second digit is 3 and having at least one 5 is (8 × 9) − (7 × 8) = 16. Similarly, the number of 3-digit numbers in which the third digit is 3 and having at least one 5 is (8 × 9) − (7 × 8) = 16. Thus we get 17 + 16 + 16 = 49 such numbers. Therefore the number of 3-digit numbers having at most one 3 and at least one 5 is 200+49 = 249. 3. Let P (x) be a non-constatnt polynomial whose coeﬃcients are positive integers. If P (n) divides P (P (n) − 2015) for every natural number n, prove that P (−2015) = 0. Solution Note that P (n) − 2015 − (−2015) = P (n) divides P (P (n) − 2015) − P (−2015) for every positive integer n. But P (n) divides P (P (n) − 2015) for every positive integer n. Therefore P (n) divides P (−2015) for every positive integer n. Hence P (−2015) = 0. 1 Note In the original version of the problem the word ‘non-constant’ was missing. The falsity of the statement was brought to the attention of the examiners by a contestant who mentioned it in a remark at the end of a perfect solution to the problem assuming that the polynomial is non-constant. Many students assumed that the polynomial is non-constant and completed the solution. They deserved full credit for doing so. 4. Find all three digit natural numbers of the form (abc)10 such that (abc)10, (bca)10 and (cab)10 are in geometric progression. (Here (abc)10 is representation in base 10.) Solution Let us write x = (a × 10 2) + (b × 10) + c, y = (b × 102) + (c × 10) + a, z = (c × 102) + (a × 10) + b. We are given that y2 = xz. This means ((b × 102) + (c × 10) + a )2 = ((a × 102) + (b × 10) + c)((c × 102) + (a × 10) + b ). We can solve for c and get c = 10b 2 − a 2 10a − b . If a, b, c are digits leading to a solution, and if d = gcd(a, b) then d|c. Consequently, we may assume that gcd(a, b) = 1. Now c = 999a 2 10a − b − (10b + 100a), showing that 10a − b divides 999a 2. Since a, b are relatively prime, this is possible only if 10a − b is a factor of 999. It follows that 10a − b takes the values 1,3,9,27,37. These values lead to the pairs (a, b) = (1, 9), (1, 7), (1, 1), (4, 3). We can discard the ﬁrst two pairs as they lead to a value of c > 10. The third gives the trivial solution (111, 111, 111). Taking d = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, we get 9 solution: (abc)10 = 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999. The last pair gives c = 2 and hence the solution (432, 324, 243). Another solution is obtained on multiplying by 2: (864, 648, 486). Thus we have (abc)10 = 111, 222, 333, 444, 555, 666, 777, 888, 999, 432, 864. 5. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦ and let BD be the altitude from B on to AC. Draw DE ⊥ AB and DF ⊥ BC. Let P , Q, R and S be respectively the incentres of triangle DF C, DBF , DEB and DAE. Suppose S, R, Q are collinear. Prove that P , Q, R, D lie on a circle. Solution 2 We ﬁrst show that SR is perpendicular to QP . Consider triangles P F Q and RES. Observe that AE ∥ DF and ED ∥ F C. Since ES bisects ∠AED and F P bisects ∠DF C, it follows that ES ∥ F P . Since ER ⊥ ES and F Q ⊥ F P , we also have ER ∥ F Q. If r1 and r2 are inradii of triangles DEA and DEB, and if r′ is the inradius of △DAB, we know that r1 = r′ AD AB , r2 = r′ BD AB . Hence ES ER = r1 r2 = AD BD . Similarly, we can prove that F Q F P = BD DC . But we know that AD/BD = BD/DC. Hence we conclude that ES/ER = F Q/F P . Therefore △ESR ∼ △QF P . But SE ⊥ ER and ER ∥ QF imply SE ⊥ QF . It follows that SR ⊥ QP . Since S, R, Q are collinear, we get SQ ⊥ QP . Thus ∠RQP = 90 ◦. Consider the circumcircle of △P RQ. Since ∠RDP = 90 ◦, we conclude that D lies on this circle. Hence P, Q, R, D are concyclic. 6. Let S = {1, 2, . . . , n} and let T be the set of all ordered triples of subsets of S, say (A1, A2, A3), such that A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 = S. Determine, in terms of n, ∑ (A1,A2,A3)∈T |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| where |X| denotes the number of elements in the set X. (For example, if S = {1, 2, 3} and A1 = {1, 2}, A2 = {2, 3}, A3 = {3} then one of the elements of T is ({1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3}).) Solution 1 Let X = (A1, A2, A3) ∈ T and let i ∈ A1 ∩A2 ∩A3. The number of times the element i occurs in the required sum is equal to the number of ordered tuples (A1 − {i}, A2 − {i}, A3 − {i}) such that A1 − {i} ∪ A2 − {i} ∪ A3 − {i} = S − {i} (∗) 3 For every element of S − {i}, there are eight possibilities - whether the element belongs to or does not belong to Ai for i = 1, 2, 3. Out of these the case when the element does not belong to any of the three subsets violates (∗). Therefore, each element can satisfy the requirement in 7 ways. The number of tuples is, therefore, 7 n−1 and the sum is n.7 n−1. Solution 2 Consider all tuples (A1, A2, A3) such that A1 ∩A2 ∩A3 = B (∗) and A1 ∪A2 ∪A3 = S (∗∗). Let |B| = r. (*) and (**) lead to A1 − B ∩ A2 − B ∩ A3 − B = Φ (∗ ∗ ∗) and A1 − B ∪ A2 − B ∪ A3 − B = S − B (∗ ∗ ∗∗) As before, for every element of S − B, there are eight possibilities. Out of these two cases -i. the element belongs to each of the three subsets A1, A2, A3 violates (***) and ii. the element does not belong to any of the three subsets violates (****). Therefore, there are 6 possibilities for each element. Also, |S − B| = n − r, therefore, the number of tuples satisfying (*) and (**) is 6 n−r. The number of ways we can select r elements is (n r), therefore the required number is n∑ r=0 (n r ) r6 n−r = n7 n−1 Solution 3 This solution was given by a contestant of standard IX. We provide a sketch of the same. Write Sn and Tn in place of S and T respectively. Also, let ∑ (A1,A2,A3)∈Tn |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| = an. We shall show that an = n.7n−1 using recurrence and induction. Let an = n.7n−1 for some positive integer n. Then, the elements of Tn+1 are made by adding n + 1 to either A1 or A2 or A3 or A1 ∩ A2 or A2 ∩ A3 or A3 ∩ A1 or A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 in Tn. Further, it is easily established that |Tn| = 7n. Now, if n + 1 is added to A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3 then |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| increases by 1. Otherwise it remains the same. So, as there are seven choices of where to put n + 1, an+1 = 7an + |Tn| Thus an+1 = (n + 1).7n, which completes the inductive step, as the base case n = 1 is trivial. Therefore ∑ (A1,A2,A3)∈T |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| = n.7n−1 7. Let x, y, z be real numbers such that x2 + y2 + z2 − 2xyz = 1. Prove that (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) ≤ 4 + 4xyz. Solution 4 Write 1 + 2xyz = x2 + y2 + z2 ⇔ 3 + 3xyz = 3 2 (x2 + y2 + z2) + 3 2 ⇒ 3 + 3xyz = (x2 + y2 + z2) + 1 2 [(x2 + 1) + (y2 + 1) + (z2 + 1)] ≥ x2 + y2 + z2 + x + y + z (Use x2 + y2 + z2 ≥ xy + yz + zx and AM-GM: x2 + 1 ≥ 2x etc.) ⇒ 3 + 3xyz ≥ xy + yz + zx + x + y + z. By adding 1 + xyz in both sides, we get 4 + 4xyz ≥ 1 + x + y + z + xy + yz + zx + xyz = (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z). Equality holds when x = y = z = 1. 8. The length of each side of a convex quadrilateral ABCD is a positive integer. If the sum of the lengths of any three sides is divisible by the length of the remaining side then prove that some two sides of the quadrilateral have the same length. Solution Let us take ABCD to be a quadrilateral with AB = a, BC = b, CD = c and DA = d where a, b, c, d are integers. We know AC < AB + BC and AD < AC + CD < AB + BC + CD. Thus we get d < a + b + c. Similarly we can write down three more inequalities: a < b + c + d, b < c + d + a and c < d + a + b. We can also take d to be the largest side. Using the given conditions, we can write a + b + c + d = la, b + c + d + a = mb, c + d + a + b = nc, a + b + c + d = kd, for some positive integers l, m, n, k. Suppose no two sides are equal. Then a < d, b < d, c < d. Hence a + b + c < 3d. Since d divides a + b + c and d < a + b + c < 3d, we must have a + b + c = 2d. Thus we obtain a + b + c + d = 3d = la = mb = nc. Write this as a = 3d l , b = 3d m , c = 3d n . Using 2d = a + b + c, we get the equation 3 l + 3 m + 3 n = 2. Here l, m, n are necessarily distinct. Suppose l = m. Then la = 3d = lb. This implies a = b, a contradiction. Similarly m = n and l = n can be discarded. We may assume l < m < n. This means, we have to solve the equation for distinct positive integers. If l ≥ 4, then m ≥ 5 and n ≥ 6. Hence 2 3 = 1 l + 1 m + 1 n ≤ 1 4 + 1 5 + 1 6 = 37 60 < 2 3 which is impossible. This means l = 1, l = 2 or l = 3. For l = 1, we get b + c + d = 0, Which is impossible. If l = 2, we get b + c + d = a, which contradicts a < b + c + d. If l = 3, then a = d and this contradicts again a < d. Therefore some two of a, b, c, d are equal. THE END NOTE We do not claim that the solutions presented here are the most elegant solutions but we thought they would be instructive. For some problems we found that solutions by contestants were diﬀerent and we have included them in this document. 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
