Show that a 2 + b2 ab + 1 is the square of an integer. Solution. Suppose that a, b are positive integers so that ab + 1 divides a 2 + b2 and let k := a 2 + b2 ab + 1 . (1) We have to prove that k is a perfect square. The very fundamental idea of this and similar problems is to give up the idea of proving properties of a and b directly. Instead, we are going to prove the desired property of k (i.e. that k is a perfect square) by ﬁxing k and considering all positive integers a, b which satisfy (1), that is, we consider S(k) := { (a, b) ∈ Z + × Z + : a 2 + b2 ab + 1 = k} . By deﬁning this set, we leave the concrete values of a, b and instead take the whole ”environ- ment” of k into consideration. The next step is to assume the required statement to be wrong (for the sake of contradiction), that is, we suppose that k is not a perfect square. The rest of the problem goes by the method of Inﬁnite Descent: We take any pair (a, b) ∈ S(k) and show the existence of another pair (a1, b1) ∈ S(k) which is smaller than (a, b) where (a1, b1) is said to be smaller than (a, b) if a1 + b1 < a + b. This however is a contradiction because S(k) ⊂ Z + × Z + implies that there exists a lower bound for a + b which is also achieved by at least one pair (a, b) ∈ S(k). Suppose that (a, b) ∈ S(k) is any pair which satisﬁes (1). Wlog assume that a ≥ b. Consider the equation x 2 + b2 xb + 1 = k (2) as a quadratic equation in x. This equation is equivalent to x 2 − kxb + b2 − k = 0. (3) We know that x = a is a root of (3) since x = a solves (2). Let a1 be the other solution of (3). Notice that by using the fact that this quadratic equation has another solution, we have found another pair (a1, b) that solves (1). The ﬁrst step is to show that (a1, b) ∈ S(k). Lemma 1. a1 is a positive integer. Proof. We know from Vieta’s theorem that a1 = kb − a. Thus, a1 is an integer. We still have to prove that a1 is positive. First, assume that a1 = 0. But this implies that k = b2 since we know that x = a1 solves the equation (2), a contradiction to our assumption that k is not a perfect square. Now, assume that a1 < 0. Then from (3) we infer that k = a 2 1 − ka1b + b2 ≥ a 2 1 + kb + b2 > k, Project PEN Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com clearly impossible. Notice that the last step follows from b > 0. We therefore know that a1 > 0 and thus a1 ∈ Z +. Corollary 1. (a1, b) ∈ S(k). We hence have constructed another pair in S(k) from any given pair (a, b). If we are able to prove that this new pair is smaller than the old one, we can use the argument of inﬁnite descent to reach our contradiction and we are done. The next step is to prove that the new pair is indeed smaller than (a, b). Lemma 2. a1 < a. Proof. We know that x = a and x = a1 are the roots of (3). It therefore follows from Vieta’s theorem that a1 = b2 − k a . However, since we assumed that a ≥ b, we infer that b2 − k a < a from which a1 < a follows. We thus have proved the existence of a pair (a1, b1) ∈ S(k) that is smaller than (a, b), i.e. that a1 + b1 < a + b. Iterating this procedure for (a1, b1), we can construct another pair (a2, b2) ∈ S(k) that is smaller than (a1, b1) and another pair (a3, b3) ∈ S(k) that is smaller than (a2, b2) and so on. In other words, we can construct pairs (aj, bj) for j = 1, 2, . . . so that a + b > a1 + b1 > a2 + b2 > a3 + b3 > . . . which is impossible since all (aj, bj) ∈ S(k) ⊂ Z + × Z +. Revising this method, we ﬁrst assumed the existence of a pair (a, b) that does not satisfy the statement we want to prove. We then went away from this concrete pair (a, b) and instead considered pairs with the same property as (a, b). The next step is to deﬁne a ”size” of a pair (a, b) which in our case was simply a + b. It is trivial that this size has a lower bound. Using the theorem of Vieta, we constructed another pair (a1, b1) from any given pair (a, b) and we proved that the new pair is smaller than the old one. This method is called Vieta-Jumping or Root Flipping. Applying the method of inﬁnite descent, we obtain our desired contradiction. With the same ideas, we can also prove a generalisation of the problem: 2 PEN A4 (CRUX, Problem 1420, Shailesh Shirali) If a, b, c are positive integers such that 0 < a 2 + b2 − abc ≤ c, show that a 2 + b2 − abc is a perfect square. Indeed, the ﬁrst problem is a special case of this one since 0 < a2 + b2 − abc = c Project PEN Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com implies that a 2 + b2 ab + 1 = c which must be a perfect square. Solution. Again, as in the ﬁrst problem, we assume that there exist positive integers a, b, c so that k := a 2 + b2 − abc (4) is not a perfect square. We know that k > 0 and k ≤ c. We now ﬁx k and c and consider all pairs (a, b) of positive integers which satisfy the equation (4), that is, we consider S(c, k) = {(a, b) ∈ Z + × Z + : a 2 + b2 − abc = k} . Suppose that (a, b) is any pair in S(c, k). Wlog assume that a ≥ b. Consider the equation x 2 − xbc + b2 − k = 0 (5) as a quadratic equation in x. We know that x = a is a root of this equation. Let a1 be the other root of this equation. Lemma 3. a1 is a positive integer. Proof. Since a1 and a are the roots of (5), we know from the theorem of Vieta that a1 = bc − a. It therefore follows that a1 is an integer. If a1 = 0 then (5) implies that b2 = k is a perfect square, a contradiction. If a1 < 0 then (5) implies that k = a 2 1 + b2 − a1bc ≥ a 2 1 + b2 + bc > c, a contradiction to k ≤ c. Thus, a1 is a positive integer. Corollary 2. (a1, b) ∈ S(c, k). Again, it remains to be proven that the new pair (a1, b) is smaller than (a, b). Lemma 4. a1 < a. Proof. We know that a1 and a are the roots of (5), so by Vieta’s theorem, a1 = b2 − k a . Since we assumed that a ≥ b, it follows that b2 − k a < a which implies a1 < a. Project PEN Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com We have therefore constructed another pair (a1, b1) in S(c, k) with a1 + b1 < a + b. However, S(c, k) ⊂ Z + × Z +, so using the argument of inﬁnite descent, we obtain our desired contradiction. Remark: There exists a bunch of problems which can be solved with these ideas. Here are some of them: 1. (IMO 2007/5) Let a, b be positive integers so that 4ab − 1 divides (4a 2 − 1) 2. Show that a = b. Hint: First prove that if 4ab − 1|(4a 2 − 1) 2, then 4ab − 1|(a − b) 2. 2. (A5) Let x and y be positive integers such that xy divides x 2 + y2 + 1. Show that x 2 + y2 + 1 xy = 3. 3. Let a, b be positive integers with ab ̸= 1. Suppose that ab − 1 divides a 2 + b2. Show that a 2 + b2 ab − 1 = 5. Project PEN","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
