Email me at vy- wang (at) mit.edu for errors/comments/suggestions or to discuss anything, e.g. where to look for more of these kinds of problems or topics.) Recommendation: For your two sessions with me, work on the topic/problems you think would help you the most. 1Of course, if you don’t feel like doing geometry that’s ﬁne; there’s an algebra class tomorrow anyways. Also, while it’s important to be able to ﬁnd certain ideas on your own, I encourage you to occasionally work in small groups, both in and out of class; I think you can gain a surprising amount of intuition just by talking to others. This might be easier to coordinate out of class (especially for the harder problems), but just throwing up a possibility that could work well for some of you. 1 A touch of geometry 1. (MOP 2007, for James Tao) In triangle ABC, point L lies on side BC. Extend segment AB through B to M such that ∠ALC = 2∠AM C. Extend segment AC through C to N such that ∠ALB = 2∠AN B. Let O be the circumcenter of triangle AM N . Prove that OL ⊥ BC. 2. (Yang Liu, David Yang, based on USAMO 2014) Construct P0, P1, P−1, P2, P−2, P3, P−3, P4, P−4, P5, P−5 in order such that (i) P0, P1, P−1 are not collinear; (ii) P2 ∈ P0P−1 only (i.e. it doesn’t lie on any other line so far except the ones speciﬁed, in this case P0P−1); (iii) P−2 ∈ P1P2 only; (iv) P3 ∈ P0P−2 only; (v) P−3 ∈ P1P3 only; (vi) P4 ∈ P0P−3, P−1P−2 only; (vii) P−4 ∈ P1P4, P2P3 only; (viii) P5 ∈ P0P−4, P−1P−3 only; (ix) P−5 ∈ P1P5, P2P4 only. Prove that lines P0P−5, P−1P−4, P−2P−3 have nonempty intersection. 3. (Putnam 1996; also in analysis) Let (a1, b1), (a2, b2), . . . , (an, bn) be the vertices of a convex poly- gon which contains the origin in its interior. Prove that there exist positive reals x, y such that∑ (ai, bi)xaiybi = (0, 0). 1I remember last year I felt like I wasn’t getting anything out of around half of the classes. It’s a pity if you’re not learning at least one really new/interesting thing every day. 1 Victor Wang MOP experiment (“geometry” and combinatorics) 4. (“tan9p”, Math StackExchange; also in analysis) ABC is an equilateral triangle, and AD = BE = CF for some distinct points D, E, F inside, with A, D, E collinear, B, E, F collinear, and C, F, D collinear. Prove that DEF is an equilateral triangle. 5. (Motzkin-Rabin) Let S be a ﬁnite set of points in the plane (not all collinear), each colored red or blue. Show that there exists a monochromatic line passing through at least two points of S. 6. (Romania TST 2004; also in analysis) Let D be a closed disk in the complex plane. Prove that for all positive integers n, and for all complex numbers z1, z2, . . . , zn ∈ D there exists a z ∈ D such that zn = z1z2 · · · zn. 7. (China 2012; also in analysis) Find the smallest possible value of a real number c such that for any 2012-degree monic polynomial P (x) = x2012 + a2011x2011 + · · · + a1x + a0 with real coeﬃcients, we can obtain a new polynomial Q(x) by multiplying some of its coeﬃcients by −1 such that every root z of Q(x) satisﬁes the inequality |ℑz| ≤ c|ℜz|. 8. (V. Galperin and G. Galperin, also various olympiads) Darkness has descended on the plane of Mopok. All electricity has been cut-oﬀ by the Trydan Corporation. All they have to light the plane are k lighthouses that run on cooking oil where k ≥ 1 is a positive integer. They can be kept going indeﬁnitely, the Mopoks love their french fries, but each lighthouse can only illuminate a sector of 360/k degrees. The lamp of each lighthouse can be rotated but it must be ﬁxed before the light is turned on. Can the lights be rotated so that the whole plane is covered? (The lighthouses positions are given, you don’t get to choose where to put them.) (Assuming that k is even makes the problem a bit easier.) 2 Combinatorial stuﬀ 1. (Algebraic and additive combinatorics, vaguely) (a) (Boris Bukh) Suppose A1, . . . , Am are n × n matrices with m > n and A1 + · · · + Am invertible. Show that for some proper subset S ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , m} of indices, ∑ i∈S Ai is also invertible. (b) (TSTST 2011) Let n be a positive integer. Suppose we are given 2n + 1 distinct sets, each containing ﬁnitely many objects. Place each set into one of two categories, the red sets and the blue sets, so that there is at least one set in each category. We deﬁne the symmetric diﬀerence of two sets as the set of objects belonging to exactly one of the two sets. Prove that there are at least 2 n diﬀerent sets which can be obtained as the symmetric diﬀerence of a red set and a blue set. (c) (China 2011) Let ℓ, m, n be positive integers, and A1, A2, . . . , Am, B1, . . . , Bn be m + n pairwise distinct subsets of the set {1, 2, . . . , ℓ}. Suppose that the symmetric diﬀerences Ai∆Bj := (A ∪ B) \\ (A ∩ B) (for 1 ≤ i ≤ m, 1 ≤ j ≤ n) cover each nonempty subset of {1, 2, . . . , ℓ} exactly once. Find all possible values of m, n, in terms of ℓ. (d) (TST 2014, W.) Find all functions f : N → Z such that (f (m) − f (n))(m − n) is always a square. (e) (China?) Let p be a prime and a1, . . . , ak be k ≥ 1 distinct nonzero residues modulo p. Prove that there are at most (p − 1)/k numbers n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p − 1} such that [na1]p < [na2]p < · · · < [nak]p, where [x]p denotes the (nonnegative) remainder of x modulo p. (f) Let p be a prime and b1, . . . , bk be k ≥ 1 nonzero residues modulo p. Prove that there are at most (p − 1)/k numbers n ∈ {1, 2, . . . , p − 1} such that [nb1]p + · · · + [nbk]p = [n(b1 + · · · + bk)]p, where [x]p denotes the (nonnegative) remainder of x modulo p. (g) (Putnam 2012) Let q and r be integers with q > 0, and let A and B be intervals on the real line. Let T be the set of all b + mq where b and m are integers with b in B, and let S be the set of all integers a in A such that ra is in T . Show that if the product of the lengths of A and B is less than q, then S is the intersection of A with some arithmetic progression. 2 Victor Wang MOP experiment (“geometry” and combinatorics) (h) (RMM 2012, Ben Elliott; also in analysis) Each positive integer is coloured red or blue. A function f from the set of positive integers to itself has the following two properties: (a) if x ≤ y, then f (x) ≤ f (y); and (b) if x, y and z are (not necessarily distinct) positive integers of the same colour and x + y = z, then f (x) + f (y) = f (z). Prove that there exists a positive number a such that f (x) ≤ ax for all positive integers x. (i) (China 2012) Prove that there exists a positive real number C with the following property: for any integer n ≥ 2 and any subset X of the set {1, 2, . . . , n} such that |X| ≥ 2, there exist x, y, z, w ∈ X(not necessarily distinct) such that 0 < |xy − zw| < Cα−3, where α = |X| n . (The original problem asks for the weaker Cα−4.) (j) (China 2011) Let n > 1 be an integer, and let k be the number of distinct prime divisors of n. Prove that there exists an integer a, 1 < a < n k + 1, such that n | a2 − a. (k) (ELMO 2013, W. 2) Let m1, m2, . . . , m2013 > 1 be 2013 pairwise relatively prime positive inte- gers and A1, A2, . . . , A2013 be 2013 (possibly empty) sets with Ai ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , mi − 1} for i = 1, 2, . . . , 2013. Prove that there is a positive integer N such that N ≤ (2|A1| + 1) · · · (2|A2013| + 1) and for each i = 1, 2, . . . , 2013, there does not exist a ∈ Ai such that mi divides N − a. 2. (ELMO Shortlist 2012, Linus Hamilton) Form the inﬁnite graph A by taking the set of primes p congruent to 1 (mod 4), and connecting p and q if they are quadratic residues modulo each other. Do the same for a graph B with the primes 1 (mod 8). Show A and B are isomorphic to each other. 3. (a) (RMM 2012, Ilya Bogdanov) Given a positive integer n ≥ 3, colour each cell of an n × n square array with one of ⌊(n + 2)2/3⌋ colours, each colour being used at least once. Prove that there is some 1 × 3 or 3 × 1 rectangular subarray whose three cells are coloured with three diﬀerent colours. (b) Construct an example showing that n2/3 + O(n) colors are needed. 4. (Math Prize Olympiad 2010) Let S be a set of n points in the coordinate plane. Say that a pair of points is aligned if the two points have the same x-coordinate or y-coordinate. Prove that S can be partitioned into disjoint subsets such that (a) each of these subsets is a collinear set of points, and (b) at most n3/2 unordered pairs of distinct points in S are aligned but not in the same subset. 5. Simple processes. (a) (Russia 2003) Ana and Bora start with the letters A and B, respectively. Every minute, one of them either prepends or appends to his/her own word the other person’s word (not neces- sarily operating one after another). Prove that Ana’s word can always be partitioned into two palindromes. (b) (Bulgarian solitaire) Suppose we have N = 1 + 2 + · · · + n cards total among some number of stacks. In each move, Bob takes one card from each stack and forms a new stack with them. Show that Bob eventually ends up with 1, 2, . . . , n in some order. (c) (MOP 2005?) Suppose n coins have been placed in piles on the integers on the real line. (A pile may contain zero coins.) Let T denote the following sequence of operations. (a) Move piles 0, 1, 2, . . . to 1, 2, 3 . . ., respectively. (b) Remove one coin from each nonempty pile from among piles 1, 2, 3, . . ., then place the removed coins in pile 0. (c) Swap piles i and −i for i = 1, 2, 3, . . .. Prove that successive applications of T from any starting position eventually lead to some sequence of positions being repeated, and describe all possible positions that can occur in such a sequence. 6. Some graph theory. 2For extensions/comments see the solutions ﬁle here. 3 Victor Wang MOP experiment (“geometry” and combinatorics) (a) (TST 2014, Zolt´an F¨uredi) Let n be an even positive integer, and let G be an n-vertex graph with exactly n2 4 edges, where there are no loops or multiple edges (each unordered pair of distinct vertices is joined by either 0 or 1 edge). An unordered pair of distinct vertices {x, y} is said to be amicable if they have a common neighbor (there is a vertex z such that xz and yz are both edges). Prove that G has at least 2(n/2 2 ) pairs of vertices which are amicable. (b) (MOP 2010) Fix n points in space in such a way that no four of them are in the same plane, and choose any ⌊n 2/4⌋ + 1 segments determined by the given points. Determine the least number of points that are the vertices of a triangle formed by the chosen segments. 7. Consider a directed graph G with n vertices, where 1-cycles and 2-cycles are permitted. For any set S of vertices, let N +(S) denote the out-neighborhood of S (i.e. set of successors of S), and deﬁne (N +) k(S) = N +((N +)k−1(S)) for k ≥ 2. For ﬁxed n, let f (n) denote the maximum possible number of distinct sets of vertices in {(N +) k(X)}∞ k=1, where X is some subset of V (G). (a) (ELMO Shortlist 2012, Linus Hamilton 3) Show that f (n) is sub-exponential, in the sense that for any c > 1, we have f (n) < c n for all suﬃciently large n (certainly depending on c). (b) (Linus) Let g(n) denote Landau’s function: the largest least common multiple of any partition of n. Prove that g(n) ≤ f (n) ≤ (n + c)g(n) + nd for some constants c, d > 0 independent of n. (c) (W.) Prove that g(n) ≤ f (n) ≤ g(n) + n d for some constant d > 0 independent of n. 3Linus said he thought of this problem with Mitchell Lee and David Yang by trying to optimize their answer to the “half(L)” problem on this page, which I haven’t looked at but may be interesting. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
