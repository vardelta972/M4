Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Two circles Γ and Σ, with centres O and O′, respectively, are such that O′ lies on Γ. Let A be a point on Σ and M the midpoint of the segment AO′. If B is a point on Σ diﬀerent from A such that AB is parallel to OM , show that the midpoint of AB lies on Γ. 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial where a and b are real numbers. Suppose ⟨P (−1)2, P (0) 2, P (1) 2⟩ is an arithmetic progression of integers. Prove that a and b are integers. 3. Show that there are inﬁnitely many triples (x, y, z) of integers such that x3 + y4 = z31. 4. Suppose 36 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? 5. Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Γ and incentre I. Let the internal angle bisectors of ∠A, ∠B and ∠C meet Γ in A′, B′ and C ′ respectively. Let B′C ′ intersect AA′ in P and AC in Q, and let BB′ intersect AC in R. Suppose the quadrilateral P IRQ is a kite; that is, IP = IR and QP = QR. Prove that ABC is an equilateral triangle. 6. Show that there are inﬁnitely many positive real numbers a which are not integers such that a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) ———-000———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
