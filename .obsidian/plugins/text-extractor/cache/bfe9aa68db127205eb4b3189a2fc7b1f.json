Putting these triangles together we ﬁnd that ANB and CMD have equal areas. so f (1) = 1. Combining this with (1) and the result for x even we get f (x) = x for all x. It remains to check that our solution f (x) = x actually satisﬁes the given functional equation. But f (x + y) + f (x)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
