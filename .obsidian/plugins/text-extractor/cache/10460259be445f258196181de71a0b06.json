Three major examples are geometry, number theory, and functional equations. Such areas must be learned outside class time if one wants to be successful at solving olympiad style problems. This set of notes considers another one of these areas: inequalities. This area is not covered well at schools mainly because there is a large variety of methods involved. One subarea of inequalities involves problems of the following form: “Maximise or minimise some expression, subject to some constraint.” We shall discuss some basic facts about inequalities, and then discuss these so- called ‘max-min’ problems. 1. Well-known inequalities 1.1 The basics We begin with some obvious rules. Theorem 1 For real numbers a, b, c, d, we have the following. (a) If a > b, then a + c > b + c; if a ≥ b, then a + c ≥ b + c. (b) If a > b and c > d, then a + c > b + d; if a ≥ b and c > d, then a + c > b + d; if a ≥ b and c ≥ d, then a + c ≥ b + d. (c) If a > b, then ac > bc if c > 0, and ac < bc if c < 0; if a ≥ b, then ac ≥ bc if c > 0, and ac ≤ bc if c < 0. (d) Let a, b, c, d > 0. If a > b and c > d, then ac > bd; if a ≥ b and c > d, then ac > bd; if a ≥ b and c ≥ d, then ac ≥ bd; (e) a2 ≥ 0 always holds, with equality if and only if a = 0. (f ) Let a, b > 0. If a2 > b 2, then a > b; if a2 ≥ b2, then a ≥ b. 1.2 Proving inequalities: some well-known techniques How do we prove an inequality at olympiad level? We will discuss many diﬀerent techniques. But ﬁrstly, note that such a problem usually has two parts: (a) Prove the inequality. (b) If possible, state when we have equality. 1 It is a common mistake to ignore part (b). 1.2.1 Squares are non-negative A complicated looking inequality can be proved if we can show that it is equiv- alent to an inequality of the form ‘LHS ≥ 0’, where ‘LHS’ is a sum of squares. Example 1. Prove that x4 − 7x2 + 4x + 20 ≥ 0 for every real x. When do we have equality? We have x4−7x2+4x+20 = (x4−8x2+16)+(x2+4x+4) = (x2−4)2+(x+2)2 ≥ 0. For equality, we need both x2 − 4 = 0 and x + 2 = 0. This is only possible when x = −2. Example 2. Let a, b ≥ 0. Prove that a+b 2 ≥ √ab. Since a, b ≥ 0, √a and √ b are well-deﬁned. We have 0 ≤ (√ a − √b) 2 = a + b − 2 √ ab, so a + b ≥ 2 √ab, so a+b 2 ≥ √ab. Equality holds if and only if √a − √ b = 0, ie: when a = b since a, b ≥ 0. Example 3. Prove that x2 + y2 + z2 ≥ xy + yz + zx for all real x, y, z. We have 0 ≤ (x − y) 2 + (y − z) 2 + (z − x) 2 = 2x2 + 2y2 + 2z2 − 2xy − 2yz − 2zx. So 2x2 + 2y2 + 2z2 ≥ 2xy + 2yz + 2zx, and we have the result by dividing by 2. Equality holds if and only if x − y = y − z = z − x = 0, ie: when x = y = z. 1.2.2 The QM-AM-GM-HM inequalities We now describe a chain of inequalities which will be extremely useful. Theorem 2 (The QM-AM-GM-HM inequalities) Let x1, . . . , xn ≥ 0. We de- ﬁne their quadratic mean to be QM = √ x2 1 + · · · + x2 n n . Deﬁne their arithmetic mean to be AM = x1 + · · · + xn n . Deﬁne their geometric mean to be GM = n√x1 · · · xn. For x1, . . . , xn > 0, deﬁne their harmonic mean to be HM = n 1 x1 + · · · + 1 xn . Then, if x1, . . . , xn > 0, we have QM ≥ AM ≥ GM ≥ HM. If we remove ‘ HM’ from above, we may have x1, . . . , xn ≥ 0 instead. ie: For x1, . . . , xn ≥ 0, we have QM ≥ AM ≥ GM. We have QM = AM = GM = HM if and only if x1 = · · · = xn. 2 Taking any two of these means gives us a useful inequality. For example, the ‘AM-GM inequality’ says: For x1, . . . , xn ≥ 0, we have x1 + · · · + xn n ≥ n√x1 · · · xn, with equality if and only if x1 = · · · = xn. Note that Example 2 above is the AM- GM inequality for two terms. The ‘AM-HM inequality’ says: For x1, . . . , xn > 0, we have x1 + · · · + xn n ≥ n 1 x1 + · · · + 1 xn , with equality if and only if x1 = · · · = xn. And so on. Example 4. Let a, b, c, x, y, z > 0. Prove that ( a x + b y + c z )( x a + y b + z c ) ≥ 9. Applying the AM-HM inequality, we have 1 3 ( a x + b y + c z ) ≥ 3 x a + y b + z c . This easily rearranges to the required inequality. Equality holds if and only if a, b, c, x, y, z satisfy a x = b y = c z . 1.2.3 Cauchy-Schwarz inequality This is another well-known inequality which is extremely useful. Theorem 3 (Cauchy-Schwarz inequality) Let x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn be real num- bers. Then (x1y1 + · · · + xnyn) 2 ≤ (x2 1 + · · · + x2 n)(y2 1 + · · · + y2 n). Equality holds if and only if either there exists a real number k such that x1 = ky1, x2 = ky2, . . . , xn = kyn, or there exists a real number ℓ such that y1 = ℓx1, y2 = ℓx2, . . . , yn = ℓxn. Note: Be careful! The statements ‘there exists a real number k such that x1 = ky1, x2 = ky2, . . . , xn = kyn’ and ‘there exists a real number ℓ such that y1 = ℓx1, y2 = ℓx2, . . . , yn = ℓxn’ are not quite equivalent. We will have a problem if either all xi = 0 or all yi = 0. For example, if x1 = · · · = xn = 0 and y1, . . . , yn are arbitrary, not all zero, then the ﬁrst statement above is true with k = 0, but the second is false! 3 Remarkably, almost all literature about the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality are not too careful about this, merely just stating one of these statements as the condition for equality! Example 5. Let x, y, z > 0. Prove that (x2 + y2 + z2) 1/2 ≥ 1 13(3x + 4y + 12z). Applying Cauchy-Schwarz, we have (3 2 + 42 + 122)(x2 + y2 + z2) ≥ (3x + 4y + 12z)2, x2 + y2 + z2 ≥ 1 169(3x + 4y + 12z)2. Since both sides are positive, the result follows by taking square roots. Equality holds if and only if x = 3k, y = 4k and z = 12k for some real number k > 0. 1.2.4 Jensen’s inequality This is yet another very useful inequality. To state this inequality, we must ﬁrst deﬁne a property of functions. A function f (x) deﬁned on an interval I is said to be strictly convex on I if for every a, b ∈ I with a < b, and for every λ with 0 < λ < 1, we have f ((1 − λ)a + λb) < (1 − λ)f (a) + λf (b). Graphically, this just says that, no matter where we choose a and b within I, the chord joining (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)) lies strictly above the graph of the function in the interval (a, b). ................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................ ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ................................................................................................ ................................................................................................................................................................................. ............................................................................................................................................... ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ................ a b(1−λ)a+λb f ((1−λ)a+λb) (1−λ)f (a)+λf (b) (a,f (a)) (b,f (b)) y=f (x) . . . . For example, f (x) = x2 is strictly convex on (−∞, ∞). g(x) = sin x is strictly convex on [π, 2π]. We say that f (x), deﬁned on interval I, is strictly concave on I if −f (x) is strictly convex on I. Graphically, for all a, b ∈ I with a < b, the chord joining (a, f (a)) and (b, f (b)) lies strictly below the graph of the function in the interval (a, b). We can now state Jensen’s inequality. 4 Theorem 4 (Jensen’s inequality) Let f (x) be a function deﬁned on an interval I, and is strictly convex on I. Then, for every x1, . . . , xn ∈ I, we have 1 n(f (x1) + · · · + f (xn)) ≥ f ( 1 n(x1 + · · · + xn) ) . Equality holds if and only if x1 = · · · = xn. A similar statement holds when we replace ‘convex’ by ‘concave’, and reverse the inequality. Example 6. For w, x, y, z > 0, prove that 16(w3 +x3 +y3 +z3) ≥ (w+x+y +z) 3. Since f (x) = x3 is strictly convex on (0, ∞), by Jensen’s inequality, we have 1 4(w3 + x3 + y3 + z3) ≥ ( w + x + y + z 4 )3 . This rearranges to the required inequality. Equality holds if and only if w = x = y = z. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to decide whether a function is strictly convex/concave on a certain interval. For example, where is the function f (x) = x4 + 4x3 − 18x2 + 5x strictly convex/concave? One way to determine this would be to use calculus, which we will come to next. 2. Calculus 2.1 Calculus or no calculus? Despite the fact that a lot of references suggest that the knowledge of calculus is never required in olympiad style problems, calculus is still a useful tool to have. Of course, it has advantages and disadvantages. A big advantage is that it is quite powerful and sometimes it oﬀers a ‘cheap way out’; namely there may be elegant solutions to a certain problem, but calculus oﬀers an easy, ugly solution (but still a solution!). Another is that calculus oﬀers a way to determine where a function is strictly convex/concave. A big disadvantage is that calculus only locates local min- ima/local maxima/points of inﬂexion. A detailed analysis of the function concerned is needed to show whether a local minimum/local maximum is also indeed global. Moreover, we may need to compute the second derivative to determine the nature of stationary values, and this is not always pleasant. Nevertheless, if the function concerned is simple enough and a detailed analysis is carried out, then calculus can oﬀer solutions. There is the following important principle in calculus as well. Theorem 5 Suppose f : I → R is twice diﬀerentiable on the interval I. Suppose that c ∈ I is the only critical point of f (x). Then, f (c) is the global minimum of f (x) if f ′′(c) > 0, and f (c) is the global maximum of f (x) if f ′′(c) < 0. 5 Example 7. For x > 0, minimise 16 x + 81x3/2. At ﬁrst sight, this problem is crying out for a calculus solution. Let f (x) = 16x−1 + 81x3/2. We have f ′(x) = −16x−2 + 243 2 x1/2. Solving f ′(x) = 0 gives x = 4 9. We ﬁnd that f ( 4 9) = 60. Also, f ′′(x) = 32x−3 + 243 4 x−1/2. We see that f ′′(x) > 0 for all x > 0, so in particular, f ′′( 4 9) > 0. Hence by Theorem 5, f ( 4 9) = 60 is the global minimum of f (x), and 60 is the required minimum. We have equality if and only if x = 4 9. We may also argue without Theorem 5, by considering the graph of f (x). Ob- serve that f (x) → ∞ when x → 0 and when x → ∞. Indeed f (x) has the y-axis as an asymptote, and it behaves like 81x3/2 for large x. The graph of f (x) looks like: ............................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... ..... ..... ................ ................ y 60 0 4 9 x f (x) = 16 x + 81x3/2 . We could, in fact, use the AM-GM inequality to solve this problem: apply AM- GM on 16 3x , 16 3x, 16 3x, 81 2 x3/2, 81 2 x3/2. This does not seem as obvious as the calculus approach. As mentioned, another thing that calculus can do is to determine where a function is strictly convex/concave. We have the following result. Theorem 6 Suppose f : I → R is twice diﬀerentiable on the interval I. Then, f (x) is strictly convex on I if f ′′(x) > 0 for all x ∈ I, and f (x) is strictly concave on I if f ′′(x) < 0 for all x ∈ I. Example 8. Determine where the function f (x) = x4 + 4x3 − 18x2 + 5x is strictly convex and strictly concave. We ﬁnd easily that f ′′(x) = 12x2 + 24x − 36 = 12(x + 3)(x − 1). We have f ′′(x) > 0 when x < −3 or when x > 1, and f ′′(x) < 0 when −3 < x < 1. So by Theorem 6, f (x) = x4 + 4x3 − 18x2 + 5x is strictly convex on (−∞, −3) and on (1, ∞), and strictly concave on (−3, 1). In a nutshell, use calculus only when the function is suﬃciently simple, and avoid calculus if the function is too complicated. 3. ‘Maximum-Minimum Problems’ 3.1 How do we tackle them? Problems of the type 6 “Maximise and/or minimise (expression A), subject to (constraint B)” can be diﬃcult to solve. The diﬃculty usually seems to be to decide how to incor- porate constraint B into the problem of maximising and/or minimising expression A. This gets even more diﬃcult if, for example, expression A involves more than two variables and constraint B is only a single equation relating the variables: there may be little or no hope if we try to ‘eliminate one variable’, and one would have to think of another approach. The techniques that we have already discussed more or less cover many of the strategies on how to solve such problems. One just needs to be a little clever in deciding what technique(s) to use. Finally, once the maximum and/or minimum has/have been decided, one must then show that it/they may be attained by giving an example. Example 9. Minimise the expression (x+y)(y+z), where x, y and z are positive real numbers satisfying xyz(x + y + z) = 1. We have (x + y)(y + z) = xy + xz + y2 + yz = xz + y(x + y + z) = xz + 1 xz , where we have used the condition xyz(x + y + z) = 1 to get the last equality. Applying the AM-GM inequality gives (x + y)(y + z) = xz + 1 xz ≥ 2 √ xz · 1 xz = 2. To claim that ‘2’ is indeed the required minimum value, we must give an example of x, y, z where this minimum can be attained, and satisfying the constraint. In the inequality above, we have equality when xz = 1 xz , so xz = 1. To make things simple, choose x = z = 1. Then y must satisfy y(2 + y) = 1; solving this gives y = −1 ± √2. Since y > 0, we take the root with the positive sign. It is then easy to check that (x + y)(y + z) = 2 when x = z = 1 and y = −1 + √2. Example 10. Maximise the expression 7x + 2y + 8z, where x, y and z are positive real numbers satisfying 4x2 + y2 + 16z2 = 1. We try to cleverly apply the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. We have (7x + 2y + 8z) 2 ≤ ((2x) 2 + y2 + (4z) 2) (( 7 2 )2 + 22 + 22) = 81 4 , where we have used the condition 4x2 + y2 + 16z2 = 1 to get the last equality. We see that 7x + 2y + 8z ≤ 9 2. Again we must show that ‘ 9 2’ can be attained by some values of x, y, z satisfying the given constraint. For equality to hold in Cauchy-Schwarz, we have 2x = 7 2k, y = 2k, 4z = 2k for some k > 0. Substituting these into 4x2 + y2 + 16z2 = 1 gives 49 4 k2 + 4k2 + 4k2 = 1, giving k = 2 9. This leads to x = 7 18, y = 4 9 and z = 1 9. It is 7 then easy to check that with these values of x, y, z, we do have 4x2 + y2 + 16z2 = 1 and 7x + 2y + 8z = 9 2. 4. Problems Here are some inequalities and ‘maximum-minimum’ problems. 1.
