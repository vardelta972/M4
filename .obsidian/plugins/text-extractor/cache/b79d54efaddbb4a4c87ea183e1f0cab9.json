Let Λ be another circle passing through O and intersecting Γ at points A and B. A diameter CD of Γ intersects Λ at a point P diﬀerent from O. Prove that ∠AP C = ∠BP D . 2. Determine the smallest prime that does not divide any ﬁve-digit number whose digits are in a strictly increasing order. 3. Given real numbers a, b, c, d, e > 1 prove that a2 c − 1 + b2 d − 1 + c2 e − 1 + d2 a − 1 + e2 b − 1 ≥ 20 . 4. Let x be a non-zero real number such that x4 + 1 x4 and x5 + 1 x5 are both rational numbers. Prove that x + 1 x is a rational number. 5. In a triangle ABC, let H denote its orthocentre. Let P be the reﬂection of A with respect to BC. The circumcircle of triangle ABP intersects the line BH again at Q, and the circumcircle of triangle ACP intersects the line CH again at R. Prove that H is the incentre of triangle P QR. 6. Suppose that the vertices of a regular polygon of 20 sides are coloured with three colours – red, blue and green – such that there are exactly three red vertices. Prove that there are three vertices A, B, C of the polygon having the same colour such that triangle ABC is isosceles. ——— ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ ———","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
