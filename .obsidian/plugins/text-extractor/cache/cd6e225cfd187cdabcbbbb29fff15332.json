A 2n × 2n board is divided into 4n2 small squares in the manner of a chessboard. Each small square is painted with one of four colours so that every 2 × 2 block of four small squares involves all four colours. Prove that the four corner squares of the board are painted with dif- ferent colours. 2. Which positive integers n have the property that {1, 2, . . . , n} can be partitioned into two subsets A and B so that the sum of the squares of the elements of A is the sum of the squares of the elements of B? 3. This problem concerns polynomials in X with real coeﬃcients. Let f (X) = 2013X + 1. Suppose that g(X) and h(X) are polynomials such that f (g(X)) = g(f (X)) and f (h(X)) = h(f (X)). Prove that g(h(X)) = h(g(X)). Time allowed: 4 hours 30 minutes Each problem is worth 7 points","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
