Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Suppose x is a nonzero real number such that both x5 and 20x + 19 x are rational numbers. Prove that x is a rational number. 2. Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Ω and let G be the centroid of triangle ABC. Extend AG, BG and CG to meet the circle Ω again in A1, B1 and C1, respectively. Suppose ∠BAC = ∠A1B1C1, ∠ABC = ∠A1C1B1 and ∠ACB = ∠B1A1C1. Prove that ABC and A1B1C1 are equilateral triangles. 3. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 1. Prove that a a2 + b3 + c3 + b b2 + c3 + a3 + c c2 + a3 + b3 ≤ 1 5abc . 4. Consider the following 3 × 2 array formed by using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:  a11 a12 a21 a22 a31 a32   =   1 6 2 5 3 4   . Observe that all row sums are equal, but the sum of the squares is not the same for each row. Extend the above array to a 3 × k array (aij)3×k for a suitable k, adding more columns, using the numbers 7, 8, 9, . . . , 3k such that k∑ j=1 a1j = k∑ j=1 a2j = k∑ j=1 a3j and k∑ j=1(a1j) 2 = k∑ j=1(a2j) 2 = k∑ j=1(a3j)2. 5. In an acute angled triangle ABC, let H be the orthocenter, and let D, E, F be the feet of altitudes from A, B, C to the opposite sides, respectively. Let L, M, N be midpoints of segments AH, EF, BC, respectively. Let X, Y be feet of altitudes from L, N on to the line DF . Prove that XM is perpendicular to M Y . 6. Suppose 91 distinct positive integers greater than 1 are given such that there are at least 456 pairs among them which are relatively prime. Show that one can ﬁnd four integers a, b, c, d among them such that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(c, d) = gcd(d, a) = 1. ———-0———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
