A polynomial P (x) of degree n is generally of the form P (x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, (1.1) so that the coeﬃcient of x i is ai, 0 ≤ i ≤ n. We can also write P (x) in terms of its roots, ri. The roots, or zeros, of a function f (x) are the values of x for which f (x) = 0. As we will see, these are of great signiﬁcance. Since the degree of P (x), or the greatest power of x in the polynomial, is n (we write deg P = n), we can prove that there are exactly n roots (not necessarily distinct). The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) comes in handy, claiming that every polynomial has at least one zero. (For a proof of the FTA, see [1].) As a direct consequence of this theorem, we can write P (x) = (x − r1)P1(x), where P1(x) is a polynomial with degree n − 1. If we apply FTA again, this time to P1(x), we get P (x) = (x − r1)(x − r2)P2(x), where P2(x) is a polynomial with degree n − 2. We can keep applying FTA until we get P (x) = an(x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn), (1.2) which is our factored form of P (x). It shows us that the roots are r1, r2, . . . , rn, since these are where P (x) becomes zero. A Few Introductory Problems 1. Show, by writing P (x) in the two forms given in (1.1) and (1.2), that a0 = (−1) n · an(r1r2 · · · rn). 2. (Canada 1988) For some integer a, the equations 1988x 2+ax+8891 = 0 and 8891x 2+ax+1988 = 0 share a common root. Find a. 3. (ARML 1 1989) If P (x) is a polynomial in x, and x 23 + 23x 17 − 18x 16 − 24x 15 + 108x 14 = (x 4 − 3x 2 − 2x + 9) · P (x) for all values of x, compute the sum of the coeﬃcients of P (x). 1American Regions Math League 1 Page 2 2 VIETA’S FORMULAS 2 Vieta’s Formulas We deﬁne the kth symmetric sum, σk, of a set to be the sum of the elements multiplied k at a time. For example, the symmetric sums of w, x, y, and z are σ1 = w + x + y + z σ2 = wx + wy + wz + xy + xz + yz σ3 = wxy + wxz + wyz + xyz σ4 = wxyz. Vieta’s Formulas state that σk = (−1) k · an−k an , (2.1) for 1 ≤ k ≤ n. We can prove this inductively. The base case is n = 1, so let f (x) = a1x + a0. Since the only one root is −a0/a1, the only possibility is k = 1. Plugging in n = k = 1 in Vieta’s formulas, we get (−1) 1 · a0 a1 = −a0/a1, as desired. Now the inductive step is to assume that it is true for n = t. If n = t + 1, we get f (x) = at+1x t+1 + atx t + · · · + a0. Let g(x) be a monic polynomial with degree t such that f (x) = (at+1)(x − rt+1)g(x), where rt+1 is one of the t + 1 roots of f (x) = 0. Notice the roots of g(x) = 0 must be r1, r2, . . . , rt. Then we can write g(x) = x t − (r1 + r2 + · · · + rt)x t−1 + · · · + (−1) t(r1r2 · · · rt). In other words, f (x) = (at+1)(x − rt+1)(x t − σ1x t−1 + σ2x t−2 + · · · + (−1) tσt). Multiplying it out, we ﬁnd that f (x) = (at+1)(x t+1 − x t(r1 + · · · + rt + rt+1) + · · · + (−1) t+1(r1r2 · · · rtrt+1), or f (x) = at+1(x t+1 − σ1x t + · · · + (−1) t+1σt+1), which is what we wanted. Example 2.1. Determine the product of the roots of 50x 50 + 49x 49 + · · · + x + 1 = 0. Solution. From Vieta’s Formulas, we have σ50 = (−1) 50 · a0 a50 = 1 50 . 2 Page 3 2 VIETA’S FORMULAS Example 2.2. Find all ordered pairs (x, y, z) that satisfy x + y + z = 17, xy + yz + xz = 94, xyz = 168. Solution. We are given that σ1 = 17, σ2 = 94, and σ3 = 168. Hence, x, y, and z are solutions to the equation f (a) = a 3 − 17a 2 + 94a − 168 = 0. Noticing that 7 is a factor of 168, we try a = 7 as a solution, and indeed f (a)/(a − 7) = a 2 − 10a + 24, which can be factored as (a − 4)(a − 6), so f (a) = (a − 4)(a − 6)(a − 7). Hence, all possible ordered pairs (x, y, z) are the six permutations of (4, 6, 7). Problems 4. Find all ordered triples (x, y, z) that satisfy x + y − z = 0, zx − xy + yz = 27, xyz = 54. 5. (AIME 2 2001) Find the sum of all roots, real and nonreal, of the equation x 2001 + ( 1 2 − x )2001 = 0, given that there are no multiple roots. 6. (USA 1984) The product of two of the four zeros of the quartic equation x 4 − 18x 3 + kx 2 + 200x − 1984 = 0 is −32. Find k. 7. (Canada 2001) There exists a quadratic polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients such that: (a) both of its roots are positive integers, (b) the sum of its coeﬃcients is prime, and (c) for some integer k, P (k) = −55. Show that one of its roots is 2, and ﬁnd the other root. 2American Invitational Mathematics Examination 3 Page 4 3 TOOLS FOR FINDING THE ROOTS OF A POLYNOMIAL 3 Tools for Finding the Roots of a Polynomial It is common knowledge that the solutions to the quadratic polynomial ax 2 + bx + c = 0 are found by the quadratic formula, x = −b ± √b2 − 4ac 2a . Unfortunately, the cubic and quartic formulas are so complicated that they are hardly worth memorizing, and it has even been proven that there exist no formulas for the roots of polynomials with degree greater than four. Naturally, we resort to other tactics for these polynomials. The most simple tool we have for ﬁnd the roots of a polynomial is the Remainder Theorem: The remainder upon dividing the polynomial P (x) by (x − a) is P (a). The Factor Theorem follows directly from this: If r is a root of the polynomial P (x), then the remainder upon dividing P (x) by (x − r) is 0. The proof of the Remainder Theorem is very simple. Let Q(x) and r be the quotient and remainder, respectively, when P (x) is divided by (x − a). From the division algorithm, we obtain the identity P (x) = Q(x)(x − a) + r. Since an identity is true for all values of x, we can substitute x = a above to ﬁnd that P (a) = r, as desired. Example 3.1. Find the remainder when x 2006 + x 2005 + · · · + x + 1 is divided by x + 1. Solution. By the Remainder Theorem, the remainder when divided by x + 1 is just (−1) 2006 + · · · + (−1) + 1. Since (−1) k = −1 if k is odd and (−1) k = 1 if k is even, the remainder is 1 . Example 3.2. (The USSR Olympiad Problem Book) An unknown polynomial yields a remainder of 2 upon division by x − 1, and a remainder of 1 upon division by x − 2. What remainder is obtained if this polynomial is divided by (x − 1)(x − 2)? Solution. Let this polynomial be f (x). By the Remainder Theorem, f (1) = 2 and f (2) = 1. We need to ﬁnd r(x), where f (x) = j(x)(x − 1)(x − 2) + r(x). We know that deg r < deg(x − 1)(x − 2) = 2, so let r(x) = ax + b. Substituting x = 1 above, we ﬁnd f (1) = r(1) = a + b and f (2) = r(2) = 2a + b. Solving the equations a + b = 2 and 2a + b = 1 simultaneously gives a = −1 and b = 3, so r(x) = −x + 3. Coupled with the Rational Root Theorem (RRT), we can often use the Remainder Theorem to ﬁnd the roots of a polynomial. RRT states that for a polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients, any rational roots must be in the form p/q, where |p| and |q| are relatively prime, p divides a0, and q divides an, where deg f = n. The proof of RRT is not diﬃcult either. If p/q is a root of P (x) = 0, we must have an ( p q )n + an−1 ( p q )n−1 + · · · + a0 = 0. If we multiply through by qn, we get anpn + an−1pn−1q + · · · + a0qn = 0. 4 Page 5 3 TOOLS FOR FINDING THE ROOTS OF A POLYNOMIAL Modulo p, the left hand side becomes a0qn, so a0qn ≡ 0 (mod p). Since we stated that p and q are relatively prime, we cannot have qn ≡ 0 (mod p). This means that p must divide a0. When we consider the equation modulo q, we get anpn ≡ 0 (mod q), and by the same argument, q must divide an, as desired. Example 3.3. Find all roots of the equation x 3 − 2x 2 − 5x + 6 = 0. Solution. Let’s ﬁrst try to look for rational roots. By RRT, all rational roots must be elements of the set {±6, ±3, ±2, ±1}. How do we know which ones are roots? By the factor theorem, x 3 −2x 2 −5x+6 must be divisible by x−r, where r is a root. If we try x = 1, we ﬁnd that (x 3−2x 2−5x+6)/(x−1) = x 2−x−6, so 1 is indeed a root. We can also factor x 2 − x − 6 to get (x − 3)(x + 2), so the roots are −2, 1, and 3. Another tool we can use is Descartes’ Rule of Signs, which tells us the possible numbers of positive and negative roots. The number of changes in sign (positive to negative or negative to positive) in f (x) is the maximum number of positive roots and the number of sign changes in f (−x) is the maximum number of negative roots. Also, the actual number of roots can only diﬀer by a multiple of 2 from the maximum. Example 3.4. If we have f (x) = x 4 + 2x 3 − 25x 2 − 26x + 120, there are 2 sign changes. Therefore, there are either 2 or 0 positive roots. Also, f (−x) = x 4 − 2x 3 − 25x 2 + 26x + 120 has 2 sign changes, so there are either 2 or 0 negative roots as well. Yet another way to limit our search for roots is to use upper and lower bounds. If we have, for example, f (x) = x 3 − 6x 2 + 11x − 6, and we divide by x − 7, we get 7 1 -6 11 -6 7 7 126 1 1 18 120 Since all the numbers in the bottom row (the coeﬃcients of the quotient, and the remainder) are all positive, 7 is an upper bound on the roots; none of the roots can be greater than 7. Also, if we divide by x + 1, we get -1 1 -6 11 -6 -1 7 -18 1 -7 18 -24 Since the numbers in the bottom row alternate in sign, −1 is a lower bound on the roots; none of the roots can be smaller than −1. We can also use the Single Bound Theorem. Consider the monic polynomial P (x) = x n + an−1x n−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, where ai is real for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1. Let M1 = 1 + max{|a0|, |a1|, . . . , |an−1|} and M2 = max{1, |a0| + |a1| + · · · + |an−1|}. Also, let M = min{M1, M2}. The Single Bound Theorem states that all roots of P (x) are between −M and M . A proof is given in [3]. Another important fact is that all roots in the form a + b√c come in “pairs”. If a + b√c is a root of a polynomial with rational coeﬃcients, then a − b√c must also be a root. This is also true if c = −1, in which case we have a + bi and a − bi. Example 3.5. A quartic polynomial with rational coeﬃcients has roots 1 + √5 and 1 2 − i √3 2 . Find all other roots. Solution. The other two roots must be 1 − √5 and 1 2 + i √3 2 . 5 Page 6 3 TOOLS FOR FINDING THE ROOTS OF A POLYNOMIAL Problems 8. Find all roots of the equation x 3 − 10x 2 + 23x − 14 = 0. 9. Find all roots of the equation x 3 − 9x 2 + 23x − 15 = 0. 10. Show that all roots of the equation x 4 − 14x 3 + 64x 2 − 114x + 63 = 0 lie in the interval (0, 14). 6 Page 7 4 TRANSFORMING POLYNOMIALS 4 Transforming Polynomials Example 4.1. If we have the polynomial f (x) that has roots r1, r2, . . . , rn, how can we ﬁnd the polynomial g(x) that has roots 1/r1, 1/r2, . . . , 1/rn? We know that f ( 1 1/r1 ) = 0, so we ﬁnd g(x) = f (1/x) = an(1/x) n + an−1(1/x) n−1 + · · · + a1(1/x) + a0. Multiplying by x n to get a polynomial, we ﬁnd g(x) = an + an−1x + · · · + a1x n−1 + a0x n, or g(x) = a0x n + a1x n−1 + · · · + an−1x + an. Notice that the coeﬃcients of g(x) are the same as the coeﬃcients of f (x), but reversed. Example 4.2. Consider again the polynomial f (x). We can also ﬁnd the polynomial g(x) with roots m times the roots of f (x) by substituting x/m. We have f (x/m) = an(x/m) n + an−1(x/m) n−1 + · · · + a1(x/m) + a0. Multiplying by m n we ﬁnd g(x) = anx n + an−1mx n−1 + · · · + a1mn−1x + a0mn. Example 4.3. Find the polynomial with roots that exceed the roots of f (x) = 3x 3 −14x 2 +x+62 = 0 by one. Solution. Let g(x) = f (x − 1). If the roots of f (x) = 0 are ri, 1 ≤ i ≤ 3, then g(ri + 1) = f (ri) = 0, so g(x) is the polynomial we need to ﬁnd. A quick method to determine g(x) is to keep dividing (using synthetic division) f (x) by x + 1 until we are left with a single number as the quotient. The remainder of the ith division will be the coeﬃcient of x i−1, 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. This method is easily generalized to any polynomial of any degree. Problems 11. (Mu Alpha Theta 1991) If the roots of f (x) as deﬁned in Example 4.3 are a, b, c, determine 1 a + 3 + 1 b + 3 + 1 c + 3 . 12. Alice and Bob each have diﬀerent cubic polynomials with leading coeﬃcients equal to 1 (let them be a(x) and b(x), respectively). They ﬁnd all roots, real and nonreal, of their respective polynomials and Alice remarks, “My polynomial has roots that are half the roots of your polynomial.” Given that a(x) = x 3 + 3x 2 + 3x + 7, ﬁnd b(x). 7 Page 8 5 NEWTON’S IDENTITIES 5 Newton’s Identities Example 5.1. Let the roots of x 3 + 2x 2 + 3x + 4 = 0 be a, b, c. Find a 2 + b2 + c 2. Solution. Recall that (a + b + c) 2 = a 2 + b2 + c 2 + 2(ab + bc + ca) ⇐⇒ a 2 + b2 + c 2 = (a + b + c) 2 − 2(ab + bc + ca). By Vieta’s formulas, a + b + c = −2 and ab + bc + ca = 3 so that a 2 + b2 + c 2 = −2 . Newton’s identities are nice generalizations to this principle. Let sn = rn 1 + rn 2 + · · · + rn n, where ri are the roots of a polynomial P (x), as deﬁned in (1.2), and recall that ai are the coeﬃcients of x i, as deﬁned in (1.1). Then Newton’s identities, or Newton’s sums, are ans1 + an−1 = 0 ans2 + an−1s1 + 2an−2 = 0 ans3 + an−1s2 + an−2s1 + 3an−3 = 0, and so on. More generally, ansd + an−1sd−1 + an−2sd−2 + · · · + an−d+1s1 + dan−d = 0. (5.1) There are many proofs of Newton’s identities. An inductive proof is given in [2]. We can use these in problems in which we have polynomials and we need the sum of the kth powers, but we can also apply Newton’s sums in problems that have systems of equations, using the solutions to the system as the roots of a polynomial. This is illustrated well in problem 16. Example 5.2. Find the sum of the fourth powers of the roots of the equation 7x 3 −21x 2 +9x+2 = 0. Solution. We need s4. By Newton’s identities, 7s1 − 21 = 0, s1 = 3; 7s2 − 21 (3) + 2(9) = 0, s2 = 45 7 ; 7s3 − 21 ( 45 7 ) + 9 (3) + 3(2) = 0, s3 = 102 7 ; 7s4 − 21 ( 102 7 ) + 9 ( 45 7 ) + 2 (3) + 4(0) = 0, so s4 = 1695 49 . 8 Page 9 5 NEWTON’S IDENTITIES Problems 13.

The result is clear if we substitute x = 0 into (1.1) and (1.2). 2. If we substract the equations from each other to eliminate the ax terms, we have (8891−1988)x 2 − (8891 − 1988) = 0 so that x = ±1. Substituting x = 1 into either of the equations we get (8891 + 1988) + a = 0, so a = −10879 causes both equations to have a common root. 3. It is important to realize that the sum of the coeﬃcients of any polynomial is the polynomial evaluated at x = 1. In this case, we need P (1). Plugging in x = 1 to the equation, we ﬁnd that P (1) = 90/5 = 18. 4. Notice that if z wasn’t negative, we would have symmetric expressions. Hence, let w = −z, so that w + x + y = 0, wx + wy + xy = −27, wxy = −54. Thus σ1 = 0, σ2 = −27, and σ3 = −54, so w, x, and y are solutions to the equation f (a) = a 3 − 27a + 54 = 0. We can factor this to get f (a) = (a + 6)(a − 3) 2, so our solutions for (w, x, y) are (−6, 3, 3), (3, −6, 3), and (3, 3, −6). Finally, the ordered triples (x, y, z) are (3, 3, 6), (−6, 3, −3), and (3, −6, −3). 5. We can use the Binomial Theorem to expand x 2001 + ( 1 2 − x )2001: x 2001 + [( 1 2 )2001 + 2001 ( 1 2 )2000 (−x) + · · · + 2001 ( 1 2 ) (−x) 2000 + (−x) 2001] . Notice that x 2001 disappears so that this polynomial has degree 2000. Thus we need − a1999 a2000 where ai is the coeﬃcient of x i. − a1999 a2000 = − − (2001 2 ) ( 1 2 )2 (2001 1 ) ( 1 2 ) = 2001·2000 2 · 1 2 2001 , and our answer is 500 . 6. Let the roots be r, s, t, and u. Assume without loss of generality that rs = −32. From Vieta’s formulas we know that r + s + t + u = 18 (♣) rs + rt + ru + st + su + tu = k (♠) rst + rsu + rtu + stu = −200 (♥) rstu = −1984 (♦) 12 Page 13 7 SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS From (♦) we ﬁnd tu = 62. Factoring and substituting this into (♥), we get rs(t + u) + tu(r + s) = −200, or −32(t + u) + 62(r + s) = −200. Let t + u = a and r + s = b. Now we have the system −32a + 62b = −200 a + b = 18 Solving, we get a = 14, b = 4. Now we substitute into (♠) to get k = rs + (r + s)(t + u) + tu = −32 + (14)(4) + 62, so k = 86 . 7. Let P (x) = ax 2 +bx+c = a(x−r1)(x−r2), where r1, r2 are the roots, and let p = a+b+c. Assume without loss of generality that r1 ≤ r2. Since P (1) = a + b + c = p, and P (1) = a(1 − r1)(1 − r2), it clear that a ∈ {1, −1, p, −p}. However if a = p then (1 − r1)(1 − r2) = 1 so r1 = r2 = 0 or r1 = r2 = 2, which is clearly impossible (because of condition (c)). Also if a = −p then (1 − r1)(1 − r2) = −1 so r1 = 0 and r2 = 2, which is also a contradiction. Now because P (k) = a(k − r1)(k − r2) = −5 · 11, we must have one of the following:  | | a = 1 k − r1 = 55 k − r2 = 1 or  | | a = 1 k − r1 = 11 k − r2 = 5 . In the ﬁrst case we get r2 = r1 + 54, b = −2r1 − 54, and c = r1(r1 + 54). Thus r2 1 + 52r1 − (53 + p) = 0 so r1 = −52 ± √ 522 + 4(53 + p) 2 = −26 ± √ 262 + 53 + p = −26 ± √ 272 + p. Let h2 = 272 + p ⇐⇒ p = (h + 27)(h − 27). Since p is prime h − 27 = 1 ⇒ h = 28, but then p = 55 which is not a prime. Therefore the ﬁrst case doesn’t work. In the second case we ﬁnd that r2 = r1 + 6 so b = −2r1 − 6 and c = r1(r1 + 6). Thus p = 10(2r1 + 6) + r2 1 + 6r1 or r2 1 + 4r1 − (5 + p) = 0 ⇐⇒ r = −2 ± √32 + p. Let i 2 = 3 2 + p ⇐⇒ p = (i + 3)(i − 3). Since p is prime we must have i = 4 and then p = 7. This works, and r1 = 2, r2 = 8. In summary, the only polynomial P (x) that satisﬁes all three conditions is (x − 2)(x − 8) with roots 2 and 8. 8. By RRT, all roots must be factors of ±14. We can check that (x − 7) is a factor, so we have (x − 7)(x 2 − 3x + 2) = (x − 7)(x − 1)(x − 2) = 0, so the roots are x = 1, 2, 7. 13 Page 14 7 SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS 9. It is not diﬃcult to see that the factors are (x − 1), (x − 3), (x − 5), so the roots are x = 1, 3, 5. 10. Division by x yields x 3 − 14x 2 + 64x − 114 + 63 x , and the coeﬃcients alternate in sign, so all roots are greater than 0. Division by (x − 14) yields x 3 + 64x + 782 + 11011 x − 14 , and the coeﬃcients are positive so all roots are less than 14. 11 (Method 1). The polynomial with roots that exceed the roots of f (x) by 3 is g(x) := f (x − 3). Using the method of Example 5.3 (divide f (x) by x + 3) we ﬁnd g(x) = 3x 3 − 41x 2 + 166x − 148. Let h(x) be the polynomial with roots that are reciprocals of those of g(x). By the method of Example 5.1 we ﬁnd h(x) = −148x 3 + 166x 2 − 41x + 3. The sum of its roots is (−1) 1 · 166 −148 = 83 74 . 11 (Method 2). Let’s write 1 a + 3 + 1 b + 3 + 1 c + 3 with a common denominator. We get (b + 3)(c + 3) + (a + 3)(c + 3) + (a + 3)(b + 3) (a + 3)(b + 3)(c + 3) , or (ab + bc + ac) + 6(a + b + c) + 27 abc + 3(ab + ac + bc) + 9(a + b + c) + 27 . We recognize this as σ2 + 6σ1 + 27 σ3 + 3σ2 + 9σ1 + 27 , which we compute to be 83 74 , as before. 12. By Example 4.2, b(x) = x 3 + 6x 2 + 12x + 56 = 0. 14 Page 15 7 SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS 13. Let z = p(a) + p(b) + p(c) + p(d). Then z = (a 6 − a 5 − a 3 − a 2 − a) + (b6 − b5 − b3 − b2 − b) + (c 6 − c 5 − c 3 − c 2 − c) + (d6 − d5 − d3 − d2 − d) = (a 6 + b6 + c 6 + d6) − (a 5 + b5 + c 5 + d5) + (a 3 + b3 + c 3 + d3) − (a 2 + b2 + c 2 + d2) − (a + b + c + d) = s6 − s5 − s3 − s2 − s1 Using Newton’s sums with d = 6 on the roots of x 4 − x 3 − x 2 − 1, we get a4s6 + a3s5 + a2s4 + a1s3 + a0s2 + a−1s1 + 6a−2 = 0 s6 − s5 − s4 + 0s3 − s2 + 0s1 + 6 · 0 = 0 s6 − s5 − s4 − s2 = 0 Adding s4 − s3 − s1 to both sides, we get s6 − s5 − s3 − s2 − s1 = s4 − s3 − s1, so z = s4 − s3 − s1. We can use Newton’s sums again to ﬁnd that s1 = 1, s3 = 4, and s4 = 11, so our answer is 11 − 4 − 1 = 6 . 14. Let the roots be r1, r2, . . . , r8. By Vieta’s formulas, we have σ1 = r1 + r2 + · · · + r8 = 4 and σ2 = 7. The value of σ2 does not seem particularly helpful in the form in which it is given, so we recall that Newton’s identities give a8s2 + a7s1 + 2a6 = 0, s2 + (−4)(4) + 2(7) = 0, so s2 = r2 1 +r2 2 +· · ·+r2 8 = 2. It seems that we have run into another dead end here, unless we recall the well-known Cauchy’s Inequality, which states that, for real numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn and y1, y2, . . . , yn, we have (x1y1 + x2y2 + · · · + xnyn) 2 ≤ (x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n)(y2 1 + y2 2 + · · · + y2 n), with equality if and only if x1/y1 = x2/y2 = · · · = x8/y8. In this case, we put x1 = x2 = · · · = x8 = 1 and yi = ri to get (r1 + r2 + · · · + rn) 2 ≤ 8(r2 1 + r2 2 + · · · + r2 8). Notice that we have equality, so we must have r1 = r2 = · · · = r8 = 1/2, and thus a0 = r1r2 · · · r8 = 1 256 . 15 Page 16 7 SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMS 15. Assume without loss of generality that x, y, and z are the roots of a cubic polynomial with leading coeﬃcient 1. Since σ1 = 3, we ﬁnd a2 = −3. Hence, we know that the polynomial has the form f (r) = r3 − 3r2 + a1r + a0. By Newton’s sums, we have a3s2 + a2s1 + 2a1 = 0, (1)(3) + (−3)(3) + 2a1 = 0, a1 = 3; a3s3 + a2s2 + a1s1 + 3a0 = 0, (1)(3) + (−3)(3) + (3)(3) + 3a0 = 0, a0 = −1. Thus f (r) = r3 − 3r2 + 3r − 1 = (r − 1) 3, so the only solution is x = y = z = 1 . 16 Page 17 REFERENCES References [1] Heinrich D¨orrie. 100 Great Problems of Elementary Mathematics. Dover, 1965.
