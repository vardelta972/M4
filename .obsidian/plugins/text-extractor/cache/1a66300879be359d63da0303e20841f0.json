Find all possible values of f (2020). 2. Let AD be the altitude from vertex A onto BC. From D, drop perpendiculars DD1 and DD2 onto CA and AB respectively. Let ℓa be the length of D1D2. Deﬁne ℓb and ℓc analogously. Prove that ℓa = ℓb = ℓc. 3. A polynomial P (x) with non-negative real coefﬁcients has n real roots. Moreover, let the leading coefﬁcient and constant term both be 1. Find the minimum value of P (k) for any positive integer k. 4. Let f : [a, b] → R be twice differentiable, satisfy f (x) = f ′(x) + f ′′(x) for each x ∈ [a, b] and f (a) = f (b) = 0. Find all such function f. 5. Consider inﬁnite sequences a1, a2, . . . of positive integers beginning with a1 = 1 and such that an divides ak + ak+1 + · · · + ak+n−1 for every k, n ∈ N. For a given positive integer m, ﬁnd the maximum possible value of a2m. 6. (a) If α is a root of the polynomial p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn with real coefﬁcients (an ̸= 0), then show that |α| ≤ 1 + max 0≤k≤n−1 \f \f \f ak an \f \f \f. (b) Let a0 + 10a1 + · · · + 10 nan be the decimal representation of a prime number such that an ≥ 2, n > 1. Prove that the polynomial p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn cannot be written as a product of two non-constant polynomials with integer coefﬁcients. 7. Suppose f : [0, a] → R is a continuous function. Deﬁne another function g : (0, a) → R as g(x) = ∫ a x f (t) t dt, x ∈ (0, a). Prove that lim δ→0 ∫ a δ g(t)dt = ∫ a 0 f (t)dt. 8. Consider a 6 × 6 grid. Deﬁne a diagonal to be the six squares whose coordinates (i, j) (1 ≤ i, j ≤ 6) satisfy i − j ≡ k (mod 6) for some k = 0, 1, . . . , 5. Hence there are six diagonals. Determine if it is possible to ﬁll it with the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 36 (each exactly once) such that each row, each column, and each of the six diagonals has the same sum.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
