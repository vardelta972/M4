Show that if ∑ √a + hb = ∑ √a + hc (cyclic sums), then ABC is isosceles. Solution: If x = sin A, etc., suppose x > y > z > 0 for contradiction (we can’t have two angles sum to π, so sin is eﬀectively “injective” here); we get ∑ √x + xy = ∑ √x + xz, so 0 = ∑ √x + y(√x − √y) = (√x − √y)( √x + y − √z + x) + (√y − √z)( √y + z − √z + x), whence (√x + √y)(√x + y + √z + x) = ( √y + √z)(√y + z + √z + x). But using x > y > z, this is clearly impossible. 2. Prove that if t is a positive integer, then there exists a positive integer n > 1 such that gcd(n, t) = 1 and none of the numbers nk + t (k ≥ 1) are perfect powers. Solution: Suppose p | t + 1 for some prime p and let ℓ = vp(t + 1). Now take n = (1 + mp ℓ+1t) ℓ for large m, noting that nk + t must be a dth power for some d | ℓ in order to be a perfect power at all. 3. Suppose ABCD is a parallelogram. Consider circles w1, w2 with w1 tangent to segments AB, AD and w2 tangent to segments BC, CD. Suppose circle w3 is tangent to lines AD, DC and externally tangent to w1, w2; prove there exists a circle w4 tangent o lines AB, BC and externally tangent to w1, w2. Solution: Let x = AB = CD, y = AD = BC, α = A/2 = C/2, and β = B/2 = D/2 so that α + β = 90◦. WLOG assume w3 is “inside” the parallelogram (other is analogous). It’s easy to see √y = √rA cot α + √rD tan α and √x = √rC cot α + √rD tan α and that rB exists iﬀ √x = − √ra cot α + √rB tan α and √y = − √rC cot α + √rB tan α are compatible, which is clear. 4. Points A, B are on a circle ω with center O. Let C be the circumcenter of △AOB, and ℓ be a line passing through C such that the angle between ℓ and OC is π/3. Let ℓ intersect AA, BB at M, N , respectively. Suppose (CAM ) ∩ (CBN ) = P , (CAM ) ∩ ω = Q, and (CBN ) ∩ ω = R. Prove that OP ⊥ QR. Solution: Angle chase to get that ∡BOQ = ∡AOR = 60 ◦ under some orientation (basically just ﬁnd ∠AQC and then ∠BQC). It’s easy to angle chase that P lies on (OAB), so phantom P ′ such that ∠QOP ′ = ∠P ′OR and trivially get isosceles trapezoids, which must be cyclic. 5. Find all integer numbers x, y such that (y3 + xy − 1)(x2 + x − y) = (x3 − xy + 1)(y2 + x − y). Solution: When expressions like x2 + x − y have small absolute value, we can do ﬁnite case check. Otherwise, divide both sides by x2 + x − y and y2 + x − y and do some trivial inequalities (triangle inequality helps). Also exists harder problem on AoPS thread. 6. Suppose p is an odd prime. We call the polynomial f (x) = ∑n j=0 ajxj with integer coeﬃcients i- remainder if ∑ p−1|j,j>0 aj ≡ i (mod p). Prove that {f (0), . . . , f (p − 1)} is a complete residue system modulo p if and only if polynomials f (x) k for 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 2 are 0-remainder and f (x) p−1 is 1-remainder. Solution: Rewrite the i-remainder condition in terms of f (0)+· · ·+f (p−1) (mod p), and use Newton sums. 7. Let O be the circumcenter of the acute triangle ABC. Suppose points A′, B′, C ′ are on sides BC, CA, AB such that (AB′C ′) ∩ (BC ′A′) ∩ (CA ′B′) = O. Let ℓa be the radical axis of the circle centered at B′ with radius B′C and the circle centered at C ′ with radius C ′B. (Deﬁne ℓb, ℓc analogously.) Prove that ℓa, ℓb, ℓc form a triangle with orthocenter H. Solution: This is killed by spiral similarity about O and the observation that some point A1 ∈ BC lies on the radical axis ℓa (it turns out this is isogonal conjugates-ish, i.e. (A′B′C ′) meets BC at A1). Noting that O is the orthocenter of A′B′C ′ helps to complex bash. Basically, if a ′/m = 2r, etc. (some complex r), then r + r = 1, and we compute x = a(1−r)+r(b+c) 1−r where XY Z is the triangle formed by the ℓa. 2012-2013 Black Problem Set 1 8. A piece begins at the origin of the coordinate plane. Two players, A and B, play the following game. In A’s turn, A marks a lattice point in the ﬁrst quadrant that the piece is not on. In B’s turn, B moves the piece up to k times, where a move is deﬁned as moving the piece from (x, y) to (x + 1, y) or (x, y + 1), as long as the lattice point that the piece moves onto is not marked. They then proceed to alternate turns, with A playing ﬁrst. If B cannot move the piece, A wins. For what values of k can A win? Solution: This is a special case of Conway’s Angel problem for which A (the devil) can always win. The idea is to reduce solution sets, where ultimately we’ll need B to be at (x, y) while (x + 1, y) and (x, y + 1) are both unavailable. The “most obvious” way to guarantee this, i.e. to make sure that when B is at some (x, y), all of the (x + i, y + j) are unavailable for i, j ≥ 0 and i + j = r (some r ≥ 1), does not directly work if we try to get consecutive things on some ﬁxed line x + y = T . The next dumbest thing, however, does work: we want to gradually narrow down the choices on this ﬁxed line x + y = T (call this L) depending on the remaining possible locations of B (note that if B is at (x, y), then it can only go to (x′, y′) later with x′ ≥ x and y′ ≥ y). Hence we’ll want to do this iteratively, checking at certain points where B is and letting A mark the remaining possible points between consecutive checks. The most natural way to do this is uniformly; for example, if we have m moves before the ﬁrst check, then B can move up to the line x + y = mk but no further, and we’ll let A mark things at (x, y) ∈ L with x ≡ 0 (mod ⌈T /m⌉). The idea is that we’ll want to do ⌈T /m⌉ checks to make sure B cannot get past L. Of course, if m is too small, our checking gets little done, and if m is too large, B will pass L before we even ﬁnish checking once (for instance, we need m ≤ T /k for the ﬁrst time). Let M = ⌈T /m⌉ and suppose that B is at xi + yi = ri at the i th checkpoint (i ≥ 0) and A responds by making mi ≤ 2 + (T − ri)/M marks at the positions (x, y) ∈ L with x ≡ i (mod M ) and x ≥ xi, y ≥ yi. Now suppose for contradiction that rn ≥ T for n minimal; since we must not have ﬁnished marking all residues (mod M ) in order for B to have passed L between the (n − 1)th and nth checkpoints, we have 1 ≤ n ≤ M (otherwise, everything would’ve been marked between the 0th and M th checkpoints before B passed L). Since ri − ri−1 ≤ kmi−1 ≤ 2k + k(T − ri−1)/M for i ≥ 1 (note that r0 = 0), this means that rn−1 + 2k + k(T − rn−1)/M ≥ rn ≥ T . Setting c = k/M (let’s choose M and T large enough so that 0 < c < 1), we get rn−1 ≥ T − 2k 1−c , and by a simple induction with geometric series we get 0 = r0 ≥ T − 2k((1 − c) −n + · · · + (1 − c) −1), so ﬁxing some 0 < c < 1 and taking T suﬃciently large, we get a contradiction. 9. For any given positive integer n, show that there are inﬁnitely many triples of pairwise coprime positive integers (x, y, z) such that nx 2 + y3 = z4. Solution: Use the standard norm trick. If y3 = (z2 − x√n)(z2 + x√n), then it’s natural to set y = u 2 − nv2 to get z2 = u(u 2 + 3nv2) and x = 3u 2v + nv3. It’s then convenient to set u = w2 so we want w4 + 3nv2 = t2. Using norms again, if w = α2 − β2(3n), we want u = (α2 − (3n)β2)2 and v = 4αβ(α2 + (3n)β2) (we have t = α4 + 6α2β2(3n) + β4(3n)2). We make α odd, β even, and α ⊥ 3nβ to get the coprimality stuﬀ. If we ﬁx β and take α large then we’ll get u 2 > nv2 as u is quartic in α and v is only cubic. 10. Let A, B be ﬁnite sets of real numbers and x ∈ A + B be an element. Show that |A ∩ (x − B)| ≤ |A − B| 2/|A + B|. Solution: It suﬃces to show that |A + B|2 ≥ |X| · |A − B|, where X = A ∩ B. But |A + B| 2 ≥ |A + X| · |B + X|, and every diﬀerence d ∈ A − B appears as (a + x) − (b + x) at least |X| times. 11. Let ABCD be a convex tangential quadrilateral such that ∠ABC + ∠ADC < 180◦ and ∠ABD + ∠ACB = ∠ACD + ∠ADB. Prove that one of the diagonals of quadrilateral ABCD bisects the other. Solution: Invert about A to get that AB · CD = AD · BC, and use the tangential condition to get symmetrical stuﬀ. 12. Find the maximum possible number of kings on a 12 × 12 chess table so that each king attacks exactly one of the other kings (a king attacks only the squares that have a common point with the square he sits on). 2012-2013 Black Problem Set 1 Solution: Pair up the kings, and note that each pair borders at least 6 “grid” points, while no two pairs can share any grid points. This gets a bound of 132/6, so there are at most 28 pairs. The construction is not hard using this intuition.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
