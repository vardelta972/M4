Three positive real numbers a, b, c are such that a 2 + 5b2 + 4c 2 − 4ab − 4bc = 0. Can a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle? Justify your answer. Solution No. Note that a2 + 5b 2 + 4c2 − 4ab − 4bc = (a − 2b)2 + (b − 2c) 2 = 0 ⇒ a : b : c = 4 : 2 : 1 ⇒ b + c : a = 3 : 4. The triangle inequality is violated. 2. The roots of the equation x3 − 3ax2 + bx + 18c = 0 form a non-constant arithmetic progression and the roots of the equation x3 + bx2 + x − c3 = 0 form a non-constant geometric progression. Given that a, b, c are real numbers, ﬁnd all positive integral values a and b. Solution Let α − d, α, α + d (d ̸= 0) be the roots of the ﬁrst equation and let β/r, β, βr (r > 0 and r ̸= 1) be the roots of the second equation. It follows that α = a , β = c and a3 − ad2 = −18c; 3a 2 − d 2 = b, (1) c(1/r + 1 + r) = −b; c2(1/r + 1 + r) = 1. (2) Eliminating d, r and c yields ab 2 − 2a3b − 18 = 0, (3) whence b = a 2 ± (1/a)√a6 + 18a. For positive integral values of a and b it must be that a 6 + 18a is a perfect square. Let x2 = a 6 + 18a. Then a3 < x 2 < a 3 + 1 for a > 2 and hence no solution. For a = 1 there is no solution. For a = 2, x = 10 and b = 9. Thus the admissible pair is (a, b) = (2, 9). 3. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle in which ∠ABC is the largest angle. Let O be its circumcentre. The perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB meet AC at X and Y respectively. The internal bisectors of ∠AXB and ∠BY C meet AB and BC at D and E respectively. Prove that BO is perpendicular to AC if DE is parallel to AC. Solution Observe that triangles AY B and BXC are isosceles (AY = BY and BX = CX). This implies ∠BY C = 2∠BAC and ∠AXB = 2∠ACB. Since XD and Y E are angle bisectors we have ∠AXD = ∠ACB and ∠CY E = ∠CAB. Hence XD is parallel to BC and Y E is parallel to AB. Therefore CE EB = CY AY (4) and AD DB = AX CX . (5) 1 Now, if DE is parallel to AC then CE EB = AD DB . Therefore we must have CY AY = AX CX . (6) But then CY AY + 1 = AX CX + 1 ⇒ AC AY = AC CX ⇒ AY = CX. (7) Hence BY = AY = CX = BX. Thus ∠BXY = ∠BY X i.e ∠AXB = ∠BY C or ∠ACB = ∠BAC i.e triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = CB. Hence BO is the perpendicular bisector of AC. 4. A person moves in the x − y plane moving along points with integer co-ordinates x and y only. When she is at point (x, y), she takes a step based on the following rules: (a) if x + y is even she moves to either (x + 1, y) or (x + 1, y + 1); (b) if x + y is odd she moves to either (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y + 1). How many distinct paths can she take to go from (0, 0) to (8, 8) given that she took exactly three steps to the right ((x, y) to (x + 1, y))? Solution We note that she must also take three up steps and ﬁve diagonal steps. Now, a step to the right or an upstep changes the parity of the co-ordinate sum, and a diagonal step does not change it. Therefore, between two right steps there must be an upstep and similarly between two upsteps there must be a right step. We may, therefore write HV HV HV The diagonal steps may be distributed in any fashion before, in between and after the HV sequence. The required number is nothing but the number of ways of distributing 5 identical objects into 7 distinct boxes and is equal to (11 6 ). 5. Let a, b, c be positive numbers such that 1 1 + a + 1 1 + b + 1 1 + c ≤ 1. Prove that (1 + a2)(1 + b2)(1 + c 2) ≥ 125. When does the equality hold? Solution 1 1 + a + 1 1 + b + 1 1 + c ≤ 1 ⇒ a 1 + a ≥ 1 1 + b + 1 1 + c . (8) Similarly, b 1 + b ≥ 1 1 + a + 1 1 + c , c 1 + c ≥ 1 1 + a + 1 1 + c . (9) Apply AM-GM to get that a 1 + a ≥ 2 √ (1 + b)(1 + c) , b 1 + b ≥ 2 √(1 + a)(1 + c) , c 1 + c ≥ 2 √(1 + a)(1 + b) . (10) 2 Multiplying these results we get abc ≥ 8. (11) Now take F = (1 + a2)(1 + b2)(1 + c 2) ≥ 1 + a 2 + b2 + c 2 + a 2b 2 + b2c 2 + c2a 2 + a 2b2c2 (12) and apply AM-GM to a 2, b 2, c 2 and to a2b2, b 2c 2, c 2a 2 to get F ≥ 1 + 3(a 2b2c2)1/3 + 3(a 4b 4c 4)1/3 + a 2b2c2 = [1 + (a 2b 2c 2)1/3]3 ≥ [1 + 82/3] 3 = 125. (13) Wherein the equality holds when a = b = c = 2. 6. Let D, E, F be the points of contact of the incircle of an acute-angled triangle ABC with BC, CA, AB respectively. Let I1, I2, I3 be the incentres of the triangles AF E, BDF , CED, respectively. Prove that the lines I1D, I2E, I3F are concurrent. Solution Observe that ∠AF E = ∠AEF = 90 ◦ − A/2 and ∠F DE = ∠AEF = 90 ◦ − A/2. Again ∠EI1F = 90 ◦ + A/2. Thus ∠EI1F + ∠F DE = 180 ◦. Hence I1 lies on the incircle. Also ∠I1F E = (1/2)∠AF E = (1/2)∠AEF = ∠I1EF. (14) Thus I1E = I1F . But then they are equal chords of a circle and so they must subtend equal angles at the circumference. Therefore ∠I1DF = ∠I1DE and so I1D is the internal bisector of ∠F DE. Similarly we can show that I2E and I3F are internal bisectors of ∠DEF and ∠DF E respectively. Thus the three lines I1D, I2E, I3F are concurrent at the incentre of triangle DEF . 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
