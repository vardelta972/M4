No. Call a lattice point even if the sum of its coordinates is even, and call it odd otherwise. Call one of the legs ﬁrst, and other one second. Then every time a leg is moved from an even point to an even point, or from an odd point to an odd point. If in the beginning one of the legs is at an even point, and the other - at an odd point, the legs cannot switch. If both legs are at even points or both at odd points, consider a new coordinate system on the sheet of paper, with unit length twice as large as unit length in the original coordinate system, and so that the two legs are located at lattice points of the new coordinate system. (Russian Math Olympiad 1998) 2. For each point P on the boundary of A, consider the homothety with centre P and factor 2 3 , which carries the set A to a set AP lying inside A. For any three points K, L, M on the boundary of A, the centroid of △KLM lies in each of the sets AK, AL, AM so the three sets have non- empty intersection. By Helly’s theorem all sets have non-empty intersection; take a point O in this intersection. Consider any two points X, X ′ on the boundary of A such that O lie on XX ′. By construction O ∈ AX , O ∈ AX ′ so XX ′ 3 ≤ OX, OX ′ ≤ 2XX ′ 3 and the result follows. (Iran Math Olympiad 2004) 3. We claim that any such set contains at most 4 points. Assume S has more than 4 points. Take A, B, C such that △ABC has the largest possible area over all choices of A, B, C. There is a fourth point D such that ABCD is a parallelogram. It is clear that if a point X is outside ABCD then one of the triangles ABX, BCX, CDX, ADX has area greater than the area of triangle ABC, BCD, CDA, DAB respectively. Each of these triangles has area equal to the area of ABC. Hence there are no points outside of ABCD. Consider a point E inside ABCD. There is a point F such that A, B, E, F are vertices of a parallelogram. It is clear that F cannot be inside ABCD. This gives a contradiction. (USA TST 2005) 4. Let A, B be points in S such that AB is maximal. Consider a point C in S such that the distance from C to AB is maximal. It suﬃces to show the distance from C to AB is at most 1, since then we can cover S by a strip of length 2 such that line AB passes is the middle line in the strip. We can assume A, B, C are not collinear (otherwise we are done). The triangle ABC can be covered by a strip of length 1, hence one of its altitudes has length at most 1. Since AB is the longest side in the triangle, the altitude to it is the shortest among the three altitudes, so it has length at most 1. Therefore the distance from C to AB is at most 1. (Balkan Math Olympiad 2010) 5. Place the ﬁrst circle on the second. Then place a painter at a ﬁxed point on the ﬁrst circle. Rotate the ﬁrst circle in one direction, and make the painter paint the point on the second circle, under which the painter is located, whenever some marked point lies on a marked arc. It suﬃces to show that after one full revolution of the ﬁrst circle, some point on the second arc is not painted. The resulting painting of the second circle will be the same to the one if the ﬁrst circle is rotated 1000 times, and on the ith rotation the painter paints the point under him whenever the ith marked point lies on a marked arc. During each revolution less than 1 cm is painted on the second circle, hence after 1000 revolutions less than 1000 cm will be painted on the second circle. The result follows. (A Russian Book with Olympiad Problems) 1 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov 6. If (xi, yi) and (xi+1, yi+1) are the coordinates of two consecutive vertices in the polygon, then xi + yi ̸= xi+1 + yi+1 mod 2, since the length of the segment joining the two vertices is an odd integer. Therefore n cannot be odd (otherwise we will have x1 + y1 ≡ xn + yn mod 2 which is impossible. We will show any even n ≥ 4 works. For every n we will construct a polygon with n vertices X1, ..., Xn satisfying the conditions of the problem, and furthermore the side XiXn+1−i is parallel to the x−axis. We proceed by induction. For n = 4 take the vertices of the polygon to have coordinates (0, 0), (69, 12), (100, 12), (109, 0). Assume we have the polygon with n vertices, we need to add two new vertices A, B. Notice that we can shift all vertices X n 2 +1, X n 2 +2, ..., Xn in the positive x−direction by an arbitrary number of units m. The resulting polygon with the new vertices X1, X2, ..., Xn still satisﬁes the conditions of the problem. Hence it suﬃces to prove that there exists a trapezoid ABCD with points A, B on the x−axis and CD||AB, so that all its sides are pairwise distinct odd integers, which are arbitrarily large, and the angles ∠CAB, ∠DBA are arbi- trarily small; since then we can shift vertices X n 2 +1, X n 2 +2, ..., Xn, and then let X n 2 X n 2 +1 be side AB and CD be above AB so that C, D are the two new vertices. Construction of ABCD is not hard. Let x be the height of the trapezoid. We want to ﬁnd in- tegers y, z and s, t such that x2 = z2 − y2, x2 = s2 − t2 so that AC, BD have lengths y, s; and tan(∠CAB), tan(∠DBA) are x y , x t ; we want these to be arbitrarily small. Take x = 6k + 3, y = 18k2 + 18k + 4, z = 18k2 + 18k + 5, s = 6k2 + 6k, t = 6k2 + 6k + 3. Then since we can take k arbitrarily large, the integers x, y, z, s, t satisfy the conditions we want. (Chinese TST Quiz 6, 2008; most of the solution is from Adrei Frimu’s post on AOPS) 7. Assume the contrary. Notice that for any point of intersection of two lines, there is a red line passing through it. Consider a line l and points A and B on l, which are points of intersections of l with two red lines m and n respectively. Choose A and B such that AB is maximal. Let C be the point of intersection of m and n. There is a blue line passing through C and intersecting l at a point D; D must be a point on line segment AB (since AB is maximal). Look at all conﬁgurations of 4 lines l′, m′, n′, p′ that look like the conﬁguration of l, m, n, p; with lines l′, p′ being of one color, m′, n′ of the other color; m′, l′, n′ concurrent and the point of intersection of p′ with l′ is between the points of intersection of m′, n′ with l. Find the conﬁguration for which the area of the triangle formed by lines l′, m′, n′ is minimal. Let C′, A′, B′ be the points of intersection of m′, n′; m′, l′; l′, n′ respectively. Through the point of intersection of p′, l′ there is another line q′ of the same color as m′ and n′. It will intersect the line segment C′A′ or C′B′; wolog it is line segment C′A′. Then lines m′, p′, l′, q′ form a conﬁguration with a triangle of smaller area. This is a contradiction. (Russian Math Olympiad 2002) 8. Call such drawing of diagonals a triangulation, and call a triangle special if two of its sides coincide with two of the sides of the polygon. Let the number of sides of the polygon be n. The sum of the angles in the polygon is (n − 2)π. The sum of the angles in a triangle is π so there are (n − 2) triangles in the triangulation. Hence there are at least 2 distinct special triangles. Furthermore, there are at most 3 acute angles in any convex polygon, since otherwise the sum of the angles in the polygon is less than (n − 2)π. Consider two distinct triangulations T1, T2. There are two triangles t1, t2 that are special in trian- gulation T1. Each of them has an angle that coincides with an angle of the polygon; let the two 2 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov angles be α1, α2. Similarly deﬁne two special triangles s1, s2 in triangulation T2, and the two angles β1, β2. Since angles αi, βi are all acute, it follows that two of them are the same; wolog α1, β1 are the same. Then triangles t1, s1 are the same. Cut them oﬀ and consider the remaining convex polygon with n − 1 sides. Finish the problem with induction. (Russian Math Olympiad 2003) 9. Let the sides of the squares be equal to ai for i = 1, 2, ..., N (N is the number of squares). If some ak > 1 then kth square will cover the unit square. Assume ai < 1 for all i. Each ai must belong to some interval [2−ki, 2−ki+1) where ki are positive integers for all i. Let us decrease every ith square to the square with side length bi = 1 2ki . Its area will decrease by at most 4 times, because 1 ≤ ai bi < 2. Therefore the area of the new squares will be greater than 1. Let us prove we can tile the unit square with the new squares. Divide the unit square into 4 squares with side length 1 2 . First place the squares with side 1 2 (if they exist). On the non-tiled squares with side 1 2 (if they exist) place the squares with side 1 4 (if they exist), by dividing each non-tiled square with side 1 2 into 4 equal squares. We will continue this procedure for k = 3, 4, ... by placing squares with side length 1 2k on the on-tiled squares with side length 1 2k−1 , each time dividing them into 4 equal squares. Because the sum of areas of squares is greater than 1, then eventually we will cover the unit square. Increasing the ith square with side bi to the square with side ai, we will get the tiling of the unit square with the given squares. (Russian Math Olympiad 1979) 10. Call the 2n angles into which the lines divide the angle around O - basic, and two lines that form a basic angle - adjacent. Since no line passes inside a basic angle, then for any two adjacent lines, there is a third line bisecting the other pair of vertical angles (complementary with the basic angles). If this line is rotated by 90◦ around O, it will bisect the simple angles. There are as many ”bisecting” lines, as all the lines, hence if the whole ﬁgure is rotated by 90◦ around O, each of the rotated n lines will be bisect two vertical simple angles. Let α be the largest vertical simple angle, and β, θ be two adjacent simple angles, the angle bisectors of which become after the 90◦ degree rotation the sides of α. Then α = β+θ 2 hence α = β = θ. Rotating by 90◦ in opposite direction the angles β, θ, we see that the two angles adjacent to α are equal to α. Hence all simple angles are equal. (Russian Math Olympiad 2003) 11. We use induction on the number of colors, n. Base case will be done for n = 2. Let S be the left-most square. If it is of color 1, all squares of color 2 have a point in common with it, hence each of the squares of color 2 contains one of the right vertices of S; hence all squares of color 2 can be pinned using 2 pins at those two vertices. Assume the result holds for n colors; we need to prove it for n + 1 colors. Consider all squares and ﬁnd the left-most square S; wolog it has color n + 1. All squares intersecting S contain one of its right vertices, hence they can all be pinned using 2 pins. Remove from the table all squares of color n + 1 and all squares intersecting S. Among the remaining squares, each square has one of n colors. Among any n of these squares of pairwise distinct colors, there are two that intersect; or else add in square S and we get n + 1 squares of pairwise distinct colors, no two of which intersect. Hence there is a color i, such that all the remaining squares of color i can be pinned using 2n − 2 pins. The squares of color i that are not pinned all intersect square S and can be pinned using 2 pins at the two right vertices of S. (Russian Math Olympiad 2000) 3 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov 12. Let A1, A2, ..., AN be the points, and each of the distances AiAj is equal to one of the numbers r1, r2, ..., rn. Then for each i, all of the points except Ai lie on one of the circles ω(Ai, r1), ω(Ai, r2), ..., ω(Ai, rn) where ω(O, r) denotes the circle with centre O and radius r. Introduce a system of coordinates so that the coordinates axes are not parallel to any of the lines AiAj. Wolog A1 has the smallest x−coordinate among the points. Among the lines A1Ai ﬁnd the one with the largest absolute value of the slope; wolog it is A1A2. Then all points A3, A4, ..., AN lie in the same half-plane π with respect to line A1A2. Each of the points A3, A4, ..., AN is the intersection of circles ω(A1, rk), ω(A2, rl) for some k, l ∈ {1, 2, ..., n}. Each of the n2 pairs of these circles has at most one point of intersection in π. Hence among N − 2 points A3, A4, ..., AN at most n2 are distinct. Hence N − 2 ≤ n2 so N ≤ n2 + 2 = (n + 1)2. (Russian Math Olympiad 2004) Processes 1. Among all grids we can get (there are ﬁnitely many of them) take the one with the largest possible sum of all numbers. Assume the sum of the numbers in one of the rows in this grid is negative. If we switch the sign of the numbers in the grid, we get a grid with a larger sum of numbers. The result follows. (Russian Math Olympiad 1961) 2. Call a characteristic of a deck the number of cards of the most frequently occurring suit. Every time the characteristic stays the same or decreases by 1. If it decreases by 1, Igor guessed the right suit. In the beginning the characteristic is 13, in the end it is 0. Hence it decreased by 1 exactly 13 times. (Russian Math Olympiad 1998) 3. Let us write numbers on a second board. Every time numbers x, y appear on the ﬁrst board, we will write down numbers ab x , ab y on the second board. Then when numbers x, y are on the ﬁrst board, x < y, and the operation is performed, then on the other board the pair ( ab x , ab y ) will be replaced by ( ab y , ab x − ab y ) (verify this). This is just Euclid’s algorithm, so eventually both numbers on the second board will be equal to gcd(a, b). At that point both numbers on the ﬁrst board will be equal. (Russian Math Olympiad 1998) 4. Call a move internal if the checker jumps into the n × n square S, and external if the checker jumps outside of S. Assume we got to a position from which it is impossible to make any moves, and k internal and l external moves have been made. There are at least ⌊ n2 2 ⌋ empty squares in S (or else two checkers are in adjacent squares); an internal move increases the number of empty squares in S by at most 1; an external move increases this number by at most 2. Hence 2l + k ≥ ⌊ n2 2 ⌋ (1) Assume n is even. Divide S into n2 4 2 × 2 squares. In every such square there were at least 2 moves which involved the checkers from this square (either the checker was used to jump in a move, or it was jumped over). In every internal move, the checkers used were from at most 2 squares; in every external moves, the checkers used were from at most 1 square; hence 2k + l ≥ 2 n2 4 (2) 4 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov Adding (1) and (2) the result follows for all even n. For odd n = 2m + 1 consider the cross formed by taking the third column from the left and third row from the top. Divide the cross into one unit square and 2m dominoes made up of two squares. Divide the remaining part into m2 2 × 2 squares. Every internal move uses at checkers from at most 2 ﬁgures among the ﬁgures we selected; and every external move uses at most one such ﬁgure. Hence 2k + l ≥ 2m 2 + 2m (3) Then add (1) and (2) and get the result for all odd n (you might need to consider some cases of n mod 3). (Russian Math Olympiad 1999) 5. Cynthia wins. Let us divide the points into 4 equal groups A, B, C, D and index the points from 1 to 500 in each group. We will prove Cynthia can always make a move so that after her move the number of line segments exiting from the points in each group is the same. If Danny erases a line segment connecting two points from the same group, i.e. AiAj, Cynthia will erase BiBj, CiCj, DiDj. If Danny erases a line segment connecting two points from diﬀerent groups and having diﬀerent indices, i.e. AiBj Cynthia will erase AjBi, CiDj, DiCj. If Danny erases a line segment connecting two points from diﬀerent groups but with diﬀerent indices, i.e. AkBk Cynthia does the following. There are 6 line segments connecting pairs of points from Ak, Bk, Ck, Dk. Cynthia can always erase two other line segments among these 6 so that the remaining three have an endpoint in common. For example she can erse AkCk, BkCk so the remaining three segments are AkDk, BkDk, CkDk. If Danny ever erases one of these line segments, there must exist l ̸= k such that AlDk, BlDk or ClDk is not yet erased (otherwise no line segments are exiting from Dk). Then the same thing will hold for Bk, Ak, Ck so Cynthia can erase the other two segments from AkDk, BkDk, CkDk and not lose. (Russian Math Olympiad 2000) 6. No. We ﬁrst prove there is a 2 × 2 square in the original grid with three zeroes and one 1. This follows from the fact that there is a row containing only zeroes, hence there is a row containing only zeroes adjacent to a row containing a 1. Consider any 2 × 2 square K in the grid; let a, b, c, d be the numbers in top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right corners of this square, respectively. After the operation is performed let these numbers be a′, b′, c′, d′ respectively. Let S = (a + d) − (b + c); S′ = (a′ + d′) − (b′ + c′). We will show D ≡ D′ mod 3. Call the square on which the operation is performed cool. If the cool square is outside K, it is easy to verify D = D′. If the cool square is inside K, wolog it is in the top left corner of K; then after operation is performed a′ = a − 1, b′ = b + 1, c′ = c + 1, d′ = d hence D = D′ − 3. Hence D ≡ D′ mod 3. The result follows. (Russian Math Olympiad 1998) 7. Let r be the positive root of the equation x2 − x − 1 = 0. For any conﬁguration A of the stones, let ai be the number of stones in square i and let w(A) = ∑ airi. Then w(A) stays constant (verify this yourself). We now show the process cannot repeat forever by induction on n, the total number of stones. For suﬃciently large M , rM > w(A) since r > 1. Hence no stones can ever be in a square with index greater than M . Hence eventually a stone will appear in a square and will not be moved from there 5 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov anymore. Throw out this stone when this happens. Now use the induction hypothesis. Assume it is possible to get two distinct ﬁnal conﬁgurations A, B with ai, bi respectively being the number of stones in square i; so that for some j, aj ̸= bj. Assume w(A) = w(B). Choose the largest k for which ak ̸= bk.; wolog ak = 0, bk = 1. Throw out stones on squares k + 1, k + 2, ... in both conﬁgurations A, B (they are identical in A and B). For the remaining conﬁgurations A′, B′ we have w(B′) ≥ rk = rk−1 1 − r−2 = rk−1 + rk−3 + ... > w(A′) since in conﬁguration A′ it is impossible to make any more moves, hence no two stones in A′ are in one square, and no two are in adjacent squares. Hence w(A) ̸= w(B) and the result follows. (Russian Math Olympiad 1997) 8. Label the two rooms X and Y . Let 2n be the size of the largest clique. Place all students in one such clique C in X and everyone else in Y . Let s(X), s(Y ) be the sizes of the largest cliques in rooms X and Y respectively. Move students from X to Y one by one. Every time a student is moved, d = s(X) − s(Y ) decreases by 1 or 2. Hence at one point it will become 0 or −1. It suﬃces to consider the case d = −1. Then s(X) = k, s(Y ) = k + 1 for some positive integer k. If some student from C is in Y and is not in one of the cliques in Y of size k + 1, move this student to X so that d(X) = d(Y ) = k + 1. Hence we can assume each clique in Y of size k + 1 contains 2n − k students from C. Then in each such clique there are 2(k − n) + 1 ≥ 1 students no in C. Move these students one by one to X. We will show every time the size of the largest clique in X is k. Assume not, then the last student that has been moved is friends with all students in C, which contradicts the fact that 2n is the size of the largest clique. Hence at some point d(X) = d(Y ) = k and we are done. (IMO 2007/3; proposed by Russia. Surprising, eh?) Graphs 1. Assume there is a graph G in which the length of every cycle is divisible by 3. Take such graph with the smallest possible number of vertices, and look at any cycle C in this graph containing the cities A1, A2, ..., A3k. Assume there is a path connecting cities Am, An which does not use any of the edges in C. The union of this path with C gives two cycles C1, C2 each of which has length (i.e. number of edges in it) divisible by 3. Hence the length of the path is also divisible by 3. Then for any vertex B not in C, it cannot be connected by an edge with two cities from C. Replace the cycle C by a vertex A. (!) Connect it by an edge with those vertices that were previously connected by an edge with some vertex in C. It is clear the new graph G′ has less vertices, there are at least 3 edges coming out of every vertex, and every cycle in the new graph has length which is divisible by 3. This contradicts the choice of G as the smallest possible graph. 2. (a) The pandemic will last forever if for example on the ﬁrst day one person is sick, one is healthy, and one is immune, and every two people are friends. (b) Let us prove nobody can get sick twice. Divide the people into groups G1, G2, ... so that G1 is the group of all people who got sick on day 1; G2 contains all people who are not in G1 and are friends with somebody from G1, G3 contains all people who are not in G1 or G2 and are friends with somebody from G2, etc. If two people are friends, the indices of the groups they belong to diﬀer by 1. By induction it is easy to prove that on day i only people from Gi are sick, and only people from Gi−1 are immune to the ﬂu. 6 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov (Russian Math Olympiad 1980) 3. Look at the graph where vertices are people, two vertices are connected by an edge if the two corresponding people do not know each other. (!) If this graph has no odd cycles, we can split it into two groups; in each group no two vertices are connected, so every two people know each other. We can then ﬁnd 6 people who know each other. Assume there is an odd cycle. Consider the minimal odd cycle of length k, we have 5 cases: Call a person good if he is in the cycle and bad if he is not in the cycle. k = 3: If among the bad people every two know each other we are done. Otherwise we can ﬁnd two that don’t know each other. For the other 7 bad people, among any four, we can ﬁnd three who know each other. (Take those four, the 3 good people, and the two who don’t know each other). Then any 2 edges in the subgraph on these 7 people have a vertex in common. Furthermore, this vertex must be the same for any 2 edges. Removing this vertex gives 6 vertices no two of which are connected by an edge, giving the required 6 people. k = 5: For the 7 bad people, among any four, we can ﬁnd three who know each other. (Take those four and the ﬁve good people). This case is done in the same way as the previous one. k = 7: For any two bad people, if we take them and the 7 good people, we get 9. Hence any 2 bad people do not know each other. If there is some good person who does not know any bad person, we are done. Otherwise there is a bad person A and good people B, C, so that AB and AC are edges in the graph. By choice of minimal cycle the only way this can happen is if as we go along the cycle from B to C, we visit only one more vertex D, so that BD, DC are edges. But then D does not know any bad people, since if we remove D from the cycle and insert A, we get a cycle of length 7, and no two people in the complement of this cycle know each other. k = 9: Impossible, as if we take the 9 good people, among any 5 we can ﬁnd two who do not know each other. k = 11: The bad person A does not know at most 2 good people (otherwise there is an odd cycle with smaller length). Let the two good people be B, C. Arguing in the same way as when k = 7 we get that BD, DC are edges in the cycle. Now take person A, D, and every second person as we go along the cycle starting from D, until we have 6 people in total. No two of them will know each other. 4. No. Consider the graph where vertices are cities and edges are roads. At any point in the game choose any edge that is not yet oriented. We will show that it is possible to orient it in a way so that it is still possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex. Let the ends of the edge be x and y, and call the edge xy. If there is a path P from x to y (or from y to x) without using the edge xy, we direct the edge xy from y to x (or from x to y, respectively). Then in any path between any two cities that used the edge xy in direction from x to y, the edge xy can be replaced by P , and everything is ﬁne. Assume now there is no path P from x to y or from y to x that does not use edge xy. Let S be the set of all vertices to which one can get from x without using edge xy, and T be the set of vertices to which one can get from y, without using edge xy. For any vertex in S, there is a path from it to vertex y. By the assumption, this path must use edge xy. Therefore for any vertex in S, there is a path from it to x that does not use edge xy. Then for any two vertices in S, it is possible to get from one to the other without using edge xy. Similarly for any two vertices in T , it is possible to get from one to the other without using edge xy. Since in the original graph it is possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex, then every 7 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov vertex belongs to exactly one of S and T . If edge xy is removed, it is possible to get from any vertex to any other vertex so there is a vertex p in S and vertex q in T so that pq is an edge, wolog directed from p to q. But there is a path from x to p, and from q to y not using edge xy, so there is a path from x to y not using edge xy, contradicting our assumption. 5. We use induction on the number of cities. When there is 1 city, the result is obvious. Now, assume the result holds for k cities and we want to prove it for k + 1 cities. Look at a graph G with k + 1 cities satisfying the conditions of the problem and remove city X and all roads coming out of it. By the induction assumption, the cities in the remaining graph G′ can be colored in n + 2 colors, so that no two cities of the same color are connected by a road. For every m = 2, 3, ..., n + 2 consider the graph G′ m made up only of cities of colors 1 and m and the roads between these cities. This graph is bipartite hence has no odd cycles. Let Gm be the graph obtained by adding to G′ m the city X and all roads connecting it with the cities in G′ m. If for some m, the graph Gm has no odd cycle through X, then it has no odd cycles at all. Hence it is bipartite and we can recolor the cities in Gm in colors 1 and m so that no two cities of the same color are connected by a road. Now add back all the remaining cities and roads. The resulting colored graph G will also satisfy the condition that no two cities of the same color are connected by a road, and we are done. Otherwise for every m = 2, 3, ..., n + 2 the graph Gm has no odd cycle Cm through X. This cycle must pass through some vertex of color m. Therefore all cycles C2, C3, ..., Cn+2 are pairwise distinct. We get n + 1 odd cycles through X, a contradiction. 6. Lemma: We are given 2n people from n countries, two from each country. Assume it is possible to divide the people into n pairwise disjoint pairs, so that these pairs are the only pairs of friends among then 2n people. Then it is possible to divide the people into 2 groups, each containing one person from each country, so that no two people from the same group are friends. Proof: Number the countries from 1 to n; call two people from the same country comrades. We will construct two groups A, B. Place one person from country 1 in group A and in group B place his comrade; place his friend in group A; wolog that friend is from country i; in group B place his comrade; place his friend in group A, etc. This process stops when the next person to be placed has already been placed; this person must be the ﬁrst person from country 1. He is placed in group A which is exactly what we want. If the process stops and there are still people remaining, we do the same thing with the remaining people. The lemma is proved. Let us now solve the problem. Consider 4 people in a country X. Create new countries X ′, X ′′ and place 2 of the people from those 4 in country X ′ and the other 2 in country X ′′. Divide the people around the table into 50 pairs, so that in each pair people are sitting side by side; call them friends. Apply the lemma; we can divide the people into 2 groups, each with 50 people, and in each group no two people are friends and they are all from diﬀerent ”new” countries. In each group, for every person there is at most one other person in that group sitting beside him. Hence we can again split the people in the group into pairs of neighbors and apply the lemma again (now using the original countries) to get 4 groups, so that in each group no two people sit side by side. (Russian Math Olympiad 2003) 7. Number the rows and columns from top to bottom and from left to right, respectively. Call a square located in an odd-numbered row and odd-numbered column special. Notice that an empty square is always special. 8 IMO Training 2010 Russian-style Problems Alexander Remorov If a special square A is covered by a domino, then one of the short sides of the domino is adjacent to another special square B. Draw an arrow from the centre of square A to the centre of square B. Notice if B is empty, then by sliding the domino we can move the empty square to A. Draw these arrows for all special squares. If there is a directed path along the arrows from a special square A to the empty square, it is possible to move the empty square to A. A path along these arrows either ends in an empty square, or is a cycle. Let us show that if it is a cycle, then it bounds a polygon with an odd number of squares inside. Look at any such cycle. Consider a new square grid with vertical and horizontal lines passing through the centres of the special squares. The cycle will bound a polygon made up of squares of side length 2 in the new grid. We now use induction on the number of these squares. For one square the result is obvious. A polygon made up of k squares is obtained by adding a 2 × 2 square on the boundary of a polygon made up of k − 1 squares; it is easy to check then the number of unit squares inside the cycle increases by 2 or 4. Any polygon bounded by a cycle must contain an even number of unit squares, since it can be completely tiled by dominoes. Hence all paths along the arrows end in the empty square. The corner squares are special, and the result follows. (Russian Math Olympiad 1998) 8. For every player call a break the number of games between two consecutive matches (including the second match). All breaks are at least n + 1. Number the games in order of their occurrence. Consider n + 3 consecutive games g1, g2, ..., gn+3 with 2n + 6 players in them. We claim at most 3 players could participate in two of these games. This is clear since they would have to play games (g1, gn+2), (g2, gn+3), (g1, gn+3) or else two of them play each other twice. There are 2n + 3 players in total, hence the breaks of the players of g1 are n + 1 and n + 2. Hence every break is equal to n + 1 or n + 2. It suﬃces to ﬁnd a player all whose breaks were equal to n + 2, since the total number of games is (2n+3)(2n+2) 2 = (n + 2)(2n + 1) + 1 he will be the one playing in the ﬁrst and the last games. Assume the contrary. Find the player X who was the last to have a break of n + 1 games. Assume he played a player Z in game c at the end of this break. Let a be the number of the last game Z played, right after which he had a break of n+1 games. Then between games a+n+1 and c, Z had all breaks of length n+2; so c = a+(n+1)+k(n+2). All the breaks that X had before game c were n + 2. If he had at least k such breaks, then he had to play game a with Z. Otherwise he had at most k−1 such breaks, and his ﬁrst game was at least c−(n+1)−(k−1)(n+2) = a+(n+2) ≥ n+3. Hence at most 2n + 2 games played in the ﬁrst n + 2 games, so the games 1 and n + 2 were played by the same two players, a contradiction. (Russian Math Olympiad 2008) References 1.
