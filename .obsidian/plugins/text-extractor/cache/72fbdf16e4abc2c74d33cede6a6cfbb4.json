Ptolemy’s inequality is a beautiful inequality, but it is rather difficult to see when or how it can be applied to geometry problems. This inequality has often been used in gifted student selection exams in various places. In this article we will first look at how this inequality is derived. Theorem (Ptolemy’s Inequality) Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. We have ABCD+DABC ≥ ACBD with equality if and only if ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral.      C D X Y E Proof. From A and from B draw two rays to cut diagonals BD and AC at X and at Y respectively such that ∠XAB = ∠DAC and ∠YBA =∠DCA. Suppose AX cut BY at E. Then ∠BAC =∠EAD. We have ∆ABE ~ ∆ACD. So )1(BEACCDAB AD AE CD BE AC AB  and we also have ∆AED ~ ∆ABC. It follows )2(.EDACBCAD BC ED AC AD  Adding the equations (1) and (2), we have ABCD+DABC=AC (BE+ED) ≥ ACBD. Thus, for arbitrary quadrilateral ABCD, we have ABCD+DABC ≥ ACBD. Equality holds if and only if E belongs to BD. In that case ∠ABD =∠ACD or ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. This inequality can also be proved in a different way (cf vol. 2, no. 4 of Math Excalibur). Next we will look at applications of the theorem and Ptolemy’s inequality. Example 1 An isosceles triangle ABC (with CA=CB) is inscribed in a circle with center O and M is an arbitrary point lying on the minor arc BC. Prove that . AC AB MC MBMA   C A M B Solution. Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to AMBC, we have MABC + MBCA = MC  AB. From CA=CB, we have . AC AB MC MBMA   Example 2 (Pythagorean Theorem) For right ∆ABC with ∠ACB=90°, we have BC 2 + AC 2 = AB 2. OA C B D Solution. Draw a circle with midpoint O of side AB as center and radius AB/2. Let ray CO intersect the circle at D. Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to ACBD, we have ADBC+BDAC = ABCD. Since AD = BC, BD=AC and CD=AB, we get BC 2 + AC 2 = AB 2. Example 3 Let a and b be acute angles. Prove that sin(a+b) = sin a cos b + sin b cos a. Solution. Let’s draw a circle with diameter AC = 1. Construct the rays AB and AD lying on opposite sides of the diameter AC such that ∠CAB = a and ∠CAD = b. Also draw diameter BE as shown in the next figure.

Also, ∠BED = ∠BAD = a+b and BD = p = sin(a+b). Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to ABCD, we have ACBD = BCDA + CDAB, which is sin(a+b) = sin a cos b + sin b cos a. Example 4 If an arbitrary point M lies on the circle circumscribed about square A1A2A3A4, then we have the relation . 2 4 2 2 2 3 2 1 MAMAMAMA  A1 A2 A3A4 M Solution. Without loss of generality, assume that M lies on minor arc A1A4. Let MA1 = x1, MA2 = x2, MA3 = x3, MA4 = x4 and let the square have side a. Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to MA1A2A3 and MA1A3A4, we have .2,2 341231 axaxaxaxaxax  Cancelling a in both equations and rewriting the second equation as ,2413 xxx  we get (x1+x3)2 + (x3−x1)2 = 2x22 + 2x42. Expanding the equation and cancelling 2 on both sides, we get x12 + x32 = x22 + x42, which is the desired conclusion. Example 5 Let A1A2…An be a regular polygon that has an odd number of sides. Let M be a point on the minor arc A1An of the circle circumscribed about it. Prove that the sum of the distances from the point M to the vertices Ai (i being odd) is equal to the sum of the distances from the point M to the vertices Ak (k being even). A1 A2 A3 A4 A5A6 A7 M Solution. Let each side of the polygon have length a. Draw the diagonals A1A3, A2A4, …, AnA2, which have a common length b. Next, draw the chords MA1, MA2, …, MAn and let MAi have length di. Applying Ptolemy’s theorem to MA1A2A3, MA2A3A4, …, MAn–1AnA1 and MAnA1A2, we have ad1+ad3=bd2, bd3=ad2+ad4, ad3+ad5=bd4, bd5=ad4+ad6, … , adn–2+adn=bdn–1, bdn+ad1=adn–1, adn+bd1=ad2. Adding these equations, we get (2a+b)(d1+d3+⋯+dn) = (2a+b)(d2+d4+⋯+dn–1). Cancelling 2a+b, this becomes d1 + d3 + ⋯ + dn = d2 + d4 + ⋯ + dn–1, which is the desired conclusion. Next we will generalize Ptolemy’s inequality to higher dimensions. Example 6 Let ABCD be a tetrahedron in the three dimensional space. Prove that ABCD+DABC > ACBD Solution. Draw a plane α which is parallel to lines AC and BD. Let A1, B1, C1, D1 be the feet of perpendiculars from A, B, C, D to plane α respectively. We have A1C1 =AC and B1D1 = BD. However, A1B1 ≤ AB, B1C1 ≤ BC, C1D1 ≤ CD, D1A1 ≤ DA and at least one of these is strict since A,B,C,D are not on the same plane.  A B C D A1 B1 C1 D1 Using the inequalities and equations above as well as Ptolemy’s inequality applied to quadrilateral A1B1C1D1 on the plane α, we have ABCD + DABC > A1B1C1D1 + D1A1B1C1 ≥ A1C1B1D1 = ACBD. Alternatively, consider the Cartesian coordinate system. Say A = (a1,a2,a3), B = (b1,b2,b3), C = (c1,c2,c3) and D = (d1,d2,d3).

In (*) and its proof, 3 can be replaced by any positive integer n and that gives Ptolemy’s inequality in n-dimensional space. The following are some exercises for the readers.

If x1 = y1 =1 and for n>1, xn = −3xn−1−4yn−1+n and yn = xn−1+yn−1−2, then find xn and yn in terms of n only. Solution.

(Ellen Yeung) College), Titu ZVONARU (Comăneşti, Romania) and Neculai STANCIU (“George Emil Palade’’ Secondary School, Buzău, Romania). Writing out many terms, we may observe that {x2n−1}, {x2n}, {y2n−1}, {y2n} are arithmetic progressions. In fact, for n = 1, 2, 3, …, we can claim x2n−1 = 17n−16, y2n−1 = −8n+9, x2n = −17n+12, y2n = 9n−9. We will prove these by induction. The case n = 1 follows from x1 = y1 = 1, x2=−3−4+2=−5, y2=1+1−2=0, agreeing with the claim. If the case n is true, then by the definition of xn and yn, x2n+1 = −3(−17n+12)−4(9n−9)+(2n+1) = 17(n+1)−16, y2n+1 = (−17n+12)+(9n−9)−2 = −8(n+1)+9, x2n+2 = −3(17(n+1)−16)−4(−8(n+1)+9) +(2n+2) = −17(n+1)+12, y2n+2 = (17(n+1)−16)+(−8(n+1)+9)−2 = 9(n+1)−9 and the induction is complete.

Prove that there does not exist a sequence p0, p1, p2, … of prime numbers such that for all positive integer k, pk is either 2pk−1+1 or 2pk−1−1. Solution. Radouan BOUKHARFANE, CHEUNG Wai Lam (Queen Elizabeth School, Form 3), F5D (Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School) and ZOLBAYAR Shagdar (Orchlon International School, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia). Assume such sequence exists. (The cases p0 = 2 or 3 can only yield no more than five terms, then contradiction arises.) For k ≥ 2, we have pk > 3. Then either pk ≡ 1 or −1 (mod 6). In the former case, 2pk+1≡3 (mod 6) cannot be prime. So pk+1=2pk−1≡ 1 (mod 6). Then repeating the same reason, we can only have pn=2pn−1−1 for all n > k. By induction, we have pn=2n−k(pk−1)+1 for n > k. In the case n=k+pk−1, we get )(mod12 1 k p p k   by Fermat’s little theorem. Then pn≡ 0 (mod pk) contradicting pn is prime. In the latter case, 2pk−1 ≡ 3 (mod 6) cannot be prime. Similarly, this leads to pn=2n−k(pk+1)−1 for n > k. Again, by Fermat’s little theorem, the case n=k+pk−1 leads to contradiction. Problem 418. Point M is the midpoint of side AB of acute ΔABC. Points P and Q are the feet of perpendicular from A to side BC and from B to side AC respectively. Line AC is tangent to the circumcircle of ΔBMP. Prove that line BC is tangent to the circumcircle of ΔAMQ. Solution 1. Titu ZVONARU (Comăneşti, Romania) and Neculai STANCIU (“George Emil Palade’’ Secondary School, Buzău, Romania).   A B C P M S O T Q N Let O be the center of the circumcircle Γ of ΔBMP and S, T be the projections of M, O onto line AC. Let OM intersect BP at N. Now OM is the perpendicular bisector of BP. So ∠MNC=∠MSC=90° implies MNCS is cyclic. Since MS || OT, γ=∠ACB=180°−∠OMS=∠MOT. By the extended sine law, the chord MP of Γ satisfies .2sin2 2 AB AP OMABCOMMP AB  Hence OM=AB 2/(4AP).

Solution 2. KWAN Chung Hang (Sir Ellis Kadoorie Secondary School (West Kowloon)). Since AP⊥BC and BQ⊥AC, points A,Q,P,B lie on the circle with M as center and AB as diameter. Consider inversion with respect to this circle. Let X’ be the image of X under this inversion. We have A’=A, Q’=Q, P’=P, B’=B. Since line AC is tangent to the circumcircle of Δ BMP, so the image of line AC and the image of the circumcircle of ΔBMP are tangent. Since the circumcircle of Δ BMP passes through M, the image of this circumcircle is the line B’P’, which is line BC. Also, the image of line AC is the circle through A’, Q’, C’, M, which is the circumcircle of Δ AMQ. So line BC is tangent to the circumcircle of ΔAMQ.

Prove that M has a nonempty subset, the sum of all its elements is divisible by 2n. Solution 1. Juan G. ALONSO and Ángel PLAZA (Garoé Atlantic School & Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria, Spain), F5D (Carmel Alison Lam Foundation Secondary School), KWOK Man Yi (S2, Baptist Lui Ming Choi Secondary School), LKL Excalibur (Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of MFBM) and Aliaksei SEMCHANKAU (School 41 named after Serebryany, Minsk, Belarus). If n is not in M, then by the pigeonhole principle, since M has n elements, it must contain at least one of the pairs {1,2n−1}, {2,2n−2}, …, {n−1, n+1}. This pair is a subset of M that we want. If n is in M, then let a1, a2, …, an be the elements of M. We may let an = n and a1 be the minimum of a1, a2, …, an–1. Since M has at least 4 elements, we may assume a2 is not a1+n (otherwise replace a2 by a3). Consider the n numbers a2, S1, S2, S3, …, Sn–1, where Si is the sum of a1, a2, …, ai. By the pigeonhole principle and the fact a2≠a1+n, two of the n numbers are congruent (mod n) and the two numbers are not a1, a2. Hence, their difference (which is a sum of the ai’s) is equal to jn for some positive integer j. If j is even, then the set T of the ai’s in the sum is a desired subset of M. Otherwise j is odd. We can add an = n to T to get a desired subset of M. Solution 2. CHEUNG Wai Lam (Queen Elizabeth School, Form 3) and ZOLBAYAR Shagdar (Orchlon International School, Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia). We will say {a,b,c} is bad if a,b,c ∈M and 2n divides a+b+c. Assume the contrary (which implies M has no bad subsets). Then M contains exactly one element in each of the sets {1,2n−1}, {2,2n−2}, …, {n−1, n+1}, {n}. In particular, n is in M. Now 1∈M ⇒ n−1∉M (otherwise {1, n−1, n} is bad) ⇒ n+1∈M ⇒ n−2∉M (otherwise {1, n−2, n+1} is bad) ⇒ n+2∈M ⇒ ⋯ ⇒ n+(n−1)=2n−1∈M ⇒ 1∉M, contradiction. Next 1∉M ⇒ 2n−1∈M ⇒ n+1∉M (otherwise {n, n+1, 2n−1} is bad) ⇒ n−1 ∈M ⇒ n+2∉M (otherwise {n−1, n+2, 2n−1} is bad) ⇒ n−2∈M ⇒ ⋯ ⇒ n − (n−1) = 1 ∈M, contradiction.

Ioan Viorel CODREANU (Secondary School Satulung, Maramures, Romania), KWAN Chung Hang (Sir Ellis Kadoorie Secondary School (West Kowloon)), LKL Excalibur (Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of MFBM) and Aliaksei SEMCHANKAU (School 41 named after Serebryany, Minsk, Belarus). Let a | b denote a divides b. Suppose xy 2+2y | 2x 2y+xy 2+8x. Then xy 2+2y | y(2x 2y+xy 2+8x) − (2x+y)( xy 2+2y) = 4xy−2y 2. Since y > 0, we get xy+2 | 4x−2y. If 4x−2y < 0, then xy+2 | 2y−4x. Now 2y > 2y−4x ≥ xy+2> xy implies 2 > x. Hence x = 1. Then y+2 | 2y−4 = 2(y+2)−8. So y+2 | 8, which implies y = 2 or 6. We can check (x,y) = (1,2) is a solution, but (1,6) is not. If 4x−2y = 0, then (x,y) = (k,2k) for some positive integer k and we have xy 2+2y=4k 3+4k | 2x 2y+xy 2+8x=8k 3+8k for all positive integer k. If 4x−2y > 0, then xy+2 | 4x−2y. Now 4x > 4x−2y ≥ xy+2 > xy. So y < 4. The case y = 1 leads to x+2 | 4x−2 = 4(x+2)−10. Hence, x+2 | 10. Then (x,y) = (3,1) or (8,1). Both can easily be checked to be solutions. The case y = 2 leads to 2x+2 | 4x−4 = 2(2x+2)−8. Hence, x+1 | 4. Then (x,y) = (1,2) or (3,2), which are not solutions. The cases y = 3 leads to 3x+2 | 4x−6. Then 3x+2 | 4(3x+2) − 3(4x−6) = 26, which leads to (x,y) = (8,3), but it is not a solution. So the solutions are (x,y) = (3,1), (8,1) and (k, 2k) for all positive integer k.
