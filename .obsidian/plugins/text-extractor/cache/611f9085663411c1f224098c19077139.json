Evaluate the series: ∞∑ n=1 n + 1 (n − 1)! + n! + (n + 1)! and ∞∑ n=1 1 (n + 1)√n + n √n + 1 . 3. Evaluate the series: (a) 1 + 1 2 + 1 42 + 1 23 + 1 44 + 1 25 + 1 46 + · · · . (b) 1 + 1 2 + 1 2 · 3 + 1 22 · 3 + 1 22 · 32 + 1 23 · 32 + 1 23 · 33 + · · · . 4. Suppose that an+2 = an+1 + an for all n ≥ 1 and a1 = 1, a2 = 2. Evaluate the series ∞∑ n=1 1 anan+2 . Comment: Note that an is essentially the sequence of Fibonacci numbers. However, you don’t need any result on Fibonacci numbers to do this problem. 5. Show that ∞∑ n=1 tan −1 ( 1 1 + n + n2 ) converges and also ﬁnd its sum. 6. Determine whether the series ∞∑ n=1 sin(π√n2 + n + 1) converges or not. 7. Let 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, · · · be the sequence of all positive integers which do not contain the digit zero. If we denote this sequence by {an}n≥1, show that ∑∞ n=1 1/an ≤ 90. 8. Show that the series 1 1 + x + 2 1 + x2 + 4 1 + x4 + · · · + 2 n 1 + x2n + · · · converges when |x| > 1, and in this case evaluate it. 1 9. If ∞∑ n=1 |xn+1 − xn| converges, show that lim n→∞ xn exists. 10. Show that for every a < 1, ∞∑ n=1 1 na diverges. (You may use that ∞∑ n=1 1 n diverges.) 11. Suppose that ∑ n≥1 |an| converges. Consider the series ∑ n≥1(an + |an|). This is a series of non-negative terms. Give an upper bound on its partial sum to show that it converges. Hence conclude that ∑ n≥1 an converges. 12. (a) For any x ∈ R, deﬁne x+ = max{x, 0} and x− = max{−x, 0}. Show that for every x ∈ R, x = x+ − x− and |x| = x+ + x−. (Hint: Split into two cases as x ≥ 0 or x < 0.) (b) Show that ∑ n≥1 |an| converges if and only if ∑ n≥1 a+ n and ∑ n≥1 a− n are convergent. 13. Suppose that an is a sequence that decreases to zero (i.e. an is decreasing and converges to 0). Show that the ‘alternating’ series ∑∞ n=1(−1)n−1an converges. Hence conclude that the series ∑∞ n=1(−1) n−1/n converges. Hint: Consider the sequence of partial sums Sn = ∑n k=1(−1)k−1ak. Show that the sequence {S2n}n≥1 is increasing and bounded above by S1 and {S2n+1}n≥1 is decreasing and bounded above by S2. Finally, use S2n+1 − S2n = a2n+1 to show that these two subsequences converge to the same limit. 14. Suppose that {an}n≥1 is a decreasing sequence of non-negative numbers such that ∞∑ n=1 an converges. Show that lim n→∞ nan = 0. Hint: Let Sn = ∑n k=1 ak. Give an upper bound on a2n using S2n and Sn. Do similar thing for a2n+1. 15. Let a0, a1 be any positive real number and deﬁne an+1 = nan + an−1 n + 1 for all n ≥ 1. Show that the sequence an converges. Hint: Give an upper bound on |an+1 − an| and show that ∑∞ n=1 |an+1 − an| converges. 16. Suppose that {an}n≥1 is a sequence of non-negative numbers such that ∞∑ n=1 an converges. Then show that ∞∑ n=1 √ an+1an must also converge. 2 17. Let a1 = 3 and an+1 = (a2 n + 1)/2 for all n ≥ 1. Show that for every n ∈ N, 1 a1 + 1 + 1 a2 + 1 + · · · + 1 an + 1 + 1 an+1 − 1 = 1 2. Hence show that ∞∑ n=1 1 an + 1 = 1 2. 18. For any positive integer n, let ⟨n⟩ denote the integer closest to √n. Evaluate the series ∞∑ n=1 2 ⟨n⟩ + 2−⟨n⟩ 2n . Hint: For a ﬁxed k ∈ N, ﬁnd all n ∈ N which satisfy ⟨n⟩ = k. 19. Let x0 = a, x1 = b and deﬁne xn+1 = (1 − 1 2n )xn + 1 2nxn−1 for n ≥ 1. Show that lim n→∞ xn exists and also ﬁnd this limit. 20. (a) Start with de Moivre’s theorem: (cos θ + i sin θ)m = (cos mθ + i sin mθ). Put m = 2n + 1 and θ = kπ 2n+1 and hence obtain a polynomial in cot2 θ which vanishes when θ = kπ 2n+1, k = 1, . . . , n. (b) Using the polynomial in part (a), show that n∑ k=1 cot 2 kπ 2n + 1 = n(2n2 − 1) 3 . (c) Use the inequality sin x < x < tan x for x ∈ (0, π/2), to derive lower and upper bounds on ∑n k=1 1/k2 (also, use part (b)). Hence show that 1 + 1 22 + 1 32 + · · · = π2 6 . 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
