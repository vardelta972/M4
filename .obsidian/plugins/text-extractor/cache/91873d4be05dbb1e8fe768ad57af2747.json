You can use any result discussed in the class, but you have to state it properly. Since it is a ‘take-home’ exam, I can only request you to take the test honestly and abide by the time limit. Do not cheat to yourself. All the best! 1. (5+5 points) (a) Let g : R → R be a diﬀerentiable function. Assume that g(x0) = 0 and g′(x) > g(x) for every x ∈ R. Prove that g(x) > 0 for every x > x0. (b) For any a > 0 prove that the equation aex = 1 + x + x2/2 has a unique real root. 2. (3+3+4 points) Let p1, p2, . . . , pn ∈ (0, 1) such that ∑n i=1 pi = 1. For α ≥ 0, α ̸= 1, deﬁne H(α) = 1 1 − α log ( n∑ i=1 pα i ) . (a) Calculate limα→1 H(α). (b) Show that dH(α) dα = 1 (1 − α)2 n∑ i=1 zi log(pi/zi), where zi = pα i / ∑n j=1 pα j . (c) Hence or otherwise show that H(α) is a non-increasing function of α. 3. (10 points) Find the area of the largest circle centred at the origin which is inscribed between the graphs of the functions y = 1 1 + x2 , and y = − 1 1 + x2 . (You need not ﬁnd an approximate value, just ﬁnd an expression.) 4. (10 points) Suppose that f : [0, π] → R is a diﬀerentiable function (assume that the one sided derivatives exist at both the endpoints) such that there is no x ∈ [0, π] satisfying f (x) = f ′(x) = 0. Show that the set S = {x : f (x) = 0} must be ﬁnite.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
