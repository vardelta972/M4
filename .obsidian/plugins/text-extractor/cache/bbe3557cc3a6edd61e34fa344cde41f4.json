Answer: 4 Solution: Note that x2 + 2x − 15 x2 − 4x + 3 = (x − 3)(x + 5) (x − 3)(x − 1) = x + 5 x − 1 . Then lim x→3 x + 5 x − 1 = 3 + 5 3 − 1 = 4 . 2. Compute all real values of b such that, for f (x) = x2 + bx − 17, f (4) = f ′(4). Answer: 3 Solution: We have that f (4) = 4b − 1 and f ′(4) = 2(4) + b = b + 8. Setting these equal to each other, we see that b = 3 . 3. Suppose a and b are real numbers such that lim x→0 sin 2 x eax − bx − 1 = 1 2 . Determine all possible ordered pairs (a, b). Answer: (2, 2) and (−2, −2) Solution: Since this is in an indeterminate form, we can use L’Hˆopital’s Rule to obtain lim x→0 sin 2x aeax − b = 1 2 . However, the numerator goes to zero, so the denominator must also go to zero to give us another indeterminate form. This implies that a = b. Using L’Hˆopital’s Rule again, we have that lim x→0 2 cos 2x a2eax = 1 2 . The numerator goes to 2, so the denominator must go to 4. Therefore, a = b = ±2, giving us (a, b) = (2, 2) and (−2, −2) . 4. Evaluate ∫ 4 0 e√x dx. Answer: 2e2 + 2 Let w = √x so that w2 = x and dx = 2w dw. Then the integral becomes 2 ∫ 2 0 we w dw. To ﬁnd this integral, use integration by parts: u = w → du = dw; dv = ew dw → v = ew ∫ we w dw = uv − ∫ v du = we w − ∫ ewdw = (w − 1)e w. Evaluating 2(w − 1)ew at our limits of integration yields 2e 2 + 2 . SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 5. Evaluate lim x→0 sin 2(5x) tan3(4x) (log(2x + 1))5 . Answer: 50 Solution 1: For any function f with f (0) = 0, we know that lim x→0 f (x) x = lim x→0 f (x) − f (0) x = f ′(0). sin(5x), tan(4x), and log(2x + 1) are all 0 at x = 0, and their derivatives at 0 are 5, 4, and 2, respectively. So, divide numerator and denominator by x5 and re-arrange to get lim x→0 sin 2(5x) tan3(4x) (log(2x + 1))5 = lim x→0 ( sin(5x) x )2 · ( tan(4x) x )3 ( log(2x+1) x )5 = 52 · 43 25 = 50 . Solution 2: Recall from Taylor series that if f (0) = 0, then f (x) ≈ f ′(0)x when x is small. This allows us to write lim x→0 sin 2(5x) tan3(4x) (log(2x + 1))5 = lim x→0 (5x)2(4x)3 (2x)5 = 50 . 6. Compute ∞∑ k=0 ∫ π 3 0 sin 2k x dx. Answer: √ 3 Bring the sum into the integral, so we have ∫ π 3 0 ∞∑ k=0 sin 2k x dx. The integrand is a geometric series, so the answer is ∫ π 3 0 1 1 − sin 2 x dx = ∫ π 3 0 sec2 x dx = tan ( π 3 ) − tan(0) = √3 . 7. The function f (x) has the property that, for some real positive constant C, the expression f (n)(x) n + x + C is independent of n for all nonnegative integers n, provided that n + x + C ̸= 0. Given that f ′(0) = 1 and ∫ 1 0 f (x) dx = C + (e − 2), determine the value of C. Note: f (n)(x) is the n-th derivative of f (x), and f (0)(x) is deﬁned to be f (x). Answer: √3 − e Solution: Since f (n)(x)/(n + x + C) is independent of n, we can say that it is equal to g(x). Multiplying by (n + x + C), we have that f (n)(x) = (n + x + C)g(x). SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 Taking a derivative with respect to x, we obtain f (n+1)(x) = (n + x + C)g′(x) + g(x). However, this is equal to (n + 1 + x + C)g(x) by the problem statement. Canceling terms, we obtain that g(x) = g′(x). The only class of functions that is its own derivative is aex, so we have that g(x) = aex (for some constant a). Now, f ′(x) = (x + C + 1)aex, so f ′(0) = 1 gives us that a = 1/(C + 1). We also have that ∫ 1 0 f (x) dx = ∫ 1 0 x + C C + 1 · ex dx = C + (e − 2). Integration by parts gives us (e − 1)C + 1 C + 1 = C + (e − 2), which simpliﬁes to C2 = 3 − e, from which it follows that the answer is √ 3 − e . 8. The function f (x) is deﬁned for all x ≥ 0 and is always nonnegative. It has the additional property that if any line is drawn from the origin with any positive slope m, it intersects the graph y = f (x) at precisely one point, which is 1√m units from the origin. Let a be the unique real number for which f takes on its maximum value at x = a (you may assume that such an a exists). Find ∫ a 0 f (x) dx. Answer: 1+log(2) 4 Solution 1: First, express x and y as functions parametrized by m. We have the system y = mx x2 + y2 = 1 m . Solving for y, we get y = √ m 1+m2 . Hence, maximizing y is equivalent to maximizing m 1+m2 . By diﬀerentiating with respect to m, we see that the maximum occurs when m = 1, at the point ( 1√2 , 1√2 ). Now, we just need to compute the integral. However, this parametric form is not convenient. Instead, by drawing the line y = x, we notice that the integral splits up into a right isosceles triangle, and a region between the line y = x and the y-axis. This suggests that we should convert to polar coordinates. In fact, f (x) is equivalent to the graph r(θ) = 1√tan(θ) , since a line at angle θ to the x-axis has slope tan(θ). The area we wish to compute is ∫ π/2 π/4 1 2 r(θ) 2 dθ = 1 2 ∫ π/2 π/4 cot(θ) dθ = 1 2 [log(sin(θ))]π/2 π/4 = 1 2 (0 − log(1/√2)) = 1 4 log(2). SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 We add this area to the area of the triangle, which is 1 2 ( 1√2 )2 = 1 4 , so our ﬁnal answer is 1 + log(2) 4 . Solution 2: We begin as before to ﬁnd a, but present a diﬀerent method of computing the integral. Solving for x in terms of y, we get that x2 + y2 = x/y =⇒ yx 2 − x + y3 = 0 =⇒ x = 1 ± √1 − 4y4 2y . We only care about the region where 1 ± √ 1 − 4y4 = 2xy ≤ 1, since x, y ≤ 1√2 . Hence, we take x = 1−√1−4y4 2y . Notice that we can compute the desired quantity as ( 1 √2 )2 − ∫ 1√ 2 0 1 − √ 1 − 4y4 2y dy, since within the square bounded by the coordinate axes and x, y ≤ 1√2 , the area between the curve and the x-axis plus the area between the curve and the y-axis sum to the area of the whole square. Now, using the substitution u = √ 1 − 4y4, we get ∫ 1√2 0 1 − √ 1 − 4y4 2y dy = ∫ 0 1 (1 − u)u 4u2 − 4 du = 1 4 ∫ 1 0 (1 − u)u (1 − u)(1 + u) du = 1 4 ∫ 1 0 u 1 + u du = 1 4 ∫ 1 0 1 − 1 1 + u du = 1 4 [u − log(1 + u)] 1 0 = 1 − log(2) 4 . The answer is 1 2 minus this quantity, so report 1 + log(2) 4 . 9. Evaluate ∫ π/2 0 dx (√sin x + √cos x)4 . Answer: 1/3 Solution 1: Observe that by pulling a factor of cos2 x out of the denominator, we can write the given integral as ∫ π/2 0 dx (1 + √tan x)4 cos2 x = ∫ π/2 0 sec2 x dx (1 + √tan x)4 . SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 We now substitute u = √tan x + 1: du = sec2 x 2√tan x dx = sec2 x 2(u − 1) dx. Thus, our integral is equal to ∫ ∞ 1 2u − 2 u4 du = ∫ ∞ 1 2u −3 − 2u −4 du, which simpliﬁes to [−u −2 + 2 3 u −3]∞ 1 = 1 3 . Solution 2: Let I be the value of the given integral. Note that 1 2 I = 1 2 ∫ π/2 0 ((√ sin(x) + √ cos(x) )−2)2 dx, which is the polar area bounded by the curve r(θ) = (√ sin(θ) + √ cos(θ))−2 and the x and y axes for θ ∈ [0, π/2]. Converting to Cartesian coordinates, we get 1 = r (√ sin(θ) + √cos(θ))2 = (√ r sin(θ) + √r cos(θ))2 =⇒ √x + √y = 1 =⇒ y = (1 − √x) 2 = 1 + x − 2 √x. Therefore, 1 2 I = ∫ 1 0 1 + x − 2√ x dx = [x + x2 2 − 4 3 x3/2]1 0 = 1 + 1 2 − 4 3 = 1 6 =⇒ I = 1 3 . 10. Evaluate lim n→∞ [( n∏ k=1 2k 2k − 1 ) ∫ ∞ −1 (cos x)2n 2x dx ] . Answer: π 2π 2π−1 Solution 1: Observe that (cos x)2n looks like a bunch of spikes, centered at 0, π, 2π, . . . , each with area In = ∫ π/2 −π/2(cos x)2n dx. SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 We can integrate by parts to see that Ik = ∫ π/2 −π/2(cos x) 2k dx = [ (cos x) 2k−1 sin x]π/2 −π/2 + (2k − 1) ∫ π/2 −π/2(cos x) 2k−2 sin 2 x dx = (2k − 1) ∫ π/2 −π/2(cos x) 2k−2(1 − cos2 x) dx = (2k − 1)(Ik−1 − Ik). Therefore, Ik = 2k − 1 2k Ik−1 =⇒ In = ( n∏ k=1 2k − 1 2k ) I0 = π n∏ k=1 2k − 1 2k . As n → ∞, the spikes get sharper and sharper; this means that the denominator 2x of the integrand gets concentrated at x = 0, π, 2π, . . . . Therefore, we expect that as n → ∞, ( n∏ k=1 2k 2k − 1 ) ∫ ∞ −1 (cos x)2n 2x dx → ( n∏ k=1 2k 2k − 1 ) ∞∑ k=0 In 2kπ = π 1 1 − 2−π = π 2π 2π − 1 . Solution 2: We present a more rigorous approach here. First, rewrite the problem into the following form: For each positive integer n, let an = ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx. Additionally, let c = lim n→∞ √n n∏ k=1 (1 − 1 2k ), which is a positive ﬁnite constant. Evaluate 1 c lim n→∞ an. Let B = {0, π, 2π, . . . }. The idea is that the numerator of the integrand approaches a function with cπ area concentrated inﬁnitely closely to each point in B. Therefore, the limit should be lim n→∞ ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = ∑ x∈B cπ 2x = cπ 2π 2π − 1 , where the last equality follows by the formula for summing geometric series. We will soon get to a more precise way of thinking about the area being concentrated inﬁnitely closely to points in B, but ﬁrst let’s see why the numerator should have cπ area around each point in B. Since the area around each point in B is the same (cos2n is periodic), we need only consider the area around 0. We can apply integration by parts to ﬁnd a formula for the area around 0 in each term of the sequence. The recurrence is ∫ π/2 −π/2 √n(cos x)2n dx = (1 − 1 2n ) ∫ π/2 −π/2 √n(cos x) 2(n−1) dx. Repeatedly applying this formula, we get ∫ π/2 −π/2 √n(cos x)2n dx = π√n n∏ k=1 ( 1 − 1 2k ) . Taking the limit as n → ∞, the area around 0 goes to cπ. So the answer makes sense. Now we will prove it more rigorously. SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 For x /∈ B, the integrand √n(cos x)2n 2x goes to 0 as n → ∞ because cos x < 1. So for any open set S suﬃciently disjoint from B, we might guess that lim n→∞ ∫ S √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = 0. If we require that every point in S is at least ϵ > 0 away from any point in B, then this is indeed true. There are two ways to see this. The fanciest way to see it is to use the “dominated convergence theorem”, which says that if a sequence of functions fn converges pointwise to a funciton f and if there is some function ϕ with |fn(x)| < ϕ(x) for all x ∈ S and ∫ S ϕ < ∞, then limn→∞ ∫ S fn = ∫ S f . To apply this theorem, we let fn be the integrand of the n-th term of the sequence. To construct ϕ, notice that since every point in S is at least ϵ away from every point in B, there is some δ < 1 so that | cos x| < δ for all x ∈ S. So √n(cos x)2n is bounded by √nδ2n for all x ∈ S. Since √nδ2n has a ﬁnite limit as n → ∞, √n(cos x)2n is bounded by some ﬁnite number B for all x ∈ S. So we can let ϕ(x) = B/2x. Then |fn(x)| < ϕ(x) for all x ∈ S and ∫ S ϕ < ∞, just as we need in order to apply the theorem. So we apply the theorem to get lim n→∞ ∫ S √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = ∫ S lim n→∞ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = ∫ S 0 dx = 0. But we of course don’t expect you to know the dominated convergence theorem, so we can also prove this using a “bare hands” method that is actually easier. (Bare hands is usually much harder than the dominated convergence theorem proof. That is why people use the dominated convergence theorem. But we have arranged for this problem to work with bare hands.) As we argued above, there is some δ < 1 so that cos x < δ for all x ∈ S. Then √n(cos x)2n < √nδ2n for all x ∈ S. So we have a bound ∫ S √n(cos x)2n 2x dx ≤ √nδ2n ∫ S 1 2x dx. Since the integral ∫ 1 2x converges, this goes to 0 as n → ∞ so we again have the desired result. The upshot of all this is that we can now deﬁne Bϵ to be the points in [−1, ∞) that are within ϵ of B and have lim n→∞ ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = lim n→∞ ∫ Bϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx. To calculate the integral on the right, notice that it is just the sum over all integers k ≥ 0 of ∫ kπ+ϵ kπ−ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = 1 2kπ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx. By the formula for summing geometric series, the sum of this over all integers k ≥ 0 is lim n→∞ ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = 2π 2π − 1 ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx. (1) So we have reduced the problem to calculating the following limit: lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx. SMT 2013 Calculus Test Solutions February 2, 2013 To do this, bound the limit above and below by taking the highest and lowest possible values of 2x out of the integral: 2 −ϵ lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x) 2n dx ≤ lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx ≤ 2 ϵ lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n dx. By a very similar argument as above, nothing outside (−ϵ, ϵ) contributes to the integrals in our bounds and therefore lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √ n(cos x) 2n dx = lim n→∞ ∫ π/2 −π/2 √n(cos x)2n dx. We have already calculated the right hand side: it is cπ. So we can plug this back into our bounds to get 2−ϵcπ ≤ lim n→∞ ∫ ϵ −ϵ √n(cos x)2n 2x dx ≤ 2 ϵcπ. Plugging this bound into (1) gives 2 −ϵcπ 2π 2π − 1 ≤ lim n→∞ ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx ≤ 2ϵcπ 2π 2π − 1 . Since ϵ was arbitrary, taking ϵ → 0 forces lim n→∞ ∫ ∞ −1 √n(cos x)2n 2x dx = cπ 2π 2π − 1 , as desired. Finally, you might be interested in knowing why c is a positive ﬁnite constant. (This is not necessary to solve the problem, but it is necessary to be sure that the problem makes sense. And it is interesting.) To see this, let bn = √n ∏n k=1(1 − 1 2k ). Then log bn = 1 2 log n + n∑ k=1 log ( 1 − 1 2k ) = 1 2 log n + n∑ k=1 ( − 1 2k + O ( 1 k2 )) . Here O( 1 k2 ) denotes some function of k whose absolute value is always less than C 1 k2 for some C big enough. The fact that log(1 − 1 2k ) = − 1 2k + O( 1 k2 ) follows from the Taylor expansion of log around 1. It is well known that ∑n k=1 1 k = log n + γ + O( 1 n ) where γ is some constant. Plugging this in gives log bn = 1 2 log n − 1 2 log n − 1 2 γ + O ( 1 n ) + n∑ k=1 O ( 1 k2 ) = − 1 2 γ + O ( 1 n ) + n∑ k=1 O ( 1 k2 ) . Since ∑∞ k=1 1 k2 converges to some constant, ∑n k=1 O( 1 k2 ) converges to some ﬁnite constant α as n → ∞. Therefore log bn → − 1 2 γ +α as n → ∞. This is some ﬁnite number, so c = exp(− 1 2 γ +α) is a positive ﬁnite number, as desired.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
