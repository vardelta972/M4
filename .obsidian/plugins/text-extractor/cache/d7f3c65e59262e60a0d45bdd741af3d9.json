Similarly, if x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ... ≤ xn, y1 ≥ y2 ≥ ... ≥ yn, z1, z2, ..., zn is a permutation of y1, y2, ..., yn, then n∑ i=1 xiyi ≤ n∑ i=1 xizi. Summing over all possible permutations of y1, y2, ..., yn, we get Chebyshev’s In- equality: If x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ... ≤ xn, y1 ≤ y2 ≤ ... ≤ yn, then n n∑ i=1 xiyi ≥ n∑ i=1 xi n∑ i=1 yi. Similarly, if x1 ≤ x2 ≤ ... ≤ xn, y1 ≥ y2 ≥ ... ≥ yn, then n n∑ i=1 xiyi ≤ n∑ i=1 xi n∑ i=1 yi. AM-GM and similar inequalities If a1, a2, ..., an ≥ 0, then a1+a2+...+an n ≥ n√a1a2...an. This can be generalized to the RMS-AM-GM-HM, which states that: If a1, a2, ..., an ≥ 0, then√ a2 1+a2 2+...+a2 n 2 ≥ a1+a2+...+an n ≥ n√a1a2...an ≥ n 1 a1 + 1 a2 +...+ 1 an . Even more generally, the Power Mean Inequality states that: If a1, a2, ..., an ≥ 0 and w > x > 0 > y > z, then (a w 1 +a w 2 +...+a w n ) 1 w ≥ (a x 1 +a x 2 +...+a x n) 1 x ≥ n√a1a2...an ≥ (a y 1 +a y 2 +...+a y n) 1 y ≥ (a z 1 + a z 2 + ... + a z n) 1 z . These have equality if and only if a1 = a2 = ... = an. AM-GM can also be used to prove the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which states that: For any sequences of real numbers x1, x2, ..., xn and y1, y2, ..., yn, ( n∑ i=1 xiyi)2 ≤ n∑ i=1 x2 i n∑ i=1 y2 i . Cauchy-Schwarz is a special case of Holder’s inequality, in which p = q = 2. In general: Winter Camp 2014 Inequalities Daniel Spivak If p and q are positive real numbers such that 1 p + 1 q = 1, then for all sequences of non-negative real numbers x1, x2, ..., xn and y1, y2, ..., yn, n∑ i=1 xiyi ≤ ( n∑ i=1 xp i ) 1 p ( n∑ i=1 yq i ) 1 q . In Holder’s inequality, the equality case occurs when xp 1 yq 1 = xp 2 yq 2 = ... = xp n yq n Note: Holder’s inequality is spelled with a fancy, double-dotted o, but it does not show up in this editor. Miscellaneous useful theorems Jensen’s Inequality allows is one of the few ways in which you can use derivatives without making graders get angry: Suppose f (x) is a convex function on [a, b], that is to say, f ′′(x) ≥ 0 if x ∈ [a, b]. Then for all positive real numbers t1, t2, ..., tn and all x1, x2, ..., xn ∈ [a, b] such that t1 + t2 + ... + tn = 1, we have t1f (x1) + t2f (x2) + ... + tnf (xn) ≥ f (t1x1 + t2x2 + ... + tnxn), and if f ′′(x) > 0, then this is with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = ... = xn. Schur’s Inequality is the ﬁrst one to suspect when there is a weird equality case - equality holds when two variables are equal and the third is also equal or is zero: Let f (x) be a non-decreasing, non-negative function, e.g. f (x) = xk with k ≥ 0. Then for all non-negative real a, b, c, f (a)(a − b)(a − c) + f (b)(b − a)(b − c) + f (c)(c − a)(c − b) ≥ 0. The special case of f (x) = x yields a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + 3abc ≥ a 2b + ab 2 + a2c + ac 2 + b2c + bc 2. A rarely-used but very Fancy version of Schur’s has ﬁve variables, but with- out the ﬂexibility of a function: If a, b, c, d, e are any real numbers, then (a − b)(a − c)(a − d)(a − e) + (b − a)(b − c)(b − d)(b − e) + (c − a)(c − b)(c − d)(c − e) + (d − a)(d − b)(d − c)(d − e) + (e − a)(e − b)(e − c)(e − d) ≥ 0. Equality occurs whenever each variable is equal to at least one other variable. Muirhead’s Inequality is very helpful when bashing, although it frequently does not apply until you apply AM-GM several times: A sequence a1, a2, ..., an majorizes a sequence b1, b2, ..., bn when x1 ≥ x2 ≥ ... ≥ xn, y1 ≥ y2 ≥ ... ≥ yn, x1 + x2 + ... + xn = y1 + y2 + ... + yn and a1 + a2 + ... + ak ≥ b1 + b2 + ... + bk for k = 1, 2, ..., n. In this case, for any sequence of non-negative real numbers x1, x2, ..., xn, ∑ sym xa1 1 x a2 2 ...x an n ≥ ∑ sym xb1 1 xb2 2 ...x bn n . Note that the sum is symmetric, not cyclic, and that the theorem is often false 2 Winter Camp 2014 Inequalities Daniel Spivak in the cyclic case. And for all those pesky inequalities with exponents, Bernoulli’s Inequality states that: For all k ≥ 1 and x ≥ −1,, (1 + x) r ≥ 1 + xr Common techniques An inequality is homogenous if when all variables are multiplied by a con- stant, the inequality is unaﬀected, i.e. the total exponent of all variables in each term is the same. If you are trying to bash and have a non-homogenous condition, you can multiply by the condition to homogenize and make bashing easier. For example, if xyz = 8 is given, and the inequality to be homogenized is x2 + y ≤ 5, it can be changed to x2 + y (xyz) 1 3 2 ≤ 5 (xyz) 2 3 4 . Also, if you are given that the product of some variables is 1, you can force homogeneity by setting each variable as a quotient; for example, if abc = 1, you may set a = x y , b = y z , c = z x . If you are given the silly condition that a, b, and c are sides of a triangle, in- troduce new positive variables x, y and z such that a = x + y, b = x + z, and c = y + z. You should always try to guess the equality cases of the inequality; if an equal- ity case involves one or more of the variables being zero, it’s likely that Schur’s inequality is involved. This will also help you determine what weights to use when you apply weighted AM-GM. Expanding power series: This is most frequently seen with 1 1−x = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + ... for −1 < x < 1. While the original fraction is diﬃcult to apply AM-GM on, power series are just meant to have roots taken of them. Factoring: If you have a polynomial in two variables, you can factor it to ﬁnd out precisely when it is bigger or smaller than zero; this is particularly useful if you’ve reduced the inequality to one variable by Showing that variables are equal: If you manage to show that replacing a, b with a+b 2 , a+b 2 or any other measure of central tendency preserves the inequality, most frequently by using Jensen’s inequality, then you can make many variables equal and reduce the number of variables enough to do this.
