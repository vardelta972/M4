Suppose x is a nonzero real number such that both x5 and 20x + 19 x are rational numbers. Prove that x is a rational number. Solution:Since x 5 is rational, we see that (20x)5 and (x/19) 5 are rational numbers. But (20x)5 − ( 19 x )5 = (20x − 19 x ) ( (20x)4 + (203 · 19)x2 + 202 · 192 + (20 · 19 3) 1 x2 + 194 x4 ) . Consider T = ((20x) 4 + (203 · 19)x2 + 202 · 19 2 + (20 · 19 3) 1 x2 + 194 x4 ) = ((20x) 4 + 19 4 x4 ) + 20 · 19 ((20x) 2 + 19 2 x2 ) + (202 · 192). Using 20x + (19)/x is rational, we get (20x) 2 + 19 2 x2 = ( 20x + 19 x )2 − 2 · 20 · 19 is rational. This leads to (20x) 4 + 19 4 x4 = ( (20x)2 + 192 x2 )2 − 2 · 202 · 19 2 is also rational. Thus T is a rational number and T ̸= 0. We conclude that 20x−(19/x) is a rational number. This combined with the given condition that 20x + (19/x) is rational shows 2 · 20 · x is rational. Therefore x is rational. 2. Let ABC be a triangle with circumcircle Ω and let G be the centroid of triangle ABC. Extend AG, BG and CG to meet the circle Ω again in A1, B1 and C1, respectively. Suppose ∠BAC = ∠A1B1C1, ∠ABC = ∠A1C1B1 and ∠ACB = ∠B1A1C1. Prove that ABC and A1B1C1 are equilateral triangles. Solution: Let ∠BAA1 = α and ∠A1AC = β. Then ∠BB1A1 = α. Using that angles at A and B1 are same, we get ∠BB1C1 = β. Then ∠C1CB = β. If ∠ACC1 = γ, we see that ∠C1A1A = γ. Therefore ∠AA1B1 = β. Similarly, we see that ∠B1BA = ∠A1C1C = β and ∠B1BC = ∠B1C1C = δ. Since ∠F BG = ∠BCG = β, it follows that F B is tangent to the circumcircle of △BGC at B. Therefore F B2 = F G · F C. Since F A = F B, we get F A 2 = F G · F C. This implies that F A is tangent to the circumcircle of of △AGC at A. Therefore α = ∠GAF = ∠GCA = γ. A similar analysis gives α = δ. It follows that all the angles of △ABC are equal and all the angles of △A1B1C1 are equal. Hence ABC and A1B1C1 are equilateral triangles. 3. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 1. Prove that a a2 + b3 + c3 + b b2 + c3 + a3 + c c2 + a3 + b3 ≤ 1 5abc . Solution:Observe that a 2 + b 3 + c 3 = a 2(a + b + c) + b3 + c3 = (a 3 + b3 + c 3) + a 2(b + c) ≥ 3abc + a 2b + a 2c. Hence a a2 + b3 + c3 ≤ 1 3bc + ab + ac . Using AM-HM inequality, we also have 3 bc + 1 ca + 1 ab ≥ 25 3bc + ca + ab . Thus we get a a2 + b3 + c3 ≤ 1 3bc + ab + ac ≤ 1 25 ( 3 bc + 1 ca + 1 ab ) . Similarly, we get b b2 + c3 + a3 ≤ 1 25 ( 3 ca + 1 ab + 1 bc ) and c c2 + a3 + b3 ≤ 1 25 ( 3 ab + 1 bc + 1 ca ) Adding, we get a a2 + b3 + c3 + b b2 + c3 + a3 + c c2 + a3 + b3 ≤ 5 25 ( 1 ab + 1 bc + 1 ca ) = 1 5abc . 4. Consider the following 3 × 2 array formed by using the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6:  a11 a12 a21 a22 a31 a32   =   1 6 2 5 3 4   . 2 Observe that all row sums are equal, but the sum of the squares is not the same for each row. Extend the above array to a 3 × k array (aij)3×k for a suitable k, adding more columns, using the numbers 7, 8, 9, . . . , 3k such that k∑ j=1 a1j = k∑ j=1 a2j = k∑ j=1 a3j and k∑ j=1(a1j) 2 = k∑ j=1(a2j) 2 = k∑ j=1(a3j) 2. Solution:Consider the following extension:   1 6 3 + 6 4 + 6 2 + (2 · 6) 5 + (2 · 6) 2 5 1 + 6 6 + 6 3 + (2 · 6) 4 + (2 · 6) 3 4 2 + 6 5 + 6 1 + (2 · 6) 6 + (2 · 6)   of   1 6 2 5 3 4   . This reduces to   1 6 9 10 14 17 2 5 7 12 15 16 3 4 8 11 13 18   . Observe 1 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 14 + 17 = 57; 1 2 + 62 + 92 + 102 + 142 + 172 = 703; 2 + 5 + 7 + 12 + 15 + 16 = 57; 2 2 + 52 + 72 + 122 + 152 + 162 = 703; 3 + 4 + 8 + 11 + 13 + 18 = 57; 3 2 + 42 + 82 + 112 + 132 + 182 = 703. Thus, in the new array, all row sums are equal and the sum of the squares of entries in each row are the same. Here k = 6 and we have added numbers from 7 to 18. 5. In a triangle ABC, let H be the orthocenter, and let D, E, F be the feet of altitudes from A, B, C to the opposite sides, respectively. Let L, M, N be midpoints of segments AH, EF, BC, respectively. Let X, Y be feet of altitudes from L, N on to the line DF . Prove that XM is perpendicular to M Y . Solution:Observe that AF H and HEA are right-angled triangles and L is the mid-point of AH. Hence LF = LA = LE. Similarly, considering the right triangles BF C and BEC, we get N F = N E. Since M is the mid-point of F E it follows that ∠LM F = ∠N M F = 90◦ and L, M, N are collinear. Since LY and N X are perpendiculars to XY , we conclude that Y F M L and F XN M are cyclic quadrilaterals. Thus ∠F LM = ∠F Y M, and ∠F XM = ∠F N M. 3 We also observe that CF B is a right triangle and N is the mid-point of BC. Hence N F = N C. We get ∠N F C = ∠N CF = 90 ◦ − ∠B. Similarly, LF = LA gives ∠LF A = ∠LAF = 90 ◦ − ∠B. We obtain ∠LF N = ∠LF C + ∠N F C = ∠LF C + 90 − ∠B = ∠LF C + ∠LF A = ∠AF C = 90 ◦. In triangles Y M X and LF N , we have ∠XY M = ∠F Y M = ∠F LM = ∠F LN, and ∠Y XM = ∠F XM = ∠F N M = ∠F N L. It follows that ∠Y M X = ∠LF N = 90 ◦. Therefore Y M ⊥ M X. 6. Suppose 91 distinct positive integers greater than 1 are given such that there are at least 456 pairs among them which are relatively prime. Show that one can ﬁnd four integers a, b, c, d among them such that gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(c, d) = gcd(d, a) = 1. Solution:Let the given integers be a1, a2, . . . , a91. Take a 91 × 91 grid and color the cell at (i, j) black if gcd(ai, aj) = 1. Then at least 2 × 456 = 912 cells are colored black. If di is the number of 4 black cells in the ith column, then ∑ di ≥ 912. Now, 91∑ 1 (di 2 ) ≥ 1 2   1 91 ( 91∑ i=1 di )2 − 91∑ i=1 di   = 1 2 × 91 ( 91∑ i=1 di ) ( 91∑ i=1 di − 91 ) ≥ 1 2 × 91 × 2 × 456 × (2 × 456 − 91) > (91 2 ) Since there are only (91 2 ) distinct pairs of columns, there must be at least one pair of rows (u, v) that occur with two distinct columns s, t. Thus (u, s), (u, t), (v, s) and (v, t) are all black. Thus if the integers corresponding to the columns u, v, s, t are a, c, b, d respectively, then gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, c) = gcd(c, d) = gcd(d, a) = 1. ———-0———- 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
