IMO team members will be given problems #3, 4, 5, and local students will be given problems #1, 2, 3. • When a student solves a problem, he/she should write it up and submit it to the graders. When the solution is considered correct (i.e., worthy of a 7), the student will be given a new problem. If the student has already received the last problem in the list, then no new problem will be given. • If the student’s solution contains a minor error, the error will be indicated and the student will be asked to correct it and resubmit the solution. • The time limit is 4.5 hours. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1. Let A be a subset of {1, 2, . . . , 2008}, such that for all x, y ∈ A with x ̸= y, the sum x + y is not divisible by 1004. Find, with proof, the maximum possible size of A. 2. Find, with proof, all real number solutions to the following: (a 2 + 1)(b2 + 1) = (ab + 1)(a + b). 3. Find all ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers such that 2x = 3 y + 7. 4. To clip a convex n-gon means to choose a pair of consecutive sides AB, BC and to replace them by the three segments AM , M N , and N C, where M is the midpoint of AB and N is the midpoint of BC. In other words, one cuts oﬀ the triangle M BN to obtain a convex (n + 1)-gon. A regular hexagon P6 of area 1 is clipped to obtain a heptagon P7. Then P7 is clipped (in one of the seven possible ways) to obtain an octagon P8, and so on. Prove that no matter how the clippings are done, the area of Pn is at least 1 2 , for all n ≥ 6. 5. Let n be a positive integer. Suppose that θ1, θ2, . . . , θn are angles with 0 < θi < π 2 for each i such that cos2 θ1 + cos2 θ2 + · · · + cos2 θn = 1. Prove that tan θ1 + tan θ2 + · · · + tan θn ≥ (n − 1)(cot θ1 + cot θ2 + · · · + cot θn). 6. Let AA1, BB1, CC1 be the altitudes of an acute triangle ABC. Let O be an arbitrary point inside A1B1C1. Denote the feet of the perpendiculars from O to the lines AA1 and BC by M and N , respectively; the ones from O to the lines BB1 and CA by P and Q, respectively; the ones from O to the lines CC1 and AB by R and S, respectively. Prove that the lines M N , P Q, and RS are concurrent. 7. Positive integers a and b are given such that 2a + 1 and 2b + 1 are relatively prime. Find all possible values of the greatest common divisor of 22a+1 + 2a+1 + 1 and 2 2b+1 + 2b+1 + 1. 8. Let X be a ﬁnite set, and suppose A1, . . . , Am and B1, . . . , Bm are subsets of X with |Ai| = r and |Bi| = s for each i, such that Ai ∩ Bi = ∅ for every i and Ai ∩ Bj ̸= ∅ whenever i ̸= j. Prove that m ≤ (r+s r ). 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
