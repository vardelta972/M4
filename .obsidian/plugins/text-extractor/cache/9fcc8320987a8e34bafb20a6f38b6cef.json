Problem 1. Do there exist square matrices A and B such that AB − BA = I? Solution. No. Take the trace of both sides and using tr(AB) = tr(BA), we get that tr(AB−BA) = 0 while tr(I) ̸= 0. □ 1. Introduction In this talk I’ll discuss some techniques on dealing with determinants that may be useful for the Putnam exam. We will focus on the evaluation and manipulation of determinants. I won’t talk about applications of determinants to, say, combinatorics (maybe another time). We will assume familiarity with basic properties of determinants. Just a reminder, if A = (aij)1≤i,j≤n is an n × n matrix, then det A = ∑ σ∈Sn sgn(σ)a1σ(1)a2σ(2) · · · anσ(n) where the sum is taken over all permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n}. Here’s an outline of techniques used to deal with determinants. Evaluation • Row and column operations • Expansion by minors • Setting variables / Vandermonde • Eigenvalues / circulant matrices Manipulation • Assume invertibility • Block decomposition • Conjugation and positivity 2. Evaluation of determinants I’ll talk about how to evaluate determinants when the entries are given. The most basic (and often extremely useful) method is row/column operations and minor expansions. Though I won’t discuss them here, since I want to talk more exciting techniques. The ﬁrst example is everyone’s favorite Vandermonde determinant. Problem 2 (Vandermond determinant). Let V =      1 x1 x2 1 · · · xn−1 1 1 x2 x2 2 · · · xn−1 2 ... ... ... . . . ... 1 xn x2 n · · · xn−1 n  | | |  . Show that det V = ∏ 1≤i<j≤n (xj − xi). 1 2 Solution. Let p(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = det V, viewed as a polynomial in n variables. Now, suppose we view p as a single-variable polynomial in x1 with coeﬃcients in Q(x2, . . . , xn). If we set x1 to xi, for any i ̸= 1, then two rows of the matrix are equal and hence the determinant vanishes, and therefore (x1 − xi) must be a factor of p. Similarly, every (xi−xj) for i ̸= j is a factor of p(x1, . . . , xn). But the degree of p is 1 2 n(n−1) (from looking at the matrix), and we just showed that ∏1≤i<j≤n(xj − xi) (which has degree 1 2 n(n − 1)) divides p. Therefore, p(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = k ∏ 1≤i<j≤n (xj − xi), for some constant k. Comparing the coeﬃcient of the term x2x2 3x3 4 · · · xn−1 n shows that k = 1. □ Our next example is the circulant matrix. Problem 3 (Circulant matrix). Let C =        a0 a1 a2 · · · an−1 an−1 a0 a1 · · · an−2 an−2 an−1 a0 · · · an−3 ... ... ... . . . ... a1 a2 a3 · · · a0  | | | | |  Then det C = n−1∏ j=0 ( n−1∑ k=0 ζ jkak ) where ζ = e2πi/n. Solution. We know that the determinant equals to the product of the eigenvalues. The eigenvectors of C are v0 =        1 1 1 ... 1        v1 =        1 ζ ζ 2 ... ζ n−1        v2 =        1 ζ 2 ζ 4 ... ζ 2(n−2)        · · · vn−1 =        1 ζ n−1 ζ 2(n−1) ... ζ (n−1)2        . They are independent because of the Vandermonde determinant, so they form a complete set of eigenvalues. The corresponding eigenvectors are λ0 = a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + an−1 λ1 = a0 + a1ζ + a2ζ 2 + · · · + an−1ζ n · · · λn−1 = a0 + a1ζ n−1 + a2ζ 2(n−1) + · · · + an−1ζ (n−1)2 Thus det C = λ0λ1 · · · λn−1. □ Now you have the tools to solves the following problem, which appeared as Putnam 1999/B5. The highest score on his problem was 2 points by one contestant! By this measure, it is one of the most diﬃcult Putnam problems in history; but knowing the above technique is becomes not so bad. Problem 4 (Putnam 1999/B5). Let n ≥ 3. Let A be the n×n matrix with Ajk = cos(2π(j +k)/n). Find det(I + A). 3 3. Manipulation of matrices Now I’ll discuss some techniques on dealing with determinants of matrices without knowing their entires. We will make repeated uses of the fact that det AB = det A det B for square matricies. Problem 5. Let A and B be n × n matrices. Show that det(I + AB) = det(I + BA). Solution. First, assume that A is invertible. Then det(I + AB) = det(A(I + BA)A−1) = det A det(I + BA) det(A−1) = det(I + BA). Now we give two ways of working around the assumption that A is invertible. Method 1. For any t ∈ R, let At = A − tI. Then At is non-invertible precisely when t is an eigenvalue of A. Thus, if t is not an eigenvalue, then det(I + AtB) = det(I + BAt). Now, det(I + AtB) − det(I + BAt) is a polynomial in t which vanishes everywhere except for the ﬁnitely many eigenvalues; hence det(I + AtB) − det(I + BAt) = 0 for all t. Setting t = 0 gives the result. Method 2. View the entries of A and B as indeterminants, so that what we are proving is a polynomial identity in {aij} ∪ {bij}. Work over the ﬁeld Q(a11, . . . , b11, . . . ). Then in this ﬁeld, A is invertible, and the proof works. □ Remark. The set of invertible matrices form a Zariski (dense) open subset, and hence to verify a polynomial identity, it suﬃces to verify it on this dense subset. Remark. The statement is also true when A and B are not square matrices. Speciﬁcally, suppose that A is an n × m matrix, and B an m × n matrix, then det(In + AB) = det(Im + BA). To prove this fact, extend A and B to square matrices by ﬁlling in zeros. The technique of assuming invertibility is very powerful. Let us give another example. Problem 6. Let A, B, C, D be n × n matrices such that AC = CA. Prove that det (A B C D ) = det(AD − CB). Solution. First assume that A is invertible. Then ( I O −CA−1 I ) (A B C D ) = (A B O D − CA−1B ) , so that det (A B C D ) = det (A B O D − CA−1B ) = det A det(D − CA −1B) = det(AD − ACA −1B) = det(AD − CB). (We used the fact that A and C commute.) Now we need to get rid of the invertibility assumption. Let At = A − tI. Since AC = CA, we get AtC = CAt for all t. It follows that det ( At B C D ) = det(AtD − CB). whenever t is not an eigenvalue of A. But this is a polynomial equation in t, which holds for all but ﬁnitely many t’s, and hence it must hold for all t. In particular, setting t = 0 gives the desired result. □ Finally, let us look at a few problems involving inequalities. Problem 7. Let A be a square matrix with real entries. Show that det(A2 + I) ≥ 0. 4 One way to solve this problem is to look at the eigenvalues of A. If the eigenvalues of A are {λi} (as a multiset, i.e., counting multiplicities), then the eigenvalues of A2 + I are {λ2 i + 1}, and hence det(A2 + 1) = ∏i(λ2 i + 1). Finally use the fact that all non-real eigenvalues λi come in conjugate pairs. Here is a much slicker solution. Proof. We have A2 + I = (A + iI)(A − iI). So det(A2 + I) = det(A + iI) det(A − iI) = det(A + iI)det(A + iI) = |det(A + iI)| 2 ≥ 0. □ Problem 8. Let A, B, C be n × n real matrices that pairwise commute and ABC = O. Show that det(A3 + B3 + C3) det(A + B + C) ≥ 0. Solution. Recall the identity A3 + B3 + C3 − 3ABC = (A + B + C)(A + ωB + ω2C)(A + ω2B + ωC) where ω = e2π/3 is a third root of unity. We used the assumption that A, B, C pairwise commute. Hence, det(A3 + B3 + C3) det(A + B + C) = det(A3 + B3 + C3 − 3ABC) det(A + B + C) = (det(A + B + C)) 2 det(A + ωB + ω2C) det(A + ω2B + ωC) = (det(A + B + C)) 2 det(A + ωB + ω2C)det(A + ωB + ω2C) ≥ 0. □ Problem 9. Let A and B be two n × n real matrices that commute. Suppose that det(A + B) ≥ 0. Prove that det(Ak + Bk) ≥ 0 for all k ≥ 1 Problem 10. Let A be real skew-symmetric square matrix (i.e., At = −A). Prove that det(I + tA2) ≥ 0 for all real t.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
