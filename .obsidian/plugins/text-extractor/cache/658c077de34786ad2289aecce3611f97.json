The vertices of a regular 2012-gon are labelled with the numbers 1 through 2012 in some order. Call a vertex a peak if its label is larger than the label of its two neighbours, and a valley if its label is smaller than the label of its two neighbours. Show that the total number of peaks is equal to the total number of valleys. Solution: Call a vertex extreme if it is either a peak or a valley. Note that the vertex labelled 1 must be a valley. Reading clockwise from that vertex, the next extreme vertex encountered must be a peak, and carrying on paying attention only to extreme vertices, peaks and valleys must alternate. So each valley can be paired with the next peak in clockwise order, and the number of each type must be the same. Alternate inductive solution. We will prove by induction that the total number of peaks equals the total number of valleys for any labelling of the vertices of a regular n-gon by the numbers 1 to n. For the base case, consider n = 3. There is essentially only one labelling, and for this labelling there is one peak (the number 3), and one valley (the number 1). So the assertion is true for n = 3. Now suppose that the assertion is true for labellings of a regular n-gon, and consider a labelling of a regular (n + 1)-gon. If we remove the vertex labelled n + 1 we may regard what is left as a labelling of an n-gon, for which the number of peaks equals the number of valleys, by our inductive hypothesis. We now consider what happens when n + 1 is re-inserted, necessarily becoming a peak. Suppose its neighbours are a and b, and suppose further without loss of generality that a < b. Since n + 1 > a also, there is no change to whether a is a peak or a valley. Consider then the number c on the other side of b. If c < b then b was a peak; after n + 1 is inserted it is no longer a peak or a valley, but n + 1 is a peak in its place, so there is no net change to the number of peaks or valleys. On the other hand, if c > b, then b was neither a peak nor a valley, but becomes a valley when n + 1 is inserted, balancing the creation of the new peak at n + 1. So in this case the number of peaks and valleys remains equal also. The result follows by induction. Alternate approach. Another promising approach is to start from the consecutive labelling 1, 2, . . . , 2012, which has one peak and one valley, and consider how the number of peaks and valleys changes as small changes are made to this labelling (for example, if two adja- cent numbers are swapped). Generally speaking solutions that took this approach didn’t consider enough cases to be able to rearrange the consecutive labelling to an arbitrary labelling, which is what is needed to solve the problem in this way. the fractional part of this is x 3, 3x 2 + 3x + 1 must be an integer, and so 3x 2 + 3x must be an integer. The maximum integer value of 3x 2 + 3x for x < 1 is 5 so we simply solve: 3x 2 + 3x − k = 0 for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, giving the values: x = −3 + √ S3. Two courier companies oﬀer services in the country of Old Aland. For any two towns, at least one of the companies oﬀers a direct link in both directions between them. Addi- tionally, each company is willing to chain together deliveries (so if they oﬀer a direct link from A to B, and B to C, and C to D for instance, they will deliver from A to D.) Show that at least one of the two companies must be able to deliver packages between any two towns in Old Aland. Solution: Let A be one of the towns, and suppose that the ﬁrst company cannot deliver between A and some other town in Old Aland. Let S be the set of towns that the ﬁrst company can reach from A, and T be the remaining towns. Then both S and T are non-empty and the direct link between any town in S and any town in T must only be provided by the second company. Therefore, the second company can deliver between any two towns (directly if one is in S and the other in T , or at worst via a single relay through the opposite set if both belong to S or both belong to T ). Note that we’ve actually proved a stronger result: either both companies can deliver ev- erywhere, or one of them can deliver between any two towns with at most one intermediate stop. Alternate inductive solution. If there are only two towns in Old Aland, then by the conditions of the problem one of the companies must oﬀer a direct link between these two towns, and so this company can deliver between any two towns in Old Aland. Suppose then that the result is true for any collection of n towns, and consider a network of n + 1 towns. Ignoring the (n + 1)th town for the moment, one of the companies — the ﬁrst, say — must be able to deliver between any two of the remaining n towns. If the ﬁrst company also oﬀers a direct link between any one of these towns and the (n + 1)th, then the ﬁrst company is able to deliver between any two of the towns and we are done. Otherwise, only the second company oﬀers direct links to the (n + 1)th town. But then every town has a direct link to the (n + 1)th town by the second company, so the second company is able to deliver between any two towns in Old Aland, and we are again done. Chris begins by removing any black counter, and sliding a white counter from an adjacent square onto the empty square. From that point on, the players take turns. Michael slides a black counter onto an adjacent empty square, and Chris does the same with white counters (no more counters are removed). If a player has no legal move, then he loses. (a) Show that, even if Chris and Michael play cooperatively, the game will come to an end. (b) Which player has a winning strategy? Solution: Imagine that the board is coloured, with the squares initially containing black counters coloured black, and those with white counters, white. At Chris’s turn to slide a counter it is always a black square that is vacant. Likewise at Michael’s turn it is always a white square. So Chris can only ever move white counters oﬀ white squares and onto black ones, while Michael can only ever move black counters oﬀ black squares onto white ones. In particular, once a counter is moved, it can never be moved again. Since there are only 12 white, and 12 black counters in play, the game must end. Michael has a winning strategy. When Chris ﬁrst chooses a counter to remove, Michael should imagine the rest of board tiled with 2 × 1 rectangles (or dominoes) – it’s easy to see that this is always possible. Now whenever Chris makes a slide move, Michael takes the other counter from the corresponding domino and moves it into the position which has just been vacated. This guarantees that Michael will always have a move available and since we know that the game ends, it must be Chris who loses. and noting pγ is not a divisor of γ but is of c we conclude that pγ is not a divisor of b, that is β < γ. This is true for all primes, so b is a divisor of c. Moreover, in the equation above, every term except possibly γ is now divisible by b, so γ must be as well. That means c = db for some positive integer d ≥ 2.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
