The notation “f (n)(x)” (where there are n f ’s) is the nth iteration of f . Another version of the same idea is a recursive sequence expressing an+1 in terms of an, such as an+1 = 2an + 1. To see why these are the same, let x = a0. Then f (x) = a1, f (2)(x) = a2, and so on. This lecture covers techniques on how to ﬁnd the nth iteration of a function or the general term of a recursive sequence. Below are three basic functions that we know how to handle: f (x) = x + k ⇒ f (n)(x) = x + nk f (x) = kx ⇒ f (n)(x) = knx f (x) = xk ⇒ f (n)(x) = xkn And some more to keep in mind: an = an−1 + kn ⇒ an = a0 + k( n(n + 1) 2 ) an = an−1 + kn 2 ⇒ an = a0 + k( n(n + 1)(2n + 1) 6 ) an = an−1 + kn3 ⇒ an = a0 + k( n(n + 1) 2 )2 0 Telescoping Like yesterday’s NYCIML! 1 Finding bn (or g(x)) The idea is that if we can ﬁnd a series bn, such that we can easily convert between an and bn, and we know how to ﬁnd the general term bn, then we have a way to ﬁnd an. This will make a lot more sense with examples. 1.1 Example Given that an+1 = a 2 n + 2an for all integers n ≥ 0, if a0 = 4, ﬁnd a150. Solution: The right side reminds us of perfect squares. Adding one to both sides yields an+1 + 1 = a 2 n + 2an + 1 = (an + 1) 2. Making the substitution bn = an + 1, we have bn+1 = b2 n, so bn = b2 n 0 . Converting back from bn to an, we have an + 1 = (a0 + 1)2 n ⇒ an = (a0 + 1)2 n − 1 ⇒ a150 = 5 2150 − 1. 1 1.2 The Common an+1 = can + d Linear relations are easy to transform by adding a constant λ to both sides of the equation: an+1 + λ = c(an + d+λ c ). If we could ﬁnd a λ so that λ = d+λ c , then the equation would look like the second of the three basic functions. Solving for λ, we get λ = d c−1 . Replacing λ, we then have (an+1 + d c−1 ) = c(an + d c−1 ), and letting bn = (an + d c−1 ), we have bn+1 = cbn. From the second basic equation, we then have bn = cnb0. Replacing bn we have an + d c − 1 = c n(a0 + d c − 1 ) an = c n(a0 + d c − 1 ) − d c − 1 . Example: (HMMT2013) Values a1, a2, ...a2013 are chosen independently and at random from the set {1, 2, ..., 2013}. What is the expected number of distinct values in the set {a1, a2, ..., a2013}? 2 Linear Recurrences and Characteristic Equations The recurrence relation an = c1an−1+c2an−2+· · ·+cdan−d has the general term an = k1rn 1 +k2rn 2 +· · ·+kdrn d , where r1, r2, ..., rd are the distinct roots of the characteristic polynomial f (x) = xd−c1xd−1−c2xd−2−· · ·−cd, and k1, ..., kd are constants. (Note that if the roots of the characteristic polynomial are not distinct then the form changes slightly.) Example: (AoPS) Let there be a sequence {an} with initial values a0 = 0, a1 = 38, a2 = −90 given by the recurrence relation an+1 = 19an−1 − 30an−2 for n ≥ 2. Prove that a2010 is divisible by 2011. 3 Other Tips 1. Ranges are helpful. If, for instance, a problem states that the function only applies for values of x between -1 and 1, think sine or cosine! Example: Let an+1 = 4an(1 − an), 0 ≤ an ≤ 1 for all an. Find the general term an if a0 = 1 4 . Solution: The given range perfectly allows for the substitution an = sin2(bn). Substituting, we get sin 2(bn+1) = 4 sin2(bn)(1 − sin 2(bn)) = 4 sin2(bn) cos 2(bn) = sin 2(2bn), so bn+1 = 2bn. That means that bn = 2nb0, and it follows that an = sin2(bn) = sin 2(2nb0) = sin 2(2n arcsin(√a0)). The last step comes from the fact that an = sin 2(bn) implies bn = arcsin( √an). Substituting in the fact that a0 = 1 4 , we then have an = sin 2( 2 nπ 6 ) = sin 2( 2 n−1π 3 ). 2. List out the ﬁrst few terms of a sequence if you don’t know what to do; easy problems will usually reveal a pattern. 4 Problems 1. Five monkeys discover a pile of peaches by a lake. They agree to divide the pile evenly the next day. The next morning, the ﬁrst monkey comes and tries to split the pile into ﬁve equal parts, but fails because there’s one left over. His solution is to toss one peach into the lake, and then takes one pile (1/5 of what’s left) and leaves. The second monkey comes, but doesn’t know the ﬁrst one already took his share, so he tries splitting the pile into ﬁfths, but ends up with one left over. He tosses a peach into the lake, takes his share, and leaves. The third, fourth, and ﬁfth monkeys all have the same problem and do the same thing. What is the least number of peaches that could’ve been in the original pile? 2 2. Let f (x) = 19x + 89. Find the ones digit of f (100)(5). 3. Given that f (x) = 2x2 + 2x for − 1 2 ≤ x, ﬁnd f (n)(x). 4. If a0 = 1 and an+1 = (n + 1)an + (n + 2)! for n ≥ 0, ﬁnd an. 5. Let f (x) = x−3 x+1 for x ̸= ±1. Find f (27)(x). 6. Find the general term Fn of the Fibonacci sequence deﬁned by F0 = F1 = 1 and Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2 for n ≥ 2. 7. Given that an+1 = 2a 2 n − 1 and -1 ≤ an ≤ 1 for all an, ﬁnd the general term an. 8. Let f (x) = √2 + x, -2 ≤ x ≤ 2. Find f (n)(x). (Hint: Half angle formula! Also, the range being from -2 to 2 instead of -1 to 1 means something...) 9. Find f (n)(x) for f (x) as deﬁned in Question 6, but for the domain x > 2. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
