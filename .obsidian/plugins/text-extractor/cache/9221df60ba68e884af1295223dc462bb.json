Levin \u0003 November 23, 2002 Descartes' Rule of Signs states that the number of positive roots of a polynomial p(x) with real coe\u000ecients does not exceed the number of sign changes of the nonzero coe\u000ecients of p(x). More precisely, the number of sign changes minus the number of positive roots is a multiple of two. Back in high school, I was introduced to Descartes' Rule of Signs as a mysterious, almost magical, aid in polynomial root \fnding and factoring| an otherwise tedious occupation when computers were unheard of in the classroom. Even today Descartes' Rule continues to be of interest to both mathematicians and computer scientists [2]. Descartes' Rule is plausible when we consider that each power of x dom- inates in a di\u000berent region of x> 0. When x is very large, then the highest power of x in p(x), say x n, dominates and the sign of p(x)is thatof the leading coe\u000ecient pn.When x is very small, then the lowest power of x, typically x 0, rules. As we move along from the origin, each successive power of x comes into play. If the sign of the coe\u000ecient of the new power of x does not change, then the function continues the trend set by the previous power, trending towards negative values if the coe\u000ecient is negative or positive val- ues if the coe\u000ecient is positive. If there is to be a zero crossing, then there needs to be a sign change. If there is a sign change but there isn't a zero crossing, then we must have turned away from the x axis due to another sign change and will need to switch signs again to head back towards the x axis. This explains why signs need to be dropped in pairs when counting roots. A Simple Example | Three Terms A concrete example helps illustrate these ideas nicely: Lemma 1 For arbitrary powers n> m > 0, examples of polynomials of the form 1 − ax m + bx n with real coe\u000ecients having 0, 1, or 2 positive roots are given by the following table 1 has at least two positive roots, one less than 1 and one greater than 1. To see that there are no more than two roots, let y = x m. Then the equation becomes by n exposition I reacquaint the mathematical public with the proof by elemen- tary means \frst presented by the Prince of Mathematicians, Carl Friedrich Gauss [6]. I believe the following development is very clean and accessible, capturing the essence of Gauss' insight without obscuring it in unnecessary formalism 4. I then enhance Gauss' proof with the addition of parity as noted in Dickson [4, x67] or Albert [1]. Finally I resolve some questions about Descartes' Rule left open in a recent Monthly article [2]. Although the actual proof of Descartes' Rule is brief|Lemma 2 and The- orem 2 cover less than a page|it is instructive to warm up to some special cases, starting with all positive or all negative roots. Remark 1 We may take the leading coe\u000ecient pn of p(x) to be unity without loss of generality. Multiplying or dividing p(x) by any nonzero real number a\u000bects neither the location and number of sign changes in its coe\u000ecients nor the location and number of its roots. We will continue to employ the symbol pn when it will simplify notation. Remark 2 We can safely assume the constant term p0 is nonzero, i.e. the polynomial has no zero roots. Removing any common factors of x does not change the number of positive (or negative) roots, just the number of zero roots. Proposition 1 If all the coe\u000ecients of p(x) are positive, then p(x) has no positive roots. Proof. If all the coe\u000ecients are positive, p(x)isa sumofpositiveterms for any x> 0 and so cannot equal zero there. Proposition 2 If a polynomial p(x) of degree n has n positive roots, then its coe\u000ecients are all nonzero and the signs of the coe\u000ecients of p(x) alternate. Proof. We proceed by induction on n.For n = 0 there are no roots and no sign changes. For n = 1, there is one sign alternation and the coe\u000ecients of p1x − p0 are nonzero. Suppose now that n> 1 and the proposition holds for polynomials of degree up to n − 1 and consider a polynomial of degree n having n positive roots. By induction it may be written as the product (x − \u000b) n−1X j=0(−1)n−1−jpjx j with \u000b and all pj positive. Expanding, we get (−1)n\u000bp0 + n−1X j=1[(−1)n−j\u000bpj +(−1)n−j−2pj−1]x j + pn−1x n =(−1)n\u000bp0 + n−1X j=1(−1)n−j(\u000bpj + pj−1)x j + pn−1x n which also has nonzero coe\u000ecients with alternating signs. Proof. We zero out all but the \frst of the leading k nonnegative coe\u000ecients and replace all following coe\u000ecients with −G.Then for x> 1we have p(x) \u0015 pnx n − G n−kX j=0 x j >pnx k−1(x n−k+1 − 1) − Gx n−k+1 − 1 Using an argument from the days before calculus was invented, we now show that there is exactly one positive root if there is one sign change 8.We start with a simple observation about the function Pk−1 j=0 x j : Observation 1 Let ˚0(x)=0, ˚k(x)= ˚k−1(x)+x k−1 for k =1, . . . . Then ˚k(x) satis\fes the three relations: \u000f ˚k(1) = k, \u000f ˚k(y) \u0015 ˚k(x) for y \u0015 x \u0015 1, and \u000f ˚m(x) \u0015 ˚k(x) for m \u0015 k when x \u0015 0. Proposition 4 If there is one sign change in the coe\u000ecients of p(x), then it has exactly one positive root. Proof. By Proposition 3, there is at least one positive root. Let \u000b> 0 be the smallest and form the polynomial ^p(x)= \u000b −np(\u000bx). The coe\u000ecients of this new polynomial have the same signs as the original and the smallest positive root is shifted to x = 1. We now show that ^p is positive for x> 1 and that x = 1 is a simple root. Splitting the positive and negative terms out, we write ^p(x)= q(x)−r(x), where the coe\u000ecients of q and r are nonnegative, and let k be as in Theorem 1 so that q has k coe\u000ecients. Factoring we have ^p(x)= ^p(x) − ^p(1) = nX j=n−k+1 qj(x j − 1) − n−kX j=0 rj(x j − 1) =(x − 1) 2 4 nX j=n−k+1 qj˚j(x) − n−kX j=0 rj˚j(x) 3 5 =(x − 1)s(x). Note that the j = 0 term in the second term is identically zero. Writing 0= r0 − r0, we now show that s(x) is positive for x \u0015 1, and thus x =1 is a simple root and ^p(x) is positive for x> 1. s(x) \u0015 ˚n−k+1(x) 2 4r0 + nX j=n−k+1 qj − n−kX j=0 rj 3 5 \u0015 ˚n−k+1(1) [r0 +^p(1)] =(n − k +1) \u0001 r0 > 0. We conclude therefore that ^p(x) and hence p(x) has exactly one positive root. and hence opposite to that of pjm. Therefore p(x) has at least m +1 sign changes. 9 which says that di\u000berence in the number of sign changes in the whole sequence and the number of sign changes (i.e. 0 or 1) in the subsequence s0 sn is even. \u000f A sign change between powers of x separated by an odd number of missing terms. Corollary 7 The number of negative roots of p(x) does not exceed the num- ber of sign series separated by an even number of missing terms added to the number of sign changes separated by an odd number of missing terms in p(x). Furthermore, the di\u000berence is an even number. Corollary 8 The number of complex roots 10 of p(x) exceeds by a nonnegative even integer the number of missing terms plus the number of sign series separated by an odd number of terms less the number of sign changes separated by an odd number of missing terms. The proof of this last corollary, also from Gauss [6], is left to the reader. Going the Other Way Quite recently this Monthly [2] addressed the question of whether given any particular sign sequence all positive root combinations allowed by Descartes' Rule were possible. With the stipulation that all coe\u000ecients be nonzero, the answer given was yes. Left open was the question of whether their theorem holds in the presence of missing terms. Grabiner [7] proves that the extension to missing coe\u000ecients is possible by a very pretty direct construction of such polynomials 11. In this section, we will shortly develop, and later generalize, an elementary inductive proof of this extension, \frst tackling the easier question of whether given any particular list of powers of x there are examples of polynomials with those nonzero terms that have any given numbers of positive roots and sign changes allowable by Theorem 3. We can show this is the case using our original simple three term constructions: Theorem 4 Given any speci\fed sequence of exponents 0= m0 <m1 < ::: < mn, there exist polynomials p0x m0 + p1x m1 ::: + pnx mn whose number of positive roots equals the upper bound given by Descartes' Rule of Signs. Furthermore there also exist such polynomials having a (nonnegative) number of positive roots di\u000bering from this upper bound by every possible multiple of two. Proof. We proceed by induction and show how to construct suitable exam- ples featuring only simple (or no) positive roots. The \frst problem here is to \fgure out what to induct on. The degree of the polynomial? The number of nonzero coe\u000ecients? The trick is to induct on the number of sign changes, N\u0014 n, and, because of parity, to work even and odd numbers separately. For N =0and N = 1 the result follows immediately from Propositions 1 and 4. Suppose now that the theorem holds for N = k − 2 \u0014 n − 2. We now construct polynomials with the desired n nonzero coe\u000ecients having k sign changes and either 0 or 2 additional roots. By hypothesis, there is a polynomial q(x)= n−2X j=0 qjx mn−2−mj having k − 2 sign changes and n − 1 nonzero coe\u000ecients, where we may take the constant term qn−2 to have the value 1. We now write the polynomial p(x)= bx mn − ax mn−1 + x mn−2q \u0012 \u000b arguments. Appendix A contains elementary machinery to \fll in the details without calculus.) Lemma 5 The coe\u000ecients of a polynomial with exactly two sign changes can be modi\fed without changing its coe\u000ecient signs to produce two other polynomials, one with zero and the other with two positive roots. Proof. Taking the leading coe\u000ecient to be 1 as before, write the given polynomial p(x)as p(x)= x nq(x) − x mr(x)+ s(x) where the coe\u000ecients of q, r and s are positive and n and m are the appro- priate positive integers. We note (c.f. Corollary 3 and 4) that p(x) is positive for all su\u000eciently small and all su\u000eciently large positive x.Choose any two arbitrary positive values x1 <x2.Then min x1\u0014x\u0014x2[x nq(x)+ s(x)] = x n 1 q(x1)+ s(x1), and max x1\u0014x\u0014x2[x nq(x)+ s(x)] = x n 2 q(x2)+ s(x2). We now construct the polynomial x nq(x) − γx mr(x)+ s(x) and adjust the parameter γ> 0 to ensure either 0 or 2 roots respectively. Since min x1\u0014x\u0014x2[x mr(x)] = x m 1 r(x1), and max x1\u0014x\u0014x2[x mr(x)] = x m 2 r(x2), the ratio of x nq(x)+ s(x)to x mr(x)satis\fes min x1\u0014x\u0014x2 x nq(x)+ s(x) meet our need. If p originally had 2 positive roots, then let x1 and x2 be their locations. Using choice a) above for γ shifts p upwards everywhere in x> 0 and makes it also now positive in x1 \u0014 x \u0014 x2, eliminating the two roots. On the other hand, if p originally had no positive roots, choose any convenient x1 and x2 and choice b) above for γ shifts p downwards everywhere in x> 0 and makes both p(x1)and p(x2) negative, ensuring p has two positive roots. can be made to have either zero or two positive roots simply by adjusting γ> 0 appropriately. Thus, using Lemma 4, we may construct a polynomial ^p(x)= x k1q(x) − γx k2r(x)+ x k^s \u0012\u000b Corollary 6 guarantees that any such example must have exactly 0 or 1 positive root respectively. Therefore the theorem is true for these initial cases. Having established these initial cases, following the induction on the num- ber of sign changes from k − 2 ! k in Theorem 4 is clear sailing. By adding two consecutive leading sign changes, with 0 or 2 accompanying positive roots, Proposition 7 guarantees we add no further sign changes to p(−x)and hence introduce no new possible combinations of the numbers of signs and negative roots. Thus we can construct a polynomial with N = k sign changes and which has any allowable numbers of positive and negative roots. [9] Laguerre, E.

Theorem A If the product of n positive numbers equals 1 their sum is not less than n. Furthermore equality holds only when all the numbers are equal to 1. Proof. We proceed by induction. The case n = 1 is immediate. Suppose now that it holds for all n \u0014 k and consider the product of k +1 positive numbers 12 x1x2 ::: xkxk+1 =1 : Two cases may arise: \u000f All the numbers are identical, i.e. x1 = x2 = ::: = xk = xk+1 ,or \u000f Some factors are di\u000berent. In the \frst case all the terms are equal to 1 and their sum is k +1. In the second case at least one of the terms is less than 1 and one greater than 1. After suitable renumbering, we may suppose that x1 < 1and xk+1 > 1. Putting y1 = x1xk+1 we have y1x2 ::: xk =1 : By our induction hypothesis, we have y1 + x2 + ::: + xk \u0015 k: But x1 + x2 + ::: + xk + xk+1 =(y1 + x2 + ::: + xk)+ xk+1 − y1 + x1 \u0015 (k +1)+ xk+1 − y1 + x1 − 1 =(k +1)+(xk+1 − 1)(1 − x1) ; remembering that y1 = x1xk+1.As x1 < 1and xk+1 > 1, the product (xk+1 − 1)(1 − x1) is positive and so x1 + x2 + ::: + xk + xk+1 >k +1 ; proving Theorem A. Proof. Write \u000b = mwe have z1 + z2 = \u0015(d1 − 1) + (1 − \u0015)(d2 − 1) = 0 : Invoking Theorem C, we can write R >\u0015(1 + \u000bz1 where \u000b = n","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
