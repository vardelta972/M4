Answer: 250 3 Solution: This integral is equal to ∫ 5 −5 x + x 2 + x 3 dx = ∫ 5 −5 x 2 dx = ( 53 3 − (−5)3 3 ) = 250 3 . 2. Find the maximum value of ∫ 3π/2 −π/2 sin(x)f (x) dx subject to the constraint |f (x)| ≤ 5. Answer: 20 Solution: Clearly we want to maximize f (x) when sin (x) ≥ 0 and minimize f (x) when sin (x) < 0. We do this by setting f (x) = 5 in the ﬁrst case and f (x) = −5 in the second case. Noting that the bounds of integration cover precisely one full period of sin, we see that the integral becomes equivalent to twice the integral of 5 sin (x) over the half period where sin (x) ≥ 0. This results in 20 . 3. Calculate ∫ 35 25 1 x − x3/5 dx. Answer: 5 2 ln 8 3 Solution: Note that we can write the integral as ∫ 35 25 1 x3/5(x2/5 − 1) dx. We solve via u-substitution. Let u = x2/5 − 1: du = 2 5 x −3/5 dx =⇒ dx = 5 2 x 3/5 du. The integral becomes 5 2 ∫ 32−1 22−1 x3/5 x3/5 · u du = 5 2 ∫ 8 3 1 u du, which evaluates to 5 2 (ln 8 − ln 3) = 5 2 ln 8 3 . 4. Compute the x-coordinate of the point on the curve y = √x that is closest to the point (2, 1). Answer: 2+ √ 3 2 Solution: We want to minimize the distance between the points (a2, a) and (2, 1). We can equivalently minimize the square of the distance between those two points, which is (2 − a 2) 2 + (1 − a) 2 = a 4 − 3a 2 − 2a + 5. SMT 2012 Calculus Test and Solutions February 18, 2012 The derivative of this function is 4a3 −6a−2, which can be factored as 2(a+1)(2a2 −2a−1). The roots of this cubic are therefore a = −1, 1 ± √3 2 . Two of the roots are negative and therefore invalid, so a = 1 + √3 2 and a2 = 2 + √3 2 . 5. Let f (x) = x + x2 2 + x3 3 + x4 4 + x5 5 , and set g(x) = f −1(x). Compute g(3)(0). Answer: 1 Solution 1: The inverse function rule tells us that g′(x) = [ f ′(g(x)) ]−1 . Using this and the fact that g(0) is clearly equal to zero, this problem can be solved with a straightforward bash. Solution 2: We begin by observing that we know by the inverse function rule that we will not need to know any derivatives of f past its third derivative. Since the ﬁrst three derivatives of f at zero agree with those of the function − log (1 − x) (by Taylor series expansion), we can assume f (x) = − log (1 − x). Now, y = − log (1 − x) =⇒ −y = log (1 − x) =⇒ e −y = 1 − x =⇒ x = 1 − e −y so g(y) = 1 − e−y and therefore g(3)(0) = e−0 = 1 . 6. Compute lim x→0 ( sin x x ) 1 1−cos x . Answer: e−1/3 Solution 1: We take logs and evaluate by L’Hopital’s rule: lim x→0 log [( sin x x ) 1 1−cos x ] = lim x→0 log(sin x) − log x 1 − cos x = lim x→0 cos x sin x − 1 x sin x = lim x→0 x cos x − sin x x sin 2 x = lim x→0 −x sin x sin 2 x + 2x sin x cos x = lim x→0 −x sin x + 2x cos x = lim x→0 −1 cos x + 2 cos x − 2x sin x = − 1 3 . Therefore, the answer is e−1/3. Solution 2: We can approximate sin x and cos x by their Taylor series. Applying substitutions then yields lim x→0 ( sin x x ) 1 1−cos x = lim x→0 (1 − x2 6 ) 2 x2 = lim x→0 (1 + x2 6 )− 2 x2 = lim x→∞ (1 + 1 6x2 )−2x2 = lim x→∞ (1 + 1 x )−x/3 = e −1/3 because e = limx→∞(1 + 1 x )x.

Answer: 12x2 − 24x + 26 − 26e−x Solution: First diﬀerentiate the equation with respect to x: g(x) + ∫ x 0 g(t) dt = 4x 3 + 2x. Diﬀerentiate again to obtain g′(x) + g(x) = 12x 2 + 2. The solution 12x2 − 24x + 26 can be found using the method of undetermined coeﬃcients, so the general solution will be g(x) = 12x 2 − 24x + 26 + Ce −x for some constant C. By substituting x = 0 into the ﬁrst equation, we see that g(0) = 0. We therefore ﬁnd that C = −26, making the answer 12x 2 − 24x + 26 − 26e −x . 8. Compute ∫ ∞ 0 ln x x2 + 4 dx. Answer: π ln 2 4 Solution: Substitute x = 2 tan θ to get ∫ ∞ 0 ln x x2 + 4 dx = 1 2 ∫ π/2 0 ln(2 tan θ) dθ = 1 2 · π 2 ln 2 + 1 2 ∫ π/2 0 ln(tan θ) dθ. We will now show that this ﬁnal integral is zero by substituting u = π/2 − θ to yield ∫ π/2 0 ln(tan θ) dθ = ∫ π/2 0 ln (tan ( π 2 − θ)) dθ = ∫ π/2 0 ln ( 1 tan θ ) dθ = − ∫ π/2 0 ln(tan θ) dθ, which gives us what we wanted, so the answer is therefore π ln 2 4 . 9. Find the ordered pair (α, β) with non-inﬁnite β ̸= 0 such that lim n→∞ n2√1!2! · · · n! nα = β holds. Answer: (1/2, e−3/4) Solution 1: Taking the logarithm of 1!2! · · · n!, we ﬁnd ln(1!2! · · · n!) = ln 1 + (ln 1 + ln 2) + (ln 1 + ln 2 + ln 3) + · · · = n ln 1 + (n − 1) ln 2 + · · · + ln n = n ln 1 n + (n − 1) ln 2 n + · · · + ln n n + n(n + 1) 2 ln n. SMT 2012 Calculus Test and Solutions February 18, 2012 Dividing this by n2, we have ln( n2√1!2! · · · n!) = n + 1 2n ln n + 1 n ( n∑ m=1 n + 1 − m n ln m n ) As n goes to inﬁnity, the sum will converge to the integral ∫ 1 0 (1 − x) ln x dx = [ 1 4 x 2 − 1 2 x 2 ln x − x + x ln x ]1 0 = − 3 4 and the ﬁrst term will approach 1 2 ln n, so if we subtract 1 2 ln n then this expression will converge to − 3 4 . Finally, by raising e to the power of each side, we have lim n→∞ n2√1!2! · · · n! n1/2 = e −3/4 . Solution 2: We take logs and approximate by Stirling’s approximation1. Here, we will be some- what sloppy with our approximations, and freely use ∼ to indicate approximations that become irrelevant in the limit. All of these calculations can be made rigorous, and such justiﬁcation is left as an exercise to the reader. Stirling’s approximation says that log(n!) ∼ n log n − n. Using this, we have log ( n2√1!2! · · · n! nα ) = 1 n2 log(1!2! · · · n!) − α log n = 1 n2 n∑ k=1 log(k!) − α log n ∼ 1 n2 n∑ k=1(k log k − k) − α log n = 1 n2 n∑ k=1(k log k) − 1 n2 n(n + 1) 2 − α log n Approximate n(n+1) 2 ∼ n2 2 and approximate the inﬁnite sum by an integral (and integrate by parts): ∼ 1 n2 ∫ n 1 x log x dx − 1 2 − α log n = 1 n2 ( n2 2 log n − n2 4 + 1 4 ) − 1 2 − α log n ∼ 1 2 log n − 3 4 − α log n. Therefore, lim n→∞ log ( n2√1!2! · · · n! nα ) = lim n→∞ [( 1 2 − α) log n − 3 4 ] , which is ﬁnite only when 1 2 − α = 0, in which case α = 1 2 and the limit evaluates to − 3 4 . Therefore, we wish to compute lim n→∞ n2√1!2! · · · n! n1/2 = exp [ lim n→∞ log ( n2√1!2! · · · n! nα )] = e −3/4 . 1http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling’s approximation SMT 2012 Calculus Test and Solutions February 18, 2012 10. Find the maximum of ∫ 1 0 f (x) 3 dx given the constraints −1 ≤ f (x) ≤ 1, ∫ 1 0 f (x) dx = 0. Answer: 1/4 Solution 1: Consider the expression ∫ 1 0 (f (x) − 1) (f (x) + 1 2 )2 dx. Since f (x) ≤ 1 this expression is less than or equal to 0. Meanwhile, expanding the integrand gives (f (x) − 1) (f (x) + 1 2 )2 = f (x) 3 − 3 4 f (x) − 1 4 , so its integral is ∫ 1 0 (f (x) − 1) (f (x) − 1 2 )2 dx = ∫ 1 0 f (x) 3 dx − 3 4 ∫ 1 0 f (x) dx − 1 4 ∫ 1 0 dx = ∫ 1 0 f (x) 3 dx − 1 4 , proving that the answer is at most 1/4. This expression is zero when f (x) = 1 or f (x) = −1/2, so 1/4 is indeed the maximum value. Solution 2: Let f+ and f− denote the positive and negative part of f respectively. Deﬁne A+ = {f > 0} and A− = {f < 0}. Then f+ and f− are nonzero only on A+ and A−. Also the condition on f means 0 ≤ f+(x), f−(x) ≤ 1, ∫ 1 0 f+(x) dx = ∫ 1 0 f−(x) dx = s. We will ﬁx s and try to optimize the value ∫ f 3 = ∫ f 3 + − ∫ f 3 −. For the maximum of ∫ f 3 +, we have the inequality f+(x)3 ≤ f+(x), and integrating it gives ∫ 1 0 f+(x) 3 dx ≤ ∫ 1 0 f+(x) dx = s. Equality holds when f+(x) is either 0 or 1 for all x. For the minimum of ∫ f 3 −, we claim that the minimum occurs when f− is constant on A−. From the inequality a3 + b3 2 ≥ ( a + b 2 )3 for 1 > a, b > 0, we speculate that the minimum is achieved when the values of f− are distributed as close as possible. Then if we denote the length of A− to be l, the minimum occurs when SMT 2012 Calculus Test and Solutions February 18, 2012 f−(x) = s/l for all x ∈ A−, and the integral will be l · (s/l)3 = s3/l2. This can be made rigorous by applying Jensen’s inequality ∫ A− ϕ(f−(x)) dx l ≥ ϕ ( ∫ A− f−(x) dx l ) for the convex function ϕ(t) = t3. This gives the minimum as ∫ f−(x)3 dx l ≥ s3 l3 , ∫ f−(x) 3 dx ≥ s3 l2 . Meanwhile A+ should have length greater than s, since f+ is only nonzero on A+ and the integral of f+ ≤ 1 over A+ has length at most A+. So we have 1 − l ≥ s, l ≤ 1 − s. Now our objective integral is optimized to be the maximum of a single-variable function in s, as follows: ∫ 1 0 f (x) 3 dx ≤ s − s3 (1 − s)2 . We diﬀerentiate this in s to ﬁnd the maximum. Since d ds (s − s3 (1 − s)2 ) = 1 − 3s (1 − s)3 , its maximum is obtained at s = 1/3. Thus ﬁnally we can calculate our answer 1 3 − (1/3)3 (2/3)2 = 1 3 − 1 12 = 1 4 , and equality occurs when f (x) = 1 on a set of length 1/3 and f (x) = −s/l = −1/2 elsewhere.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
