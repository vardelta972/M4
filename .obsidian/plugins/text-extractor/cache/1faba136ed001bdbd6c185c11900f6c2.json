Challenging Warmup: A natural number N is called automorphic if N 2 ends with N when written out in its decimal notation. For example, 5 is automorphic. Find all automorphic numbers. 2. Find all triples (a, m, n) of natural numbers satisfying (a m + 1)|(a + 1) n 3. f : Q → Q is a function which satisﬁes f (q + 13 42 ) + f (q) = f (q + 1 7 ) + f (q + 1 6 ) for all rational numbers q, and |f (q)| ≤ 1. Prove that f is periodic, i.e. f (q + c) = f (q) for some non-zero c. 4. Prove that for n > 1, x n n! + x n−1 (n−1)! +... x 2 2 +x+1 = 0 does not have rational solutions. 5. Deﬁne an Recursively by ∑ d|n ad = 2 n. Prove that n|an. 6. Find all natural numbers x, y such that x y2 = yx 7. b, m, n are natural numbers such that bn − 1 and bm − 1 have the same prime factors. Prove that b − 1 is a power of 2. 8. Let m, n be relatively primes natural numbers. Call a number representable if it can be written as am + bn for non-negative a, b. Prove that mn − m − n is not representable, but if x is any non-representable number, then mn − m − n = am + nb + cx for non-negative a, b, c. 9. Let p1, p2, ..., pn be distinct prime numbers ≥ 5. Prove that 2p1p2p3...pn + 1 has at least 4 n factors. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
