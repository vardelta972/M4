Given n points (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) with distinct x-coordinates, there is a unique polynomial p(x) of degree at most n − 1 which passes through all of these points. Lagrange interpolation gives a useful formula for this polynomial: f (x) = y1 · (x − x2)(x − x3) · · · (x − xn) • Complex Roots. All polynomials factor completely over the complex numbers: f (x) = c(x − r1) . . . (x − rn), where r1, . . . , rn are the (complex) roots of f (with multiplicity). It follows that the coeﬃcients of f can be expressed as elementary symmetric polynomials in r1, . . . , rn. Taking c = 1 for convenience and letting f (x) = x n + an−1x n−1 + · · · + a1x1 + a0, we have a0 = (−1) nr1 · · · rn, a1 = (−1) n−1(r2r3 · · · rn−1 + r1r3 · · · rn + · · · + r2r3 · · · rn), ... an−1 = −(r1 + · · · + rn). Of course, polynomials do not generally factor completely over the reals or the rationals, resulting in many more fun facts. • Real Roots. Polynomials with real coeﬃcients factor as products of linear and quadratic factors: the linear terms correspond to real roots and the quadratic terms correspond to com- plex conjugate pairs. It is generally diﬃcult to say much about the real roots of a polynomial just by looking at it (other than that polynomials of odd degree have an odd number of real roots), but Descartes’ Rule of Signs occasionally gives a little more information: the number of positive roots of a real polynomial is congruent to the number of sign changes between consecutive coeﬃcients (mod 2). • Rational Roots. The Rational Root Theorem states that if q = r Finally, as a slight aside, a polynomial f has a square factor if and only if f and f ′ (the formal derivative) share a common factor, which can be checked simply by using the Euclidean algorithm. • Irreducibility. A polynomial that does not factor at all is called irreducible. This topic is more advanced and we only touch on it here. Eisenstein’s Criterion is probably the least- technical way of proving irreducibility: it states that if f (x) = anx n + an−1x n−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 has integer coeﬃcients satifying p | a0, a1, . . . , an−1, p ̸ | an, and p2 ̸ | a0, then f (x) is irreducible over the rationals. As an example, it follows immediately that x n − p is irreducible for any n. A trickier example is to show that x p −1 factors completely as (x−1)(x p−1 +· · ·+1): the trick to showing that the second factor (a cyclotomic polynomial) is irreducible is to replace x by x + 1 before applying Eisenstein. Lastly, a root r of a monic (i.e., leading coeﬃcient 1) irreducible polynomialf (x) is called an algebraic integer. In this case f (x) is called the minimal polynomial of r and divides all polynomials of which r is a root. Puzzling Problems 1.

[Russia 01] Two polynomials P (x) = x 4 + ax 3 + bx 2 + cx + d and Q(x) = x 2 + px + q take negative values on some common real interval I of length greater than 2, and outside of I they take on nonnegative values.
