Usually there is one nontrivial function (or family of functions) satisfying the functional equation, such as f (x) = x2 or f (x) = cx for some c ∈ R, but don’t forget trivial constant solutions such as f (x) = 1 as well. • Make substitutions like g(x) = f (x + 1) or g(x) = f (x) − f (0) to simplify the functional equation and/or its solutions. • Consider special values of the function, such as f (0), f (1), and f (−1). • Think about the values of the function on arithmetic progressions. • Consider trying to prove that the function is injective (one-to-one) or surjective (onto), since both of these properties are helpful in simplifying expressions. • Find a such that f (a) = 0; this usually (but not always!) means proving surjectivity ﬁrst. • Can you show that the function is monotone (increasing/decreasing)? • Cauchy’s functional equation f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) does not imply that f (x) = cx for functions on R without any additional constraints, but it does if any one of the following is also true: – f is monotone on some interval – f is continuous at one point – f is bounded on some interval – f is actually only a function on Q, not all of R. 2 Problems 1. (APMC 97) Prove that there does not exist f : Z → Z such that f (x + f (y)) = f (x)y for all integers x, y. 2. (ISL 01/A4) Find all functions f : R → R satisfying f (xy)(f (x) − f (y)) = (x − y)f (x)f (y) for all x, y. 1 3. (ISL 03/A2) Find all nondecreasing functions f : R → R such that (i) f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1; (ii) f (a) + f (b) = f (a)f (b) + f (a + b − ab) for all real numbers a, b such that a < 1 < b. 4. (USAMO 00/1] Prove that there exists no function f : R → R such that f (x) + f (y) 2 ≥ f ( x + y 2 ) + |x − y| for all x, y. 5.

(ISL 02/A1) Find all functions f : R → R such that f (f (x) + y) = 2x + f (f (y) − x) for all real x, y. 7. (Romania TST 04) Find all one-to-one mappings f : N → N such that for all positive integers n the following relation holds: f (f (n)) ≤ n + f (n) 2 . 8. (ISL 04/N3) Find all functions f : N∗ → N∗ satisfying (f (m) 2 + f (n) ) | (m2 + n)2 for any two positive integers m and n. Remark. The abbreviation N∗ stands for the set of all positive integers: N∗ = {1, 2, 3, ...}. 9. (ISL 00/A3) Find all pairs of functions f, g : R → R such that f (x + g(y)) = x · f (y) − y · f (x) + g(x) for all real x, y. 10. (China TST 03) Find all functions f : Z + → R which satisfy f (n + 1) ≥ f (n) for all n ≥ 1 and f (mn) = f (m)f (n) for all (m, n) = 1. 11. (IMO 99/6) Find all functions f : R → R such that f (x − f (y)) = f (f (y)) + xf (y) + f (x) − 1 for all x, y ∈ R. 12.
