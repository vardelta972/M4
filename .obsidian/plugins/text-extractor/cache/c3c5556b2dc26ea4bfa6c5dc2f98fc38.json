The Euclidean algorithm for ﬁnding gcd’s – in particular, for any integers a, b, there are integers m and n such that ma + nb = gcd(a, b). Theorem 2. If a is relatively prime to b, there exists a′ such that aa′ ≡ 1 (mod b). Corollary 1. If c is relatively prime to m and ab ≡ ac (mod m), then b ≡ c (mod m). Theorem 3. Let a, n, m be positive integers with a ≥ 2. Then gcd(an − 1, a m − 1) = a gcd(n,m) − 1. The Euler phi function is ϕ(n) =the number of integers less than n relatively prime to n. If n = pa1 1 · · · pai i , then ϕ(n) is given by the explict formula ϕ(n) = (p1 − 1)pa1−1 1 · · · (pi − 1)pai−1 i Theorem 4 (Euler’s Theorem). If gcd(a, m) = 1, then aϕ(m) ≡ 1 (mod m). In particular if m = p is prime, we have Fermat’s Little Theorem: ap−1 = 1 (mod p). Theorem 5. If (a, m) = 1, deﬁne ordm(a) to be the least j such that aj ≡ 1 (mod n). Then ordm(a) divides k if and only if ak ≡ 1 (mod n). Combining the two above facts, we conclude that ordm(a) divides ϕ(m). Theorem 6 (Partial Converse of Fermat’s Little Theorem). If there is an a for which am−1 ≡ 1 (mod m), but for no prime divisor p of m − 1 does a m−1 p ≡ 1 (mod m), then m is prime. Notation: Let Z/pZ be the integers mod p. Theorem 7. A polynomial of degree n with coeﬃcients in Z/pZ has at most n roots in Z/pZ. (Unlike in the complex numbers, it may have fewer than n roots even when you count multiplicity.) Proof. Like in the real numbers; by induction. 1 MOP 2011, Aqua Group Primitive Roots and Exponentials June 29, 2011 Primitive Roots mod p Theorem 8 (Existence of a Primitive Root mod p). For any prime p there exists an element a such that ordp(a) = p − 1; equivalently, such that the list 1, a, a2, a 3, . . . , ap−2 contains each of the nonzero residues mod p exactly once. (Why are these equivalent?) The following problems sketch a proof of the above theorem (which you can cite in olympiads). 1. Suppose that ordp(a) = x and ordp(b) = y, where x and y are relatively prime. Show that ordp(ab) = xy. 2. Show that if d | p − 1, there are exactly d solutions to xd = 1 in Z/pZ ∗. 3. Suppose that q is a prime and qdq is the largest power of q dividing n − 1. Show that there exists some m ∈ Z/pZ ∗ such that ordp(m) = qdq . 4. Show that there exists a primitive root mod p. The following criterion for primitive roots is useful: Theorem 9. An integer a is a primitive root modulo p if and only if for all primes q dividing p − 1, a(p−1)/q ̸≡ 1 (mod p). You can deﬁne primitive roots likewise modulo any m, but usually they will not exist. For example, there are no primitive roots modulo pq if p and q are distinct odd primes. Examples 5 (2009 Hungary-Israel). Let p be a prime. For which positive integers k is it the case that∑p−1 i=0 ik ≡ 0 (mod p)? 6. Determine whether there exist positive integers n1, n2, . . . , nk all greater than 1 such that n1 | 2 n2 − 1, n2 | 2 n3 − 1, . . . , nk−1 | 2 nk − 1, nk | 2 n1 − 1. Problems For some of these problems, like Problem 6 above, it is very helpful to start by arguing along the lines of “Let p be the smallest prime dividing (some number or set of numbers). Consider the order of (something) mod p...” 7 (Putnam 94/B6). For each non-negative integer i deﬁne ni = 101i + 100 · 2 i. If 0 ≤ a, b, c, d ≤ 99 and na + nb ≡ nc + nd (mod 101100), show that {a, b} = {c, d}. 8 (Putnam 97/B5). Deﬁne a1 = 2, an = 2 an−1 for n ≥ 2. Prove that an−1 ≡ an mod n. 9 (ELMO 2002?). Let n be an integer. Then every prime factor of n2002 + n2001 + ... + n + 1 is either equal to 2003 or is 1 mod 2003. (You may assume without proof that 2003 is prime. ¨⌣) 10 (MOP 2000). Show that, for n > 1, if 3 n − 2 n is a prime power, then n is prime. 11 (IMO 99/4). Find all pairs of positive integers (n, p) such that • p is a prime number 2 MOP 2011, Aqua Group Primitive Roots and Exponentials June 29, 2011 • n ≤ 2p • np−1 divides (p − 1) n + 1. 12 (APMO 1997). Find an integer n, 100 ≤ n ≤ 1997 such that n divides 2 n + 2. 13 (IMO 2003/6). Let p be a prime number. Prove that there exists a prime number q such that for every integer n, the number np − p is not divisible by q. 14 (Bulgaria 96). Find all pairs of primes (p, q) such that pq | (5 p − 2 p)(5 q − 2 q). 15 (TST 03). Find all triples p, q, r such that p | qr + 1, q | rp + 1, r | pq + 1. 16. (a) Find the smallest integer n with the following property; if p is an odd prime and a is a primitive root modulo pn, then a is a primitve root modulo every power of p. (b) Show that 2 is a primitive root modulo 3 k and 5 k for every positive integer k. More useful facts: Proposition 1. If either p is an odd prime and n ≥ 1, or p = 2 and n ≥ 2, then, for integers a, b both relatively prime to p: ap ≡ bp (mod pn+1) ⇐⇒ a ≡ b (mod pn) Proposition 2. Let p be a prime, n ≥ 2, and k is a positive integer relatively prime to p. Assume additionally that a ≡ b (mod p). ak ≡ bk (mod pn) ⇐⇒ a ≡ b (mod pn). Additional Problems 17 (Ireland 1996). Let p be a prime number and a, n positive integers. Prove that if 2 p + 3 p = an, then n = 1. 18 (MOP 2000). In how many zeroes does the number 4 56 + 6 54 end? 19 (IMO Shortlist 1993). A natural number n is said to have the property P , if, for all a, n2 divides an − 1 whenever n divides an − 1. (a) Show that every prime number n has property P . (b) Show that there are inﬁnitely many composite numbers n that possess property P . 20 (IMO Shortlist 2002). Let p1, p2, . . . , pn be distinct primes greater than 3. Show that 2 p1p2...pn +1 has at least 4 n divisors. 21. Show that there must either be inﬁnitely many composite numbers of the form 2 2n + 1 or inﬁnitely many composite numbers of the form 6 2n + 1. (Note: it is an open problem as to whether there exist inﬁnitely composite numbers of the form 2 2n + 1; likewise it is an open problem as to whether there exist inﬁnitely many composite numbers of the form 6 2n + 1; nevertheless we can show that one of the two sequences contains inﬁnitely many composites.) 3 MOP 2011, Aqua Group Primitive Roots and Exponentials June 29, 2011 Extra problem 22 (MOP 2004). Let m and n be positive integers such that 2 m divides the number n(n + 1).
