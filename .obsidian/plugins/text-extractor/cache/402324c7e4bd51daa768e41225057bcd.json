Let S be the set of all integers k, 1 ≤ k ≤ n, such that gcd(k, n) = 1. What is the arithmetic mean of the integers in S? 2. Let f (u) be a continuous function and, for any real number u, let [u] denote the greatest integer less than or equal to u. Show that for any x > 1, ∫ x 1 [u]([u] + 1)f (u)du = 2 [x]∑ i=1 i ∫ x i f (u)du. 3. Let I1, I2, I3 be three open intervals of R such that none is contained in another. If I1 ∩ I2 ∩ I3 is non-empty, then show that at least one of these intervals is contained in the union of the other two. 4. Given n positive integers, consider all possible sums formed by one or more of them. Prove that these sums can be divided into n groups such that in each group the ratio of the largest to the smallest does not exceed 2. 5. Let f : [0, 1] → [0, ∞) be a differentiable function, such that f ′(x) is decreasing, f (0) = 0 and f ′(1) > 0. Prove that the following inequality holds: ∫ 1 0 1 f (x)2 + 1 dx ≤ f (1) f ′(1). Can equality be achieved? 6. Let (xn) be an integer sequence such that 0 ≤ x0 < x1 ≤ 100 and xn+2 = 7xn+1 − xn + 280, for all n ≥ 0. a) Prove that if x0 = 2, x1 = 3 then for each positive integer n, the sum of divisors of the following number xnxn+1 + xn+1xn+2 + xn+2xn+3 + 2018 is divisible by 24. b) Find all pairs of numbers (x0, x1) such that xnxn+1 + 2019 is a perfect square for inﬁnitely many nonnegative integer numbers n. 7. Let f : R → (0, +∞) be a continuous function such that lim x→−∞ f (x) = lim x→+∞ f (x) = 0. a) Prove that f (x) attains a maximum value on R. b) Prove that there exist two sequeneces xn and yn with xn < yn, for all n = 1, 2, 3, ... such that they have the same limit when n → ∞ and f (xn) = f (yn) for all n ≥ 1. 1 8. Let f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function such that ∫ b a f (x)dx ̸= 0. Prove that there are numbers a < α < β < b such that ∫ α a f (x)dx = (b − α)f (β). 9. Let n > 1 be an integer and let f : [0, 1] → R be a continuous function such that ∫ 1 0 f (x)dx = 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n . Prove that there is a real number x0 ∈ (0, 1), such that f (x0) = 1 − xn 0 1 − x0 . 10. Let ψ : R → R be a continuous function such that ∫ x+y x ψ(t)dt = ∫ x x−y ψ(t)dt, for all x, y ∈ R. Prove that ψ is a constant function. 11. Let f, g : [a, b] → R be continuous functions. Prove that there is a real number c ∈ (a, b) such that ∫ c a f (x)dx + (c − a)g(c) = ∫ b c g(x)dx + (b − c)f (c). 12. Let f : R → R be an injective and differentiable function. Prove that the function F : (0, ∞) → R, F (x) = 1 x ∫ x 0 f (t)dt is monotone.
