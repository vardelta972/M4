I lied to you in class! In class I gave you an incorrect statement of Siegel’s theorem about integers point on curves of the form y2 = f (x). The correct statement is the following: Let f (x) ∈ Z[x] be a polynomial of degree at least 3 with distinct roots. Then the equation y2 = f (x) has only ﬁnitely many solutions in Z. (This is actually a special case of the full Siegel’s theorem for integer points on more general curves, but it’s a form which is easy to cite and apply accurately.) However, it certainly can have inﬁnitely many solutions in Q if f has degree 3 or 4. (This is true by the theory of elliptic curves; doing an explicit example is messy but I’d like to see one if anyone has one.) 1 Prologue: Diophantine Problems in general Given a subset S of C, one can ask if a given polynomial equation f (a1, . . . , an) = 0 has any solutions in S. Generally if one wants a nice theory for this sort of thing, one takes S to be a subring of C. We’ll call this a “diophantine equation over S” although the terminology may not be standard. The diﬃculty of this depends upon what S is: • S = C. • S = R; decidable but painful. • S = Q; this is where most of the nice mathematical theories are; we don’t know whether this is decidable or not. • S = Z; this is undecidable in general. Reductions: Diophantine equations over Q can be reduced to Diophantine equations over Z. Homogeneous diophantine equations over Z are equivalent to the same ones over Q. If you want to know more about this, look at Bjorn Poonen’s website; it has some very good expository articles. If you want to know more about undecidability for Z, ask Paul Valiant. Of course, there are rings other than Z. For example, Z/n = Z/nZ = {integers mod n}. Finite rings are ﬁnite, but still: • S = Z/pZ: see Josh’s handout. 1 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 • S = Z/pnZ: see my handout. Also Hensel’s lemma. • S = Z/nZ: CRT! Also you can do diophantine problems in polynomial rings; you saw one on Aaron’s polynomials handout and there’s another one below. 2 Techniques and Heuristics But all is not lost! With persistence and ingenuity, our intrepid mathematicians can rescue many equations from the depths of unsolvedness! • Sandwiching: e.g. if you want to prove that some expression X cannot be a perfect kth power, show that kn < X < (k + 1)n for some n. This method generalizes. • If you’re looking to construct a solution, try clever algebraic specializations/substitutions. Always remember that linear is better than quadratic is better than cubic, etc. But it’s nice to make things factor! (Or at least have singularities.) • Pythagorean triples. • Pythagoras plus: how to get a general formula for rational solutions to ax2 + by2 = cz2 if you already have a single solution. WARNING: The polynomials does not give you all integer solutions (a, b, c) with gcd(a, b, c) = 1; you need to rescale to get those. (Eg, for the Pythagorean triples our standard formula (m2 − n2, 2mn, m2 + n2) only gives us triples (a, b, c) where b is even; this generalizes.) • Pell’s equation/recurrences. • Inﬁnite descent. Generally happens when your equation has a lot of symmetries, which generally happens with Pell-type equations. • Quadratic Reciprocity and another reciprocity-ish law. Quadratic reciprocity can be stated in the following form: let P (x) = x2 +(−1) (p−1)/2p. Then if q ̸= p is a prime, q divides P (a) for some integer a if and only if q is a square mod p. Let Φn(x) be the nth cyclotomic polynomial. If q is a prime not dividing n, q divides P (a) for some integer a if and only if q is 1 mod n. Exercises: Prove the statements above. • Look beyond Z: factorizations in Z[i] and Z[ω]. 3 Examples 1 (TST 2002). Find in explicit form all ordered pairs of positive integers m, n such that mn − 1 divides m2 + n2. 2 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 2 (MOP 2007, Ramanujan?). Show that there exist inﬁnitely many positive integers n such that n = a3 + b3 = c3 + d 3 for nonzero positive integers a, b, c, d with {a, b} ̸= {c, d}. 3 (New to the revised handout!). Show that any rational number can be written as the sum of three rational cubes in inﬁnitely many ways. 4 (MOP 2000?). Suppose p, N, D are positive integers (p is prime) such that p = x2 1 + Dy2 1 N p = x2 2 + Dy2 2 for some integers x1, y1, x2, y2. Then show that there are integers x, y such that N = x2 + Dy2. 5. Let λ be a complex number, λ ̸= 0, 1. Show that if a(x) is a rational function with complex coeﬃcients such that a(x)(a(x) − 1)(a(x) − λ) is the square of a rational function, then a(x) is a constant function. 4 Problems 6. Prove that there exists an integer m ≥ 2002 and m distinct positive integers a1, a2, . . . , am such that m∏ i=1 a2 i − 4 m∑ i=1 a2 i is a perfect square. 7 (IMO Shortlist 2001). Consider the system x + y = z + u, 2xy = zu. Find the greatest value of the real constant m such that m ≤ x/y for any positive integer solution (x, y, z, u) of the system, with x ≥ y. 8 (MOP 98). Let p be a prime congruent to 3 mod 4, and let a, b, c, d be integers such that a2p + b2p + c2p = d 2p. Show that p divides abc. 9 (China, 2002). Sequence {an} satisﬁes: a1 = 3, a2 = 7, a2 n + 5 = an−1an+1, n ≥ 2. If an + (−1) n is prime, prove that there exists a nonnegative integer m such that n = 3 m. 10 (MOP 02). Show that there are inﬁnitely many ordered quadruples of integers (x, y, z, w) such that all six of xy + 1, xz + 1, xw + 1, yz + 1, yw + 1, zw + 1 are perfect squares. 3 MOP 2011, Black Group Number Theory June 20, 2011 5 Problems from the real world These are diophantine equations over Q that I found in published math papers; they were con- structed as examples of diophantine equations with certain properties (generally failure of local- to-global), but their solutions are elementary. 11 (Reichardt-Lind). Show that there are no rational solutions to the equation x4 − 17y4 = 2z2. 12 (Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer). Show that there are no rational solutions to the system of equations uv = x2 − 5y2 (u + v)(u + 2v) = x2 − 5z2. 13 (Swinnerton-Dyer). Show that if rational numbers x, y, z satisfy the equation x2 + y2 = (4z − 7)(z2 − 2) then z ≥ 7/4. 6 Further Reading These are written for mathematicians, so parts will be over your heads, but other parts are under- standable with only an olympiad background.
