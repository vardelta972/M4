(JSteinhardt) Let ⋄(k) be the sum of k’s digits in base 720 + 1. How many positive integers m exist such that ⋄(k) ≡ k (mod m) for all k? We will separate digits base 721 by grouping them with parentheses for clariﬁcation purposes. First we can see that any divisor of 720 works, since 721n ≡ 1 (mod m) if m|720. In addition, we can see that it is necessary that m is a divisor of 720 by noting that in particular (1)(1)721 ≡ 2721 (mod m), so (720)721 ≡ 0 (mod m) =⇒ m|720. Then it only remains to ﬁnd the number of divisors of 720 = 6! = 6 ∗ 5 ∗ 4 ∗ 3 ∗ 2 = 3 ∗ 2 ∗ 5 ∗ 2 ∗ 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 2 = 5 ∗ 32 ∗ 24, so there can be between 0 and 1 powers of 5, 0 and 2 powers of 3, and 0 and 4 powers of 2 that divide any factor of 720, leading to 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 5 = 30 factors. 2. (JSteinhardt) Find the number of divisors of the sum of the squares of the divisors of 720. The sum of the squares of the divisors of 720 can be found similarly to the sum of the divisors of 720. That is, since 720 = 5 ∗ 32 ∗ 24 (shown above), we can use the factorization (12 + 52)(12 + 32 + 92)(12 + 22 + 42 + 82 + 162) (do you see why this works?) and simplify this to 6 ∗ 91 ∗ 341 = 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 7 ∗ 13 ∗ 11 ∗ 31 and use the same logic as before to deduce that there are 32 divisors to this number. 3. (JSteinhardt) Find the sum of the square divisors of 720. We again use a factorization, this time ignoring any factors that aren’t squares. The resulting form is (1) ∗ (1 + 32) ∗ (1 + 22 + 24) = 10 ∗ 21 = 210 . Actually, 210 is pretty cool as well. 4. (Traditional) Find the right-most non-zero digit of 210! in base 210. First we note that 210 = 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 5 ∗ 7. The largest factor of 210 that divides 210! will therefore correspond to the largest factor of 7 that divides 210!, which is ⌊ 210 7 ⌋+⌊ 210 49 ⌋+. . . = 30+4 = 34. Then taking 210! 21034 mod 2, 3, 5, and 7, we obviously have that it is congruent to 0 for the ﬁrst 3. This only leaves mod 7. 210! 21034 ≡ 6! 30 ∗ 1 ∗ 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 4 ∗ 5 ∗ 6 ∗ 1 ∗ 8 ∗ . . . ∗ 26 ∗ 27 ∗ 4 ∗ 29 ∗ 30 3034 ≡ (−1) 30 ∗ 6!4 ∗ 1 ∗ 2 ∗ (1 ∗ 2 ∗ 3 ∗ 4) 234 ≡ (−1)4 ∗ 48 234 ≡ (−1) ∗ 434 ≡ (−1) ∗ 44 ≡ (−1) ∗ 162 ≡ (−1) ∗ 22 ≡ −4 ≡ 3 (mod 7) By the Chinese Remainder Theorem there is a unique number in mod 210 that is 0 mod 2, 3, and 5 and 3 mod 7. Starting with 5 and 7, we get that it is 10 mod 35. Bringing in 3, we have that it is 45 mod 105. Finally, bringing in 2 gives that it is 150 mod 210, so the answer is 150 . 5. (Traditional) Find the length of the repeating part of 1 17 in base 210. Call the length l. If 1 17 ∗ (210n − 1) is an integer, then l|n (consider that multiplying 1 17 by (210l − 1) causes the repeating part to telescope, as is the case for any multiple of l. This is equivalent to 210n ≡ 1 (mod 17), which by Fermat’s theorem says that the smallest possible n such that this is true must divide 16. We can then test 1, 2, 4, and 8: 210n ≡ 6n (mod 17), so 2101, 2102, 2104, and 2108 correspond to 6, 36 ≡ 2, 4, and 16equiv − 1. It is then clear that the smallest value of n is 16, so the length of the repeating decimal is 16 . 1 But 47 is the coolest of all. 6. (Traditional) If 46∑ i=1 1 i = p q , and r exists such that 47|p − qr, then ﬁnd r − 47⌊ r 47 ⌋. We ﬁrst note that the problem is basically asking for the value of the given sum mod 47, which happens to be prime. We then note that {f rac11, . . . , 1 p−1 } is equivalent to {1, . . . , p − 1} in a prime mod, because multiplicative inverses are unique in prime mods (prove it!), so mapping each number to its multiplicative inverse simply constitutes a permutation of the set. So we can actually take 46∑ i=1 i = 46 ∗ (46 + 1) 2 mod 47, which happens to be a factor of 47, so the answer is 0 . 7. (Traditional) Find the smallest positive integer n such that 1n + 2n + . . . + 46n is not divisible by 47. Let g be a generator mod 47. Then {g1, . . . , g46} is equivalent to the set {1, . . . , 46} be deﬁnition. Thus, 46∑ i=1 i n = 46∑ i=1 gin, which is now an easily evaluatable geometric series that is in particular congruent to 0 mod 47 for any n < 46. It is then clear from Fermat’s theorem that it is not congruent to 0 for n = 46, so the answer is 46 . And ﬁnally, Haitao has asked permission to give you all a problem, and I said yes. 8. Let p > 2 be a prime and let P (x) = a0xp−1 + . . . + ap−1 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. If for all integral x,y such that if p does not divide x − y, then p also does not divide P (x) − P (y). Prove that p|a0. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
