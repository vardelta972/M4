Suppose that f : [a, b] → R has a local maximum at x = c, where c ∈ (a, b). Is it necessary that f ′(c) = 0? 2. Suppose that f : [a, b] → R has a local maximum at x = c, where c ∈ [a, b]. Assume that f is diﬀerentiable at x = c. Is it necessary that f ′(c) = 0? 3. (Fermat’s Theorem) Suppose that f : [a, b] → R has a local maximum (or minimum) at x = c, where c ∈ (a, b). Assume that f is diﬀerentiable at x = c. Show that f ′(c) must be equal to zero. (Note: It is enough to show it only for the case of local maximum. If f has a local minimum at x = c, then we can just apply that result to −f .) 4. Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is diﬀerentiable at x = c, where c ∈ (a, b). If f ′(c) = 0, is it necessary that f has a local maximum/minimum at x = c? 5. (Rolle’s Theorem) Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is continuous on [a, b], diﬀerentiable on (a, b), and f (a) = f (b). Prove that there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that f ′(c) = 0. 6. Show that Rolle’s theorem fails to hold if f is not continuous at one of endpoints (a or b). 7. (Lagrange’s Mean Value Theorem) Suppose that f : [a, b] → R is continuous on [a, b], diﬀerentiable on (a, b). Prove that there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that f (b) − f (a) b − a = f ′(c). 8.

Let P (x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients and degree n ≥ 2. Prove that if all roots of P (x) are real, then all roots of P ′(x) are also real. 16. Let f be continuous on [0, 2] and twice diﬀerentiable on (0, 2). If f (x) = x holds for x = 0, 1 and 2, then show that there exists x0 ∈ (0, 2) such that f ′′(x0) = 0. 17. Let n > 1 be an integer, and let f : [a, b] → R be a continuous function, which is n-times diﬀerentiable on (a, b). If the graph of f (x) has n + 1 collinear points, then prove that there exists c ∈ (a, b) such that f (n)(c) = 0. [Here f (n)(c) denotes the n-th derivative of f (x), evaluated at x = c.] 18. Let f, g : [0, 1] → R such that f (0) = g(0) and f ′(x) > g′(x) for all x ∈ (0, 1). Show that f (x) > g(x) must hold for all x ∈ (0, 1]. 19.

Comment: If we also assume that g′(x) ̸= 0 for every x ∈ (a, b), then it rearranges to the following: f (b) − f (a) g(b) − g(a) = f ′(c) g′(c) . 24.

Find the value of lim x→∞ f −1(8x) − f −1(x) x1/3 . 30. Suppose that lim x→∞ f ′(x) = ∞. Does this imply that f (x) is unbounded? 31. Let P be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Let the leading coeﬃcient be a (where a > 0) and the degree be b. Show that, lim n→∞ ( P (n + 1)1/b − P (n) 1/b) = a1/b. 32.
