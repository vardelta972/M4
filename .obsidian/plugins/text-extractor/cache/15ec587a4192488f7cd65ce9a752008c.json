Draw a line parallel to AC through D. Let it intersect AB at E. Suppose AE : EB = 2 : 1. Prove that ABC is an equilateral triangle. Solution: Extend DE to meet BC at F . Join BD and DA. Since CD is a diameter, we see that ∠DBC = 90 ◦. Since DF is paral- lel to AC, it follows that △EBF ∼ △ABC. Hence EB = EF . Now ∠EBF = ∠EF B = 90◦ − ∠EDB. But ∠EBF + ∠EBD = 90◦. Hence we obtain ∠EBD = ∠EDB, which gives EB = ED. Since AE : EB = 2 : 1 and EB = ED, we obtain AE = 2ED. Hence ∠DAB = 30◦. This implies ∠DCB = 30◦ and hence ∠BDC = 60◦. But then ∠BAC = ∠BDC = 60 ◦ and hence △ABC is equilateral 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that ab 1 + bc + bc 1 + ca + ca 1 + ab = 1. Prove that 1 a3 + 1 b3 + 1 c3 ≥ 6√2. Solution: The given condition is equivalent to ∑ ab(1 + ca)(1 + ab) = (1 + ab)(1 + bc)(1 + ca). This gives ∑ ab + ∑ a2b2 + abc ∑ a + abc ∑ a 2b = 1 + ∑ ab + abc ∑ a + a 2b2c 2. Hence a 2b2c2 + 1 = ∑ a 2b 2 + abc ∑ a2b. Using ∑ a 2b 2 ≥ 3(abc) 4/3, ∑ a 2b ≥ 3abc, we get a 2b2c2 + 1 ≥ 3(abc)4/3 + 3(abc) 2. Taking x = (abc) 2/3, this reduces to 2x3 + 3x2 − 1 ≤ 0. This gives (x + 1)2(2x − 1) ≤ 0. Hence x ≤ 1/2. Therefore abc ≤ 1/2 √2. Finally 1 a3 + 1 b3 + 1 c3 ≥ 3 abc ≥ 6√2. 3. The present ages in years of two brothers A and B, and their father C are three distinct positive integers a, b, and c respectively. Suppose b − 1 a − 1 and b + 1 a + 1 are two consecutive integers, and c − 1 b − 1 and c + 1 b + 1 are two consecutive integers. If a + b + c ≤ 150 determine a, b and c. Solution: We have b − 1 a − 1 = l, b + 1 a + 1 = l − 1, c − 1 b − 1 = m, c + 1 b + 1 = m − 1 (If we take a ≤ b, we see that b−1 a−1 ≥ b+1 a+1 .) Consider the ﬁrst two relations: b − 1 = l(a − 1), b + 1 = (l − 1)(a + 1). Solving for a, we get a = 2l − 3 and hence b = 2l2 − 4l + 1. Using the second set of relations, we obtain b = 2m − 3 and c = 2m2 − 4m + 1. Thius we have 2m − 3 = 2l2 − 4l + 1 or m = (l − 1)2 + 1. Obviously l > 1. If l = 2, we get a = 1 which forces b = 1 and c = 1, which is impossible. If l = 3, we get a = 3, b = 7 and c = 31. If l ≥ 4, then m ≥ 10 and c ≥ 161. But then a + b + c > 150. Thus the only choice is a = 3, b = 7 and c = 31. 4. A box contains answer 4032 scripts out of which exactly half have odd number of marks. We choose 2 scripts randomly and, if the scores on both of them are odd number, we add one mark to one of them, put the script back in the box and keep the other script outside. If both scripts have even scores, we put back one of the scripts and keep the other outside. If there is one script with even score and the other with odd score, we put back the script with the odd score and keep the other script outside. After following this procedure a number of times, there are 3 scripts left among which there is at least one script each with odd and even scores. Find, with proof, the number of scripts with odd scores among the three left. Solution: There are three types of processes. In the ﬁrst type, the scripts with odd scores decreases by 2. In the second and third types, there is no change in the number of scripts with odd scores. Hence at each step, the number of scripts with odd score decreases by 0 or 2. Since there are 2016 scripts with odd scores, the number of scripts with odd scores at the end is either 0 or 2. Since it is given that there is at least one script with odd scores, two of the three must have odd scores. 5. Let ABC be a triangle, AD an altitude and AE a median. Assume B, D, E, C lie in that order on the line BC. Suppose the incentre of triangle ABE lies on AD and the incentre of ADC lies on AE. Find the angles of triangle ABC. Solution: Since AD ⊥ BE and the incentre of △ABE lies on AD, it follows that ABE is isosceles. In particu- lar ∠BAD = ∠DAE = α, say. Since AE is the bisector of∠DAC, it follows that ∠EAC = ∠DAE = α. Moreover, we have AD AC = DE CE . Since BE = EC = a 2 , we also have DE = 1 2 BE = a 4 . Thus we get AD AC = DE EC = a/4 a/2 = 1 2 . Since △ADE is a right-angled triangle and AD = AC/2, it follows that ∠ACD = 30◦. Hence ∠DAC = 60 ◦. Since ∠DAC = 2α, we get α = 30 ◦. Now ∠A = 3α and hence ∠A = 90 ◦. This gives ∠B = 60 ◦. 6. i) Prove that if an inﬁnite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers in arithmetic progression has one cube then it has inﬁnitely many cubes. (ii) Find, with justiﬁcation, an inﬁnite sequence of strictly increasing positive integers in arithmetic progression which does not have any cube. Solution: i) Let a be the ﬁrst term of the AP and d be the common diﬀerence. (Here a, d are positive integers.) We can ﬁnd an integer b such that b 3 = a + (n − 1)d for some n ∈ N. Consider (b + d) 3. We observe that (b + d) 3 = b3 + d(3b 2 + 3bd + d 2) = a + (n − 1 + 3b2 + 3bd + d2)d = a + (m − 1)d, 2 where m = n + 3b2 + 3bd + d2 is a positive integer. Hence (b + d)3 is also in the given AP. More generally, the same method shows that (b + kd)3 is in the AP for every k ∈ N. Hence the given AP contains inﬁnitely many cubes. ii) Consider the AP ⟨2, 6, 10, 14, . . .⟩. Here a = 2 and d = 4. The general term is 2 + 4k, where k ≥ 0 is an integer. Suppose 2 + 4k = b3 for some integer b. Then 2 divides b. Hence b = 2c for some c. Therefore 8c3 = 2 + 4k or 4c 3 = 2k + 1. But this is impossible since LHS is even and RHS is odd. We conclude that the AP ⟨2, 6, 10, 14, . . .⟩ does not contain any cube. ———-0———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
