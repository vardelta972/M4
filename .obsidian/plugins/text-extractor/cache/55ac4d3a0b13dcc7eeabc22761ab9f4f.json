Find the number of eight-digit numbers the sum of whose digits is 4. 2. Find all 4-tuples (a, b, c, d) of natural numbers with a ≤ b ≤ c and a! + b! + c! = 3d. 3. In an acute-angled triangle ABC with AB < AC, the circle Γ touches AB at B and passes through C intersecting AC again at D. Prove that the orthocentre of triangle ABD lies on Γ if and only if it lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 4. A polynomial is called a Fermat polynomial if it can be written as the sum of the squares of two polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose that f (x) is a Fermat polynomial such that f (0) = 1000. Prove that f (x) + 2x is not a Fermat polynomial. 5. Let ABC be a triangle which it not right-angled. Deﬁne a sequence of triangles AiBiCi, with i ≥ 0, as follows: A0B0C0 is the triangle ABC; and, for i ≥ 0, Ai+1, Bi+1, Ci+1 are the reﬂections of the orthocentre of triangle AiBiCi in the sides BiCi, CiAi, AiBi, respectively. Assume that ∠Am = ∠An for some distinct natural numbers m, n. Prove that ∠A = 60◦. 6. Let n ≥ 4 be a natural number. Let A1A2 · · · An be a regular polygon and X = {1, 2, . . . , n}. A subset {i1, i2, . . . , ik} of X, with k ≥ 3 and i1 < i2 < · · · < ik, is called a good subset if the angles of the polygon Ai1Ai2 · · · Aik , when arranged in the increasing order, are in an arithmetic progression. If n is a prime, show that a proper good subset of X contains exactly four elements. ——— ⋆ ⋆ ⋆ ———","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
