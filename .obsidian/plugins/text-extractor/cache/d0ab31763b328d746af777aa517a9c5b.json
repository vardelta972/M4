Mr. Fat is moving around on the lattice points (points (x, y) where both x and y are integers) according to the following rules: From point (x, y) he may move to any of the points (y, x), (5x, \u0000y), (\u0000x, 5y), (x +2,y +4) and (x \u0000 4,y \u0000 2). Show that if he starts at the origin (0, 0), he can never reach the point (2020, 2019). 2. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral. Suppose E, F are points on AB such that AE = EF = FB and G, H are points on CD such that DH = HG = GC. Prove that area of EF GH is one-third of the area of ABCD. 3. A train has n wagons. Any passenger who is boarding the train, chooses a wagon at random (independent of others) to get on. (a) If there are m passengers, what is the probability that at least one passenger gets on every wagon? (b) Using (a), evaluate the following sum, for 1  p  n. ✓ n 1 ◆ 1 p \u0000 ✓ n 2 ◆ 2 p + ✓ n 3 ◆ 3 p \u0000 · · · +(\u00001) n\u00001 ✓ n n ◆ n p . 4. Find all primes p and q such that p q\u00001 + q p\u00001 is a perfect square. 5. For all n \u0000 1, deﬁne a n = n\u00001 X k=1 sin( (2k\u00001)⇡ 2n ) cos 2 ( (k\u00001)⇡ 2n )cos 2 ( k⇡ 2n ). Determine lim n!1 a n n 3 . 6. Let F 1 =1,F 2 =1,F n+2 = F n+1 + F n (for n \u0000 1) be the Fibonacci sequence. (i) Show that \u0000 m 0 \u0000 F n +\u0000 m 1 \u0000 F n+1 +\u0000 m 2 \u0000 F n+2 +·· ·+\u0000 m m \u0000 F n+m = F n+2m for any m, n 2 N. (ii) Let p(x) be a polynomial of degree 9 such that p(k)= F k holds for k = 11, 12, ·· · , 20. Show that p(21) = F 21 \u0000 1.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
