(IMO Short lost 2008, G2) We will assume D is between A and E, as shown in the diagram below. It could also be that A is between D and E, which leads to a diﬀerent conﬁguration, but the same argument applies in that conﬁguration with very little change.1 C D A Y E F I K J Since ∠Y CE = ∠ADF , we have ∠F CE = ∠Y CE = ∠ADF , and hence F CED is a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, ∠F EA = ∠F ED = ∠F CD. Since CD and Y A are parallel, this implies in turn that ∠F EA = 180◦ − ∠F Y A. Hence, F EAY is also a cyclic quadrilateral. In particular, power of a point now implies the following two identities: CJ · DJ = F J · EJ(1) and F I · EI = Y I · AI(2). Furthermore, I belongs to the circumcircle of CDK if and only if IJ · KJ = CJ · DJ, which is equivalent to IJ · KJ = F J · EJ by (1). Writing IJ = IF + F J, EJ = F E − F J, and KJ = 1 2 F E − F J, this occurs if and only if F J = F I·F E 2F I+F E (3). Similarly, K belongs to the circumcircle of triangle AY J if and only if JI · KI = Y I · AI, 1You can usually avoid the issue of diﬀerent conﬁgurations by using signed angles and distances, but in this case, you have to make sure you get the sign right when converting the given condition ∠DAE = ∠CBF into a condition on signed angles. 1 which is equivalent to JI · KI = F I · EI. Writing JI = F I + F J, KI = F I + 1 2 F E, and EI = F I + F E, this occurs if and only if F J = F I·F E 2F I+F E (4). The result follows from the fact that conditions (3) and (4) are identical. 2. (IMO Short list 2008, N3) We ﬁrst prove the result for small values of n = 0, 1, 2, 3. Since ai ≥ gcd(ai, ai+1) > ai−1, the sequence is increasing, so a1 ≥ 2. For each i ≥ 1, we also have ai+1 ≥ gcd(ai, ai+1) + ai ≥ ai + ai−1 + 1, hence a2 ≥ 4, a3 ≥ 7. a3 = 7 is impossible, because then 2 ≤ a1 < gcd(a2, 7), which contradicts the fact that a2 < 7. So a3 ≥ 8 and the claim is proven for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. We now proceed be induction. Let n ≥ 3 and assume that ai ≥ 2i for i = 0, 1, . . . , n. We must show that an+1 ≥ 2n+1. We will in fact show that an+1 ≥ min(2an, 4an−1, 8an−2, 16an−3), which is clearly suﬃcient. Suppose this is not the case. Then we must have an+1 < 2an, so gcd(an+1, an) < an+1 2 , and an+1 4 < an−1 < gcd(an, an+1) < an+1 2 . So we must have that gcd(an+1, an) = an+1 3 and an = 2an+1 3 . Now look at an−2. By assumption, an−2 > an+1 8 > 3an−1 8 > an−1 3 . But we also know that an−2 < gcd(an−1, an), and so gcd(an−1, an) = an−1 2 . Hence an 6 < an+1 8 < an−2 < gcd(an−1, an) = an−1 2 < an 4 , so we conclude that gcd(an−1, an) = an 5 , and an−1 = 2an 5 = 4an+1 15 . Finally, we see that an+1 16 < an−3 < gcd(an−2, an−1) = gcd (an−2, 4an+1 15 ) . From before, we know that 4an+1 45 < an+1 8 < an−2 < gcd(an−1, an) = 2an+1 15 , hence an−2 doesn’t divide 4an+1 15 , and so gcd (an−2, 4an+1 15 ) ≤ an−2 2 < an+1 15 , but then an−3 < gcd ( an−2, 4an+1 15 ) ≤ 4an+1 75 < an+1 16 which is a contradiction. This completes the induction, so the claim is proven. 3. (IMO Short list 2008, A7) Note that 2(a−b)(a−c) a+b+c = (a−c)2 a+b+c + (a−c)(a−2b+c) a+b+c and 2(c−d)(c−a) c+d+a = (c−a)2 c+d+a + (c−a)(c−2d+a) c+d+a . There- fore, 2(a−b)(a−c) a+b+c + 2(c−d)(c−a) c+d+a can be written as (a − c) 2 · ( 1 a + b + c + 1 c + d + a ) + (a − c) · ( a − 2b + c a + b + c − a − 2d + c a + d + c ) = (a − c) 2 · ( 2a + b + 2c + d (a + b + c)(c + d + a) ) + (a − c) · (d − b) · ( 3a + 3c (a + b + c)(c + d + a) ) . 2 Similarly, 2(b−c)(b−d) b+c+d + 2(d−a)(d−b) d+a+b can be written as (b − d)2 · ( a + 2b + c + 2d (b + c + d)(d + a + b) ) − (a − c) · (d − b) · ( 3b + 3d (b + c + d)(d + a + b) ) . Letting S = a + b + c + d, it therefore suﬃces to prove the following: (a − c)2 · ( S + a + c (S − b)(S − d) ) + (b − d) 2 · ( S + b + d (S − a)(S − c) ) ≥ 3(a − c)(b − d) · ( (a + c)(S − a)(S − c) − (b + d)(S − b)(S − d) (S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) ) . Assume without loss of generality that ac(a + c) ≥ bd(b + d). The right-hand side simpliﬁes to 3(a − c)(b − d) · ( ac(a+c)−bd(b+d) (S−a)(S−b)(S−c)(S−d) ) ≤ 3·|(a−c)(b−d)·ac(a+c)| (S−a)(S−b)(S−c)(S−d) . By the AM-GM inequality, the left-hand side is at least 2 · |(a − c)(b − d)| · √ (S + a + c)(S + b + d)(S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) (S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) ≥ 2 · |(a − c)(b − d)| · √2(a + c) · (a + c) · c · (a + c) · a · (a + c) (S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) . where we used the fact here that b, d ≥ 0 in each factor. Furthermore (a + c)2 ≥ 4ac, so this is at least 2 · |(a − c) · (b − d)| · √ 8(a + c)2 · a2c2 (S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) = 4√2 · |(a − c)(b − d) · ac(a + c)| (S − a)(S − b)(S − c)(S − d) . This is clearly at least 3·|(a−c)(b−d)·ac(a+c)| (S−a)(S−b)(S−c)(S−d) , which completes the proof. For equality to hold at the end, we must have a = c or b = d. For equality to hold during our initial application of AM-GM, we must then have both a = c and b = d. Conversely, it is clear that if a = c and b = d, then equality does indeed hold. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
