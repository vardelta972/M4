Many combinatorial problems can be solved by ﬁnding the right bijection. A map between two sets A and B is a bijection if it is both injective and surjective, that is, it is one-to-one and maps onto all of B. Equivalently, a bijection is a map that has a well-deﬁned inverse. Most bijective (a.k.a. counting in two ways) proofs use the following principle: If there is a bijection between ﬁnite sets A and B, then A and B have the same number of elements. So, if we wish to ﬁnd |A| (the number of elements in A) and there is a bijection from A to a set B whose elements are easy to count, then we know how to count the elements of A. We can also prove two integers are equal by showing they count sets that have a bijection between them. Example. Prove that n∑ k=0 ( n k )2 = (2n n ). To prove this, we can easily use a straightforward induction argument, but it is more exciting to ﬁnd a bijection between sets that each side counts. Consider a class with 2n students, n of whom are boys and n of whom are girls. There is a natural bijection between • pairs (G, B) of subsets G of the girls and B of the boys with |G| + |B| = n, and • subsets of the set of all students of size n, deﬁned by (G, B) 7→ G ∪ B. A simple counting argument shows that the number of possible pairs (G, B) is ∑n k=0 (n k)( n n−k) = ∑n k=0 (n k)2, and the number of subsets of the class of size n is (2n n ). So, these quantities must be equal! Problems 1. Find the bijection! For each of the following pairs of mathematical objects, give a description of a bijection that maps one set of objects to the other. (a) Binary sequences of length n ↔ Subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} 1 (b) Lattice paths from (0, 0) to (m, n) that only travel right or up at each step ↔ Choices of n blocks from a pile of m blue and n red blocks (c) Tilings of a 2 × n grid with dominoes ↔ Sequences of n − 1 white or black dots such that no two black dots are adjacent (d) Partitions1 of n into distinct parts ↔ Partitions of n into odd parts (e) Partitions of n into distinct odd parts ↔ Partitions of n whose Young Diagram2 is symmetric about the diagonal (f) Increasing binary trees with nodes labeled 1, 2, . . . , n ↔ Permutations of 1, 2, . . . , n. 2. Give a bijective proof of each of the following identities. All unspeciﬁed variables are assumed to be positive integers. • ∑n k=0 k(n k) = n2n−1 • ∑r k=0 (n k)( m r−k) = (m+n r ) • ∑n i=0 (x+i i ) = (x+n+1 n ) • ∑n k=0 (n k)sktn−k = (s + t)n 3. Let w = a1a2 · · · an be a permutation of 1, 2, . . . , n. We say that i is a ﬁxed point of w if ai = i. Show that the total number of ﬁxed points of all possible permutations w is n!. 4. Show that, for positive integers n > 2, the number of integers x ∈ {0, 1, . . . , n − 1} for which x2 ≡ 1 (mod n) is even. 5. How many m × n matrices of 0’s and 1’s have the property that every row and column contains an odd number of 1’s? 6. (AIME 1983.) For {1, 2, . . . , n} and each of its nonempty subsets a unique alternating sum is deﬁned as follows: Arrange the numbers in the subset in decreasing order and then, beginning with the largest, alternately add and subtract successive numbers. (For example, the alternating sum for {1, 2, 4, 6, 9} is 9 − 6 + 4 − 2 + 1 = 6.) Find the sum of all alternating sums of the nonempty subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n}. 7. Prove Fermat’s Little Theorem using a combinatorial argument as follows. We wish to show that if p is prime and a is a positive integer, then ap − a is divisible by p. To do so, it suﬃces to ﬁnd a set S with ap − a elements and sort the elements of S into disjoint subsets having p elements each. 8. (Putnam 2002.) A nonempty subset S ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} is decent if the average of its elements is an integer. Prove that the number of decent subsets has the same parity as n. 9. (AIME 1998.) Find the number of ordered quadruples (x1, x2, x3, x4) of positive odd integers that satisfy x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 = 98. 1A partition of a positive integer is a way of writing it as a sum of other integers, called the parts of the partition, where we list the parts in nonincreasing order. 2The Young Diagram of a partition is a partial grid of squares, aligned at the left, where each row has a number of squares corresponding to the size of the parts in nonincreasing order. 10. (USAMO 1996.) An n-term sequence in which every term is either 0 or 1 is called a “binary sequence” of length n. Let an be the number of binary sequences of length n containing no three consecutive terms equal to 0, 1, 0 in that order. Let bn be the number of binary sequences of length n containing no four consecutive terms equal to 0, 0, 1, 1 or 1, 1, 0, 0 in that order. Prove that bn + 1 = 2an for all positive integers n. 11. (China 1996.) Let n be a positive integer. Find the number of polynomials P (x) with coeﬃcients in {0, 1, 2, 3} such that P (2) = n. 12. Find the number of strings of n letters, each equal to A, B, or C, such that the same letter never occurs three times in succession. 13. (Putnam 1996.) Given a ﬁnite string S of symbols X and O, we write ∆(S) for the number of X’s in S minus the number of O’s. For example, ∆(XOOXOOX) = −1. We call a string S balanced if every substring T of (consecutive symbols of) S has −2 ≤ ∆(T ) ≤ 2. Thus, XOOXOOX is not balanced, since it contains the substring OOXOO. Find, with proof, the number of balanced strings of length n. 14. The Catalan numbers: The Catalan numbers3 C0, C1, C2, . . . can be deﬁned by the recurrence relation Cn+1 = CnC0 + Cn−1C1 + Cn−2C2 + · · · + C0Cn along with the initial value C0 = 1. The nth Catalan number Cn can also be deﬁned as: • The number of lattice paths from (0, 0) to (n, n), formed by moving one unit right or one unit up at each step, that lie below or on the diagonal x = y • The number of ways to fully parenthesize the addition 1 + 1 + · · · + 1 of n + 1 ones. For instance, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 can be parenthesized in ﬁve ways: ((1 + 1) + 1) + 1 (1 + (1 + 1)) + 1 1 + ((1 + 1) + 1) 1 + (1 + (1 + 1)) (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) • The number of rooted binary trees having n leaves labeled 1, 2, . . . , n • The number of ways of triangulating a regular n + 2-gon by drawing n − 1 diagonals (diﬀerent triangulations that are congruent are considered distinct.) • The number of ways of connecting 2n points on a circle with n nonintersecting chords Show that each of these sets satisﬁes the Catalan recurrence. Can you ﬁnd bijections between each of these pairs of sets? 15. (Hard.) Find a bijective proof that the nth Catalan number Cn is equal to 1 n+1 (2n n ). 3See http://math.mit.edu/ rstan/ec/ for a list of 188 diﬀerent combinatorial interpretations of the Catalan numbers.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
