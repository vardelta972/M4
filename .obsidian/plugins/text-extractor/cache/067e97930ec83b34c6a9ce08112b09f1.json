In this article we ﬁnd the number of edges in a graph that ensures the existence of a (k + 1)-clique without an edge as a subgraph. A famous Turan’s Theorem says that in the class of graphs G on n vertices with no k-clique we have |E| ≤ k − 2 k − 1 · n2 − r2 2 + (r − 1)r 2 , where n ≡ r(mod k − 1). Let f (S, n) be the greatest number of edges in a graph on n vertices with no par- ticular structure S in it. From the above statement it follows that if n ≡ r(mod k−1), then f (Kk, n) = k − 2 k − 1 · n2 − r2 2 + (r − 1)r 2 . Clearly, from here, the number f (Kk, n) + 1 ensures the existence of a k-clique in the graph. We would also like to introduce a complement of f (S, n), a function g(S, n) equal to the least number of edges we need to remove from a graph on n vertices to guarantee the nonexistence of a particular structure S in it. We have g(Kk, n) = (n − 1)n 2 − f (Kk, n) = (n − r)(n + r − (k − 1)) 2(k − 1) , where n ≡ r(mod k − 1). We want to ﬁnd the number of edges that ensures the existence of a (k +1)-clique without an edge in the graph. We claim that this number is the same as the number that ensures the exitence of a k-clique, that is f (Kk, n) = f (Kk+1\\{e}, n), for n ≥ k + 1, k ≥ 3. Let us start with a simple observation. It is clear that f (Kk, n) ≤ f (Kk+1\\{e}, n), because Kk ⊂ Kk+1\\{e}. Thus g(Kk+1\\{e}, n) ≤ g(Kk, n). It is also clear that g(S, n − 1) < g(S, n). To prove this consider a graph on n vertices with g(S, n) edges removed. The graph has no S in it. Delete one vertex that had an edge removed. We are left with n − 1 vertices and at most g(S, n) − 1 edges removed, with no S in the graph. Mathematical Reflections 1 (2008) 1 We use mathematical induction to prove our statement. The ﬁrst and the most tedious thing we need to do is to prove the statement for n ∈ {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k}. 1st case: n = k − 1 + l, 2 ≤ l ≤ k − 1. Using the formula above we have g(Kk, n) = l. Using induction on l we prove that g(Kk+1\\{e}, n) = g(Kk, n) = l. The base case l = 2: g(Kk+1\\{e}, k + 1) = g(Kk, k + 1) = 2 is true. Assume the statement holds for m = 2, . . . , l − 1. From the inequalities above we have l − 1 = g(Kk+1\\{e}, n − 1) < g(Kk+1\\{e}, n) ≤ g(Kk, n) = l. Thus g(Kk+1\\{e}, n) = g(Kk, n) = l, yielding f (Kk+1\\{e}, n) = f (Kk, n). 2nd case: n = 2k − 1. We have g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) ≥ k. Thus if we remove these edges there is a vertex v0 which has at least two adjacent edges removed. Then G\\{v0} that does not contain Kk+1\\{e} has at least g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 2) = k − 1 edges removed. It follows that g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) ≥ k + 1, hence k + 1 = g(Kk, 2k − 1) ≥ g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) ≥ k − 1 + 2 = k + 1. Thus g(Kk, 2k − 1) = g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) and we are done. 3rd case: n = 2k. Then g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) ≥ k + 2. Using the same idea we get g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k − 1) ≥ k + 3. Therefore k + 3 = g(Kk, 2k) ≥ g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k) ≥ k + 1 + 2 = k + 3, yielding g(Kk, 2k) = g(Kk+1\\{e}, 2k) and the statement is proved. Now, with the base cases for n ∈ {k + 1, k + 2, . . . , 2k} veriﬁed, we continue our mathematical induction. Assume the result holds for all positive integers less than n, n ≥ 2k. We prove the statement for n. Assume to the contrary that there is no subgraph Kk+1\\{e} in the graph G on n vertices with f (Kk, n) + 1 edges. From Turan’s Theorem, there is a subgraph Kk in G. Consider G\\Kk that has n − k vertices. Each of the vertices is connected to at most k − 2 vertices of Kk. Also using the induction hypothesis, G\\Kk has at most f (Kk, n − k) edges. Thus f (Kk+1\\{e}, n) ≤ (k − 1)k 2 + (n − k)(k − 2) + f (Kk, n − k). We want to prove the following inequality (k − 1)k 2 + (n − k)(k − 2) + f (Kk, n − k) ≤ f (Kk, n), which will give us the desired contradiction. Mathematical Reflections 1 (2008) 2 1st case: n = (k − 1)t. Then n − k = (k − 1)(t − 2) + k − 2. We have f (Kk, n) = (k − 2)(k − 1)t2 2 and f (Kk, n − k) = (k − 2) 2 · ((k − 1)(t − 2) 2 + k − 3). Then f (Kk, n) − f (Kk, n − k) = 2(k − 2)(k − 1)(t − 1) − (k − 3)(k − 2) 2 . Our inequality is equivalent to (k − 1)k 2 + (k − 2)(k − 1)(t − 1) − (k − 2) ≤ 2(k − 2)(k − 1)(t − 1) − (k − 3)(k − 2) 2 , or k2 − 4k + 5 ≤ (k − 2)(k − 1)(t − 1). It clear that this inequality is true for all k ≥ 3. 2nd case: n = (k − 1)t + r, 1 ≤ r ≤ k − 2. Then n − k = (k − 1)(t − 1) + r − 1. We have f (Kk, n) = k − 2 k − 1 · n2 − r2 2 + (r − 1)r 2 = (k − 2)t 2 ((k − 1)t + 2r) + (r − 1)r 2 and f (Kk, n − k) = k − 2 k − 1 · (n − k)2 − (r − 1)2 2 + (r − 2)(r − 1) 2 = (k − 2)(t − 1) 2 ((k − 1)(t − 1) + 2r − 2) + (r − 2)(r − 1) 2 = (k − 2)(t − 1) 2 ((k − 1)t + 2r) − (k − 2)(k + 1)(t − 1) 2 + (r − 2)(r − 1) 2 . It follows that f (Kk, n) − f (Kk, n − k) = (k − 2) 2 ((k − 1)t + 2r) + (k − 2)(k + 1)(t − 1) 2 + (r − 1) = (k − 2)k(t − 1) + (k − 2)(k − 1 + 2r) 2 + (r − 1). Thus our inequality is equivalent to (k − 1)k 2 +(k −2)((k −1)(t−1)+r −1) ≤ (k −2)k(t−1)+ (k − 2)(k − 1 + 2r) 2 +r −1, or (k − 1) + (k − 3)(r − 1) ≤ (k − 2)(t − 1) + r(k − 2), or 0 ≤ (k − 2)(t − 1) + r − 2, and we are done. Thus we proved a stronger result than Turan’s Theorem: If the number of edges in the graph ensures the existence of a k-clique, it will ensure the existence of a (k + 1)-clique without an edge.
