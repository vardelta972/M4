This is known as the base 10 representation. In general, for any natural n > 1, we can create a system where numbers are expressed using powers of n. For example, if n = 9, note that 3 × n 2 + 2 × n + 1 = 3 × 9 2 + 2 × 9 + 1 = 262. We denote this number 3 × 9 2 + 2 × 9 + 1 = 262 as (321)9. Another example: (253)9 = 2 × 9 2 + 5 × 9 + 3 = 210. In general, for any natural n > 1, base n representation is deﬁned as (akak−1 · · · a1a0)n = ak × nk + an−1 × nk−1 + · · · + a1 × n + a0. Example: How to express 2620 in base 9? First do the division algorithm: 2620 = 291 × 9 + 1 291 = 32 × 9 + 3 32 = 3 × 9 + 5 3 = 0 × 9 + 3. Now rewrite in the following manner: 2620 = 291 × 9 + 1 = (32 × 9 + 3) × 9 + 1 = 32 × 9 2 + 3 × 9 + 1 = (3 × 9 + 5) × 9 2 + 3 × 9 + 1 = 3 × 9 3 + 5 × 9 2 + 3 × 9 + 1 = (3531)9. Note: In base 10, the digits are 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9. In base n, the digits are 0, 1, . . . , n − 1. Another example: Convert (321)6 to base 10: (321)6 = 3 × 6 2 + 2 × 6 + 1 = 121 = (121)10. Convert (321)10 to base 6: (321)10 = (1253)6 (calculation shown in the above Brilliant webpage). Note: Multiplication by 10 is easier only in base 10. In base 9, multiplication by 9 is easier! Here is an example: (321)9 × 10 = 262 × 10 = 2620 = (3531)9 (321)9 × 9 = (3 × 9 2 + 2 × 9 + 1) × 9 = 3 × 9 3 + 2 × 9 2 + 1 × 9 = (3210)9. 1 Problem 1. THE SILVER BAR problem from the book Entertaining Mathematical Puzzles by Martin Gardner. We discussed it in detail. For a complete solution, please read the book (pages 6-9). Problem 2. A car has a faulty odometer, which proceeds from digit 3 to digit 5, always skipping the digit 4, regardless of position. For example, after 000339 it shows 000350 (instead of 000340); after 000353 it shows 000355, and so on. If the odometer shows 002051, what will be the actual distance travelled by the car? (The image is just for illustration) Solution: We begin by observing the following: Actual digit: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 What the odometer shows: 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 10 Thus the faulty odometer works with only 9 digits, instead of 10. Suppose there is another odometer that works in base 9. Observe that our faulty odometer works in exactly similar fashion, just with a diﬀerent set of digits: Digits of odometer: 0 1 2 3 5 6 7 8 9 Digits of base 9 odometer: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 (in base 9) Actual digit: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Actual distance Faulty odometer Base 9 odometer 3 3 (3)9 4 5 (4)9 5 6 (5)9 ... ... ... 8 9 (8)9 9 10 (10)9 10 11 (11)9 ... ... ... 12 13 (13)9 13 15 (14)9 14 16 (15)9 Thus, in order to get the correct distance from the faulty odometer, we have to ﬁrst convert the faulty reading into the reading of the base 9 odometer and then convert it to base 10. e.g., suppose the odometer shows 26. We convert it as: 267 → (256)9 = 2 × 9 2 + 5 × 9 + 6. Final answer for this problem: 002051 → (002041)9 = 2 × 9 3 + 0 × 9 2 + 4 × 9 + 1 = 1495. 2 Number Base Representations (day 2) Online Class 11 Saturday, July 18 Problem 1. The equation (166)b × (56)b = (8590)b is valid in some base b ≥ 10 (that is 1, 6, 5, 8, 9, 0 are digits in base b in the above equation). Find the sum of all possible values of b ≥ 10 satisfying the equation. Solution: First we convert the numbers written in base b to base 10: (166)b × (56)b = (8590)b ⇐⇒ (b2 + 6b + 6)(5b + 6) = (8b3 + 5b2 + 9b). We expand the LHS and bring everything to one side of the equation to get 3b3 − 31b2 − 57b − 36 = 0. All we have to do now is to solve the last equation. Note that we need b to be an integer such that the above equation holds, so it must hold that b | 36 and b ≥ 10. Hence possible values of b can be 12, 18 or 36. Luckily, our ﬁrst guess, that b = 12 works here. So using this we can factorize the above equation, as follows: 3b3 − 31b2 − 57b − 36 = 0 (3b3 − 36b2) + 5b2 − 57b − 36 = 0 (3b3 − 36b2) + (5b2 − 60b) + (3b − 36) = 0 (b − 12)(3b2 + 5b + 3) = 0. Now the last equation has only one positive integer root, namely b = 12. Answer : 12 Problem 2. Alice picks a polynomial p(x) with non-negative integer coeﬃcients. Bob can ask her what is the value of p(n) for any positive integer n of his choice. What is the minimum number of questions Bob needs to ask Alice, in order to determine p(x) completely? Solution: Suppose that the polynomial that Alice has in her mind, is the following: p(x) = akxk + · · · + a1x + a0. The answer to this problem is quite surprizing. We shall show that only two questions will suﬃce. To illustrate our idea, let us ﬁrst take a numerical example: Suppose Bob asks p(1) and Alice tells him that p(1) = 13. Then Bob asks p(13) and Alice tells him that p(13) = 2341. Can Bob recover the polynomial just from these information? Since p(1) = ak + ak−1 + · · · + a1 + a0 = 13, so either each ai is < 13 or there is just one non-zero coeﬃcient which is equal to 13. In the latter case, p(x) = 13xk, which would be immediate if p(13) is a power of 13. If that is not the case then each ai < 13. Here we have p(13) = 2341, so we are in the case where each ai ∈ {0, 1, 2, . . . , 12}. 3 Hence we can interpret the following as a representation in base 13 : p(13) = ak × 13 k + · · · + a1 × 13 + a0 = 2341. We write 2341 in base 13: 2341 = 133 + 11 × 13 + 1 . Since base 13 representation is unique, we can say that p(x) = x3 + 11x + 1. Conclusion: Bob can recover the polynomial with just two questions. First he asks what is p(1). If p(1) = n, then he asks what is p(n). HW for you: Write down the solution for a general value of p(1), say when p(1) = n. Comment: This is perhaps a better approach: if p(1) = n then ask for p(n + 1) instead of p(n). Since you know that p(1) = n, it is immediate that no digit is greater than n. Hence expressing p(n + 1) in base n + 1 will give you the coeﬃcients (as the digits in that representation). This idea is illustrated in the following problem. Problem 3. Let P (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + anxn be a polynomial in which ai is non-negative integer for each 0 ≤ i ≤ n. If P (1) = 4 and P (5) = 136, what is P (3)? Solution: Let P (x) = a0 + a1x + a2x2 + · · · + akxk. Since P (1) = a0 + a1 + · · · + ak = 4, and each ai is a non-negative integer, we conclude that each coeﬃcient is less than or equal to 4. Hence, P (5) = ak5 k + · · · + a15 + a0 = 136 can be interpreted as the base 5 representation of 136. Thus, we can just express 136 in base 5 and hence obtain the coeﬃcients of P (x) from the digits of that base 5 representation. Note that 136 = 53 + 2 × 5 + 1. So we conclude that P (x) = x3 + 2x + 1. Hence P (3) = 34. Answer : 34 Problem 4. Let n be a positive integer and p be a prime. Deﬁne vp(n!) as the largest exponent r of prime p such that pr divides n!. For instance, v2(10!) = 8. Show that, vp(n!) = n − dp(n) p − 1 where dp(n) is the sum of digits of n in base p. Solution: Suppose that n = a0 + a1p + a2p2 + · · · + akpk is the base p representation of n, where a0, a1, . . . , ak are all 0, 1, 2, . . . , p − 1 (digits in base p). So here dp(n) = (sum of digits of n in base p) = a0 + a1 + · · · + ak. We know that the largest exponent of prime p that divides n! is given by vp(n!) = ⌊ n p ⌋ + ⌊ n p2 ⌋ + ⌊ n p3 ⌋ + · · · + ⌊ n pk ⌋ . Because the largest (k + 1)-digited number in base p is less than pk+1 (HW: prove it), hence we have ⌊n/pi⌋ = 0 for each i > k. This is why we did not write the other terms (for pk+1, p k+2, . . . ) in the above summation. 4 Now we shall ﬁnd ⌊n/p⌋, ⌊n/p 2⌋, . . . . one by one, as follows. n = a0 + a1p + a2p2 + · · · + akpk =⇒ n/p = a0/p + a1 + a2p + a3p2 · · · + akpk−1 =⇒ ⌊n/p⌋ = a1 + a2p + a3p2 · · · + akpk−1 =⇒ ⌊n/p⌋/p = a1/p + a2 + a3p + · · · + akpk−2 =⇒ ⌊n/p2⌋ = 0 + a2 + a3p + · · · + akpk−2 (since ⌊n/p⌋/p = ⌊n/p2⌋) ... ... ... =⇒ ⌊n/pk⌋ = 0 + 0 + · · · + ak I used red color to indicate that those terms will vanish when we take the ﬂoor of both sides. Next we shall sum up the above equations, to ﬁnd vp(n!). The key idea is to group up terms that contain same ai’s (see below). vp(n!) = ⌊ n p ⌋ + ⌊ n p2 ⌋ + ⌊ n p3 ⌋ + · · · + ⌊ n pk ⌋ = a1 + a2(1 + p) + a3(1 + p + p2) + · · · + ak(1 + p + p2 + · · · + pk−1) = a1 + a2 p2 − 1 p − 1 + a3 p3 − 1 p − 1 + · · · + ak pk − 1 p − 1 = a1(p − 1) + a2(p2 − 1) + a3(p3 − 1) + · · · + ak(pk − 1) p − 1 = n − (a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + ak) p − 1 (recall, n = a0 + a1p + a2p2 + · · · + akpk) = n − dp(n) p − 1 (recall, dp(n) = a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · + ak). This completes our proof. □ Corollary. If a be the largest exponent of 2 contained in n! and b be the number of 1’s in the binary (base 2) representation of n, then show that n = a + b.
