Bhandarkar April 20th, 2011 1 Introduction In this lecture I will outline several problem solving techniques in the general topic of sequences and series. I hope that today I will be able to cater to everyone’s inner problem solver and I encourage you to work either in groups or alone to solve the provided challenge problems. 2 Techniques 2.1 Telescoping Example (1): Compute ∞∑ n=1 1 n(n + 1) = 1 1(2) + 1 2(3) + 1 3(4) + 1 4(5) + . . . Hmph. This is deﬁnitely neither a geometric nor an arithmetic series, so how do we even solve this problem? The key to realizing the telescoping nature of this sum is through partial fraction decompositions. I quickly run by on the board how we may ﬁnd that 1 n(n+1) = 1 n − 1 n+1 . Thanks to this fact we have that: ∞∑ n=1 1 n(n + 1) = ( 1 − 1 2 ) + ( 1 2 − 1 3 ) + ( 1 3 − 1 4 ) + · · · = 1. Clearly, telescoping is quite the powerful technique and through employing clever factorization strategies tandem partial fraction decompositions many series problems may be solved almost im- mediately. Example (2): Compute ∞∑ n=1 4n n4 + 4 = 4 14 + 4 + 4(2) 24 + 4 + 4(3) 34 + 4 + 4(4) 44 + 4 + . . . I would like to highlight through this example how clever factorizations may reveal the telescoping nature of a series. Here, we use the Sophie Germain Identity: n4 + 4 = n4 + 4n2 + 4 − 4n2 = (n + 2)2 − (2n)2 = (n + 2n + 2)(n − 2n + 2). We note that 4n n4+4 = 1 n2−2n+2 − 1 n2+2n+2 . Using this fact, we telescope the sum and arrive at 3 2 for our answer. 2.2 Arithmetico-Geometric Arithmetico-Geometric series take the form where part of the sum is progressing arithmetically and the other is progressing geometrically. Most solutions incorporate clever manipulation of the original series itself. 1 Example (3): Compute S = ∞∑ n=1 (−1)n+1n 2n = 1 2 − 2 4 + 3 8 − 4 16 + . . . The geometric nature of the denominator tempts us to divide by 2 and add back to our original series. S = 1 2 − 2 4 + 3 8 − 4 16 + 5 32 + . . . S 2 = 1 4 − 2 8 + 3 16 − 4 32 + . . . From this, we have that 3S 2 = ∑∞ n=1 (−1)n+1 2n = 1 3 . Therefore, S = 2 9 . (Source: TJARML Practice) 2.3 Combinatorial Sums I claim a three step plan to evaluate any combinatorial sum: 1. Simplify through Identities 2. Apply Binomial Expansions 3. Work Backwards to the Combinatorics Problem Identities: The following identities are extremely powerful in discovering the symmetry of a combinatorial sum and overall simpliﬁcation. ( n k ) = ( n n − k ) (n 0 ) + (n 1 ) + (n 2 ) + ( n 3 ) + · · · + ( n n ) = 2n ( k k ) + (k + 1 k ) + ( k + 2 k ) + · · · + ( n k ) = ( n + 1 k + 1 ) r∑ k=0 ( m k )( n r − k ) = ( m + n r ) Binomial Expansions: Versatility with binomial expansions is crucial in some combinatorial sums. Be comfortable with the expansions of (1 ± i)n and the binomial theorem generalized to non-integer powers: (x + y)n = ( n 0 )xny0 + (n 1 ) xn−1y1 + (n 2 ) xn−2y2 + . . . Lastly, Working Backwards to the Combinatorics Problem is a powerful technique in trans- lating from an algebraic sum to combinatorial arguments. 2 Example (4): Simplify n∑ i=1 i (n i ) = (n 1 ) + 2( n 2 ) + 3(n 3 ) + · · · + n( n n ) We apply one of the identies: S = ( n n−1 ) + 2 ( n n−2 ) + · · · + (n − 1) (n 1) + n(n 0). Adding back to the original sum, we have 2S = n( (n 0) + (n 1) + · · · + (n n )). Therefore, S = n2n−1. 2.4 Polynomial Sums Polynomial sums are encountered quite frequently in the realm of contest math, but have you ever wondered how to arrive at the closed form of ∑n i=1 i3 or how to generalize to greater powers? Dis- crete Calculus deﬁnitely provides a powerful outlet in doing so, but today I would like to provide a simpler analysis bridging what we learned from Combinatorial Sums. Example (5): Arrive at the closed form of n∑ i=1 i 3 We will say that i3 = a1(i 3 ) + a2(i 2) + a3(i 1 ), where a1, a2, and a3 are coeﬃcients we must de- termine. Through expanding the combinations, we realize that this boils down in the same we did partial fraction decompositions: i3 = a1 ( i(i−1)(i−2) 6 ) + a2 ( i(i−1) 2 ) + a3i. By cleverly plugging in i = 0, 1, 2, we may determine a1 = 6, a2 = 6; a3 = 1. This means that: n∑ i=1 i 3 = n∑ i=1 ( 6(i 3 ) + 6(i 2 ) + (i 1 )) = 6(n + 1 4 ) + 6 (n + 1 3 ) + ( n + 1 2 ) = ( n(n + 1) 2 )2, as we learned from Combinatorial Sums. This powerful approach may be generalized to even further powers of the index. 2.5 Nested Radicals Evaluation of nested radicals hinges on identifying the recursive nature of the sum at hand. Example (6): Compute v u u √ 1 + 2 √ 1 + 3 √ 1 + 4√ 1 + 5√1 + . . . We will deﬁne a function f (x) = √ 1 + x √ 1 + (x + 1)√ 1 + (x + 2)√1 + . . .. We then have f (x) = √ 1 + xf (x + 1) or [f (x)]2 = 1+xf (x+1). The left hand side is of order 2n, whereas the right hand side is of order n + 1, so we know that our solution is linear (n = 1). By plugging in f (x) = ax + b, we discover that the function f (x) = x + 1 satisﬁes this relation. Our sum is f(2), giving us a ﬁnal answer of 3. (Source: Ramanujan’s Notebooks) 2.6 Trignometric Sums Often we must expose the telescoping nature of trignometric sums to get to the heart of the sum. The following are some helpful trignometric identities for telescoping. 3 tan−1 x − tan−1 y = tan−1 x−y 1+xy mod π sin(α + β) + sin(α − β) = 2 sin(α) cos(β) cos(α − β) − cos(α + β) = 2 sin(α) sin(β) Symmetry, like cos 180 − x = − cos x, is also another powerful tool in evaluating trignometric sums. Example (7): Compute cos( π 7 ) − cos( 2π 7 ) + cos( 3π 7 ) This is only three terms, but it’s already looking nasty! Hoping things will telescope we look to the second identity, S = 2 sin π/7 2 sin π/7 (cos( π 7 )−cos( 2π 7 )+cos( 3π 7 )) = sin(2π/7)+sin(π/7)−sin(3π/7)+sin(4π/7)−sin(2π/7) 2 sin π/7 . This simpliﬁes to sin π/7 2 sin π/7 = 1 2 and demonstrates telescoping is a powerful technique in evaluating trignometric series. 3 Problems 1. Evaluate ∞∑ n=1 n2 2n 2.
