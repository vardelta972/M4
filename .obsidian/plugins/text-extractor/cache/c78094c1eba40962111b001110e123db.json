Deﬁne a sequence by setting a1 = n and, for each k > 1, letting ak be the unique integer in the range 0 ≤ ak ≤ k − 1 for which a1 + a2 + · · · + ak is divisible by k. For instance, when n = 9 the obtained sequence is 9, 1, 2, 0, 3, 3, 3, . . . . Prove that for any n the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . eventually becomes constant. First Solution: For k ≥ 1, let sk = a1 + a2 + · · · + ak. We have sk+1 k + 1 < sk+1 k = sk + ak+1 k ≤ sk + k k = sk k + 1. On the other hand, for each k, sk/k is a positive integer. Therefore sk+1 k + 1 ≤ sk k , and the sequence of quotients sk/k is eventually constant. If sk+1/(k + 1) = sk/k, then ak+1 = sk+1 − sk = (k + 1)sk k − sk = sk k , showing that the sequence ak is eventually constant as well. Second Solution: For k ≥ 1, let sk = a1 + a2 + · · · + ak and sk k = qk. Since ak ≤ k − 1, for k ≥ 2, we have sk = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + ak ≤ n + 1 + 2 + · · · + (k − 1) = n + k(k − 1) 2 . Let m be a positive integer such that n ≤ m(m+1) 2 (such an integer clearly exists). Then qm = sm m ≤ n m + m − 1 2 ≤ m + 1 2 + m − 1 2 = m. We claim that qm = am+1 = am+2 = am+3 = am+4 = . . . . 1 This follows from the fact that the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is uniquely determined and choosing am+i = qm, for i ≥ 1, satisﬁes the range condition 0 ≤ am+i = qm ≤ m ≤ m + i − 1, and yields sm+i = sm + iqm = mqm + iqm = (m + i)qm. Third Solution: For k ≥ 1, let sk = a1 + a2 + · · · + ak. We claim that for some m we have sm = m(m−1). To this end, consider the sequence which computes the diﬀerences between sk and k(k − 1), i.e., whose k-th term is sk − k(k − 1). Note that the ﬁrst term of this sequence is positive (it is equal to n) and that its terms are strictly decreasing since (sk − k(k − 1)) − (sk+1 − (k + 1)k) = 2k − ak+1 ≥ 2k − k = k ≥ 1. Further, a negative term cannot immediately follow a positive term. Suppose otherwise, namely that sk > k(k − 1) and sk+1 < (k + 1)k. Since sk and sk+1 are divisible by k and k + 1, respectively, we can tighten the above inequalities to sk ≥ k2 and sk+1 ≤ (k + 1)(k − 1) = k2 − 1. But this would imply that sk > sk+1, a contradiction. We conclude that the sequence of diﬀerences must eventually include a term equal to zero. Let m be a positive integer such that sm = m(m − 1). We claim that m − 1 = am+1 = am+2 = am+3 = am+4 = . . . . This follows from the fact that the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . is uniquely determined and choosing am+i = m − 1, for i ≥ 1, satisﬁes the range condition 0 ≤ am+i = m − 1 ≤ m + i − 1, and yields sm+i = sm + i(m − 1) = m(m − 1) + i(m − 1) = (m + i)(m − 1). This problem was suggested by Sam Vandervelde. 2 2. A square grid on the Euclidean plane consists of all points (m, n), where m and n are integers. Is it possible to cover all grid points by an inﬁnite family of discs with non- overlapping interiors if each disc in the family has radius at least 5? Solution: It is not possible. The proof is by contradiction. Suppose that such a covering family F exists. Let D(P, ρ) denote the disc with center P and radius ρ. Start with an arbitrary disc D(O, r) that does not overlap any member of F. Then D(O, r) covers no grid point. Take the disc D(O, r) to be maximal in the sense that any further enlargement would cause it to violate the non-overlap condition. Then D(O, r) is tangent to at least three discs in F. Observe that there must be two of the three tangent discs, say D(A, a) and D(B, b), such that ∠AOB ≤ 120 ◦. By the Law of Cosines applied to triangle ABO, (a + b)2 ≤ (a + r)2 + (b + r)2 + (a + r)(b + r), which yields ab ≤ 3(a + b)r + 3r2, and thus 12r2 ≥ (a − 3r)(b − 3r). Note that r < 1/ √2 because D(O, r) covers no grid point, and (a − 3r)(b − 3r) ≥ (5 − 3r)2 because each disc in F has radius at least 5. Hence 2 √3r ≥ (5 − 3r), which gives 5 ≤ (3+2 √ 3)r < (3+2 √3)/ √2 and thus 5 √2 < 3+2 √3. Squaring both sides of this inequality yields 50 < 21 + 12 √3 < 21 + 12 · 2 = 45. This contradiction completes the proof. Remark: The above argument shows that no covering family exists where each disc has radius greater than (3 + 2 √3)/ √2 ≈ 4.571. In the other direction, there exists a covering family in which each disc has radius √13/2 ≈ 1.802. Take discs with this radius centered at points of the form (2m + 4n + 1 2, 3m + 1 2), where m and n are integers. Then any grid point is within √13/2 of one of the centers and the distance between any two centers is at least √13. The extremal radius of a covering family is unknown. This problem was suggested by Gregory Galperin. 3. Let S be a set containing n2 + n − 1 elements, for some positive integer n. Suppose that the n-element subsets of S are partitioned into two classes. Prove that there are at least n pairwise disjoint sets in the same class. Solution: In order to apply induction, we generalize the result to be proved so that it reads as follows: 3 Proposition. If the n-element subsets of a set S with (n+1)m−1 elements are partitioned into two classes, then there are at least m pairwise disjoint sets in the same class. Proof. Fix n and proceed by induction on m. The case of m = 1 is trivial. Assume m > 1 and that the proposition is true for m − 1. Let P be the partition of the n- element subsets into two classes. If all the n-element subsets belong to the same class, the result is obvious. Otherwise select two n-element subsets A and B from diﬀerent classes so that their intersection has maximal size. It is easy to see that |A ∩ B| = n − 1. (If |A ∩ B| = k < n − 1, then build C from B by replacing some element not in A ∩ B with an element of A not already in B. Then |A ∩ C| = k + 1 and |B ∩ C| = n − 1 and either A and C or B and C are in diﬀerent classes.) Removing A∪B from S, there are (n+1)(m−1)−1 elements left. On this set the partition induced by P has, by the inductive hypothesis, m − 1 pairwise disjoint sets in the same class. Adding either A or B as appropriate gives m pairwise disjoint sets in the same class. Remark: The value n2 + n − 1 is sharp. A set S with n2 + n − 2 elements can be split into a set A with n2 − 1 elements and a set B of n − 1 elements. Let one class consist of all n-element subsets of A and the other consist of all n-element subsets that intersect B. Then neither class contains n pairwise disjoint sets. This problem was suggested by Andr´as Gy´arf´as. 4. An animal with n cells is a connected ﬁgure consisting of n equal-sized square cells.1 The ﬁgure below shows an 8-cell animal. A dinosaur is an animal with at least 2007 cells. It is said to be primitive if its cells cannot be partitioned into two or more dinosaurs. Find with proof the maximum number of cells in a primitive dinosaur. 1Animals are also called polyominoes. They can be deﬁned inductively. Two cells are adjacent if they share a complete edge. A single cell is an animal, and given an animal with n-cells, one with n + 1 cells is obtained by adjoining a new cell by making it adjacent to one or more existing cells. 4 Solution: Let s denote the minimum number of cells in a dinosaur; the number this year is s = 2007. Claim: The maximum number of cells in a primitive dinosaur is 4(s − 1) + 1. First, a primitive dinosaur can contain up to 4(s − 1) + 1 cells. To see this, consider a dinosaur in the form of a cross consisting of a central cell and four arms with s − 1 cells apiece. No connected ﬁgure with at least s cells can be removed without disconnecting the dinosaur. The proof that no dinosaur with at least 4(s−1)+2 cells is primitive relies on the following result. Lemma. Let D be a dinosaur having at least 4(s − 1) + 2 cells, and let R (red) and B (black) be two complementary animals in D, i.e., R ∩ B = ∅ and R ∪ B = D. Suppose |R| ≤ s − 1. Then R can be augmented to produce animals ˜R ⊃ R and ˜B = D \\ ˜R such that at least one of the following holds: (i) | ˜R| ≥ s and | ˜B| ≥ s, (ii) | ˜R| = |R| + 1, (iii) |R| < | ˜R| ≤ s − 1. Proof. If there is a black cell adjacent to R that can be made red without disconnecting B, then (ii) holds. Otherwise, there is a black cell c adjacent to R whose removal disconnects B. Of the squares adjacent to c, at least one is red, and at least one is black, otherwise B would be disconnected. Then there are at most three resulting components C1, C2, C3 of B after the removal of c. Without loss of generality, C3 is the largest of the remaining components. (Note that C1 or C2 may be empty.) Now C3 has at least ⌈(3s − 2)/3⌉ = s cells. Let ˜B = C3. Then | ˜R| = |R| + |C1| + |C2| + 1. If | ˜B| ≤ 3s − 2, then | ˜R| ≥ s and (i) holds. If | ˜B| ≥ 3s − 1 then either (ii) or (iii) holds, depending on whether | ˜R| ≥ s or not. Starting with |R| = 1, repeatedly apply the Lemma. Because in alternatives (ii) and (iii) |R| increases but remains less than s, alternative (i) eventually must occur. This shows that no dinosaur with at least 4(s − 1) + 2 cells is primitive. This problem was suggested by Reid Barton. 5 5. Prove that for every nonnegative integer n, the number 7 7n + 1 is the product of at least 2n + 3 (not necessarily distinct) primes. Solution: The proof is by induction. The base is provided by the n = 0 case, where 7 70 + 1 = 7 1 + 1 = 2 3. To prove the inductive step, it suﬃces to show that if x = 7 2m−1 for some positive integer m then (x7 + 1)/(x + 1) is composite. As a consequence, x7 + 1 has at least two more prime factors than does x + 1. To conﬁrm that (x7 + 1)/(x + 1) is composite, observe that x7 + 1 x + 1 = (x + 1) 7 − ((x + 1) 7 − (x7 + 1)) x + 1 = (x + 1) 6 − 7x(x5 + 3x4 + 5x3 + 5x2 + 3x + 1) x + 1 = (x + 1) 6 − 7x(x4 + 2x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 1) = (x + 1) 6 − 7 2m(x2 + x + 1) 2 = {(x + 1) 3 − 7 m(x2 + x + 1)}{(x + 1) 3 + 7 m(x2 + x + 1)} Also each factor exceeds 1. It suﬃces to check the smaller one; √7x ≤ x gives (x + 1) 3 − 7 m(x2 + x + 1) = (x + 1) 3 − √7x(x2 + x + 1) ≥ x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 1 − x(x2 + x + 1) = 2x2 + 2x + 1 ≥ 113 > 1. Hence (x7 + 1)/(x + 1) is composite and the proof is complete. This problem was suggested by Titu Andreescu. 6. Let ABC be an acute triangle with ω, Ω, and R being its incircle, circumcircle, and cir- cumradius, respectively. Circle ωA is tangent internally to Ω at A and tangent externally to ω. Circle ΩA is tangent internally to Ω at A and tangent internally to ω. Let PA and QA denote the centers of ωA and ΩA, respectively. Deﬁne points PB, QB, PC, QC analogously. Prove that 8PAQA · PBQB · PCQC ≤ R3, 6 with equality if and only if triangle ABC is equilateral. Solution: Let the incircle touch the sides AB, BC, and CA at C1, A1, and B1, respectively. Set AB = c, BC = a, CA = b. By equal tangents, we may assume that AB1 = AC1 = x, BC1 = BA1 = y, and CA1 = CB1 = z. Then a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y. By the AM-GM inequality, we have a ≥ 2 √yz, b ≥ 2 √zx, and c ≥ 2 √xy. Multiplying the last three inequalities yields abc ≥ 8xyz, (†), with equality if and only if x = y = z; that is, triangle ABC is equilateral. Let k denote the area of triangle ABC. By the Extended Law of Sines, c = 2R sin ∠C. Hence k = ab sin ∠C 2 = abc 4R or R = abc 4k . (‡) We are going to show that PAQA = xa2 4k . (∗) In exactly the same way, we can also establish its cyclic analogous forms PBQB = yb2 4k and PCQC = zc2 4k . Multiplying the last three equations together gives PAQA · PBQB · PCQC = xyza2b2c2 64k3 . Further considering (†) and (‡), we have 8PAQA · PBQB · PCQC = 8xyza2b2c2 64k3 ≤ a3b3c3 64k3 = R3, with equality if and only if triangle ABC is equilateral. Hence it suﬃces to show (∗). Let r, rA, r′ A denote the radii of ω, ωA, ΩA, respectively. We consider the inversion I with center A and radius x. Clearly, I(B1) = B1, I(C1) = C1, and I(ω) = ω. Let ray AO intersect ωA and ΩA at S and T , respectively. It is not diﬃcult to see that AT > AS, because ω is tangent to ωA and ΩA externally and internally, respectively. Set S1 = I(S) and T1 = I(T ). Let ℓ denote the line tangent to Ω at A. Then the image of ωA (under the inversion) is the line (denoted by ℓ1) passing through S1 and parallel to ℓ, and the image of ΩA is the line (denoted by ℓ2) passing through T1 and parallel to 7 ℓ. Furthermore, since ω is tangent to both ωA and ΩA, ℓ1 and ℓ2 are also tangent to the image of ω, which is ω itself. Thus the distance between these two lines is 2r; that is, S1T1 = 2r. Hence we can consider the following conﬁguration. (The darkened circle is ωA, and its image is the darkened line ℓ1.) A B C PA QA I HA A1 B1 C1 O S T S1 T1 l l1 l2 By the deﬁnition of inversion, we have AS1 · AS = AT1 · AT = x2. Note that AS = 2rA, AT = 2r′ A, and S1T1 = 2r. We have rA = x2 2AS1 . and r′ A = x2 2AT1 = x2 2(AS1 − 2r) . Hence PAQA = AQA − APA = r′ A − rA = x2 2 ( 1 AS1 − 2r + 1 AS1 ) . Let HA be the foot of the perpendicular from A to side BC. It is well known that ∠BAS1 = ∠BAO = 90 ◦ − ∠C = ∠CAHA. Since ray AI bisects ∠BAC, it follows that rays AS1 and AHA are symmetric with respect to ray AI. Further note that both line ℓ1 8 (passing through S1) and line BC (passing through HA) are tangent to ω. We conclude that AS1 = AHA. In light of this observation and using the fact 2k = AHA · BC = (AB + BC + CA)r, we can compute PAQA as follows: PAQA = x2 2 ( 1 AHA − 2r − 1 AHA ) = x2 4k ( 2k AHA − 2r − 2k AHA ) = x2 4k ( 1 1 BC − 2 AB+BC+CA − BC ) = x2 4k ( 1 1 y+z − 1 x+y+z − (y + z) ) = x2 4k ( (y + z)(x + y + z) x − (y + z)) = x(y + z)2 4k = xa2 4k , establishing (∗). Our proof is complete. Note: Trigonometric solutions of (∗) are also possible. Query: For a given triangle, how can one construct ωA and ΩA by ruler and compass?
