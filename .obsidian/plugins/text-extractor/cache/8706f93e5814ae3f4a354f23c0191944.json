It can be somewhat loosely deﬁned as the study of the integers. Unfortunately, most grade school mathematics curricula don’t cover number theory at all, leaving students clueless about a highly fascinating subject. Because of this, most contest problems involving number theory are relatively easy to people that have a decent grasp of the theory. Basic number theory itself is actually very simple, and number theoretic problems are often very easy to understand. Advanced number theory can get trickier, and the best way to get a good intuition about such problems is to practice a lot. And then, of course, you have the insane unsolved problems. Have you ever heard of Fermat’s Last Theorem? It states that there are no positive integer solutions to x n + yn = zn for n > 2. This problem remained open for 357 years. 2 Notation If there’s something in this section you don’t understand, don’t worry, it will be explained in its respective section. This is mainly intended as a reference. • When we write a | b, we mean that a divides b, as in there exists an integer c such that a = bc. For example, 3 | 12. If a does not divide b, then we write a ∤ b. An example would be 3 ∤ 11. • gcd (a, b) denotes the greatest common denominator of a and b, which is the largest integer that divides both numbers. This is usually abbreviated to (a, b). Example: (12, 20) = 4. • The least common multiple of two numbers is the smallest number that they both divide. This is written [a, b], and an example would be [12, 20] = 60. • N means the natural numbers, Z the integers, Z + the positive integers, Z/nZ the integers (mod n), Q the rational numbers, Q ′ the irrational numbers, R the real numbers, and C the complex numbers. • n, m, and k are commonly used as integers. p and q are usually primes. If we want a variable, we usually use x, y, and z, with w and z often used for complex numbers. Constants are often a, b, and c. i, j, and k are often indices or dummy variables. f and g are quite often functions. Roots of unity are usually something like ω or ξ. • ϕ : F → F ′ means that ϕ is a mapping from F to F ′. • ⇔ means iﬀ means if and only if. • A ⇒ B means if A, then B. • s.t is such that. • ∑ d|n means a sum over all the divisors d of n. 1 3 The Theorems 3.1 Modular Arithmetic Consider a number system in which we replace each number with its remainder on division by some ﬁxed integer n. Well, this is a perfectly valid sysem to do arithmetic in! We call this arithmetic “modulo n”, or (mod n). As you may have seen above, we denote the integers (mod n) as Z/nZ. Let’s consider some examples of arithmetic in Z/5Z: 24 ≡ 4 (mod 5) 3 + 4 ≡ 2 (mod 5) 12 · 23121321789321378912285 ≡ 12 · 0 ≡ 0 (mod 5) As you can see, we have a nice system. But watch out! You can’t cancel multiplication all of the time. Why? Because x ≡ 0 (mod n) does not mean x = 0, and we can have xy ≡ 0 (mod n) even if neither x nor y is zero. An example of this is 20 ≡ 2 (mod 6), but 10 ̸≡ 1 (mod 6). What happened? Consider a number a that divides the product of two others: a | bc. Clearly a can be split into parts a0 and a1 such that a0a1 = a, a0 | b, and a1 | c. Importantly, if p is a prime, the only way to split it into two parts is p · 1. Thus if p | bc, then p | b or p | c. By the deﬁnition of a | bc, we have that ka = bc for some integer k, so k = bc a = b a0 c a1 for a0 and a1 that divide b and c. This means that both b a0 and c a1 are integers, and thus b a0 | bc a . But since a0 divides both a and b, it divides (a, b). Thus b (a,b) | b a0 , leading us to the conclusion that b (a, b) | bc a (1) Let’s now look at the general case. We have ac ≡ bc (mod n) (2) This means that ac and bc diﬀer by some number nk for some k. This means that a and b diﬀer by nk c , which must be an integer, and so c | nk. By (1), we have that n (n,c) | nk c . Thus a − b = nk c which means a − b ≡ 0 (mod n/(n, c)), and (2) becomes a ≡ b (mod n/(n, c)) (3) Going back to our previous example, we have 20 ≡ 2 (mod 6) ⇒ 2 · 10 ≡ 2 · 1 (mod 6) ⇒ 10 ≡ 1 (mod 6/(6, 2)) ⇒ 10 ≡ 1 (mod 3) (4) Note that from this we have ac ≡ bc (mod n) implies a ≡ b (mod n) iﬀ (n, c) = 1. 3.1.1 Exercises 1. Evaluate (1440983213234) 123321 (mod 5). 2. Prove that if ab is a perfect square and (a, b) = 1, then both a and b must be perfect squares. 3. Solve the congruence 1232x ≡ 9045 (mod 24) 2 3.2 Prime Mods Prime mods are nice because we can cancel multiplication in them. This is clear because if we use our canceling equation (3), we note that (p, c) will be 1 since p is prime, so we have ac ≡ bc (mod p) ⇒ a ≡ b (mod p), as long as c is not a multiple of p. This is because if p | c, then c ≡ 0 (mod p) and our equation before would be meaningless. We can do more. Since ac ̸≡ bc unless a ≡ b, we know that the sequence {0, a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} (5) consists of all residues (mod p). Thus it is a permutation of the set {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1} Make sure you understand this. This idea comes up everywhere in number theory. Now we get to an interesting idea. Notice that the set (5) will always contain one element that is 1 (mod p). Thus for every non-zero a, we can ﬁnd some number b such that ab ≡ 1. What other number system is this like? More on this later. 3.3 Fermat’s Little Theorem If we take the powers of some number a ̸≡ 0 (mod p), the numbers a 2, a 3, etc. cannot all be diﬀerent, since they are all between 0 and p − 1. Thus two must be the same, so let’s say a j = a k. Then if we let j > k, we have a j−k ≡ 1 (mod p). Thus the powers of a with be 1 at some point, and we call the least number ord(a) (mod p) (the order of a (mod p)), or ordp(a) for short. Now consider what we said above when we talked about {0, a, 2a, 3a, . . . , (p − 1)a} being a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , p − 1}. This means that we can say a · 2a · 3a · · · (p − 1)a ≡ 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 1) (mod p) canceling 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 1) from both sides leaves a p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) This very important theorem is known as Fermat’s Little Theorem. Fermat’s Little Theorem 3.3.1. For any integer a and any prime p, a p ≡ a (mod p) (6) 3.4 Euler’s Totient and Generalization Let’s try to ﬁnd an analog of Fermat’s Little Theorem for (mod n), where we let n be any integer instead of only primes. Notice we will only be able to cancel numbers from both sides the way we did when n was prime if the number being canceled is relatively prime to n. In addition, a will have to be relatively prime to n (do you see why?). Let S = {1, k0, k2, . . . , n − 1} be the set of all integers less than and relatively prime to n. We can do something similar to what we did before, namely a · k0a · k1a · · · (m − 1)a ≡ 1 · k0 · k1 · · · (n − 1) (mod n) We need a way to count the numbers less than and relatively prime to n. Therefore, we deﬁne a function ϕ(n) that returns the desired number. This is known as Euler’s totient function. Now we can do what we did before and cancel 1 · k0 · k1 · · · (n − 1) from both sides, yielding a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) This is known as Euler’s generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem. 3 Euler’s Generalization 3.4.1. For any relatively prime integers a and n, a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) (7) 3.4.1 Exercises 1. Explain why (7) is considered a generalization of Fermat’s Little Theorem. 2. Calculate ϕ(12). 3. Find the units digit of 4 4444 . 4. Find ϕ(pk) for p prime and any positive integer k. 5. Prove that ϕ is multiplicative, that is, ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n) if m and n are relatively prime. 6. From the result of the two earlier problems, ﬁnd an explicit formula for ϕ(n), n being any positive integer. 3.5 Wilson’s Theorem Wilson’s Theorem 3.5.1. For any odd prime p, (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p) (8) Remember that in any prime mod, a number a has a unique inverse that we’ll call a −1 such that aa −1 = 1. We use this fact in the proof of Wilson’s Theorem. Proof. Consider (p − 1)! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · (p − 2) · (p − 1). Let’s write the ﬁnal element as −1, since obviously p − 1 ≡ −1 (mod p). Notice that −1 is its own inverse. In this it is unique: every other element a (except 1, of course) will have a distinct inverse such that aa −1 = 1, so we can replace all of these element-inverse pairs with ones. We now have 1 · 1 · · · 1 · −1 ≡ −1, and thus we have proven Wilson’s Theorem. 3.5.1 Exercises 1. Prove that the function F (j) = ⌊cos π (j − 1)! + 1 j ⌋ returns 1 when j is prime and 0 when j is composite. 3.6 Divisor Sums There is a useful formula for the number of the divisors of a number. If the prime factorization is n = pe1 1 pe2 2 · · · pek k then the number of the divisors of n, τ (n), is τ (n) = (e1 + 1)(e2 + 1) · · · (ek + 1) (9) Since the proof of (9) is pretty easy and rather well known, let’s turn it into an exercise in summation notation. Proof. We are seeking the number of divisors of pe1 1 pe2 2 · · · pek k . Note that our desired result is equivalent to ∑ d|n 1 4 Now, look at the following nested sum. Can you see how this is equivalent to the previous sum? e1∑ i1=0 e2∑ i2=0 · · · ek∑ ik=0 1 Now, the solution is simple. We break apart the nested sum, and obtain the formula. τ (n) = e1∑ i1=0 e2∑ i2=0 · · · ek∑ ik=0 1 (10) = ( e1∑ i1=0 1 ) ( e2∑ i2=0 1 ) · · · ( ek∑ ik=0 1 ) (11) = (e1 + 1)(e2 + 1) · · · (ek + 1) (12) Once we’ve derived the formula for the number of divisors, it is very easy to obtain a formula for the sum of the divisors, σ(n). All it takes is to realize that σ(n) = ∑ d|n d (13) = e1∑ i1=0 e2∑ i2=0 · · · ek∑ ik=0 pi1 1 pi2 2 · · · pik k (14) = ( e1∑ i1=0 pi1 1 ) ( e2∑ i2=0 pi2 2 ) · · · ( ek∑ ik=0 pik k ) (15) = (1 + p1 + p2 1 + · · · pe1 1 )(1 + p2 + p2 2 + · · · pe2 2 ) · · · (1 + pk + p2 k + · · · pek k ) (16) It is clear that we can extend this to the sum of the kth powers of the divisors, σk(n). This result is left as an exercise to the reader. It’s best to use these formulas to appreciate them. So, let’s ﬁnd the number and then the sum of the divisors of 666. We know that 666 = 2 · 32 · 37. Thus τ (666) = (1 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 12. Now we plug the numbers into the divisor sum formula. σ(666) = (1 + 2)(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 37) = 3 · 12 · 38 = 1368 3.6.1 Exercises 1. Find the sum of the divisors of the sum of the divisors of 1000. 2. Make the formula for σ(n) simpler using the formula for the sum of a geometric sequence. 3. A number is perfect if the sum of its divisors (excluding itself) is equal to itself. The ﬁrst three are 6, 28, and 496. Prove that any number of the form 2k(2 k+1 − 1) is perfect if 2 k+1 − 1 is prime. 4. Extend the above proof to show that all even perfect numbers are of the form 2 k(2 k+1 − 1). 3.7 Prime Number Facts There are an inﬁnite number of primes. Why? Well, if there were a ﬁnite number of them, they would make a ﬁnite set {2, 3, 5, . . . , pn} 5 But if that was so, 2 · 3 · 5 · · · pn + 1 would have no “prime” factors at all, which is a contradiction. Thus there are an inﬁnite number of primes. Dirichlet’s Theorem 3.7.1. If there is more than one prime in an inﬁnte arithmetic progression, then the arithmetic progression contains an inﬁnite number of primes. Proving Dirichlet’s theorem in the general case is very diﬃcult, however, so there isn’t a proof here. Green-Tao Theorem 3.7.1. There are arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions of primes. This is also very diﬃcult and was only recently proven. Bertrand’s Postulate 3.7.1. There is always a prime p such that for any n > 1, n < p < 2n. Bertrand’s postulate is more accurately called Chebyshev’s Theorem, because it was only postulated by Bertrand, whereas Chebyshev proved it. This is also takes too long to prove, even though the proof is relatively elementary. If you ever are trying to solve a problem, and your solution hinges on the truth of one of the following conjectures, it’s best to try something else. These have remained unsolved for decades or centuries . Goldbach Conjecture 3.7.1. Every even integer greater than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes. Twin Prime Conjecture 3.7.1. There are inﬁnitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also prime. Mersenne Prime Conjecture 3.7.1. There are inﬁnitely many primes of the form Mn = 2 n − 1. Palindromic Prime Conjecture 3.7.1. There are inﬁnitely many primes that are palindromic; that is, they are the same if their digits are reversed. Conjecture 3.7.1. an 2 + bn + c is prime for inﬁnitely many values of n, as long as a, b, and c are pairwise relatively prime. 3.8 Diophantine Equations A diophantine equation is an equation in which we are interested in only integer solutions. B´ezout’s Identity is the solution to a relatively easy Diophantine equation. When solving diophantine equations, you have to keep one thing in mind: you cannot just give a bunch of answers. You have to show they work, and that no other answers exist. Steps to Solve a Diophantine Equation 1. Write out the answers to the problem. In the case of, say, x + y = 0, you would write (n, −n) for n ∈ Z. 2. Show that your answers work. 3. Prove that you have given all the answers. Usually, this requires a bit of number theory. Methods for Solving Diophantine Equations • Take the equations in certain mods. For example, if you see squares, mod4 is good, since all squares are 0 or 1. If you see cubes, try mod9, since cubes are -1, 0, and 1. Mod 8 is good for squares a well. • Factor everything possible! • Substitution • Add conditions. If the equation is symmetrical, like a 2 + b2 + c 2 = (a + b + c)!, state that without a loss of generality, a ≥ b ≥ c. • Inﬁnite descent. This is where you assume an equation has solutions, and you consider the solution whose value is the smallest. Then, show there is another solution whose value is smaller-which is a contradiction, and thus there can be no solutions. Random important thing to know: the general primitive Pythagorean triple is given by (2rs, r2 − s 2, r2 + s 2). 6 4 Problems The only way you will get better is by doing problems, especially hard problems.
