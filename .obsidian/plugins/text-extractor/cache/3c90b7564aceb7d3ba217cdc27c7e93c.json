That is, we can ﬁnd scalars a1, . . . , an+1, not all zero, such that a1v1 + · · · + an+1vn+1 = 0. • Almost all linear algebra results (especially the ones related to rank) are true over any ﬁeld. For instance, the ﬁeld F2 is often useful for working with parity or incidence. However, note that we might not be able to use eigenvalues. • Suppose that A is an m × n matrix, then the subspace spanned by its columns has the same dimension as the subspace spanned by its rows. This common dimension number is called the rank of A. In particular, we have rank A ≤ min(m, n). • Rank-nullity theorem: rank A + nullity A = n. • rank(AB) ≤ min(rank A, rank B) • rank(A + B) ≤ rank A + rank B • A is invertible if and only if m = n = rank A. If A is a square matrix, then it is invertible if and only if there does not exist a nonzero vector v such that Av = 0. Or equivalently, none of the eigenvalues of A is zero. • The determinant of a square matrix A can be evaluated by taking a sum over all permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} det A = ∑ σ∈Sn(−1) sgn σa1σ(1)a2σ(2) · · · anσ(n). A matrix is invertible if an only if its determinant is nonzero. In F2, we no longer have to worry about the sign in front of the product. • If W is a subspace of V , denote W ⊥ = {v ∈ V | vtw = 0 ∀w ∈ W }, then dim W + dim W ⊥ = dim V. However, it’s not necessarily true that W ⊕ W ⊥ = V ! E.g., take W = {(0, 0), (1, 1)} in F2 2, then W ⊥ = W . • Suppose that we have a set of maps fi : V → R, and points vi ∈ V , 1 ≤ i ≤ n. If fi(vi) ̸= 0 and fi(vj) = 0 whenever i ̸= j, then f1, f2, . . . , fn are linearly independent. 1 MOP 2007 Black Group Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics Yufei Zhao Problem: (St. Petersburg) Students in a school go for ice cream in groups of at least two. After k > 1 groups have gone, every two students have gone together exactly once. Prove that the number of students in the school is at most k. Solution. There is a combinatorial solution which is somewhat long and non-intuitive. However, a much quicker (and more intuitive) solution is available using the tools of linear algebra. Let there be n students. Note if some student went for ice cream only once, then everyone else has to have gone with that student, due to the constraint that every pair of student have gone together exactly once. Furthermore, since each group consists of two students, no other groups can be formed. However, k > 1, so this situation cannot occur. Therefore, every student went for ice cream at least twice. Let us construct incidence vectors vi ∈ Rk, 1 ≤ 1 ≤ n, representing the students. That is, the j-th component of vi is 1 if student i went with the j-th group, and 0 otherwise. The condition that every two students have gone together exactly once translates into the dot product vi · vj = 1 for i ̸= j. The condition that every student went for ice cream at least twice translates into |vi|2 ≥ 2. We want to prove that n ≤ k. Suppose otherwise. Then {v1, . . . , vn} consists of at least k + 1 vectors in Rk, so they must be linearly dependent. It follows that there are real numbers α1, . . . , αn, not all zero, such that α1v1 + · · · + αnvn = 0. Let us square the above expression (i.e., taking the dot product with itself. We get 0 = n∑ i=1 α2 i |vi| 2 + 2 ∑ i<j αiαjvi · vj = n∑ i=1 α2 i |vi| 2 + 2 ∑ i<j αiαj = n∑ i=1 α2 i (|vi| 2 − 1 ) + ( n∑ i=1 αi )2 . However, the RHS expression is positive, since |vi|2 ≥ 2 and some αi is nonzero. Contradiction. Alternatively, we can use an incidence matrix to obtain a somewhat faster (albeit more tech- nically involved) solution. The incidence matrix M is a k × n matrix, where Mij is 1 if the i-th group includes student j. Using the notation in the previous solution, we can write this as M =   | | · · · | v1 v2 · · · vn | | · · · |   Consider the product M tM . Since vi ·vj = 1 for i ̸= j and |vi|2 ≥ 2 for all i, we see that M tM = J +A, where J is the n×n matrix with all entries 1, and A is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries. Note that J is positive semideﬁnite (meaning that xtJx ≥ 0 for all vectors x) and M is positive deﬁnite (meaning that xtJx > 0 for all x ̸= 0). Therefore, their sum J + A = M tM is positive deﬁnite. In particular, this means that M tM is invertible, so its rank is n. Since M is a k × n matrix, we conclude that k ≥ n. 2 MOP 2007 Black Group Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics Yufei Zhao Partially ordered sets (posets) Deﬁnition. A partially ordered set (or poset for short) P is a set, also denoted P , together with a binary relation denoted ≤ satisfying the following axioms: • (reﬂexivity) x ≤ x for all x ∈ P • (antisymmetry) If x ≤ y and y ≤ x, then x = y. • (transitivity) If x ≤ y and y ≤ z, then x ≤ z. An example of a poset is the set of all subsets of {1, 2, . . . , n} under the relation ⊂. This poset is sometimes called the Boolean algebra of rank n, and denoted Bn. The Hasse diagram is a simple way of representing (small) posets. We say that x covers y if x > y (i.e., x ≥ y and x ̸= y) and there is no z ∈ P such that x > z > y. If x covers y, then we draw x above y and connect them using a line segment. Note that in general, x > y if and only if x is above y and we trace a downward path from x to y in the Hasse diagram. The Hasse diagram for B3 is depicted below. {1, 2, 3} {1, 2} {1, 3} {2, 3} {1} {2} {3} ∅ There is one result about posets that has proven useful for olympiad problems. Before we state this result, let us go over some more terminology. Two elements x, y of a poset are called comparable if x ≥ y or x ≤ y, otherwise they are called incomparable. A chain is a sequence of elements a1 < a2 < · · · < ak, and an antichain is a set of pairwise incomparable elements. The length or a chain or antichain is the number of elements contained in it. Now we are ready to state Dilworth’s Theorem. Theorem 1. (Dilworth) Let P be a ﬁnite poset. Then the smallest set of chains whose union is P has the same cardinality as the longest antichain. There is also a dual version of this theorem that’s much easier to prove. Theorem 2. Let P be a ﬁnite poset. Then the smallest set of antichains whose union is P has the same cardinality as the longest chain. The length of the longest chain and the length of the longest antichain are often referred to as the height and width of a poset, respectively. Another way of stating the two theorems is that if a poset P has height h and width w, then P can be covered with h antichains and w chains. One simple consequence is that |P | ≤ h · w. 3 MOP 2007 Black Group Algebraic Techniques in Combinatorics Yufei Zhao Instead of proving the the above two theorems, which you can do yourself1, let’s see how we can apply them. Problem: (Romania TST 2005) Let n be a positive integer and S a set of n2 + 1 positive integers with the property that every (n+1)-element subset of S contains two numbers one of which is divisible by the other. Show that S contains n + 1 diﬀerent numbers a1, a2, . . . , an+1 such that ai | ai+1 for each i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Solution. Use the divisibility relation to obtain a poset on S (that is, x“ ≤ ”y iﬀ x | y. Check that this makes a poset). The condition that there does not exist an n + 1 element subset of S that no element divides another translates into the condition that there does not exist an antichain of length n + 1 in S. So the longest antichain in S at length at most n, and thus by Dilworth’s theorem, S can be written as the union of at most n chains. Since S has n2 + 1 elements, this implies that one of these chains has a length of at least n + 1. This implies the result. A very similar result is the Erd¨os–Szekeres Theorem, which states that within any sequence of ab + 1 real numbers, there is either a nondecreasing subsequence of a + 1 terms, or a nonincreasing subsequence of b + 1 terms. This result is also a simple consequence of Dilworth’s Theorem. More examples are given in the problems section. Problems related to linear algebra 1.
