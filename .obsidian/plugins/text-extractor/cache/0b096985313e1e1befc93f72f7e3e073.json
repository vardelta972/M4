Although it is no longer one of the main phyla of questions in the IMO (combinatorics, algebra, geometry and number theory), sequences do feature very prominently. Generating functions To manipulate sequences, it is useful to be able to represent them algebraically as a power series known as a generating function. \u0000 A sequence \u0000A0, A1, A2, A3, …\u0000 has the ordinary generating function ao\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 A0 \u0000 A1 x \u0000 A2 x2 \u0000 A3 x3 \u0000 …. [Definition of OGF] We can add and multiply ordinary generating functions, which correspond to addition and convolution of their respective sequences. 1. Suppose we have two sequences, \u0000An\u0000 and \u0000Bn\u0000, with ordinary generating functions ao\u0000x\u0000 and bo\u0000x\u0000, respectively. Let \u0000Cn\u0000 and \u0000Dn\u0000 have ordinary generating functions ao\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 bo\u0000x\u0000 and ao\u0000x\u0000 bo\u0000x\u0000, respectively. Show that Cn \u0000 An \u0000 Bn and Dn \u0000 A0 Bn \u0000 A1 Bn\u00001 \u0000 … \u0000 An B0. [Addition and convolution] 2. Find a closed form for 1 \u0000 x \u0000 x2 \u0000 …, the ordinary generating function of \u00001, 1, 1, …\u0000. Hence find an ordinary generating function for the sequence of natural numbers, \u00001, 2, 3, …\u0000, and the triangular numbers, \u00001, 3, 6, 10, …\u0000. 3. Suppose \u0000A0, A1, A2, A3, …\u0000 has ordinary generating function ao\u0000x\u0000. What sequence has ordinary generating function \u0000 \u0000x ao\u0000x\u0000? 4. Hence find the sequence with ordinary generating function ln\u00001 \u0000 x\u0000. When differentiating A0 \u0000 A1 x \u0000 A2 x2 \u0000 A3 x3 \u0000 …, we obtain the sequence A1 \u0000 2 A2 x \u0000 3 A3 x2 \u0000 4 A4 x 3 \u0000 …. As an operation on sequences, this is a left shift followed by a (somewhat annoying) multiplication of each term by a different scalar. We can remove this inelegance by defining a more complicated exponential generating function, or EGF. \u0000 A sequence \u0000B0, B1, B2, B3, …\u0000 has the exponential generating function be\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 B0 0\u0000 \u0000 B1 1\u0000 x \u0000 B2 2\u0000 x2 \u0000 B3 3\u0000 x3 \u0000 …. [Definition of EGF] If we differentiate it, we obtain the exponential generating function of the sequence \u0000B1, B2, B3, …\u0000, which is simply the original sequence shifted to the left. The sequence \u00001, 1, 1, …\u0000 is invariant when shifted to the left, so its exponential generating function (namely f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 1 \u0000 x \u0000 1 2 x2 \u0000 1 6 x3 \u0000 1 24 x4 \u0000 …) is invariant under differentiation, and is thus a solution to the differential equation f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f ' \u0000x\u0000. 5. Show that the exponential generating function of \u00001, 0, \u00001, 0, 1, 0, \u00001, 0, …\u0000 is a solution of the differential equation f '' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 0. This type of differential equation is encountered in the mechanics of mass-spring systems. This particular solution is the function f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 cos x; the general solution is f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 A cos x \u0000 B sin x, corresponding to the sequence \u0000A, B, \u0000A, \u0000B, A, B, \u0000A, \u0000B, …\u0000. For this reason, a stretched spring with a suspended mass will oscillate periodically in simple harmonic motion. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u00005 5 \u00001.0 \u00000.5 0.5 1.0 Some basic sequences and their exponential generating functions are given below. Sequence EGF \u00001, 1, 1, 1, …\u0000 \u0000x \u00001, \u00001, 1, \u00001, 1, …\u0000 \u0000\u0000x \u00001, 0, 1, 0, 1, …\u0000 cosh\u0000x\u0000 \u00000, 1, 0, 1, 0, …\u0000 sinh\u0000x\u0000 \u00001, 0, \u00001, 0, 1, 0, \u00001, 0, …\u0000 cos\u0000x\u0000 \u00000, 1, 0, \u00001, 0, 1, 0, \u00001, …\u0000 sin\u0000x\u0000 \u00001, 2, 4, 8, 16, …\u0000 \u00002 x \u00001, 2, 3, 4, 5, …\u0000 \u0000x x 6. Find a sequence \u0000F0, F1, F2, …\u0000 whose exponential generating function satisfies the differential equation f '' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000. In general, the solution to any homogeneous linear differential equation is the exponential generating function of a sequence defined by a linear recurrence relation. Linear recurrence relations Suppose we have a sequence defined by the linear recurrence relation An\u0000k \u0000 %0 An \u0000 %1 An\u00001 \u0000 %2 An\u00002 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 %k\u00001 An\u0000k\u00001. This is linear and homogeneous, which means that for any two sequences \u0000An\u0000 and \u0000Bn\u0000 satisfying the equation, so does the sequence \u0000\u0000 An \u0000 ' Bn\u0000. It is also determined entirely by the values of \u0000A0, A1, …, Ak\u00001\u0000, so there are k degrees of freedom in the solution set. If a sequence \u0000Bn \u0000 xn\u0000 satisfies the recurrence relation, then we have xk \u0000 %0 \u0000 %1 x \u0000 %2 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 %k\u00001 xk\u00001. By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can rearrange and factorise this into k linear terms. Assuming that this polynomial has l distinct roots, (1, (2, …, (l, we obtain the general solution \u0000An \u0000 P1\u0000n\u0000 (1n \u0000 P2\u0000n\u0000 (2n \u0000 … \u0000 Pl\u0000n\u0000 (ln\u0000. Pi is a polynomial of degree mi \u0000 1, where mi is the multiplicity of the root (i. Specifically, when all the roots are distinct, all values of Pi\u0000n\u0000 are constants. It is possible to verify that each term satisfies the linear recurrence relation, so the general solution is valid. Also, it has k degrees of freedom, so there can be no other solutions. Probably the simplest non-trivial linear recurrence relation is the Fibonacci sequence \u0000Fn\u0000 with F0 \u0000 0, F1 \u0000 1 and Fn\u00002 \u0000 Fn\u00001 \u0000 Fn. It was discovered by Leonardo of Pisa when contemplating a problem about the exponential growth of a rabbit population. It has the closed-form expression Fn \u0000 \u0000n\u0000)n \u0000\u0000) , where \u0000 and ) are the positive and negative roots, respectively, of the equation x2 \u0000 x \u0000 1. \u0000 Fn \u0000 \u0000n\u0000)n 5 , where \u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 5 2 and ) \u0000 1\u0000 5 2 . [Binet’s formula] This enables one to compute a closed form for the exponential generating function of \u00000, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …\u0000, and thus find a closed-form solution to the differential equation f '' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f ' \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 7. Find a closed form for the exponential generating function of \u00000, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …\u0000. 8. Show that, for all a, b \u0000 \u0000\u0000, we have Fa Fa b. 9. Prove that Fn2 \u0000 Fn\u00001 Fn\u00001 \u0000 \u0000\u00001\u0000n. [Cassini’s identity] 10. Show that the Fibonacci sequence has the ordinary generating function fo\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x 1\u0000x\u0000x2 , and thus find a rational approximation to 0.01010203050813213455. Every sequence generated by a linear recurrence relation has an ordinary generating function expressible as a ratio between two polynomials. Consider the sequence \u0000Ai \u0000mod p\u0000\u0000. As the sequence is generated by the previous k terms, each of which can be one of n values, the sequence must eventually cycle with period P \u0000 nk. The recurrence relation is deterministic in both directions, so it must be completely periodic. Indeed, this bound can be slightly improved upon, as k consecu- tive zeros would result in a sequence that is identically zero. Hence, P \u0000 nk \u0000 1. Sequences where equality holds are known as maximal. For example, the non-zero sequence with recurrence relation Xn\u00003 \u0000 Xn\u00001 \u0000 Xn \u0000mod 2\u0000 has a period of 23 \u0000 1 and is displayed below (where red and blue discs indicate 0 and 1, respectively). \u0000\u0000 In a maximal sequence, every non-empty string of k digits appears precisely once in each cycle. Together with the property that the sequence has a long period, linear recurrence sequences are used as simple pseudo-random number generators. A refined algorithm, known as the Mersenne twister, has a period of 219 937 \u0000 1 and is almost indistinguishable from random data. 11. Let n be an integer greater than 1. In a circular arrangement of n lamps L0, L1, …, Ln\u00001, each one of which can be either ON or OFF, we begin with the configuration where all lamps are ON. We carry out a sequence of steps, Step0, Step1, …. If L j\u00001 is ON, then Step j changes the status of L j (from ON to OFF or vice- versa), but does not change the status of any other lamps; if L j\u00001 is OFF, then Step j does not change anything at all. Show that: \u0000 There is a positive integer M \u0000n\u0000 such that all lamps are ON again after M \u0000n\u0000 steps. \u0000 If n has the form 2k, then all lamps are on after n2 \u0000 1 steps. \u0000 If n has the form 2k \u0000 1, then all lamps are on after n2 \u0000 n \u0000 1 steps. [IMO 1993, Question 6] Positional systems When we write numbers in decimal notation, we let ‘dk dk\u00001 … d2 d1 d0’ represent the non-negative integer dk 10k \u0000 dk\u00001 10k\u00001 \u0000 … \u0000 10 d1 \u0000 d0, where each digit di \u0000 \u00000, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9\u0000. Note that this is unique; an integer cannot have two valid representations. This can be generalised to other bases (or radices) such as binary and ternary. For example, we can uniquely express any non-negative integer in binary as a sum of distinct powers of two. \u0000 The n-ary representation ‘dk dk\u00001 … d2 d1 d0’, where each digit di \u0000 \u00000, 1, …, n \u0000 1\u0000, uniquely represents the integer \u0000 i\u00000 k n i di. A certain type of functional equation, known as a binary functional equation or Monk equation, is best approached by expressing the numbers in binary. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 12. A function f : \u0000\u00000 \u0000 \u0000 is defined using the initial term f \u00000\u0000 \u0000 0 and the recurrence relations f \u00002 n\u0000 \u0000 1 f \u0000n\u0000 and f \u00002 n \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 f \u00002 n\u0000. How many integers x exist such that x \u0000 220 f \u0000x\u0000? There are some more interesting variants of positional systems. Balanced ternary has n \u0000 3 and di \u0000 \u0000\u00001, 0, 1\u0000, as opposed to the \u00000, 1, 2\u0000 of ordinary base-3. There exist unique expressions in balanced ternary for every integer, as opposed to merely non-negative integers. By contrast with the modern binary computers we use today, there was an early computer (Setun), which operated in balanced ternary. The system with n \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1 and di \u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000 is even better, as it can represent any Gaussian integer. The Gaussian integers with representations using at most k \u0000 1 digits are the 2k\u00001 points on a space-filling fractal known as the twindragon curve. The example for k \u0000 8 is shown below, with the origin encircled red. 13. Prove that every Eisenstein integer has a unique representation in the positional system with base n \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1 and digits \u00000, 1, 2\u0000. A particularly interesting positional notation is the Zeckendorf representation. There is a unique way to express any non-negative integer as the sum of Fibonacci numbers, no two of which are consecutive. For example, 100 \u0000 89 \u0000 8 \u0000 3. 14. Determine whether there exists a function f : \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 such that f \u0000 f \u0000n\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000n\u0000 \u0000 n for all n \u0000 \u0000. 15. A set A of integers is called sum-full if A \u0000 A \u0000 A, i.e. each element a \u0000 A is the sum of some pair of (not necessarily distinct) elements b, c \u0000 A. A set A of integers is said to be zero-sum-free if 0 is the only integer that cannot be expressed as the sum of the elements of a finite non-empty subset of A. Does there exist a set of integers which is both sum-full and zero-sum-free? [EGMO 2012, Question 4, Dan Schwarz] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Catalan sequence We define the nth Catalan number, Cn, to be the number of ways of pairing 2 n points on the circumference of a circle with n non-intersecting chords. For example, we have C3 \u0000 5: Each of these pairings divides the interior of the circle into n \u0000 1 regions. We can place an ‘observer’ in any region. Now label each point with a L or R depending on whether it is connected to a point to the left or right of itself when viewed by the observer. For example, the first pairing can lead to any of the following labellings, depending on where the observer is positioned: L RL R L R L RL R R L R LL R L R L RR L L R As every labelling of 2 n points with n Ls and n Rs can result in a valid pairing and position of observer, and every pairing and position of observer results in a unique labelling, we have a bijection between the two. As there are Cn pairings and n \u0000 1 regions in which to place the observer, there are \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 Cn different labellings. However, there are clearly 2 n n different labellings, so we have Cn \u0000 1 n\u00001 2 n n . 16. Show that the number of valid balanced strings S of 2 n parentheses is given by Cn. (There must be n left parentheses, n right parentheses, and for all k \u0000 2 n, the number of right parentheses in the first k symbols of S cannot exceed the number of left parentheses.) 17. An insect walks on the integer lattice \u00002, beginning at \u00000, 0\u0000. After 2 n steps, it reaches \u0000n, n\u0000. \u0000 How many different paths could the insect have taken? \u0000 Assuming that, for all points \u0000x, y\u0000 on the path, x \u0000 y, how many different paths are possible? 18.

Let co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 C0 \u0000 C1 x \u0000 C2 x2 \u0000 … be the ordinary generating function for the Catalan numbers. Show that x co\u0000x\u00002 \u0000 co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 0, and thus that co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 1\u00004 x 2 x . L-systems Suppose we have a string S consisting entirely of the symbols A and B. We define f \u0000S\u0000 by simultaneously replac- ing every A with A B and every B with B A. For example, starting with a single A, we have f \u0000A\u0000 \u0000 A B, f \u0000 f \u0000A\u0000\u0000 \u0000 A B B A, f 3\u0000A\u0000 \u0000 A B B A B A A B, and so on. The limit of this is an infinite sequence A B B A B A A B B A A B A B B A …, known as the Thue-Morse sequence. This process of repeatedly applying substitution rules to every symbol in a string is known as an L-system. 20. A sequence \u0000xi\u0000 is defined by x1 \u0000 1 and the recurrences x2 k \u0000 \u0000xk and x2 k\u00001 \u0000 \u0000\u00001\u0000k\u00001 xk (for all k \u0000 \u0000\u0000). Prove that, for all n \u0000 1, we have x1 \u0000 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 xn \u0000 0.

Prove that we can divide the interval \u00000, 1\u0000 into finitely many intervals, alternately coloured red and blue, such that \u0000redP\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000blueP\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x for all polynomials P of degree 2013. One of the more interesting L-systems is the golden string, generated by iterating the system S \u0000 g\u0000S\u0000 with substitution rules X \u0000 X Y and Y \u0000 X to the initial string X . The first few iterations are X \u0000 X Y \u0000 X Y X \u0000 X Y X X Y \u0000 X Y X X Y X Y X \u0000 …. 22. Show that the number of symbols in gn\u0000X \u0000 is given by Fn\u00002, i.e. the \u0000n \u0000 2\u0000th term of the Fibonacci sequence. 23. Prove that gn\u0000X \u0000 can be expressed as the concatenation of two palindromic substrings for all n \u0000 \u0000\u0000. Moreover, find the lengths of the palindromic substrings for all n \u0000 3. (A string is described as palindromic if it reads the same in both directions. For example, L E V E L and R A C E C A R are palindromic strings. The empty string is also considered to be palindromic.) 24. Hence prove that, for all n \u0000 \u0000\u0000, removing the last two symbols of gn\u0000X \u0000 results in a palindromic string. The golden string may be regarded as a one-dimensional analogue of the Penrose tiling. Indeed, if you know where to look, you will be able to find the golden string recurring throughout any Penrose tiling. Additionally, the last digit of the Zeckendorf representation of n (for all non-negative integers n) forms the golden string. Farey sequences Suppose we have two tangent circles resting on the real line. Circle *1 is positioned at p1 q1 and has a diameter of 1 q12 . Similarly, circle *2 is positioned at p2 q2 and has a diameter of 1 q22 . 25. Prove that p1 q2 \u0000 1 \u0000 p2 q1. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 We now position a smaller circle, *3, externally tangent to the two larger circles and the real line. 26. Show that *3 is tangent to the line at p3 q3 \u0000 p1\u0000p2 q1\u0000q2 . This gives a geometrical relationship between the radii of the circles. \u0000 Suppose circles *1 and *2 are tangent to each other, and one of the outer common tangents is l. Let *3 be a third circle tangent internally to *1, *2 and l. Then 1 r3 \u0000 1 r1 \u0000 1 r2 , where ri is the radius of *i. [Sangaku problem] If we begin with a circle of unit diameter for each positive integer, and iterate this process infinitely, we create a pattern known as the Ford circles. This has an elegant symmetry associated with modular forms and certain tilings of the hyperbolic plane. Taking only the circles where q \u0000 n and confining ourselves to the interval \u00000, 1\u0000, we generate a Farey sequence, Fn. For example, F5 \u0000 \u00000, 1 5 , 1 4 , 1 3 , 2 5 , 1 2 , 3 5 , 2 3 , 3 4 , 4 5 , 1\u0000. Each term is the mediant of the two neighbouring terms. For instance, 1 3 is situated between 1 4 and 2 5 , and 1 3 \u0000 1\u00002 4\u00005 . This enables a Farey sequence to be extrapolated in both directions from two adjacent terms. It turns out that Rademacher’s proof of the formula for the partition numbers involves Ford circles and Farey sequences. Returning to the Sangaku problem, there is a generalisation known as Descartes’ theorem, named after the philosopher who said ‘cogito ergo sum’ and invented Cartesian coordinates. If we have four circles, which are pairwise externally tangent, then there is a quadratic relationship between the reciprocals of the radii. \u0000 \u0000 1 r1 \u0000 1 r2 \u0000 1 r3 \u0000 1 r4 \u0000 2 \u0000 2 \u0000 1 r12 \u0000 1 r22 \u0000 1 r32 \u0000 1 r42 \u0000. [Descartes’ theorem] 1 r4 is thus the solution to a quadratic equation. If we choose the other root (and multiply by \u00001 to make it posi- tive), we obtain the reciprocal of the radius of the circumscribed circle, rather than the inscribed circle. Egyptian fractions The Fibonacci sequence, Catalan sequence and powers of two grow reasonably quickly, namely exponentially. By comparison, Sylvester’s sequence grows even more quickly (doubly-exponentially), with the first few terms being \u00002, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3 263 443, …\u0000. This is defined with the initial term s0 \u0000 2 together with the recurrence relation sn \u0000 1 \u0000 s0 s1 s2 … sn\u00001. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 27. Prove that the terms in Sylvester’s sequence are pairwise coprime. This is a direct proof that there are infinitely many primes, as no two terms in Sylvester’s sequence share a prime factor. Euclid’s proof of the infinitude of primes is similar, but with a proof by contradiction instead. 28. Show that 1 s0 \u0000 1 s1 \u0000 1 s2 \u0000 … \u0000 1. As decimal expansions, continued fractions and ratios had not been invented, the ancient Egyptians expressed fractions as the sum of reciprocals of distinct positive integers. It is a remarkable fact that Egyptian fractions can represent any positive rational number. One algorithm which proves the possibility of this is the following: \u0000 Initially express a b as 1 b \u0000 1 b \u0000 1 b \u0000 … \u0000 1 b . \u0000 If there are multiple copies of 1 n , replace one of them with 1 n\u00001 \u0000 1 n\u0000n\u00001\u0000 . \u0000 Repeat the previous step until all unit fractions are distinct. As arbitrarily large fractions can be generated in this manner, we have a proof that the series +\u00001\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 1 3 \u0000 1 4 \u0000 … diverges to infinity. It does so rather slowly, with the first n terms tending to ln\u0000n\u0000 \u0000 ,, where , is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. Also, we have yet another proof of the infinitude of primes, because we can factorise +\u00001\u0000 as \u00001 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 1 4 \u0000 1 8 \u0000 …\u0000 \u00001 \u0000 1 3 \u0000 1 9 \u0000 …\u0000 \u00001 \u0000 1 5 \u0000 1 25 \u0000 …\u0000 …. Each term is the sum of a geometric series, resulting in the product expansion +\u00001\u0000 \u0000 2 1 \u0000 3 2 \u0000 5 4 \u0000 7 6 \u0000…\u0000 p p\u00001 \u0000…. As each of the terms is finite, but the product is infinite, there must be infinitely many primes. Another algorithm for generating Egyptian fraction expansions is the greedy algorithm, where we choose the largest unused unit fraction less than or equal to the remainder. For example, if we wanted to express 4 as an Egyptian fraction, we would first subtract 1 2 , resulting in 3 10 , followed by 1 4 , resulting in 1 20 , and finally 1 20 , resulting in the expansion 4 5 \u0000 1 2 \u0000 1 4 \u0000 1 20 . If, instead, we restrict ourselves to choosing the largest odd unit fraction at each point, the process may continue forever. For example, applying this algorithm to 1 generates the remainder of Sylvester’s sequence. This is similarly the case for all fractions with even denominators. It is an open problem as to whether the process necessarily terminates for all fractions with odd denominators. Fermat numbers Another doubly-exponential sequence is the sequence of Fermat numbers of the form 22n \u0000 1, namely \u00003, 5, 17, 257, 65 537, …\u0000. You may notice that the first five Fermat numbers are prime, known as Fermat primes. Fermat conjectured that all Fermat numbers are prime, with the first counter-example found by Euler. \u0000 225 \u0000 1 \u0000 4 294 967 297 \u0000 641 \u0000 6 700 417. [Euler’s factorisation] It is unknown whether there are infinitely many Fermat primes. Only the first five are known to be prime; the next 28 have been proved to be composite! 29. Prove that if 2 k \u0000 1 is prime, then it is a Fermat prime. A regular n-gon of unit side length is constructible if and only if it can be constructed using a compass and straightedge. Equivalently, this means that the Cartesian coordinates of each of the vertices can be expressed as a finite combination of integers together with the operations \u0000\u0000, \u0000, \u0000, - , \u0000. Gauss proved that a regular n-gon is constructible if and only if n \u0000 2a p1 p2 … pk, where each pi is a distinct Fermat prime. The only known odd \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 values for n are thus products of distinct Fermat primes. Expressed in binary, these form the first 32 rows of Pascal’s triangle modulo 2, namely \u00001, 11, 101, 1111, 10 001, …\u0000. When each 1 is replaced with a dot and 0 is replaced with an empty space, this is the fifth-order approximation to the Sierpinski triangle. Certain geometrical constructions, such as trisecting the angle, are possible with paper folding but not with Euclidean constructions. Using origami, we can apply the operations \u0000\u0000, \u0000, \u0000, -, , 3 \u0000 to Cartesian coordinates, and thus reach points unattainable with compass and straightedge alone. In this new system, a regular n-gon is constructible if and only if n \u0000 2a 3b q1 q2 … qk, where each qi is a distinct Pierpont prime (prime expressible in the form 2n 3m \u0000 1). Fermat primes are, by definition, a subset of Pierpont primes. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. We have ao\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 bo\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 A0 \u0000 B0 \u0000 A1 x \u0000 B1 x \u0000 \u0000. Similarly, ao\u0000x\u0000 bo\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000A0 \u0000 A1 x \u0000 A2 x2 \u0000 …\u0000 \u0000B0 \u0000 B1 x \u0000 B2 x2 \u0000 …\u0000. Expanding the brackets results in A0 B0 \u0000 \u0000A0 B1 \u0000 A1 B0\u0000 x \u0000 \u0000A0 B2 \u0000 A1 B1 \u0000 A2 B0\u0000 x2 \u0000 …. 2. The geometric series 1 \u0000 x \u0000 x2 \u0000 … is given by 1 1\u0000x . As \u00001, 2, 3, …\u0000 is the convolution of \u00001, 1, 1, …\u0000 with itself, its ordinary generating function is 1 \u00001\u0000x\u00002 . The convolution of this with \u00001, 1, 1, …\u0000 gives the triangular numbers with ordinary generating function 1 \u00001\u0000x\u00003 . 3. Differentiating each term, we obtain \u0000 \u0000x ao\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 A1 \u0000 2 A2 x \u0000 3 A3 x2 \u0000 4 A4 x3 \u0000 …. This is the ordinary generating function of \u0000A1, 2 A2, 3 A3, …\u0000. 4. We already know that 1 1\u0000x \u0000 1 \u0000 x \u0000 x2 \u0000 x3 \u0000 …. This can be integrated to yield c \u0000 x \u0000 1 2 x2 \u0000 1 3 x3 \u0000 …. As ln\u00001 \u0000 x\u0000 evaluates to zero when x is zero, the constant term is zero. Hence, ln\u00001 \u0000 x\u0000 is the ordinary generating function of \u00000, 1, 1 2 , 1 3 , 1 4 , …\u0000. 5. Shift the sequence two places to the left and add it to the original sequence. This results in the zero sequence, the EGF of which is the zero function. 6. This has the recurrence relation Fn\u00002 \u0000 Fn\u00001 \u0000 Fn. A possible solution is the Fibonacci sequence, \u00000, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, …\u0000. 7. fe\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 5 \u00001 \u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000\u0000 x\u00002 2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 x\u00003 3\u0000 \u0000 …\u0000 \u0000 1 5 \u00001 \u0000 ) x \u0000 \u0000) x\u00002 2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000) x\u00003 3\u0000 \u0000 …\u0000.

It is straightforward to verify from the recurrence relation that f0\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 x fo\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x 2 fo\u0000x\u0000. Rearranging, we obtain the closed form fo\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x 1\u0000x\u0000x2 . Setting x \u0000 0.01 gives us the rational approximation 0.01 1\u00000.01\u00000.0001 \u0000 0.01 0.9899 \u0000 100 9899 . 11. This system is deterministic and finite, so must necessarily eventually become cyclic. As it is reversible as well, it must be completely cyclic; this solves the first part of the question. We can represent the state of the system using the ordinary generating function Ln\u00001 \u0000 Ln\u00002 x \u0000 Ln\u00003 x2 \u0000 Ln\u00004 x3 \u0000 … \u0000 L0 xn\u00001, where 0 and 1 correspond to OFF and ON, respectively. This is a polynomial \u00002\u0000x\u0000, as each coefficient can be either 0 or 1 and we consider addition modulo 2. If we follow each step with a rotation to the left (such that Li moves into the position of Li\u00001), then we only need to alter the state of L0 depending on Ln\u00001. Refer to this composite operation as Step\u0000. The lamp alteration is equivalent to the operation P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 xn\u00001 (if applicable, or the identity function otherwise), and the rotation is equivalent to P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x P\u0000x\u0000. So, Step\u0000 performs the polynomial operation P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000mod xn \u0000 xn\u00001 \u0000 1\u0000; this modulus is the characteristic \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 polynomial associated with this linear feedback shift register. If we apply m steps in succession, then we obtain the polynomial xm P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000mod xn \u0000 xn\u00001 \u0000 1\u0000. If m is the period of the system, then xm P\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 P\u0000x\u0000 and thus xm \u0000 1. For the second part of the question, we get xn2 \u0000 \u0000xn\u0000n \u0000 \u0000xn\u00001 \u0000 1\u0000 n. As n \u0000 2k, all binomial coefficients apart from 2k 0 \u0000 1 and 2k 2k \u0000 1 are even (consider Pascal’s triangle modulo 2, which approximates the Sierpinski triangle), thus equal to zero in the field \u00002. So, \u0000xn\u00001 \u0000 1\u0000 n expands to give xn 2\u0000n \u0000 1. With the identities xn 2 \u0000 xn2\u0000n \u0000 1 and xn2 \u0000 xn2\u0000n \u0000 xn2\u00001, we obtain xn2\u00001 \u0000 1, and thus \u0000Step\u0000\u0000n2\u00001 is the identity function. For the third part of the question, we get xn2\u00001 \u0000 \u0000xn\u00001\u0000 n\u00001 \u0000 \u0000xn\u00001\u0000 2k \u0000 \u0000xn \u0000 x\u00002k \u0000 xn\u0000n\u00001\u0000 \u0000 xn\u00001 \u0000 xn2\u0000n \u0000 xn\u00001. Hence, xn 2 \u0000 xn2\u00001 \u0000 xn2\u0000n \u0000 xn\u00001 \u0000 2 xn 2\u0000n \u0000 xn\u00001. Dividing throughout by xn\u00001 results in xn2\u0000n\u00001 \u0000 1, so \u0000Step\u0000\u0000n 2\u0000n\u00001 is the identity function. 12. The function ‘reflects’ the binary representation. For example, it maps 10 011 101 to 1.0111001. Multiplying by 220 means that it is subsequently shifted 20 places to the left. The fixed points of this function are the palindromes of length 21, of which there are 211. \u00004 \u00002 2 4 \u00004 \u00002 2 4 13. Colour the Eisenstein integers red, green and blue, as in the diagram above. If we multiply all Eisenstein integers by \u0000 \u0000 1, we obtain the red Eisenstein integers (a copy of the Eisenstein integers rotated by 5 \u0000 and scaled by 3 ). The green and blue Eisenstein integers can be obtained by translating the red Eisenstein integers by 1 and 2, respectively. Hence, if no Eisenstein integer has two representations using k digits, then no Eisenstein integer has two representations using k \u0000 1 digits. By induction, all representations are unique. However, we have yet to show that all Eisenstein integers can be obtained in this manner. If all Eisenstein integers within the hexagon with vertices \u00001, \u0000\u00002, \u0000, \u00001, \u00002, \u0000\u0000\u0000 can be represented (which can be shown using trial and error), then we can represent all Eisenstein integers within the hexagon with vertices \u00001 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000, \u0000\u00002\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000, \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000, \u00001 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000, \u00002\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000, \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000\u0000 by multiplying those Eisenstein integers by \u0000 \u0000 1 and translating by 1 and 2 to fill in the gaps. By induction, we can represent all Eisenstein integers within an arbitrarily large hexagon centred about the origin, and therefore all Eisenstein integers. 14. Yes, consider the function which shifts the Zeckendorf representation of a positive integer one position to the left. Due to the Fibonacci recurrence relation, f \u0000 f \u0000n\u0000\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000n\u0000 \u0000 n. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 15. Yes, for example \u00001, \u00002, 3, \u00005, 8, \u000013, 21, …\u0000. This is sum-full as each term is the sum of the next two terms. To prove that it is zero-sum-free, consider all numbers expressible as the sum of the first k terms of the sequence. We can prove from a trivial base case and simple inductive argument that this is \u00001 \u0000 Fk\u00001, 2 \u0000 Fk\u00001, …, \u00002, \u00001, 1, 2, …, Fk\u00002 \u0000 2, Fk\u00002 \u0000 1\u0000 for odd k, and the negation thereof for even k. The limiting set is the set of nonzero integers. A B C D E F Cut here . A B C D E F 16. We can biject between these strings and non-intersecting pairings of points on a circle by cutting the circle at a given point and 'unfolding' it, as demonstrated above. 17. The insect can only move right or up at each step, as otherwise it would take too long to reach \u0000n, n\u0000. There must be n moves to the right and n moves up, so there are 2 n n possible paths in the first part of the problem. For the second part of the problem, we represent a horizontal move with a left parenthesis and a vertical move with a right parenthesis. This reduces the problem to the previous question, so there are Cn \u0000 1 n\u00001 2 n n paths with this constraint. 18. Consider 2 n \u0000 2 points on the circumference of a circle, and label one vertex A. Choose another vertex B such that the number of vertices on each arc A B is even, and join A and B with a chord. Let the number of points right of the chord be 2 k; the number of points left of the chord must be 2 \u0000n \u0000 k\u0000. There are Ck non- intersecting pairings of the vertices to the left of the chord, and Cn\u0000k non-intersecting pairings of vertices to the right of the chord, giving a total of Ck Cn\u0000k pairings. Repeating this for each location of B gives C0 Cn \u0000 C1 Cn\u00001 \u0000 … \u0000 Cn C0 possible pairings. This must be equal to Cn\u00001, by definition. 19. x co\u0000x\u00002 \u0000 x\u0000C0 \u0000 C1 x \u0000 C2 x 2 \u0000 …\u0000 2 \u0000 C02 x \u0000 \u0000C0 C1 \u0000 C1 C0\u0000 x2 \u0000 \u0000C0 C2 \u0000 C1 C1 \u0000 C2 C0\u0000 x3 \u0000 …, which simplifies to C1 x \u0000 C2 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 C0 \u0000 co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 by Segner’s recurrence relation. So, x co\u0000x\u00002 \u0000 co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000 0, and we can obtain co\u0000x\u0000 by the Babylonian formula for the roots of a quadratic equation. Specifically, we have co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000\u00001\u00002\u00004 x 2 x . As co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1 when x \u0000 0, the correct root is co\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 1\u0000 1\u00004 x 2 x . 20. We define a sequence \u0000 yi\u0000 such that: \u0000 yi \u0000 A if k is even and xk \u0000 1; \u0000 yi \u0000 B if k is odd and xk \u0000 1; \u0000 yi \u0000 C if k is even and xk \u0000 \u00001; \u0000 yi \u0000 D if k is odd and xk \u0000 \u00001. Consider the string Yl obtained by concatenating the first 2l elements of \u0000yi\u0000. It is straightforward to verify that Y0 \u0000 B, and that Yl\u00001 can be obtained from Yl by applying the L-system with substitution rules: A \u0000 D C, B \u0000 B C, C \u0000 B A, and D \u0000 D A. The first few terms of \u0000Yi\u0000 are B \u0000 B C \u0000 B C B A \u0000 B C B A B C D C \u0000 …. Interpret these strings as sequences of instructions for moving an insect on the integer lattice \u00002: \u0000 A: move east; \u0000 B: move north; \u0000 C: move west; \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 D: move south; The pattern generated by this is a space-filling curve bounded by the lines y \u0000 \u0000x and x \u0000 0 (with the first few iterations displayed below). The substitution rules effectively reflect the path in a NNW line through the origin, combined with a dilation of scale factor 2 . Hence, the insect always remains in the octant bounded by the lines y \u0000 \u0000x and x \u0000 0. Remaining to the right of y \u0000 \u0000x is equivalent to the condition an \u0000 bn \u0000 cn \u0000 dn (for all n \u0000 \u0000\u0000), where an \u0000 \u0000k : yk \u0000 A\u0000 , et cetera. This is in turn equivalent to the desired inequality. 21. We can scale the set of intervals without affecting anything, so let’s colour \u0000\u00001, 1\u0000 instead. Note that if we have a set of monic polynomials of degrees 0, 1, …, n, inclusive, which satisfy the condition (\u0000redP\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000blueP\u0000x\u0000 \u0000 x), then the condition holds for all linear combinations of them (namely all polynomials of degree \u0000 n). If we have a colouring that is symmetric (i.e. x is coloured identically to \u0000x for all x \u0000 \u0000\u00001, 1\u0000), then all odd functions satisfy the condition. Similarly, if we have a colouring that is antisymmetric (i.e. x is coloured oppositely to \u0000x for all x \u0000 \u0000\u00001, 1\u0000), then all even functions satisfy the condition. Begin with the colouring C0, where the interval \u0000\u00001, 0\u0000 is red and \u00000, 1\u0000 is blue. Clearly, all constant functions (polynomials of degree 0) satisfy the condition. Let C\u0000 denote the complement of C, where an interval is red in C\u0000 if and only if it is blue in C. We can scale C0 to the interval \u0000\u00001, 0\u0000, and scale C0\u0000 to the interval \u00000, 1\u0000, and append them to form the colouring C1. As C0 works for all degree-0 polynomials, so must the scaled copies of C0 and C0\u0000, and thus also C1. As C1 is symmetric, it must also work for the function y \u0000 x, and therefore all linear polynomials. We define C2 by performing this operation on C1, resulting in an antisymmetric colouring which must also satisfy y \u0000 x2, and therefore all quadratics. Continuing in this manner, we obtain C2013 which works for all degree-2013 polynomials. Note that this colouring is related to the Thue-Morse sequence. 22. Observe that g\u0000g\u0000X \u0000\u0000 \u0000 X Y X is the concatenation of g\u0000X \u0000 \u0000 X Y followed by X . Hence, gn\u00002\u0000X \u0000 is the concatenation of gn\u00001\u0000X \u0000 followed by gn\u0000X \u0000, and thus gn\u00002\u0000X \u0000 \u0000 gn\u00001\u0000X \u0000 \u0000 gn\u0000X \u0000 . This is the recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence. 23. As opposed to considering strings of symbols, consider instead beads on a necklace (positioned at the kth roots of unity, where k is the length of the string). The substitution rules X \u0000 X Y and Y \u0000 X are then equivalent to the alternative rules X \u0000 \u0000 Y \u0000 and Y \u0000 \u0000 \u0000, where we consider \u0000 and \u0000 to be ‘half-beads’, where \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 X , followed by a rotation of the entire necklace by one half-bead to restore the correct orientation. As the substitution rules map each symbol to a palindromic string, and the initial necklace has bilateral symmetry, then all subsequent necklaces have bilateral symmetry. We then reflect the ‘start’ of the necklace in this axis of symmetry to produce another position. Cutting at these two positions will clearly result in two palindromic strings. Using this idea of the half-bead substitution (which preserves the axis of symmetry) followed by a rotation, it is straightforward to show that gn\u0000X \u0000 has palindromic substrings of length Fn\u00001 \u0000 2 and Fn \u0000 2, where Fn is the nth Fibonacci number. g3\u0000X \u0000 g4\u0000X \u0000 g5\u0000X \u0000 g6\u0000X \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 24. We already proved, in the previous exercise, that the first Fn\u00002 \u0000 2 symbols of gn\u00001\u0000X \u0000 is a palindrome. As we obtain gn\u0000X \u0000 by taking the first Fn\u00002 symbols of the infinite golden string, g\u0000\u0000X \u0000, the first Fn\u00002 \u0000 2 symbols of gn\u0000X \u0000 also form a palindrome. 25. Consider the trapezium formed by the centres of the circles and the points of tangency with the real line. The hypotenuse has length 1 \u0000 1 q12 \u0000 1 q22 \u0000, the base has length p2 q2 \u0000 p1 q1 and the difference between the left and right heights is \u0000 1 \u0000 1 q12 \u0000 1 q22 \u0000. Applying Pythagoras’ theorem, we obtain 1 \u0000 1 q12 \u0000 1 q22 \u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000 p2 q2 \u0000 p1 q1 \u0000 2 \u0000 1 \u0000 1 q12 \u0000 1 q22 \u0000 2. Expanding, this results in \u0000 p2 q2 \u0000 p1 q1 \u0000 2 \u0000 1 q12 q22 , so p2 q2 \u0000 p1 q1 \u0000 1 q1 q2 . Multiplying by q1 q2 gives the identity p2 q1 \u0000 p1 q2 \u0000 1. 26. We have three equations, namely p2 q1 \u0000 p1 q2 \u0000 1, p3 q1 \u0000 p1 q3 \u0000 1, and p2 q3 \u0000 p3 q2 \u0000 1. Subtracting the third equation from the second gives us \u0000p1 \u0000 p2\u0000 q3 \u0000 \u0000q1 \u0000 q2\u0000 p3, which rearranges to give p3 q3 \u0000 p1\u0000p2 q1\u0000q2 . 27. Let j \u0000 i. Then s j \u0000 k si \u0000 1, so s j \u0000 1 \u0000mod si\u0000. By applying Euclid’s algorithm, si and s j have a greatest common divisor of 1. 28. By reverse-engineering the definition, we get the recurrence relation sn\u00001 \u0000 1 \u0000 sn\u0000sn \u0000 1\u0000. Assume that 1 s0 \u0000 1 s1 \u0000 … \u0000 1 sk \u0000 sk\u00001\u00002 sk\u00001\u00001 . Adding the next reciprocal would give us sk\u00001\u00002 sk\u00001\u00001 \u0000 1 sk\u00001 \u0000 sk\u000012\u0000sk\u00001\u00001 sk\u000012\u0000sk\u00001 \u0000 sk\u00002\u00002 sk\u00002\u00001 . So, by induction, this tends towards 1. 29. Assume that k is not a power of two, so k \u0000 l p for some odd prime p and integer l. Then, \u00002l \u0000 1\u0000 \u00001 \u0000 2l \u0000 22 l \u0000 … \u0000 2\u0000 p\u00001\u0000 l\u0000 \u0000 2k \u0000 1, thus proving that 2k \u0000 1 is composite. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
