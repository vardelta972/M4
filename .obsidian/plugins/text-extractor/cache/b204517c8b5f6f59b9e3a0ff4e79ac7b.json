We compute metric conditions for AM ⊥ CM , ADEF cyclic, and AN bisects BC independently and then put everything together. First note that F EN ∥ ADC by Ceva, and by Menelaus we have BE/BC = BF/BA = 1/5. Clearly AM ⊥ CM iﬀ DM = DA, or equivalently, BD = 3b/4. By Stewart’s theorem, this is equivalent to 13b2 = 8(a2 + c2). Since F E ∥ AD, ADEF is cyclic iﬀ (AD − F E)/2 = AF cos A, so using the law of cosines and the facts that AF = 4c/5, EF = b/5, AD = b/2, we have ADEF cyclic iﬀ 5b 2 + 8c2 = 8a 2. Finally, note that AN bisects BC iﬀ N E = 3b/5 (by the fact that EN ∥ CA. On the other hand, we can compute N E only using the facts that BE = a/5, CE = 4a/5, ∠N EC = C, and ∠BN C = 180 ◦ − A. First it’s important to note that these uniquely determine N E. From areas, we get cx = yz, where x = N E, y = BN , z = CN . By law of cosines, we have y2 + z2 + 2yz cos A = a 2, a 2/25 + x2 + 2ax cos C/5 = y2, and 16a 2/25 + x 2 − 8ax cos C/5 = z2, so adding up and using yz = cx, we have 2x2 − 8 25 a2 = x 5 8a 2 − 2b2 − 8c2 b . Note that this quadratic has a positive root and a negative root; we know x is uniquely determined by our equations, so it must be the positive root. Thus AN bisects BC iﬀ N E = 3b/5 iﬀ 2 9 25 b 2 − 8 25 a 2 = 3b 25 8a 2 − 2b 2 − 8c2 b , which is equivalent to 3b2 = 4a 2 − 3c2. But (8a 2 − 13b2 + 8c 2) + 7(8a2 − 5b 2 − 8c 2) − 16(4a 2 − 3b2 − 3c 2) = 0, so we’re done. 3. Note that the centers of (ABC) and (ADO) lie on opposite sides of AC (consider the perpendicular bisector ℓ of AD and use angle bisector theorem to show that since AB = BD > BO, the midpoint of AO lies on the same side of ℓ as A; clearly center of (ABC) lies between AB and AC by symmetry). Angle chasing, we have ∠AP O = 90 ◦ − ∠ABO/2, and we need to show ∠CQO = ∠ABO/2. By easy continuity arguments, the problem can be rephrased as follows: let P lie on arc AC of (ABC) and deﬁne Q = AP ∩ BC. Let X vary on segment AC. If ∠ABX = 2θ, show that ∠AP X = 90 ◦ − θ iﬀ ∠CQX = θ. Now let α = ∠ABC = ∠ACB (0 ≤ θ ≤ α/2) and β = ∠CAP . By simple angle chasing and the law of sines, we ﬁnd that ∠AP X = 90 ◦ − θ iﬀ 2 sin θ sin α cos(θ − β) = sin(α − β) sin(2α − 2θ) and ∠CQX = θ iﬀ sin θ cos(α − θ) sin β = cos α sin(α − 2θ) sin(α − β). Expanding and expressing in terms of sin θ cos θ and sin 2 θ, they are clearly equivalent. Alternatively, note that if we subtract the RHS from the LHS for the two expressions and take the ﬁrst minus two times the second, we get zero from easy sum-to-product and product-to-sum identities. 4. It’s easy to compute an = ∑ r≥1⌊n/(r + 1)⌋ + ∑ r≥s≥2⌊n/(rs)⌋. To show an > n, we just need 1 ≤ r ≤ n − 1 from the ﬁrst part and r = s = 2 from the second. Now note that an = −n + ∑ r≥s≥1 ⌊n/rs⌋ ≤ −n + ∑ n≥r≥s≥1 (n/(rs)) < −n + (n/2)(H 2 n + π2/6) < nH 2 n/2 < n 2, where it’s easy to prove Hn < 2√ n by induction on n ≥ 1. 5. After side chasing, this boils down to 16(a2 + ab + b2)(b2 + bc + c 2) ≥ 9(a + b) 2(b + c) 2 for a, b, c ≥ 0, so it suﬃces to show that 4(x2 + xy + y2) ≥ 3(x + y) 2, which is trivial inequality. 6. Induct on n, noting that Pn = 3 · Pn−1 ∪ {2 n}: gaps become at most 3 · 2 n−1, and are within range upon adding 2n where necessary. 2012 Blue and Black Homework Solutions 7. (1, 1, 1) is an initial solution; now consider (1 + ω 3√2 + ω2 3√22) n to generate a recursion. 8. First get rid of p = 2 by bounding. Now we have p ≥ 3, so n1/n ≥ p1/p means that n ≤ p using the fact that x1/x is strictly decreasing for x ≥ e. Since p is odd, n is odd. If q | np + 1, then q | (−n)(p,q−1) − 1, so consider primes q ≤ p such that q | p n + 1. In particular, since n is odd, just consider primes q | p + 1 | p n + 1. It’s easy to see, however, that q | n + 1 =⇒ q ∤ (np + 1)/(n + 1) ≡ p mod q, so vq(p + 1) ≤ vq(n + 1) for all q | p + 1. But then n + 1 ≥ p + 1, so n ≥ p =⇒ n = p. 9. It’s enough to show that ∡GP D = ∡GQF . But DE ∥ BA and ABQE is cyclic, so △GDE ∼ △GEQ with opposite orientation; similarly, △GEF ∼ △GF P with opposite orientation. Using complex numbers, set g = 0 so we have d + e + f = 0. It’s easy to see that q = ee/d and p = f f /e, so using d = −e − f , it’s easy to show that d − p g − p ∕ f − q g − q = |e| 2/|f | 2 ∈ R, as desired. 10. Equivalently, show that AF is the A-symmedian, or ∠BAF = ∠M AC. Well-known that HA, reﬂection of H over D, lies on ω, and A′, reﬂection of A over O, is the other intersection of HM with ω. Hence AEDM is cyclic, so ∠BAF = ∠BAO − ∠F AA ′ = ∠BAO − ∠DEM = ∠HAC − ∠DAM = ∠M AC, as desired. 11. It would probably be diﬃcult to show that no such set exists, so we should ﬁrst try to ﬁnd a construction. The dumbest greedy construction is to keep on adding the integer a of smallest absolute value that makes a0 − a ∈ A ∪ {a} for the smallest a0 ̸∈ A + A while not creating a zero-sum subset. Fortunately, this works: we get A = {1, −2, 3, −5, 8, . . .}, i.e. set ai = (−1)i+1Fi+1 for i ≥ 1. Obviously ai = ai+1 + ai+2 for all i ≥ 1, so A ⊆ A + A. Now we prove by induction on n ≥ 1 that the sums of the non-empty subsets of An = {a1, . . . , an} span exactly [1, Fn+2 − 1] ∪ [−Fn+1 + 1, −1] for odd n and [1, Fn+1 − 1] ∪ [−Fn+2 + 1, −1] for even n. For n = 1 and n = 2 this is trivial. First consider n ≥ 3 odd; then the sums of the non-empty subsets of An−1 span [1, Fn − 1] ∪ [−Fn+1 + 1, −1], so when we add in an = (−1)n+1Fn+1 = Fn+1, we get [Fn+1 + 1, Fn+2 − 1] from the positives, Fn+1 from an itself, and [1, Fn+1 − 1] from the negatives. Otherwise, if n ≥ 3 is even, then we start with [1, Fn+1 − 1] ∪ [−Fn + 1, −1] from An−1; when we add in an = (−1)n+1Fn+1 = −Fn+1, we get [−Fn+1 + 1, −1] from the positives, −Fn+1 from an itself, and [−Fn+2 + 1, −Fn+1 − 1] from the negatives, as desired. Hence all nonzero integers can be obtained from the subsets of An for suﬃciently large n, while zero can never be obtained, so we’re done. 12. Suppose Qn/Pn = f is a polynomial; obviously it has rational coeﬃcients. By Gauss’s lemma (e.g. viewing as polynomials in x, show that if p = qr for primitive multivariate polynomials q, r with integer coeﬃcients, then p is primitive also), f has integer coeﬃcients. But then 2 2n(2 2n−1 +1)2n/(22n+1 +1) = f (2, 1, 0) ∈ Z. But gcd(22n+1+1, 2 2n−1+1) = gcd(−3, 2 2n−1+1) = 3, so 2 2n+1+1 = 3m for some m ≥ 1. It’s well-known that only n = 1 works here. Checking, we have [∑ (x − y)2]2/[∑ (x − y)2(y − z) 2] = [( ∑ (x − y))2 − 2 ∑ (x − y)(y − z)] 2/[( ∑ (x − y)(y − z))2 − 2(x − y)(y − z)(z − x) ∑ (x − y)] = 4, so we’re done. Another perspective is to note that if a + b + c = 0 and ∑ a 2nb2n = 0, then we must have ∑ a 2n = 0, so using a = −b − c and a 2n = −b2n − c2n this means that if (x + 1)2n(x2n + 1) + x2n = 0 for some complex x, then x4n +x2n +1 = 0. After some manipulation, we ﬁnd that (x2 +x)2n = 1, (x+1)2n +x2n +1 = 0, and (x + 1) 4n + (x + 1) 2n + 1 = 0. In any case, we ﬁnd that x and x + 1 are both (6n) th roots of unity but not (2n)th roots. Using e it = cos t + i sin t, we ﬁnd that x ∈ {ω, ω2}, where ω = e 2πi/3. Since the minimal polynomial of each of ω, ω2 is x2 +x+1, we must have (x+1) 2n(x2n +1)+x2n = (x2 +x+1) 2n (by matching degrees). Plugging in x = 1, this means that 32n = 1 + 22n+1, so we’re done. 2012 Blue and Black Homework Solutions 13. One way is to represent with ω = e2πi/n, noting that if we assign to each letter its position in an arbitrarily ordered alphabet, then ∑n k=1 akωk = 0 iﬀ a1 . . . an is repetitive (i.e. nontrivially periodic). The problem hypothesis implies that (a2 −a1)(ω −ω2) = (a3 −a2)(ω2 −ω3) = · · · = (an −an−1)(ωn−1 − ωn). If n ≥ 3, this clearly implies a1 = · · · = an; if n = 2, the problem is obvious anyway. There is also a stupider solution. Suppose the word (W ) has n letters. For n ≤ 6 the problem is easy to verify (trivial for primes), so we can assume n ≥ 7. If a word has period d (i.e. if it is a concatenation of n/d identical subwords), call it [i]d-periodic[/i] (of course, d | n). Let ak be the kth letter from the left (for 1 ≤ k ≤ n) and f (k) ≤ n/2 (for 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1) denote the smallest d < n such that W is d-periodic upon switching ak and ak+1. For convenience, extend indices modulo n (this is compatible with the period condition). If f (k) = 1 for some k, the problem is trivial, so suppose that f (k) ≥ 2 for all k. First observe that if ak = ak+1, then W is f (k)-periodic itself. [b]Lemma:[/b] ak−1 = ak+1 for 2 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. [i]Proof:[/i] If max(f (k − 1), f (k)) < n/2, then using the condition when ak−1, ak are swapped yields ak−1 = ak+f (k−1) (since k + f (k − 1) /∈ {k − 1, k} (mod n)) and ak+f (k) = ak+f (k)+f (k−1) (since k+f (k), k+f (k)+f (k−1) /∈ {k−1, k} (mod n), where we use the fact that f (k)+f (k−1) ≤ n/2+n/3 = 5n/6 < n − 1). Similarly, using the condition when ak, ak+1 are swapped yields ak+1 = ak+f (k) (since k + f (k) /∈ {k, k + 1} (mod n)) and ak+f (k−1) = ak+f (k−1)+f (k) (since k + f (k − 1), k + f (k − 1) + f (k) /∈ {k, k + 1} (mod n), where we use the fact that f (k) + f (k − 1) < n − 1 < n). Thus ak−1 = ak+f (k−1) = ak+f (k−1)+f (k) = ak+f (k)+f (k−1) = ak+f (k) = ak+1, so we’re done in this case. Otherwise, f (k−1) = f (k) = n/2, so because n/2 ≥ 3, {k−1, k, k+1}∩{k−1+n/2, k+n/2, k+1+n/2} (mod n) = ∅. Thus ak−1 = ak+n/2 = ak+1 from the ak−1, ak and ak, ak+1 swaps, as desired.■ In light of the lemma, set a = a1 = a3 = · · · and b = a2 = a4 = · · · , and suppose that a ̸= b. Swapping a1 and a2, we see that there must be at least two disjoint sets of consecutive a’s, contradiction. 14. The key is to remove unnecessary points: all we need is △P BE ∼ △P CF (oppositely). Using coordinates and cross products, we can set P = (0, 0), E = (e1, e2), F = (f1, f2), B = (e1, e2) + α(e2, −e1), C = (f1, f2) − α(f2, −f1) for some nonzero real α. Solving for Q = (x, y), we get x(e2 − f2 − αf1) + y(f1 − αf2 − e1) = (e2f1 − e1f2) + α(e2f2 − e1f1) and x(f2 − e2 + αe1) + y(e1 + αe2 − f1) = (e1f2 − e2f1) − α(e2f2 − e1f1), so adding the two equations, xα(e1 − f1) + yα(e2 − f2) = 0, as desired. This is also easy with complex numbers, if we set p = 0 and take a real r such that (b − e)/e = −(c − f )/f = ri. 15. The key idea for both of the following solutions is to use a lot of bounding ideas; the former focuses on parity while the latter focuses on discrete continuity (since the slope of the partial sums graph is aproximately 2). The answer is n = 1, 2, 3, whose constructions are obvious. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a counterexample (a1, . . . , an) for some n ≥ 4. We will only use the integer arithmetic mean condition for blocks of 2k terms, where k ≥ 1. For k = 1, we get ai+1 + ai+2 ≡ 1 (mod 2); by induction, we get ai+1 + · · · + ai+2k ≡ 2k−1 (mod 2k) (assuming all indices are in range). As an easy corollary, ai ≡ ai+2k (mod 2k) for all k ≥ 1, and the ai must alternate in parity. (*) First suppose n = 2n1 is even (n1 ≥ 2). By (*), we can WLOG assume a1 is odd (since there are an even number of terms), so set ai = 2bi + 1 for odd i and ai = 2bi + 2 for even i (bi ≥ 0 for all i). Then b1 + · · · + b2n1 = 2(2n1) − 1 − (1 + 2)n1 2 = n1 − 1 2 = n2 for some positive integer n2. Thus b1 + · · · + b4n2+2 = n2. 2012 Blue and Black Homework Solutions By (*), we have bi ≡ bi+2k (mod 2k−1) and bi+1 + · · · + bi+2k ≡ 0 (mod 2 k−1) for all k ≥ 2 (since (1 + 2)(2k−1) ≡ 2 k−1 (mod 2k)). In particular, by bounding we know that at most one of b1, . . . , b4 can be odd, but because b1 + · · · + b4 is even, we must have the bi all even. Thus we can set bi = 2ci for all i and n2 = 2n3 (n3 ≥ 1) so that c1 + · · · + c8n3+2 = n3. Again by (*) (we can just directly extend the congruences for bi this time, however), we have ci ≡ ci+2k (mod 2k−2) and ci+1 + · · · + ci+2k ≡ 0 (mod 2 k−2) for all k ≥ 3. By the same bounding method (this time using c1, . . . , c8), we get that all the ci must be even, so we can set ci = 2di for all i and n3 = 2n4 (n4 ≥ 1). Continuing this descent, we get a contradiction, since n is ﬁnite. Next suppose n = 4n1 + 1 (n1 ≥ 1). Since the terms alternate in parity, and 2n − 1 is odd, we must have an odd number of odd terms and so ai is odd iﬀ i is odd. If we let ai = 2bi + 1 for odd i and ai = 2bi + 2 for even i, then b1 + · · · + b4n1+1 = 2(4n1 + 1) − 1 − (1 + 2)(2n1) − 1 2 = n1, and we can proceed in the same way as we did for the n = 2n1 case. Finally, suppose n = 4n1 + 3 (n1 ≥ 1). This time, we have ai odd iﬀ i is even, so set ai = 2bi + 1 for even i and ai = 2bi + 2 for odd i. Then b1 + · · · + b4n1+3 = 2(4n1 + 3) − 1 − (2 + 1)(2n1 + 1) − 2 2 = n1, and we can again ﬁnish in the same way. Alternatively (while this solution is more natural, it requires not just powers of 2 for the integer mean condition), note that the integer arithmetic mean property is unaﬀected by translation; thus it’s natural to translate everything down by 2. Note that a ′ i ≥ −1 always, so look at the set of partial sums and use discrete continuity. 16. KEY IDEA: EVERY TROMINO CONTAINS A PAIR (EITHER NORMAL OR DISJOINT) approach 1: 1. natural to try 3x3 (nice way is to consider ﬁrst row, then next two add at most 2) 2. extend (1) to 3xn to get an asymptotically 1/3 # squares bound, which allows for an inductive solution 3. alternatively to get to 2, want to understand mxn for small m, n (m = 1, 2 are obvious though, and don’t allow for each induction if the leading quadratic constant is 1/3) approach 2: 1. global approaches diﬃcult; note that each tromino has ≥ 2 squares of some color, so because 2 + 2 > 3, exactly one color with ≥ 2 squares 2. want to analyze each color separately, so consider # x’s and # trominos ”bearing” x and do some sums (each row, column independently) 3. alternatively to get to 2, consider number of normal pairs and disjoint pairs, then note that to count these pairs we want to sum over triples 17. either use approximation for 1/(n − x) for x ≈ 1 (solves for all but small n, which we do manually), or do standard manipulations so that we want to show ∑ aiaj n−aiaj ≤ n 2 ; then use aiaj ≤ (ai + aj) 2/4 and n − aiaj ≥ ((n − a 2 i ) + (n − a 2 j ))/2, then titu’s, then sum over everything 18. One powerful idea is if r1 + r2 = b1 + b2, then eitehr f (r1 + r2) = f (r1) + f (r2) or f (b1 + b2) = f (b1) + f (b2). More generally, we want to use f (x) + f (y) = f (z) as much as possible (since f (z)/z ≤ max{f (x)/x, f (y)/y}, which requires x, y, x + y to be the same color. Obviously this is easiest to do 2012 Blue and Black Homework Solutions when we have long strings of the same color. Indeed, suppose [n, n + mx] are all the same color as x; then f (n + kx) = f (n) + kf (x) for 0 ≤ k ≤ m. In particular, consider x, y of the same color; then if [n, n + xy] are all the same color, we have f (x)/x = f (y)/y. Thus we ﬁrst consider the case where at least one color has unbounded strings of consecutive numbers, WLOG red. Then f (r) = cr for all red r. If there are unbounded strings of blues as well, then f (b) = c′b for all b, so we’re done. Otherwise, there exists C > 0 such that for any blue b, there exists a red in [b + 1, b + C], so we’re also done in this case using the nondecreasing condition. It remains to consider when consecutive instances of a color diﬀer by at most M (some positive integer), i.e. strings of constant color have length at most M − 1. In particular, there exist inﬁnitely many of each color. WLOG let 1 = r1 < b1 < r2 < b2 < · · · be the starts of these strings. Now take m large enough so that bm − 1 > M . Then for all i ≥ 2, f (ri + bm − 1) ∈ {f (ri) + f (bm − 1), f (ri − 1) + f (bm)}, so max{f (ri+1), f (ri+1 − 1)} ≤ f (ri + bm − 1) ≤ max{f (ri), f (ri − 1)} + max{f (bm − 1), f (bm)}. But then there exists a positive constant α such that f (rn) ≤ alphan for all n ≥ 1, so f (n)/n ≤ f (rn)/n ≤ α for all n ≥ 1, and we’re done. 19. 20.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
