The circle Γ with BC as diameter intersects AB and AC again at P and Q, respectively. Determine ∠BAC given that the orthocenter of triangle AP Q lies on Γ. Solution. Let K denote the orthocenter of triangle AP Q. Since triangles ABC and AQP are similar it follows that K lies in the interior of triangle AP Q. Note that ∠KP A = ∠KQA = 90◦ −∠A. Since BP KQ is a cyclic quadrilateral it follows that ∠BQK = 180◦ − ∠BP K = 90◦ − ∠A, while on the other hand ∠BQK = ∠BQA − ∠KQA = ∠A since BQ is perpendicular to AC. This shows that 90◦ − ∠A = ∠A, so ∠A = 45◦. 2. Let f (x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c and g(x) = x3 + bx2 + cx + a, where a, b, c are integers with c ̸= 0. Suppose that the following conditions hold: (a) f (1) = 0; (b) the roots of g(x) are squares of the roots of f (x). Find the value of a2013 + b2013 + c2013. Solution. Note that g(1) = f (1) = 0, so 1 is a root of both f (x) and g(x). Let p and q be the other two roots of f (x), so p2 and q2 are the other two roots of g(x). We then get pq = −c and p2q2 = −a, so a = −c2. Also, (−a)2 = (p + q + 1)2 = p2 + q2 + 1 + 2(pq + p + q) = −b + 2b = b. Therefore b = c4. Since f (1) = 0 we therefore get 1 + c − c2 + c4 = 0. Factorising, we get (c + 1)(c3 − c2 + 1) = 0. Note that c3 − c2 + 1 = 0 has no integer root and hence c = −1, b = 1, a = −1. Therefore a2013 + b2013 + c2013 = −1. 3. Find all primes p and q such that p divides q2 − 4 and q divides p2 − 1. Solution. Suppose that p ≤ q. Since q divides (p − 1)(p + 1) and q > p − 1 it follows that q divides p + 1 and hence q = p + 1. Therefore p = 2 and q = 3. On the other hand, if p > q then p divides (q − 2)(q + 2) implies that p divides q + 2 or q − 2 = 0. This gives either p = q + 2 or q = 2. In the former case it follows that that q divides (q +2)2 −1, so q divides 3. This gives the solutions p > 2, q = 2 and (p, q) = (5, 3). 4. Find the number of 10-tuples (a1, a2, . . . , a10) of integers such that |a1| ≤ 1 and a2 1 + a2 2 + a2 3 + · · · + a 2 10 − a1a2 − a2a3 − a3a4 − · · · − a9a10 − a10a1 = 2 . Solution. Let a11 = a1. Multiplying the given equation by 2 we get (a1 − a2)2 + (a2 − a3) 2 + · · · (a10 − a1)2 = 4 . Note that if ai − ai+1 = ±2 for some i = 1, . . . , 10, then aj − aj+1 = 0 for all j ̸= i which contradicts the equality ∑10 i=1(ai − ai+1) = 0. Therefore ai − ai+1 = 1 for exactly two values of i in {1, 2, . . . , 10}, ai − ai+1 = −1 for two other values of i and ai − ai+1 = 0 for all other values of i. There are (10 2 ) × (8 2 ) = 45 × 28 possible ways of choosing these values. Note that a1 = −1, 0 or 1, so in total there are 3 × 45 × 28 possible integer solutions to the given equation. 1 Paper 1 Regional Mathematical Olympiad 2013 December 1, 2013 5. Let ABC be a triangle with ∠A = 90◦ and AB = AC. Let D and E be points on the segment BC such that BD : DE : EC = 3 : 5 : 4. Prove that ∠DAE = 45◦. Solution. Rotating the conﬁguraiton about A by 90◦, the point B goes to the point C. Let P denote the image of the point D under this rotation. Then CP = BD and ∠ACP = ∠ABC = 45◦, so ECP is a right-angled triangle with CE : CP = 4 : 3. Hence P E = ED. It follows that ADEP is a kite with AP = AD and P E = ED. Therefore AE is the angular bisector of ∠P AD. This implies that ∠DAE = ∠P AD/2 = 45◦. 6. Suppose that m and n are integers such that both the quadratic equations x2 + mx − n = 0 and x2 − mx + n = 0 have integer roots. Prove that n is divisible by 6. Solution. Let a be an integer. If a is not divisible by 3 then a2 ≡ 1 (mod 3), i.e., 3 divides a2 − 1, and if a is odd then a2 ≡ 1 (mod 8), i.e., 8 divides a2 − 1. Note that the discriminants of the two quadratic polynomials are both squares of integers. Let a and b be integers such that m2 − 4n = a2 and m2 + 4n = b2. Therefore 8n = b2 − a2 and 2m2 = a2 + b2. If 3 divides m then 3 divides both a and b, so 3 divides n. On the other hand if 3 does not divide m then 3 does not divide a or b. Therefore 3 divides b2 − a2 and hence 3 divides n. If m is odd, then so is a, and therefore 4n = m2 − a2 is divisible by 8, so n is even. On the other hand, if m is even then both a and b are even. Further (m/2)2 − n = (a/2)2 and (m/2)2 + n = (b/2)2, so (b − a)/2 is even. In particular, n = (b2 − a2)/4 is even. ——— ⋆ ——— 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
