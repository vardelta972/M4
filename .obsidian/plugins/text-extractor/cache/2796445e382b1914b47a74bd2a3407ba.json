Three positive real numbers x, y, z satisfy the equations x 2 + xy + y 2 /3=25,y 2 /3+ z 2 =9,z 2 + zx + x 2 =16. Find the value of xy +2yz +3zx. 2. Let f be a polynomial with real coefﬁcients such that f (x) \u0000 f 0 (x) for all x 2 R. Show that f (x) \u0000 0 for all x 2 R. 3. Let r 0 ,r 1 ,r 2 , ·· · ,r v be positive integers such that that r 0 + r 1 + ·· · + r v = n, where v = s 2 and n = ts(s +1) (here s, t 2 N). Find r i ’s which minimize the sum v X i=1 ✓ 1 r 0 + 1 r i ◆ . 4. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, and let diagonals AC and BD meet at X. The perpendiculars from X meet the sides AB, BC, CD, DA at A 0 ,B 0 ,C 0 ,D 0 , respectively. Prove that A 0 B 0 + C 0 D 0 = A 0 D 0 + B 0 C 0 . 5.
