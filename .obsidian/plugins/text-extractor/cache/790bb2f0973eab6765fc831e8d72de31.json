Let a, b, c be positive reals such that 1/a +1/b +1/c =1. Show that a a bc + b b ca + c c ab \u0000 27(ab + bc + ca). 3. Prove that for any integers a, b, c, there exists a positive integer n such that the number n 3 + an 2 + bn + c is not a perfect square. 4. Elmo and Elmo’s clone are playing a game. Initially, n \u0000 3 points are given on a circle. On a player’s turn, that player must draw a triangle using three unused points as vertices, without creating any crossing edges. The ﬁrst player who cannot move loses. If Elmo’s clone goes ﬁrst and players alternate turns, who wins? (Your answer may be in terms of n.) 5. Let f :[0, 1] ! R be differentiable, with f (0) = 0. Moreover, suppose that f satisﬁes |f 0 (x)|  |f (x)| for every x 2 [0, 1]. Prove that f (x)= 0 for all x 2 [0, 1]. 6. Triangle ABC has right angle at C and \\BAC = ✓. Point D is chosen on AB so that |AC| = |AD| =1, and point E is chosen on BC so that \\CDE = ✓. The perpendicular to BC at E meets AB at F . Determine lim ✓!0 |EF |. 7. Cookie Monster says a positive integer n is crunchy if there exist 2n real numbers x 1 ,x 2 ,. .., x 2n , not all equal, such that the sum of any n of the x i ’s is equal to the product of the other n of the x i ’s. Help Cookie Monster determine all crunchy integers. 8. Let f :[0, 1] ! R be a continuous function such that Z 1 0 f (x)dx = Z 1 0 xf (x)dx. Show that there is a c 2 (0, 1) such that f (c)= Z c 0 f (x)dx.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
