If e 2 E(G), then G=e (\\G contract e\") is the graph formed by deleting e and identifying its endpoints. De\fnition 1.2. A graph H is a minor of a graph G i\u000b it's obtainable from a subgraph of G by contracting edges. That is, to get a minor, one \frst deletes vertices and edges, then contracts edges. Note that contraction and deletion commute, so one can do so any order. Theorem 1.3 (Wagner's Theorem). A graph G is planar unlesss it has a K5 or K3;3 minor. Theorem 1.4 (Kuratowski's Theorem). A graph G is planar unlesss it has a subdivision of K5 or K3;3 (that is, with edges turned into paths) as a subgraph. Theorem 1.5 (Seymour). If G is an in\fnite set of graphs, then one is a minor of another. 1. Prove that every 3-connected graph has a K4 minor. 2. Prove that a graph G can be drawn in the plane with all vertices in the same region unlesss G has a K4 or K3;2 minor. 3. Prove that if a graph G has no K5 minor, then it's 4-colorable. (You may assume the Four-color Theorem.) 4. (D. W. Hall) Find all simple 3-connected graphs with no K3;3 minor. Tutte Find all simple 3-connected graphs G such that no edge of G can be deleted or contracted to give another simple 3-connected graph. 5. Prove that every simple graph with average degree at least 2 p has a Kp+2 minor. 6. Prove that if G is nonnull and loopless and jE(G)j \u0015 2jV (G)j \u0000 1, then G has a graph with three parallel edges as a minor. 1 7. Find all 2-connected graphs with no C5 minor. 8. Find all 2-connected graphs with no K4 n e minor. 9. (Kotzig's Theorem, also 2009 MOP K6.2/B6.4) Let G be a connected graph that has a perfect matching. Prove that if for any edge e of the perfect matching, Gne is connected, then G has another perfect matching. 10. Prove that if you partition the edges of K1 into \fnitely many sets, then one of them has its own K1. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
