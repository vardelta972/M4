Use of mobile phones, smartphones, ipads, calculators, programmable wrist watches is STRICTLY PROHIBITED. Only ordinary pens and pencils are allowed inside the ex- amination hall. 2. The correction is done by machines through scanning. On the OMR Sheet, darken bubbles completely with a black or blue ball pen. Please DO NOT use a pencil or a gel pen. Darken the bubbles completely, only after you are sure of your answer; else, erasing may lead to the OMR sheet getting damaged and the machine may not be able to read the answer. . 3. The name, email address, and date of birth entered on the OMR sheet will be your login credentials for accessing your score. 4. Incompletely, incorrectly or carelessly ﬁlled information may disqualify your candi- dature. 5. Each question has a one or two digit number as answer. The ﬁrst diagram below shows improper and proper way of darkening the bubbles with detailed instructions. The second diagram shows how to mark a 2-digit number and a 1-digit number. 6. The answer you write on OMR sheet is irrelevant. The darkened bubble will be considered as your ﬁnal answer. 7.
