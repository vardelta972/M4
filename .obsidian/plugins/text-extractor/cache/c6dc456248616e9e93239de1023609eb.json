Show that for a regular polygon with n sides (n > 5), the number of triangles whose vertices are non-adjacent vertices of the polygon is n(n − 4)(n − 5)/6. 2. Each face of a cube is coloured by a diﬀerent color. How many of the colourings are distinct. 3. Let A be a 2n-element set where n > 1. Find the number of diﬀerent pairings of A. 4. For a positive integer n, the n-th subdivision of an equilateral triangle ABC is the conﬁg- uration obtained by (i) dividing each side of △ABC into n + 1 equal parts by n points; and (ii) adding 3n line segments to join the 3n pairs of such points on adjacent sides so that the line segments are parallel to the third side. Find the number of parallelograms in the n-th subdivision of an equilateral triangle. 5. Let A ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , 2n} such that |A| = n + 1.

Let A = {a1, a2, . . . , a2k+1}, where k ≥ 1, be a set of 2k + 1 positive integers. Show that for any permutation aπ(1), aπ(2), . . . , aπ(2k+1) of A, the product ∏2k+1 j=1 (aπ(j) − aj) is always even. 8. Prove that the decimal expansion of a rational number is eventually repeating. What about the converse? 9. Consider a set of 2n points in space, n > 1. No three are collinear. Prove that maximum n2 segments (with end points from the given points) can be drawn without forming any triangle with vertices from the given points. 10. Suppose that to every point of the plane a color, either red or blue, is associated. Show that there must exist an equilateral triangle with all vertices of the same colour. 11. Forty-one rooks are placed on a 10 × 10 chessboard. Prove that you can choose ﬁve of them that do not attack each other. (We say that two rooks “attack” each other if they are in the same row or column of the chessboard.) 12. There is a 2n × 2n array (matrix) consisting of 0s and 1s and there are exactly 3n zeros. Show that it is possible to remove all the zeros by deleting some n rows and some n columns. Also show that, given any positive integer n there exists a arrangement of 3n + 1 zeroes such that the 0’s can not be removed by deleting any n rows and n columns. 13. If every point of the plane is painted one of three colors, do there necessarily exist two points of the same color exactly one inch apart? 14. Let a1 < a2 < · · · < a43 < a44 be positive integers not exceeding 125. Prove that among the 43 consecutive diﬀerences di = ai+1 − ai, some value must occur at least 10 times. 15.

In a given circle, n ≥ 2 arbitrary chords are drawn such that no three are concurrent within the interior of the circle. Suppose m is the number of points of intersection of the chords within the interior. Find, in terms of n and m, the number r of line segments obtained through dividing the chords by their points of intersection. 17. Suppose that m chords of a given circle are drawn in such a way that no three are concurrent in the interior of the circle. If n denotes the number of points of intersection of the chords within the circle, show that the number of regions divided by the chords in the circle is m + n + 1. 18. For n ≥ 4, let r(n) denote the number of interior regions of a convex n-gon divided by all its diagonals if no three diagonals are concurrent within the n-gon. For instance, r(4) = 4 and r(5) = 11. Prove that r(n) = (n 4) + (n−1 2 ). 19. There are p ≥ 6 points given on the circumference of a circle, and every two of the points are joined by a chord. Assume that no 3 chords are concurrent within the interior of the circle (i) Find the number of such chords. (ii) Find the number of points of intersection of these chords within the interior of the circle. (iii) Find the number of line segments obtained through dividing the chords by their points of intersection. (iv) Find the number of triangles whose vertices are the points of intersection of the chords within the interior of the circle. 20. A group of n people are standing in a circle, numbered consecutively clockwise from 1 to n. Starting with person no. 2, we remove every other person, proceeding clockwise. For example, if n = 6, the people are removed in the order 2, 4, 6, 3, 1, and the last person remaining is no. 5. Let j(n) denote the last person remaining. Find some simple way to compute j(n) for any positive integer n > 1. 21. Let an denote the number of ways to express n as a sum of positive integers greater than 1, taking order into account. For example a2 = 1 since 2 = 2 is the only representation of 2 in the required form. Similarly a3 = 1. a4 = 2 because 4 = 4 and 4 = 2 + 2 are two representations of 4 in required form. a5 = 3 because 5 = 5, 5 = 2 + 3 and 5 = 3 + 2. Find a recurrence relation for (an). Is (an) an well known sequence? 22. Prove using a combinatorial argument n∑ k=1 k−1∑ i=0 (k − 1 i )(n − k i ) = 2 n−1. 23.

If each row of a rectangular array of distinct real numbers is an increasing sequence, is the same thing true of the rectangular array obtained by rearranging each column to be an increasing sequence (read from top to bottom)? 38. Can a thousand people seated around a circle in seats numbered from 1 to 1000, each person bearing one of the numbers from 1 to 1000, be re-seated so as to preserve their (circular) order and so that no person’s number is the same as that of his chair? 39.

At n distinct points of a circular race course, n cars are ready to start. Each of them covers the course in an hour. At a given signal every car selects one of the two possible directions and starts immediately. Whenever two cars meet both of them change directions and go on without loss of speed. Show that at a certain moment each car will be at its starting point. 41. Each of n boys attends a school gathering with both of his parents. In how many ways can the 3n people be divided into groups of three such that each group contains a boy, a male parent and a female parent, and no boy is with both of his parents in his group? 42. A man has 6 friends. At dinner in a certain restaurant, he has met each of them 12 times, every two of them 6 times, every three of them 4 times, every four of them 3 times, every ﬁve twice and all six only once. He has dined out 8 times without meeting any of them. How many times has he dined out altogether? 43. Three identical black balls, four identical red balls and ﬁve identical white balls are to be arranged in a -row. Find the number of ways that this can be done if all the balls with the same colour do not form a single block. 44. In how many ways can a 2 × n board can be ﬁlled by n many 2 × 1 dominoes? 45.

A rooted binary tree is an arrangement of points (nodes) and lines connecting them where there is a special node (the root) and as you descend from the root, there are either two lines going down or zero. Internal nodes are the ones that connect to two nodes below. Find the number of rooted binary trees with n internal nodes. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
