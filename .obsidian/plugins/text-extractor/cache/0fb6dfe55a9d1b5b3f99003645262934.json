Pretty tricky, huh? Well, ﬁrst, since they are asking us to ﬁnd this value, we can assume that the given value converges, so let S be what we are trying to ﬁnd. Then S2 = xS or S = x. Another way to do it is to notice that the value is x 1 2 + 1 4 + 1 8 +... = x 1 = x Here’s another problem: Find √ x + √ x + √x + . . . Again, let S be what we are trying to ﬁnd, then S2 = x + S, or S = 1±√1+4x 2 , and since S > 0, we have S = 1+√1+4x 2 . Okay, now ﬁnd 0.50.50.5... Finding Sums Usually the idea is to add parts of the series to itself to make it telescope, or decompose it into other, known series, or break it down into a simpler series, etc. Here is a pretty well-known example: Find 1 2 + 1 6 + 1 12 + 1 20 + . . . + 1 n(n − 1) Telescope it please! (Hint: TPIAARL TFIROANC ODSEICTOIMOPN). Okay, now here’s a pretty tricky problem: Find 1m + 2 m + 3m + 4 m + 5m + . . . + nm where m is the smallest integer such that you do not already know the answer to this. Another cool thing is to add imaginary numbers to the numerator of a series to make stuﬀ factor or telescope, but that is advancedish so worry about getting down the basics ﬁrst. 1 2 Advanced Techniques Solving Recursions All linear recursions are exponential. Except those that are not. Here is how you solve a recursion: If it is of the form n∑ i=1 an+ibi = 0 for all n, then assume it is exponential and factor the polynomial n∑ i=1 bix i = 0 then your recursion is of the form an = ∑ i cirn i where the ci are determined by any n known terms of the sequence. If you have a double root, or triple root, or something, instead of ci you have (ci + nci+1)rn i and (ci + nci+1 + n2ci+2)rn i , respectively, and this generalizes (here ri = ri+1 and ri = ri+1 = ri+2). If you have some silly linear term at the end, like an+1 = 3an − 1 then you can simply write an+1 = 3an − 1 an+2 = 3an+1 − 1 and subtracting the two gives an+2 − an+1 = 3an+1 − 3an an+2 = 4an+1 − 3an and we now have a linear recursion that we can solve. The same method can be applied if we have any polynomial at the end. A Little Bit of That Stuﬀ That We Don’t Know By that, I mean Calculus, since apparently Calculus is not expected to be known by anyone in high school. However, this is blatantly FALSE as even if most problems have a non-calculus solu- tion, some things are much easier with calculus. Example one: ∞∑ i=0 1 i! 2 This is just e1 = e. Example two: ∞∑ i=0 (−1)i i! This is e−1 = 1 e . Example three: ∞∑ i=0 i 5i We can just let f (x) = 1 1−x = ∑∞ i=0 xi. Then take the derivative, and set x to 5, and cool stuﬀ should happen. 3 Problems If you are at the beginning lecture, start on problem x. If you are at the advanced lecture, start on problem y, where y > x. 1. (Traditional) Compute ∞∑ k=2 1 n2 − 1 2. (Traditional) Compute 1 + 9 + 25 + 49 + . . . + 729 3.
