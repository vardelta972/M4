Prove that |f (x)|  3/2 for every x 2 [\u00001, 1]. 2. Let a, b, c be positive integers such that a 2 \u0000 bc is a perfect square. Prove that 2a + b + c is not a prime. 3. Let G be the centroid of 4ABC. If \\BAC =60 \u0000 , \\BGC =120 \u0000 and AB =10 cm, ﬁnd the area of 4ABC. 4. Let x, y, z \u0000 1 be real numbers such that 1 x 2 \u0000 1 + 1 y 2 \u0000 1 + 1 z 2 \u0000 1 =1. Prove that 1 x +1 + 1 y +1 + 1 z +1  1. 5. Find all triples (f, g, h) of injective functions from R to R which satisfy f (x + f (y)) = g(x)+ h(y),g(x + g(y)) = h(x)+ f (y),h(x + h(y)) = f (x)+ g(y) for all real numbers x and y. 6. Suppose that P is a polynomial with integer coefﬁcients such that n divides P (2 n ) for every positive integer n. Prove that P must be the zero polynomial. 7. The numbers from 1 through 2020 are written on a blackboard. Every second, Dr. Math erases four numbers of the form a, b, c, a+b+c (of course if such numbers are available) and replaces them with the numbers a + b, b + c, c + a. Prove that this cannot continue for more than 10 minutes. 8. Let f :[0, 1] ! R be a continuous function satisfying R 1 0 f (x)dx =0 and f (0)f (1) > 0. Assume further that f 0 is continuous on (0, 1). Show that there exists c 2 (0, 1) such that exp(f 0 (c)) = f (c)+1. (Here exp(t) means e t .)","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
