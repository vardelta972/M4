Unfortunately, most school curricula do not cover number theory at all, leaving many people clueless about the subject. In general, number theory is the study of the integers and their properties. This article will go over the theorems and concepts of number theory everyone absolutely must know to get anywhere in number theory, as well as provide some practice. 1 Modular Arithmetic Mods should naturally spring to mind while working with number theory. Basically, ”a (mod b)” is the remainder when a is divided by b. For all integers n > 1, we say that modulo n is a ”congruence class.” You don’t really need to know the technicalities of the deﬁ- nition of a congruence class for now. Basically, we have a ≡ a+kn (mod n) for all integers k. Here are several warmups: 1. Evaluate 8 + 53 + 312987236982365189235638216537821582568713459713445 (mod 5). 2. Evaluate (8 + 53) 312987236982365189235638216537821582568713459713445 (mod 5). 3. Evaluate (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 + 11 + 13 + 14 + 15 + 16 + 17 + 18 + 19 + 20)31298723698236518923563821653782158256871345971344555555 (mod 11). 4. Find all values of 3√6 (mod 7). 5. Evaluate 4 4444 (mod 10). 2 Five Theorems These theorems should be second nature to you. 2.1 Euler’s Theorem For any two relatively prime integers n > 2 and a, a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). 1 Note that ϕ(n) is deﬁned as the number of naturals less than n and relatively prime to n. If n is a prime, we have the subsidiary Fermat’s Little Theorem, which states that an ≡ a (mod n). 2.2 Wilson’s Theorem For any prime p, (p − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod p). 2.3 Chinese Remainder Theorem If an integer has a certain residue in certain prime mods, then it has a unique residue in the mod that is the product of those prime mods. 2.4 Dirichlet’s Theorem For any relatively prime naturals a and b , there are an inﬁnite number of primes that are congruent to a (mod b) 2.5 Bertrand’s Postulate For every real n > 1, there is at least one prime number p such that n < p < 2n. This interesting result has been proven, and is more accurately named Chebyshev’s Theorem. Some people mistakenly call this Bernard’s Postulate. 3 Diophantine Equations A very common type of number theory problem in many math olympiads is the diophantine equation(DE). This is any equation in which the solution set is comprised of only integers. Generally, a problem will present a system of diophantine equations and ask you to ﬁnd all the solutions, and prove that you have found every one of them. 3.1 How to write the a DE solution There are three steps to writing a solution to a DE problem: 3.1.1 Write the answers Before writing anything else, simply state all the solutions. You can use variables to do this. For example, if you had to write solutions to the DE x + y = 0, you could write (n, −n) for n ∈ Z. 2 3.1.2 Show that your answers all work You can usually get away with saying ”It is trivial to show that these answers satisfy the given equation(s).” This step could even be omitted if it is really obvious. 3.1.3 Prove that you have given all the answers This is by far the hardest step. Here, you have to prove that there are no answers you have not found. You will have to use some number theory to do this. 3.2 Methods for solving DEs If you are stuck, try using the techniques on this list. 1. Play around with the DE. 2. Take the equation(s) in some mod. Mod 2 is a good starting point. If you see a n-th power, try using mod n+1 or mod 2n+1. If you see squares, also try mod 4 and mod 8. If you see cubes, try mod 8, or mod 9. If you see fourth powers, try mod 16. Sometimes the key step to a problem is ﬁnding the right mod. 3. Try to factor anything, including constants and coeﬃcients. 4. Guess and check to ﬁnd solutions. 5. Impose an extra condition. For example, if the DE is symmetrical, WLOG a ≥ b ≥ c Don’t forget to state all the answers. 6. Don’t forget negative numbers and 0. Often 0 is a special case. 7. Can you show that there cannot be any solutions if one of the variables approaches inﬁnity? 8. Make a substitution, but try to keep stuﬀ in the integers. 9. WOP and inﬁnite descent often work together with mods to solve a problem. 10. Find an upper or lower bound for one of the variables. 11. Think about what theorems might be applicable to the problem, and try to use them. 12. Think about what would happen if one of the variables was prime. 13. Work on another problem for a while. 14. Assume the guy next to you has already solved the problem, and think about what he could have done. 15. Revisit some of the previous progress you made and try to build oﬀ of it. 16. Start over; pretend you have never seen the problem yet. 3 3.3 Classics There are some diophantine equations you just have to know. Here they are for you to absorb. 3.3.1 Pythagorean Triples The positive solutions to the DE a 2 + b2 = c2 are (2mn, m2 − n2, m2 + n2) and (m2 − n2, 2mn, m2 + n2) for relatively prime integers m > n. 3.3.2 Fermat’s Last Theorem There are no positive solutions to the DE a n + bn = cn for any integer n > 2. 3.3.3 Pell’s Equation If (m, n) is the smallest solution(minimum m + n) to the positive DE a 2 − b2c = 1, where c is a ﬁxed natural that is not a perfect square, then all solutions (x, y) satisfy the identity x + y√c = (m + n√c) z for some natural z, and every natural z generates one solution. Some people think this is common, but I’ve rarely seen it used in a problem, if ever. 4 Problems I challenge you to solve ALL of the following 15 problems by the time the advanced number theory lecture rolls around.
