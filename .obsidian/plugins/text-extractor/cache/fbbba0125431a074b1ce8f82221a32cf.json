Answer: 3 Solution: We compute f ′(x) = 2x and g′(x) = 1 x , so plugging in 1 for both gives us 3 . 2. Given that f (x) = x2 + ax − 17, ﬁnd all real values of a such that f (4) = f ′(4). Answer: 3 Solution: Diﬀerentiating f (x) gives us f ′(x) = 2x + a. Now f (4) = 4a − 1 and f ′(4) = a + 8, so setting the two equal yields 4a − 1 = a + 8, which solves to a = 3 . 3. Find the value of a such that ∫ a 1 (3x2 − 6x + 3) dx = 27. Answer: 4 Solution: We factor the integrand to get ∫ a 1 3(x − 1) 2dx = (x − 1) 3\f \fa 1 = (a − 1) 3 = 27. Taking the cube root of both sides yields a − 1 = 3 or a = 4 . 4. Compute ∫ 4 0 dx √ |x − 2| . Answer: 4√2 Solution: Note that the function 1√|x−2| is discontinuous at x = 2. We therefore split the integral into two parts and compute separately: ∫ 2 0 dx √ |x − 2| = ∫ 2 0 dx √2 − x = −2 √2 − x\f \f2 0 = 2 √ 2 ∫ 4 2 dx √ |x − 2| = ∫ 4 2 dx √x − 2 = 2 √x − 2\f \f4 2 = 2 √2 The answer is therefore 2 √2 + 2√2 = 4√2 . 5. Eric and Harrison are standing in a ﬁeld, and Eric is 400 feet directly East of Harrison. Eric starts to walk North at a rate of 4 feet per second, while Harrsion starts to walk South at the same time at a rate of 6 feet per second. After 30 seconds, at what rate is the distance between Eric and Harrison changing? Answer: 6 Solution: We can model the rate of a change as a right triangle with base x = 400 feet and height y increasing at a rate of 10 feet per second. After 30 seconds, we will have y = 300 feet. If we let z denote the distance between Eric and Harrison, then z is the hypotenuse of the right triangle, giving us the relation z2 = x2 + y2. Thus, the distance between Eric and Harrison after 30 seconds is z = 500 feet. Diﬀerentiating both sides also yields 2z · z′ = 2x · x′ + 2y · y′. Plugging in our values, we get 2 · 500z′ = 2 · 400 · 0 + 2 · 300 · 10, which gives us z′ = 6 feet per second. SMT 2018 Calculus Test Solutions February 17, 2018 6. Compute lim x→0 (1 − cos x)2 x2 − x2 cos2 x . Answer: 1 4 Solution: Factoring out the x2 from the denominator and recalling that sin2 x + cos2 x = 1, our limit becomes lim x→0 (1 − cos x)2 x2 sin 2 x = ( lim x→0 1 − cos x x sin x )2 . Note that the limit is in an indeterminate form 0/0 when we plug in x = 0, so we apply L’Hopital’s rule to get lim x→0 1 − cos x x sin x = lim x→0 sin x sin x + x cos x . Plugging in x = 0 still gives us the indeterminate form 0/0, so we apply L’Hopital’s rule again to get lim x→0 sin x sin x + x cos x = lim x→0 cos x cos x + cos x − x sin x . Plugging in x = 0 here gives us 1 2 . Therefore, our answer is ( 1 2 )2 = 1 4 . 7. Compute ∫ 0 −2 x3 + 4x2 + 7x − 20 x2 + 4x + 8 dx + ∫ 2 0 2x3 − 7x2 + 9x − 10 x2 + 4 dx. Answer: 12 Solution: The polynomials in the denominator are similar, so we rewrite them in the form ∫ 0 −2 x3 + 4x2 + 7x − 20 (x + 2)2 + 4 dx + ∫ 2 0 2x3 − 7x2 + 9x − 10 x2 + 4 dx. This suggests we make the u-substution u = x + 2 in the ﬁrst integral, which gives us ∫ 2 0 (u − 2)3 + 4(u − 2)2 + 7(u − 2) − 20 u2 + 4 du + ∫ 2 0 2x3 − 7x2 + 9x − 10 x2 + 4 dx which simpliﬁes down to ∫ 2 0 u3 − 2u2 + 3u − 26 u2 + 4 du + ∫ 2 0 2x3 − 7x2 + 9x − 10 x2 + 4 dx. We can then combine the two integrals into a single integral and combine like terms to get ∫ 2 0 3x3 − 9x2 + 12x − 36 x2 + 4 dx = ∫ 2 0 (3x − 9) dx = ( 3 2 x2 − 9x)\f \f \f \f 2 0 = 3 2 (2 2) − 9 · 2 = −12 . 8. Compute lim n→∞ n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x2018x+1 dx. Answer: 1 2 SMT 2018 Calculus Test Solutions February 17, 2018 Solution: The key to evaluating this limit is to approximate the limit with a simpler integral. In particular, notice that xx → 1 as x → 0. This suggests that we can approximate the integrand using x2018x = (xx)2018 ≈ 1 to get lim n→∞ n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x 2018x+1 dx = lim n→∞ n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x dx. The integral then evaluates to ∫ 1/n 0 x dx = 1 2n2 . Plugging this back into the limit gives us the answer 1 2 . To prove this claim rigorously, let ϵ > 0. Because limx→0 x2018x = 1, there exists some δ > 0 such that |x2018x − 1| < ϵ for all 0 < x < δ. Now consider the integral n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x2018x+1 − x dx. Armed with our approximation, so long as 0 < 1 n < δ, or n > 1 δ , we have \f \f \f \f \f n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x2018x+1 − x dx \f \f \f \f \f = \f \f \f \f \f n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x (x2018x − 1 ) dx \f \f \f \f \f ≤ n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x \f \fx2018x − 1 \f \f dx < n 2 ∫ 1/n 0 ϵ · x dx = ϵ 2 where we have used the facts that the function x is non-negative on the interval [0, 1/n]. We have already shown above that n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x dx = 1 2 , so for all n > 1 δ we have \f \f \f \f \f n2 ∫ 1/n 0 x 2018x+1 dx − 1 2 \f \f \f \f \f < ϵ 2 . This is precisely the deﬁnition of a limit, so we conclude that the limit does exist and approaches 1 2 as claimed above. 9. Compute ∫ π 0 2x sin x 3 + cos 2x dx. Answer: π2 4 Solution: Let I = ∫ π 0 2x sin x 3 + cos 2x dx. We ﬁrst use the identity cos 2x = 2 cos2 x − 1 to reduce the integral into the form ∫ π 0 x sin x 1 + cos2 x dx. Next, we consider the substitution x 7→ π − y. The integral then becomes ∫ π 0 (π − y) sin y 1 + cos2 y dy. SMT 2018 Calculus Test Solutions February 17, 2018 Adding the two integrals together, we get 2I = ∫ π 0 π sin x 1 + cos2 x dx. This gives us the simpler I = π 2 ∫ π 0 sin x 1 + cos2 x dx. Now use the substitution u = cos x to get − π 2 ∫ −1 1 1 1 + u2 du. This is the standard tan−1 u integral, so we have I = π 2 (tan −1(1) − tan −1(−1) ) = π 2 ( π 4 − (− π 4 )) = π2 4 . 10. Fact: The value ln(2) is not the root of any polynomial with rational coeﬃcients. For any nonnegative integer n, let pn(x) be the unique polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that pn(ln(2)) = ∫ 2 1 (ln(x)) n dx. Compute the value of the sum ∞∑ n=0 1 pn(0) . Answer: 1 e Solution: We ﬁrst attempt to compute the integral pn(ln(2)) = ∫ 2 1 (ln(x))n dx. Using inte- gration by parts with u = (ln(x))n and dv = 1, we get ∫ 2 1 (ln(x)) n dx = x(ln(x)) n\f \f2 1 − ∫ 2 1 n(ln(x)) n−1 dx = 2(ln(2)) n − n ∫ 2 1 (ln(x)) n−1 dx = 2(ln(2)) n − npn−1(ln(2)). Because ln(2) is not the root of any polynomial with rational coeﬃcients, we can plug in x = ln(2) to get the recurrence pn(x) = 2x n − npn−1(x). Recall that we are only concerned with the constant terms pn(0), so plugging in x = 0 yields pn(0) = −npn−1(0). Now since p0(ln(2)) = ∫ 2 1 dx = 1, we have p0(x) = 1, and therefore p0(0) = 1. From the recurrence, we deduce that pn(0) = (−1) n · n!. Our desired sum is thus ∞∑ n=0 1 pn(0) = ∞∑ n=0 (−1)n n! = 1 e from the Taylor series expansion of ex at x = −1.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
