After using the relation abc = 1 to homogenize both sides, we get LHS = 1 2 [ 7 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ] + 2 [ 5 3 , 2 3 , 2 3 ] + 3 2 [ 4 3 , 4 3 , 1 3 ] + 1 2 [1, 1, 1] RHS = 1 2 [ 7 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ] + [ 5 3 , 2 3 , 2 3 ] + 3 2 [ 4 3 , 4 3 , 1 3 ] + [2, 1, 0] + 1 2 [1, 1, 1] Finally LHS ≥ RHS since by Muirhead [ 5 3 , 2 3 , 2 3 ] ≥ [2, 1, 0] □ Problem 2, Solution by Zhifan Zhang: We will show that ∑ cyc b3c3(a + b)(c + a) ≥ 3 2 a 3b3c3(a + b)(b + c)(c + a). Expanding, we get LHS = [4, 3, 1] + 1 2 [3, 3, 2] + 1 2 [4, 4, 0] = [ 16 3 , 13 3 , 7 3 ] + 1 2 [ 13 3 , 13 3 , 10 3 ] + 1 2 [ 16 3 , 16 3 , 4 3 ] RHS = 3 2 [5, 4, 3] + 1 2 [4, 4, 4] By Muirhead [ 16 3 , 13 3 , 7 3 ] ≥ [5, 4, 3], [ 16 3 , 16 3 , 4 3 ] ≥ [5, 4, 3], and [ 13 3 , 13 3 , 10 3 ] ≥ [4, 4, 4]. combining these three inequalities, we get LHS ≥ RHS □ Problem 3, Solution by Gye Hyun Baek: Using the relation xy + yz + zx = 1 we get the equivalent inequality: 11 + 4(x4 + y4 + z4) ≥ 25x2y2 + z2 + (x2 + y2 + z2) + 17(x2y2 + y2z2 + z2x 2). Now we make every term to degree six by multiplying with a power of xy+yz+zx = 1. After the cancelations, we get LHS−RHS = (4 ∑ x5y + 3 ∑ x4yz + 14 ∑ x3y2z + 41x2y2z2)−( ∑ x4y2+3 ∑ x3y3). We notice that, by Muirhead 4 ∑ x5y ≥ ∑ x4y2 + 3 ∑ x3y3. Thus, LHS ≥ RHS, as desired. The equality holds when (x, y, z) = (0, 1, 1), (1, 0, 1), or (1, 1, 0) □ 2008 BLUE MOP, INEQUALITIES-II AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 4, Solution by Toan Phan: Firstly, we will prove that ∑ cyc a ≥ 3 ∑ cyc bc ∑ cyc a Multiplying out we see that this is equivalent to [2, 0, 0] ≥ [1, 1, 0] which follows by Muirhead. Secondly, we will prove that ∑ cyc a 3 b2 − bc + c2 ≥ ∑ cyc a. And this one becomes equivalent to [6, 4, 0] + [6, 3, 1] + [4, 3, 3] + [9, 1, 0] ≥ [4, 3, 3] + [7, 3, 0] + [6, 3, 1] + [6, 4, 0], which is true since by Muirhead [9, 1, 0] ≥ [7, 3, 0]. Finally, we are done by combin- ing the two inequalities we proved □ Problem 5, Solution by Damien Jiang: Let S = xy + yz + zx − 2xyz. Note that S = ∑ cyc xy ∑ cyc x − 2xyz = ∑ sym x2y + xyz. Clearly S ≥ 0 because all terms in S are non-negative. Next, we show that S ≤ 7 27 (x + y + z) 3. Expanding and canceling the likewise terms, we get the equivalent expression 6 ∑ sym x2y ≤ 7 ∑ cyc x3 + 15xyz. But this follows from Schur: 5 ∑ sym x2y ≤ 5 ∑ cyc x3 + 15xyz and Muirhead: ∑ sym x2y ≤ 2 ∑ cyc x 3 □ Problem 6, Solution by Nicholas Triantaﬁllou: After multiplying through and clearing the denominators, we get LHS = 4[5, 1, 0] + 10[4, 1, 1] + 8[4, 2, 0] + 6[3, 3, 0] + 52[3, 2, 1] + 16[2, 2, 2] RHS = 9[4, 2, 0] + 9[4, 1, 1] + 54[3, 2, 1] + 9[3, 3, 0] + 15[2, 2, 2] and LHS −RHS = (4[5, 1, 0]−[4, 2, 0]−3[3, 3, 0])+xyz([3, 0, 0]+[1, 1, 1]−2[2, 1, 0]) ≥ 0, where the last inequality follows from Murihead and Schur □ 4 2008 BLUE MOP, INEQUALITIES-II AL˙I G ¨UREL Problem 7, Solution by Matthew Superdock: After expanding and canceling likewise terms we get ∑ sym (x5 − x2)(y5 + z2 + x2)(z5 + x2 + y2) ≥ 0 ⇔ ∑ sym (x5y5z5 + 4x7y5 + x9 + x5y2z2) ≥ ∑ sym (x5y5z2 + 2x5y4 + x6 + 2x4y2 + x2y2z2) By Muirhead and that xyz ≥ 1, we have the following inequalities: ∑ sym x5y5z5 ≥ ∑ sym x2y2z2 ∑ sym x7y5 ≥ ∑ sym x5y5z2 2 ∑ sym x7y5 ≥ 2 ∑ sym x6y5z ≥ 2 ∑ sym x5y4 ∑ sym x9 ≥ ∑ sym x7yz ≥ ∑ sym x6 ∑ sym x7y5 ≥ ∑ sym x 13 3 y 7 3 z 1 3 ≥ ∑ sym x4y2 ∑ sym x7y5 ≥ ∑ sym x 6y4z2 ≥ ∑ sym x4y2. Combining all these, we are done □ Problem 8, Solution by Minseon Shin: Since abc = 1, there exists positive reals x, y, z such that a = x/y, b = y/z, c = z/x. Substituting into the inequality, we get: (−x + y + z)(x − y + z)(x + y − z) xyz ≤ 1 ⇔ [2, 1, 0] ≤ 1 2 [1, 1, 1] + 1 2 [3, 0, 0], which is true by Schur □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
