A coil has an inductance of 2mH, and a current through it changes from 0.2A to 1.5A in a time of 0.2s. Find the magnitude of the average induced emf in the coil during this time. Solution: Just kidding. 2. Prove that the number of binary sequences with an even number of 1’s is equal to the number of binary sequences with an odd number of 1’s. Solution: Easy induction. 3 Equality 1. Let Fn be the Fibonacci sequence. Prove that F 2 n = Fn−1 + Fn+1 ± 1. Determine when it’s +1 and when it’s −1. Solution: It’s actually F 2 n = Fn−1 + Fn+1 + (−1) n. Inductive step is just evaluating FnFn+2 and expanding out Fn+2 = Fn + Fn+1. 2. (Titu98) Let a be a real number such that sin a + cos a is a rational number. Prove that for all n ∈ N, sin n a + cosn a is rational. Solution: Clearly true for n = 2; then to go from n 7→ n + 1, just multiply the 1-case by the n case; use the fact that n = 1, 2 show that sin cos ∈ Q. 3. You’ve seen maps in geography books. Did you know that they could all be colored with just 4 colors? (That is, “colored” in the sense that no two adjacent countries are the same color. Note that if two countries share a corner, they do not count as being “adjacent”.) Prove it! Solution: Well, this is actually the 4-color theorem, which was proved via computer. So don’t try too hard. 1 4. (Ricky03 from Internet) I’m playing the color-country game against Bob. We take turns; on my turn, I draw in a country. On Bob’s turn, he chooses any color for the country, but he must make sure that no adjacent countries share the same color. Is it possible for me to force Bob to use more than 4 colors? Solution: Yes it is. Prove the following statement by induction: for any N , I can force Bob to use N colors, and furthermore, when Bob uses the N -th color, it is on a country that has an unshared border. This is clearly true for N = 2. For the inductive step, suppose we have it for N , and we are trying to get N + 1. Well, then ﬁrst make Bob use N colors. Now, start a new blob of countries in a remote area, and force Bob to use 1 color in that blob. (He must use 1 of the N .) Next, start another new blob, and force Bob to use another of the N colors in that blob (possible by induction hypothesis). Proceed until we have N new blobs with each of the N colors in the exteriors; then engulf everything in a huge (not simply-connected) region; that region must have a color diﬀerent from the N colors. So we are done. 5. (MOP98) Let S be the set of nonnegative integers. Let h : S → S by a bijective function. Prove that there do not exist functions f, g from S to itself, f injective and g surjective, such that f (n)g(n) = h(n) for all n ∈ S. Solution: Use contradiction; assume that f and g exist, and deﬁne F = f ◦ h−1, G = g ◦ h−1; now F is injective and G is surjective, and f (n)g(n) = h(n) ⇔ F (n)G(n) = n. Prove by strong induction that F (n) = n: at n = 1, we have F (1)G(1) = 1 ⇒ F (1) = 1 since we are in nonnegative integers. But then if true up to N , then F (N + 1)G(N + 1) = N + 1 ⇒ F (N + 1) ∈ [1, N + 1] and by injectivity, F (N + 1) = N + 1. Hence G can only take on two values, 1 and something else, so not surjective. Contradiction. 6. Show that every 2 n × 2 n board with one square removed can be covered by Triominoes. Solution: First we inductively prove that we can tile any 2n × 2 n board such that we only miss one of the corners. Then look at a general 2 n × 2n board and split it into 4 equal squares. One of the squares contains the missing block, and we can use the previous result to tile the other 3 major squares. Recursively descend. 4 Inequality 1. Prove the AM-GM inequality by induction. Solution: Easy for n = 1, 2; use n to show 2n, and then use n to show n − 1. For n 7→ 2n, plug in (ak + ak+1)/2; for the other one, use an = (a1 + · · · + an−1)/(n − 1). 2. (Zuming97) Let a1 = 2 and an+1 = an/2 + 1/an for n = 1, 2, . . .. Prove that √2 < an < √2 + 1/n. Solution: Draw a picture to see why it is always greater than √2. Also use AM-GM to prove that we must be beyond √2. For the other side, induct and bound an+1 < ( √2 + 1/n)/2 + 1/ √2 = √2 + 1/(2n) 3. (Zuming97) For the positive sequence {an} with a 2 n ≤ an − an+1, prove that an < 1/(n + 2). Solution: Positive sequence, so a1 ≤ 1, and a2 ≤ 1/4 by AM-GM, or function theory. Now an+1 ≤ an(1 − an) ≤ 1 n + 2 (1 − 1 n + 2 ) = 1 n + 2 n + 1 n + 2 ≤ 1 n + 2 n + 2 n + 3 = 1 n + 3 4. (Zuming97) For a > 0, prove that: v u u √ a + √ 2a + √ 3a + √4a + √5a < √a + 1 2 Solution: True for n = 1. Let fk(a) be the k-th iteration evaluated at a. Then if it’s true for some k: fk+1(a) 2 < fk(2a) + a < √2a + 1 + a < a + 2 √a + 1 = (√a + 1) 2 5. Prove that 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · = ∞ Solution: Bunch the terms in packs of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc. Each pack will exceed 1, and there are inﬁnitely many of them. 6. Prove that 1 + 1 22 + 1 32 + · · · + 1 n2 < 2 Solution: Similar bunching, but now the bunches are bounded by 1/2 k, geometric series converges to 2. 5 Additional Problems 1. (MOP97) Let Fk be the Fibonacci sequence, where F0 = F1 = 1 and Fn+2 = Fn + Fn+1. Prove that for every n, k ∈ N: Fn ≤ FkFn−k + Fk+1Fn−k−1 ≤ Fn+1 Solution: Write-up for 1997 MOP test 11, problem 3. 2. (MOP97) Prove that for n, k ∈ Z, n > 0, k ≥ 0: Fn+2 − FkFn−k − Fk+1Fn−k−1 = Fk+1Fn−k Solution: Write-up for 1997 MOP test 11, problem 3. 3. (MOP97) Given a sequence of numbers {a1, . . . , an}, deﬁne the derived sequence {a ′ 1, . . . , a ′ n+1} by a ′ k = S − ak−1 − ak, where S = min 1≤k≤n+1(ak−1 + ak) + max 1≤k≤n+1(ak−1 + ak) and a0 = an+1 = 0. Thus, if we start with the sequence {1} of length 1 and apply the derived sequence operation again and again, we get the family of sequences: {1}, {1, 1}, {2, 1, 2}, {3, 2, 2, 3}, {5, 3, 4, 3, 5}, . . . Show that when we apply the operation 2n times in succession to the initial sequence {1} (with n ≥ 1), we get a sequence whose middle (i.e. (n + 1)-st) term is a perfect square. Solution: Write-up for 1997 MOP test 11, problem 3. 4. (Titu98) Prove that for every n ∈ N, there exists a ﬁnite set of points in the plane such that for every point of the set there exist exactly n other points of the set at distance equal to 1 from that point. Solution: Ask Titu 3 5. (Titu98) Let f : N → N be such that f (n + 1) > f (f (n)) for all n ∈ N. Prove that f (n) = n for all n. 6. (MOP97) Suppose that each positive integer not greater than n(n2 − 2n + 3)/2 is colored one of two colors (red or blue). Show that there must be an n-term sequence a1 < a2 < · · · an satisfying a2 − a1 ≤ a3 − a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an − an−1.
