It often happens with cyclic problems, when the equality holds for totally diﬀerent variables. There is a very helpful method which is often used to resolve this matter called the entirely mixing variables method. It is for annulling one variable that’s equal to 0, namely subtracting simultaneously from all variables a ﬁxed value. The method can be used when there is a disparity of terms that approximate to 0 (which can be understand is three diﬀerences (a − b), (b − c), (c − a) for three-variable problems). See the following example to know thoroughly about it Problem 1. Prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c we have a 3 + b3 + c 3 − 3abc ≥ 4(a − b)(b − c)(c − a). Solution. The above inequality can be rewritten as follow (a + b + c) ((a − b) 2 + (b − c) 2 + (c − a) 2) ≥ 8(a − b)(b − c)(c − a) (1) WLOG, we may assume that c = min(a, b, c). Fix the diﬀerences a − b, b − c, c − a and decrease simultaneously from a, b, c one value c (which means that we supersede a, b, c by a − c, b − c, 0), hence a − b, a − c, b − c don’t change but a + b + c is decreased. Thus the left hand side of (1) is decreased but the right hand side of (1) is invariable. So we only need to prove the problem in case a, b ≥ c = 0, the problem becomes a 3 + b3 ≥ 4ab(b − a), But this above one is obviously true because 4a(b − a) ≤ b2 ⇒ 4ab(b − a) ≤ b3 ≤ a 3 + b3. The equality occurs if and only if a = b = c. q This is only a simple sample, but represent the idea of method straightforwardly. A remarkable feature of this solution is a small comment, that if we decrease a, b, c at once by a number which is not bigger than min(a, b, c), one side is decreased but another side is immutable. To prove it is very easy, because the degree (of close-to-0 values) of (a + b + c) ((a − b) 2 + (b − c) 2 + (c − a) 2) is 2, and of (a − b)(b − c)(c − a) is 3. We also have a similar problem of four variables as follow Problem 2. Prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c, d then a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 − 4abcd ≥ 2(a − b)(b − c)(c − d)(d − a), and in case (a − b)(c − d) ≤ 0, the inequality above is still true if replacing 2 by 17. Mathematical Reflections 5 (2006) 1 Solution. Firstly, we will prove the inequality in case (a − b)(c − d) ≤ 0 and since then, the reader can easily conclude all parts of the problem with the same manner. If d = 0 hence a ≤ b, the problem becomes a 4 + b4 + c 4 ≥ 17ac(b − a)(b − c). If b ≤ c, we have done. Otherwise, if b ≥ a, c, by AM − GM Inequality ac(b − a)(b − c) ≤ ac(b − t) 2 ≤ t2(b − t) 2, for which t = (a + c)/2 ≤ b. Besides a 4 + c 4 ≥ 2t4, so it suﬃces to prove that 2t4 + b4 ≥ 17t2(b − t) 2. Let x = b/t − 1 ≥ 0, the above inequality becomes 2 + (x + 1) 4 ≥ 17x 2 ⇔ x 4 + (x − 1)(4x 2 − 7x − 3) ≥ 0 ⇔ 1 ≥ y(1 − y)(3y2 + 7y − 4). Clearly, if y ≥ 1 we have done. Otherwise, if y ≤ 1 we have two cases +, If 3y2 + 7y ≤ 8 then RHS ≤ 4y(1 − y) ≤ 1 of course. +, If 3y2 + 7y ≥ 8 then y ≥ 0.8, therefore y(1 − y) ≤ 0.8(1 − 0.8) ≤ 1 6 ⇒ y(1 − y)(3y2 + 7y − 4) ≤ 1 6 (3y2 + 7y − 4) ≤ 1. So the problem is proved if d = 0. Suppose that a, b, c, d > 0, d = min(a, b, c, d), then LHS = a 4 + b4 + c 4 + d4 − 4abcd = (a 2 − c 2) 2 + (b2 − d2) 2 + 2(ac − bd) 2 = 1 2 ((a − c) 2(a + c) 2 + (b − d) 2(b + d) 2 + (a − b) 2(c + d) 2+ + (c − d) 2(a + b) 2 + (a − d) 2(a + d) 2 + (b − c) 2(b + c) 2). Certainly, this step claims that d = 0 is all work to complete, it ends the proof. q In some instances, when we decrease simultaneously all variables, both hand sides of the inequality are changed simultaneously too, increasing or decreasing. Consider the following examples which are more diﬃcult Problem 3. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers with sum 3. Find all possible values of k for which the below inequality is always true a 4 + b4 + c 4 − 3abc ≥ k(a − b)(b − c)(c − a). 2 Solution. In case c = 0, easy to prove that −6 √2 ≤ k ≤ 6√2. Indeed, if c = 0, a + b = 3, applying AM − GM Inequality, we obtain LHS = a 4 + b4 = (a 2 − b2) 2 + 2a 2b2 ≥ 2 √2|ab(b2 − a 2)| = 6√2|ab(b − a)|. The equality is taken if and only if |b2 − a 2| = |ab| and a + b = 3, c = 0. Because the equality can be happened if a, b, c are diﬀerent values, so the positive value of k to contruct a valid inequality must lie between −6 √2 and 6 √2. Now we will prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c adding up to 3 then a 4 + b4 + c 4 − 3abc ≥ 6 √2(a − b)(b − c)(c − a). To perform the idea of the entirely mixing variables method, the ﬁrst neccesary thing is normalizing two sides of the inequality a 4 + b4 + c 4 − abc(a + b + c) ≥ 2√2(a − b)(b − c)(c − a)(a + b + c). Decreasing or increasing merely all variables by a number t ≤ min(a, b, c), we only realize that both sides of the above inequality are changed. But the feature here is that we can compare these changing values. Indeed, consider the function f (t) = (a + t) 4 + (b + t) 4 + (c + t) 4− − (a + t)(b + t)(c + t)(a + b + c + 3t) − k(a − b)(b − c)(c − a)(a + b + c + 3t) ⇒ f (t) = A + Bt + Ct2, in which the coeﬃcients of f (t) are A = a 4 + b4 + c 4 − abc(a + b + c) − k(a − b)(b − c)(c − a), B = 4(a 3 + b3 + c 3) − (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) − 3abc − k(a − b)(b − c)(c − a), C = 6(a 2 + b2 + c 2) − (a + b + c) 2 − 3(ab + bc + ca). Clearly, C ≥ 0 because 6(a 2 + b2 + c 2) ≥ 2(a + b + c) 2 ≥ (a + b + c) 2 + 3abc. WLOG, assume that c = min(a, b, c). We will prove 4(a 3 + b3 + c 3) − (a + b + c)(ab + bc + ca) − 3abc ≥ 6√2(a − b)(b − c)(c − a). The left hand side can be analyzied to sum of squares as follow LHS = (a − b) 2(a + b) + (b − c) 2(b + c) + (c − a) 2(c + a) + 2(a 3 + b3 + c 3 − 3abc) = (a − b) 2(2a + 2b + c) + (b − c) 2(2b + 2c + a) + (c − a) 2(2c + 2a + b). Mathematical Reflections 5 (2006) 3 From this transformation, we only need to examine one case c = 0 (that is based on the ﬁrst idea of the entirely mixing variables method). If c = 0, we need to prove that 4(a 3 + b3) − ab(a + b) ≥ 6 √2ab(b − a) ⇔ a 3 + 4b3 + (6 √2 − 1)a 2b ≥ (6 √2 + 1)ab 2. But this last one is obviously true by AM − GM Inequality 4b3 + (6 √2 − 1)a 2b ≥ 4 √ 6 √2 − 1ab 2 ≥ (6 √2 + 1)ab 2. Thus in the expression of f (t), the coeﬃcients of t, t 2 are positive at once, it implies that f (t) is an increasing function for t ≥ 0. If c = min(a, b, c), we have a 4 + b4 + c 4 − abc(a + b + c) − k(a − b)(b − c)(c − a)(a + b + c) ≥ a ′4 + b′4 + c ′4 − a ′b′c ′(a ′ + b′ + c ′) − k(a ′ − b′)(b′ − c ′)(c ′ − a ′), in which a ′ = a − c, b′ = b − c, c ′ = c − c = 0. It implies that we only need to check the ﬁrst problem in case c = 0, which was showed as above. The problem is completely solved and the equality holds for a = b = c or the following case with its permutations c = 0, b = 1 + √5 2 a ⇔ a = 3(3 − √5) 2 , b = 3( √5 − 1) 2 , c = 0. q This is clearly a painstaking and complicated solution, but the main content is only involved by the idea of the entirely mixing variables method. Using functions as above is almost a helpful way for problems of this kind. One special example is Jack Grafukel’s Inequality, where this method shows the most original, simplest solution Problem 4. Prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c then the following inequality holds a √a + b + b √b + c + c √c + a ≤ 5 4 √a + b + c. (Jack Grafulkel, Crux) Solution. Firstly, we must prove the problem in case one of three numbers a, b, c is 0. Indeed, suppose c = 0, the given inequality can be changed into a √a + b + √b ≤ 5 4 √a + b ⇔ 1 4 a + 5 4 b ≥ √ b(a + b) ⇔ (a + b) + 4b ≥ 4 √ b(a + b). By AM − GM Inequality, it’s obviously true and has equality when a = 3b. 4 Next, we will solve this problem in the general case. Denote x = √ a + b 2 , y = √ a + c 2 , z = √ b + c 2 , k = 5√2 4 . WLOG, we may assume that x = max(x, y, z). The required inequality is equivalent to y2 + z2 − x 2 z + z2 + x 2 − y2 x + x 2 + y2 − z2 y ≤ 5√2 4 √x + y + z ⇔ x + y + z + (x − y)(x − z)(z − y) ( 1 xy + 1 yz + 1 zx ) ≤ k√x2 + y2 + z2 (1) Clearly, the problem is proved in case z ≥ y. Firstly, we will prove that, for every numbers t ≥ 0 then k√ (x + t)2 + (b + t)2 + (z + t)2 ≥ k√x2 + y2 + z2 + 3t (2) ⇔ k√ x2 + y2 + z2 + 2t(x + y + z) + 3t2 ≥ k√x2 + y2 + z2 + 3t. Note that k2 ≥ 3 and x + y + z ≥ √ x2 + y2 + z2 so the above inequality is true. On the other hand, since x = max(x, y, z) and x 2 ≤ y2 + z2, there exists a positive number t ≤ min(a, b, c) for which (x − t) 2 = (y − t) 2 + (z − t) 2. Hence, as the above solved result, (there is one of three numbers a, b, c is 0) inequality (1) is true if we replace x, y, z by x ′ = x − t, y′ = y − t, z′ = z − t. So we obtain x ′ + y′ + z′ + (x ′ − y′)(x ′ − z′)(z′ − y′) ( 1 x′y′ + 1 y′z′ + 1 z′x′ ) ≤ k√x′2 + y′2 + z′2 (3) The inequality (1) can be rewritten as follow (x ′ − y′)(x ′ − z′)(z′ − y′) ( 1 (x′ + t)(y′ + t) + 1 (y′ + t)(z′ + t) + 1 (z′ + t)(x′ + t) ) + +x ′ + y′ + z′ + 3t ≤ k√(x′ + t)2 + (y′ + t)2 + (z′ + t)2, but clearly, we obtain this one directly by adding (3) and (2) (in which x, y, z were replaced by x ′, y′, z′). The inequality is completely solved and has equality when x = 3t, y = t, z = 0 or permutations. q Moreover, here is an similar example Problem 5. Let a, b, c be three side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that 2 ( a 2 b + b2 c + c 2 a ) ≥ a + b + c + b2 a + c 2 b + a 2 c . Solution. Clearly, this one is equivalent to ∑ cyc (a − b) 2 b ≥ (a − b)(b − c)(c − a)(a + b + c) abc . Mathematical Reflections 5 (2006) 5 ⇔ ∑ cyc ac(a − b) 2 ≥ (a − b)(a − c)(b − c)(a + b + c). The above form shows that we only need to prove it in case a ≥ b ≥ c and a = b + c (indeed, we only need to prove ∑ cyc (a + c)(a − b) 2 ≥ 3(a − b)(a − c)(b − c), applying the mixing variables method again, it remains to prove that a(a − b) 2 + b2(b + a) + a 2b ≥ 3ab(a − b), which is obvious). So we only need to prove the initial problem in case (a, b, c) are three lengths of a trivial triangle when a = b + c. The inequality becomes 2 ((b + c) 3c + c 3b + b2(a + b) ) ≥ 2bc(b + c) 2 + (b + c) 3b + b3c + c 2(b + c) ⇔ b4 − 2b3c − b2c 2 + 4bc 3 + c 4 ≥ 0. Because of the homogeneity, we may assume c = 1 and prove f (b) ≥ 0 for f (b) = b4 − 2b3 − b2 + 4b + 1 By derivative, it’s easy to prove this property. This ends the proof. q For the end, the reader should try proving two hard and interesting inequalities Problem 6. Let a, b, c be three side-lengths of a triangle. Prove that ( a b + b c + c a − 3 ) ≥ k ( b a + c b + a c − 3 ) where k = 1 − 2 (2√2 − 1 ) √ 5 + 4√2 + 1 . Problem 7. Prove that for all non-negative real numbers a, b, c with sum 1 then 1 ≤ a √a + 2b + b √b + 2c + c √c + 2a ≤ √ 3 2 . The detailed proof will be saved up for the reader.
