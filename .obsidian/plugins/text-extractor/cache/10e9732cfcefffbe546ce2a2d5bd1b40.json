Somepeople insist that the only way to really understand calculus is to start off with a thorough treatment of the real-number system and develop the subject step by step in a logical and rigorous fashion. Others argue that calculus is primarily a tool for engineersand physicists;they believe the course should stress applica- tions of the calculus by appeal to intuition and by extensive drill on problems which develop manipulative skills. There is much that is sound in both these points of view. Calculus is a deductive science and a branch of pure mathematics. At the same time, it is very impor- tant to remember that calculus has strong roots in physical problems and that it derives much of its power and beauty from the variety of its applications. It is possibleto combine a strong theoretical development with sound training in technique; this book represents an attempt to strike a sensiblebalance between the two. While treating the calculus as a deductive science, the book does not neglect applications to physicalproblems. Proofs of all the important theorems are presentedas an essential part of the growth of mathematical ideas; the proofs are often preceded by a geometric or intuitive discussion to give the student some insight into why they take a particular form. Although these intuitive dis- cussions will satisfy readers who are not interested in detailed proofs, the complete proofs are also included for those who prefer a more rigorous presentation. The approach in this book has beensuggestedby the historical and philosophical develop- ment of calculus and analytic geometry. For example, integration is treated before differentiation. Although to some this may seem unusual, it is historically correct and pedagogically sound. Moreover, it is the best way to make meaningful the true connection between the integral and the derivative. The concept of the integral is defined first for step functions. Since the integral of a step function is merely a finite sum, integration theory in this case is extremely simple. As the student learns the properties of the integral for step functions, he gains experience in the use of the summation notation and at the same time becomes familiar with the notation for integrals. This setsthe stage so that the transit\\037on from step functions to more general functions seems easy and natural.) Vll))) . . . VIlt) Preface) Preface to the Second Edition) The second edition differs from the first in many respects. Linear algebra has been incorporated, the mean-value theorems and routine applications of calculusare introduced at an earlier stage, and many new and easier exerciseshave been added. A glance at the table of contents reveals that the book has been divided into smaller chapters, each centering on an important concept. Several sections have been rewritten and reorganized to provide better motivation and to improve the flow of ideas. As in the first edition, a historical introduction precedes each important new concept, tracing its development from an early intuitive physical notion to its precise mathematical formulation. The student is told something of the struggles of the past and of the triumphs of the men who contributed most to the subject. Thus the student becomes an active participant in the evolution of ideas rather than a passive observer of results. The secondedition, like the first, is divided into two volumes. The first two thirds of V olume I deals with the calculus of functions of one variable, including infinite series and an introduction to differential equations. The last third of Volume I introduces linear algebra with applications to geometry and analysis. Much of this material leans heavily on the calculus for examples that illustrate the general theory. It provides a natural blending of algebra and analysis and helps pave the way for the transition from one- variable calculus to multi variable calculus, discussed in Volume II. Further development of linear algebra will occur as needed in the second edition of Volume II. Once again I acknowledge with pleasure my debt to Professors H. F. Bohnenblust, A. Erdelyi, F. B. Fuller, K. Hoffman, G. Springer, and H. S. Zuckerman. Their influence on the first edition continued into the second. In preparing the second edition, I received additional help from Professor Basil Gordon, who suggested many improvements. Thanks are also due GeorgeSpringer and William P. Ziemer, who read the final draft. The staff of the Blaisdell Publishing Company has, as always, been helpful; I appreciate their sym- pathetic consideration of my wishes concerning format and typography. Finally, it gives me special pleasure to expressmy gratitude to my wife for the many ways she has contributed during the preparation of both editions. In grateful acknowledgment I happily dedicate this book to her.) T. M. A.) Pasadena, California September 16, 1966))) CONTENTS) I. INTRODUCTION) Part 1.

Historical Introduction) I 1.1 The two basic concepts of calculus The remarkable progress that has been made in science and technology during the' last century is due in large part to the development of mathematics. That branch of mathematics known as integral and differential calculus servesasa natural and powerful tool for attacking a variety of problems that arise in physics, astronomy, engineering, chemistry, geology, biology,and other fields including, rather recently, some of the social sciences. To give the reader an idea of the many different types of problems that can be treated by the methods of calculus,we list here a few sample questionsselectedfrom the exercises that occur in later chapters of this book. With what speed should a rocket be fired upward so that it never returns to earth? What is the radius of the smallest circular disk that can cover every isosceles triangle of a given perimeter L? What volume of material is removed from a solid sphere of radius 2r if a hole of radius r is drilled through the center? If a strain of bacteria grows at a rate proportional to the amount present and if the population doubles in one hour, by how much will it increase at the end of two hours? If a ten-pound force stretches an elastic spring one inch, how much work is required to stretch the spring one foot? These examples,chosenfrom various fields, illustrate some of the technicalquestions that can be answered by more or less routine applications of calculus. Calculus is more than a technical tool-it is a collectionof fascinating and exciting ideas that have interested thinking men for centuries. These ideashave to do with speed, area, volume, rate of growth, continuity, tangent line, and other concepts from a variety of fields. Calculus forces us to stop and think carefully about the meanings of theseconcepts. Another remarkable feature of the subject is its unifying power. Most of these ideas can be formu- lated so that they revolve around two rather specialized problems of a geometricnature. We turn now to a brief description of these problems. Consider a curve C which lies above a horizontal base line such as that shown in Figure 1.1. We assume this curve has the property that every vertical line intersects it once at most. 1))) 2) Introduction) The shaded portion of the figure consists of those points which lie below the curve C, above the horizontal base, and between two parallel verticalsegmentsjoining C to the base. The first fundamental problem of calculusis this: To assign a number which measures the area of this shaded region. Consider next a line drawn tangent to the curve, as shown in Figure 1.1. The second fundamental problem may be stated as follows: To assign a number which measures the steepness of this line.) Line tangent to C) FIGURE 1.1) Basically, calculus has to do with the precise formulation and solution of these two special problems. It enables us to define the concepts of area and tangent line and to cal- culate the area of a given region or the steepness of a given tangent line. Integral calculus deals with the problem of area and will be discussed in Chapter 1. Differential calculus deals with the problem of tangents and will be introduced in Chapter 4. The study of calculus requires a certain mathematicalbackground. The present chapter deals with this background material and is divided into four parts: Part 1 provides historical perspective; Part 2 discussessome notation and terminology from the mathematics of sets; Part 3 deals with the real-number system; Part 4 treats mathematical induction and the summation notation. If the reader is acquainted with these topics, he can proceed directly to the development of integral calculus in Chapter 1. If not, he should becomefamiliar with the material in the unstarred sections of this Introduction before proceeding to Chapter 1.) I 1.2 Historical background The birth of integral calculus occurred more than 2000 years ago when the Greeks attempted to determine areas by a process which they called the method of exhaustion. The essential ideas of this method are very simple and can be described briefly as follows: Given a region whosearea is to be determined, we inscribe in it a polygonal regionwhich approxi- mates the given region and whose area we can easily compute. Then we choose another polygonal region which gives a better approximation, and we continue the process, taking polygons with more and more sides in an attempt to exhaust the given region. The method is illustrated for a semicircular region in Figure 1.2. It was used successfullyby Archimedes (287-212 B.C.) to find exact formulas for the area of a circleand a few other special figures.))) The method of exhaustion for the area of a parabolic segment) 3) The development of the method of exhaustion beyond the point to which Archimedes carried it had to wait nearly eighteen centuries until the use of algebraic symbols and techniques became a standard part ofmathematic\\037. The elementary algebra that is familiar to most high-schoolstudents today was completely unknown in Archimedes' time, and it would have been next to impossibleto extend his method to any general class of regions without some convenient way of expressing rather lengthy calculations in a compact and simplified form. A slow but revolutionary change in the development of mathematical notations began in the 16th century A.D. The cumbersomesystem of Roman numerals was gradually dis- placed by the Hindu-Arabic characters used today, the symbols + and - were introduced \\037for the first time, and the advantages of the decimal notation began to be recognized. During this same period, the brilliant successes of the Italian mathematicians Tartaglia,) FIGURE 1.2 The method of exhaustion applied to a semicircular region.) Cardano, and Ferrari in finding algebraic solutions of cubic and quartic equations stimu- lated a great deal of activity in mathematics and encouraged the growth and acceptance of a new and superior algebraic language. With the widespread introduction of well-chosen algebraic symbols, interest was revived in the ancient method of exhaustion and a large number of fragmentary results were discovered in the 16th century by such pioneers as Cavalieri, Toricelli, Roherval, Fermat, Pascal, and Wallis. Gradually the method of exhaustion was transformed into the subject now called integral calculus, a new and powerful discipline with a large variety of applications, not only to geometrical problems concerned with areas and volumes but also to problems in other sciences. This branch of mathematics, which retained some of the original features of the method of exhaustion, received its biggest impetus in the 17th century, largely due to the efforts of Isaac Newton (1642-1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), and its develop- ment continued well into the 19th century before the subjectwas put on a firm mathematical basis by such men as Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857)and Bernhard Riemann (1826- 1866). Further refinements and extensionsof the theory are still being carried out in contemporary mathematics.) I 1.3 The method of exhaustion for the area of a parabolic segment Before we proceed to a systematic treatment of integral calculus, it will be instructive to apply the method of exhaustion directly to one of the special figures treated by Archi- medes himself. The region in question is shown in Figure 1.3 and can be described as follows: If we choose an arbitrary point on the base of this figure and denote its distance from 0 by x, then the vertical distance from this point to the curve is x2 . In particular, if the length of the base itself is b, the altitude of the figure is b 2 . The vertical distance from x to the curve is called the \\\"ordinate\\\" at x. The curve itself is an example of what is known))) 4) Introduction) b 2) r-----------------) o) x) b) Approximation from below) Approximation from above) FIGURE 1.3 A parabolic segment.) FIGURE 1.4) as a parabola. The region bounded by it and the two line segments is called a parabolic segment. This figure may be enclosed in a rectangle of base b and altitude b2 , as shown in Figure 1.3. Examination of the figure suggests that the area of the parabolic segment is less than half the area of the rectangle. Archimedesmade the surprising discovery that the area of the parabolic segment is exactly one-third that of the rectangle; that is to say, A = b 3 /3, where A denotes the area of the parabolic segment. We shall show presently how to arrive at this result. It should be pointed out that the parabolic segment in Figure 1.3 is not shown exactly as Archimedes drew it and the details that follow are no t exactly the same as those used by him.) b 3 1_ b JArea of rectangle = n 3 k 2 \\\\' n li (k:Y) n) n) n) nb \\302\\267.. b = - n) o) b) 2b) kb) FIGURE 1.5 Calculation of the area of a parabolic segment.))) The method of exhaustion for the area of a parabolic segment) 5) Nevertheless, the essential ideas are those of Archimedes; what is presented here is the method of exhaustion in modern notation. The method is simply this: We slice the figure into a number of strips and obtain two approximations to the region, one from below and one from above, by using two sets of rectangles as illustrated in Figure 1.4. (We use rectanglesrather than arbitrary polygons to simplify the computations.) The area of the parabolic segment is larger than the total area of the inner rectangles but smaller than that of the outer rectangles. If each strip is further subdivided to obtain a new approximation with a larger number of strips, the total area of the inner rectangles increases, whereas the total area of the outer rectangles decreases. Archimedes realized that an approximation to the area within any desired degree of accuracy could be obtained by simply taking enough strips. Let us carry out the actual computations that are required in this case. For the sake of simplicity, we subdivide the base into n equal parts, each of length bin (see Figure 1.5). The points of subdivision correspond to the following values of x:) 0, Q , 2b , 3b , . . . , (n - l)b , nb = b . n n n n n) A typical point of subdivision correspondsto x = kbln, where k takes the successive values k = 0,1,2,3,..., n. At each point kbfn we construct the outer rectangle of altitude (kbln)2 as illustrated in Figure 1.5. The area of this rectangle is the product of its base and altitude and is equal to) (\\037)(k: J= :: k 2 .) Let us denote by Sn the sum of the areas of all the outer rectangles. Then since the kth rectangle has area (b 3 In 3)k 2 , we obtain the formula) (1.1)) Sn = b: (12 + 2 2 + 3 2 + . . . + n 2) . n) In the same way we obtain a formula for the sum Sn of all the inner rectangles:) (1.2)) Sn = b: [12 + 2 2 + 3 2 + . . . + (n - 1)2]. n) This brings us to a very important stage in the calculation. Notice that the factor multi- plying b 3 /n 3 in Equation (1.1) is the sum of the squares of the first n integers:) 1 2 + 2 2 + . \\302\\267\\302\\267 + n 2 .) [The corresponding factor in Equation (1.2) is similar except that the sum has only n - 1 terms.] For a large value of n, the computation of this sum by direct addition of its terms is tedious and inconvenient. Fortunately there is an interesting identity which makes it possible to evaluate this sum in a simpler way, namely,) (1.3)) 3 2 2 2 2 n n n 1 +2 +\\\"'+n =-+-+-. 3 2 6))) 6) Introduction) This identity is valid for every integer n > 1 and can be proved as follows: Start with the formula (k + 1)3= k 3 + 3k 2 + 3k + 1 and rewrite it in the form) 3k2 + 3k + 1 = (k + 1)3- k 3 .) Taking k = 1,2, . . . , n - 1, we get n - 1 formulas) 3 \\302\\2671 2 + 3 \\302\\2671 + 1 = 2 3 - 13 3 . 2 2 + 3 \\302\\2672 + 1 = 33 - 2 3) 3(n - 1)2+ 3(n - 1) + 1 = n 3 - (n - 1)3.) When we add these formulas, all the terms on the right cancel except two and we obtain) 3[1 2 + 2 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + (n - 1)2] + 3[1 + 2+ \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267+ (n - 1)]+ (n - 1) = n 3 - 13 .) The second sum on the left is the sum of terms in an arithmetic progression and it simplifies to In(n - 1). Therefore this last equation gives us) 3 2 2 2 ) 2 n n n 1 + 2 +... + (n - 1 = - - - + - . 3 2 6 Adding n 2 to both members, we obtain (1.3). For our purposes, we do not need the exact expressionsgiven in the right-hand members of (1.3)and (1.4). All we need are the two inequalities) (1.4 )) (1.5)) n 3 1 2 + 2 2 + . \\302\\267. + (n - 1)2< - < 1 2 + 2 2 + \\302\\267. . + n 2 3) which are valid for every integer n > 1. These inequalities can de deduced easily as con- sequences of (1.3)and (1.4),or they can be proved directly by induction. (A proof by induction is given in Section I 4.1.) Ifwe multiply both inequalities in (1.5) by b 3/n 3 and make use of (I.1)and (1.2), we obtain) (1.6)) b3 Sn < - < Sn 3) for every n. The inequalities in (1.6) tell us that b 3 /3 is a number which lies between Sn and Sn for every n. We will now prove that b3 /3 is the only number which has this property. In other words, we assert that if A is any number which satisfies the inequalities) (1.7)) Sn < A < Sn) for every positive integer n, then A = b3 /3. It is because of this fact that Archimedes concluded that the area of the parabolic segmentis b 3J3.))) The method of exhaustion for the area of a parabolic segment) 7) To prove that A = b 3 /3, we use the inequalities in (1.5) once more. Adding n 2 to both sides of the leftmost inequality in (1.5), we obtain) n 3 1 2 + 2 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + n 2 < - + n 2 3) Multiplying this by b 3 /n 3 and using (1.1), we find) (I. 8)) b 3 b 3 Sn < - + - \\302\\267 3 n) Similarly, by subtracting n 2 from both sides of the rightmost inequality in (1.5) and multi- plying by b 3 /n 3 , we are led to the inequality) (1.9)) b 3 b 3 - - - < Sn . 3 n) Therefore, any number A satisfying (I.7) must also satisfy) (1.10)) b 3 b 3 b 3 b 3 ---<A<-+- 3 n 3 n) for every integer n > 1. Now there are only three possibilities:) A> b3 3 ') A < b 3 3 ') b 3 A --- . 3) If we show that each of the first two leads to a contradiction, then we must have A = b 3 /3, since, in the manner of SherlockHolmes,this exhausts all the possibilities. Suppose the inequality A > b 3 /3 were true. From the second inequality in (1.10) we obtain) (1.11 )) b 3 b 3 A--<- 3 n) for every integer n > 1. Since A - b 3 /3 is positive, we may divide both sides of (1.11) by A - b 3 /3 and then multiply by n to obtain the equivalent statement) b 3 n < A _ b3f3) for every n. But this inequality is obviously false when n > b 3 /(A - b 3 /3). Hence the inequality A > b 3 /3 leads to a contradiction. By a similar argument, we can show that the))) 8) Introduction) inequality A < b3 /3 also leads to a contradiction, and therefore we must have A = b3 /3, as asserted.) *1 1.4 Exercises) 1.

This fact was generally accepted as a mathe- matical theorem for nearly 2000 years before it was realized that one must re-examine the result from a more critical point of view. To understand why anyone would question the validity of Archimedes' conclusion, it is necessary to know something about the important changes that have taken place in the recent history of mathematics. Every branch of knowledge is a collection of ideas described by means of words and symbols, and one cannot understand these ideas unless one knows the exact meanings of the words and symbolsthat are used. Certain branches of knowledge, known as deductive systems, are different from others in that a number of \\\"undefined\\\" concepts are chosen in advance and all other concepts in the system are defined in terms of these. Certain statements about these undefined concepts are taken as axioms or postulates and other))) A critical analysis of Archimedes' method) 9) statements that can be deduced from the axioms are calledtheorems. The most familiar example of a deductive system is the Euclidean theory of elementary geometry that has been studied by well-educated men since the time of the ancient Greeks. The spirit of early Greekmathematics, with its emphasis on the theoretical and postu- lational approach to geometry as presented in Euclid's Elements, dominated the thinking of mathematicians until the time of the Renaissance. A new and vigorous phase in the development of mathematics began with the advent of algebra in the 16th century, and the next 300 years witnesseda flood of important discoveries. Conspicuously absent from this period was the logically precise reasoning of the deductive method with its use of axioms, definitions, and theorems. Instead, the pioneers in the 16th, 17th, and 18th cen- turies resorted to a curious blend of deductive reasoning combined with intuition, pure guesswork,and mysticism, and it is not surprising to find that some of their work was later shown to be incorrect. However, a surprisingly large number of important discoveries emerged from this era, and a great deal of the work has survived the test of history-a tribute to the unusual skill and ingenuity of these pioneers. As the flood of new discoveries began to recede, a new and more critical period emerged. Little by little, mathematicians felt forced to return to the classical ideals of the deductive method in an attempt to put the new mathematics on a firm foundation. This phase of the development, which began early in the 19th century and has continued to the present day, has resultedin a degree of logical purity and abstraction that has surpassed all the traditions of Greek science. At the same time, it has brought about a clearer understanding of the foundations of not only calculus but of all of mathematics. There are many ways to develop calculus as a deductive system. One possible approach is to take the real numbers as the undefined objects. Some of the rules governing the operations on real numbers may then be taken as axioms. One such set of axioms is listed in Part 3 of this Introduction. New concepts, such as integral, limit, continuity, derivative, must then be defined in terms of real numbers. Properties of these concepts are then deduced as theorems that follow from the axioms. Looked at as part of the deductive system of calculus,Archimedes'result about the area of a parabolic segment cannot be accepted as a theorem until a satisfactory definition of area is given first. It is not clear whether Archimedeshad ever formulated a precise defini- tion of what he meant by area. He seemsto have taken it for granted that every region has an area associated with it. On this assumption he then set out to calculate areas of particular regions. In his calculations he made use of certain facts about area that cannot be proved until we k?ow what is meant by area. For instance,he assumedthat if one region lies inside another, the area of the smaller region cannot exceedthat of the larger region. Also, if a region is decomposed into two or more parts,the sum of the areas of the individual parts is equal to the area of the whole region. All these are properties we would like area to possess, and we shall insist that any definition of area should imply these properties. It is quite possible that Archimedes himself may have taken area to be an undefined concept and then used the properties we just mentioned as axioms about area. Today we consider the work of Archimedesas being important not so much because it helps us to compute areas of particular figures, but rather because it suggests a reasonable way to define the concept of area for more or less arbitrary figures. As it turns out, the method of Archimedes suggests a way to define a much more general concept known as the integral. The integral, in turn, is used to compute not only area but also quantities such as arc length, volume, work and others.))) 10) Introduction) If we look ahead and make use of the terminology of integral calculus, the result of the calculation carried out in Section I 1.3 for the parabolic segment is often stated as follows:) \\\"Theintegral of x 2 from 0 to b is b3 j3.\\ It is written symbolically as) j b 2 b 3 o X dx = \\\"3 \\302\\267) The symbol S (an elongated S) is called an integral sign, and it was introduced by Leibniz in 1675. The process which produces the number b3 f3 is called integration. The numbers o and b which are attached to the integral sign are referred to as the limits of integration. The symbol Sg x 2 dx must be regarded as a whole. Its definition will treat it as such, just as the dictionary describesthe word \\\"lapidate\\\" without reference to \\\"lap,\\\" \\\"id,\\\" or \\\"ate.\\\" Leibniz' symbol for the integral was readily accepted by many early mathematicians becausethey liked to think of integration as a kind of \\\"summation process\\\" which enabled them to add together infinitely many \\\"infinitesimally small quantities.\\\" For example, the area of the parabolic segment was conceived of as a sum of infinitely many infinitesimally thin rectangles of height x 2 and base dx. The integral sign represented the process of adding the areas of all these thin rectangles. This kind of thinking is suggestive and often very helpful, but it is not easy to assigna precisemeaning to the idea of an \\\"infinitesimally small quantity.\\\" Today the integral is defined in terms of the notion of real number without using ideas like \\\"infinitesimals.\\\" This definition is given in Chapter 1.) I 1.6 The approach to calculus to be used in this book A thorough and complete treatment of either integral or differential calculus depends ultimately on a careful study of the real number system. This study in itself, when carried out in full, is an interesting but somewhat lengthy program that requires a small volume for its complete exposition. The approach in this book is to begin with the real numbers as undefined objects and simply to list a number of fundamental properties of real numbers which we shall take as axioms. These axioms and someof the simplest theorems that can be deducedfrom them are discussed in Part 3 of this chapter. Most of the properties of real numbers discussed here are probably familiar to the reader from his study of elementaryalgebra. However, there are a few properties of real numbers that do not ordinarily come into consideration in elementary algebra but which play an important role in the calculus. These properties stem from the so-called least-upper-bound axiom (also known as the completeness or continuity axiom) which is dealt with here in some detail. The reader may wish to study Part 3 before proceedingwith the main body of the text, or he may postpone reading this material until later when he reaches those parts of the theory that make use of least-upper-boundproperties. Material in the text that depends on the least-upper-bound axiom will be clearly indicated. To develop calculusas a complete, formal mathematical theory, it would be necessary to state, in addition to the axioms for the real number system, a list of the various \\\"methods of proof\\\" which would be permitted for the purpose of deducingtheorems from the axioms. Every statement in the theory would then have to be justified either as an \\\"established law\\\" (that is, an axiom, a definition, or a previously proved theorem) or as the result of applying))) Introduction to set theory) 11) one of the acceptable methods of proof to an establishedlaw. A program of this sort would be extremelylong and tedious and would add very little to a beginner's understanding of the subject. Fortunately, it is not necessary to proceed in this fashion in order to get a good understanding and a good working knowledge of calculus. In this book the subject is introduced in an informal way, and ample use is made of geometric intuition whenever it is convenient to do so. At the same time, the discussion proceeds in a manner that is con- sistent with modern standards of precision and clarity of thought. All the important theorems of the subject are explicitly stated and rigorously proved. To avoid interrupting the principal flow of ideas, some of the proofs appear in separate starred sections. For the same reason, some of the chapters are accompaniedby supple- mentary material in which certain important topics related to calculus are dealt with in detail. Some of these are also starred to indicate that they may be omitted or postponed without disrupting the continuity of the presentation. The extent to which the starred sections are taken up or not will depend partly on the reader's background and skill and partly on the depth of his interests. A person who is interested primarily in the basic techniques may skip the starred sections. Those who wish a more thorough course in calculus, including theory as well as technique,should read someof the starred sections.) Part 2. Some Basic Conceptsof the Theory of Sets) I 2.1 Introduction to set theory In discussing any branch of mathematics, be it analysis, algebra, or geometry, it is helpful to use the notation and terminology of set theory. This subject, which was developed by Boole and Cantort in the latter part of the 19th century, has had a profound influence on the development of mathematics in the 20th century. It has unified many seemingly discon- nected ideas and has helpedto reduce many mathematical concepts to their logical founda- tions in an elegant and systematic way. A thorough treatment of the theory of sets would require a lengthy discussion which we regard as outside the scope of this book. Fortunately, the basic notions are few in number, and it is possible to developa working knowledge of the methods and ideas of set theory through an informal discussion. Actually, we shall discuss not so much a new theory as an agreement about the precise terminology that we wish to apply to more or less familiar ideas. In mathematics, the word \\\"set\\\" is used to represent a collection of objects viewed as a single entity. The collectionscalled to mind by such nouns as \\\"flock,\\\"\\\"tribe,\\\" \\\"crowd,\\\" \\\"team,\\\" and \\\"electorate\\\" are all examples of sets. The individual objects in the collection are called elements or members of the set, and they are said to belong to or to be contained in the set. The set, in turn, is said to contain or be composedof its elements.) t George Boole (1815-1864)was an English mathematician and logician. His book, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, published in 1854, marked the creation of the first workable system of symbolic logic. Georg F. L. P. Cantor (1845-1918) and his school created the modern theory of sets during the period 1874-1895.))) 12) Introduction) We shall be interestedprimarily in sets of mathematical objects: sets of numbers, sets of curves, sets of geometric figures, and so on. In many applications it is convenient to deal with sets in which nothing special is assumed about the nature of the individual objects in the collection. These are calledabstract sets. Abstract set theory has been developed to deal with such collections of arbitrary objects, and from this generality the theory derives its power.) I 2.2 Notations for designating sets Sets usually are denoted by capital letters : A, B, C, . . . , X, Y, Z; elements are designated by lower-case letters: a, b, c, . . . , x,y, z. We use the special notation) XES) to mean that \\\"X is an element of S\\\" or \\\"x belongs to S.\\\" If x does not belong to S, we write x \\037S. When convenient, we shall designate sets by displaying the elements in braces; for example,the set of positive even integers less than 10 is denoted by the symbol {2,4, 6, 8} whereas the set of all positive even integers is displayedas {2,4, 6, . . .}, the three dots taking the place of \\\"and so on.\\\" The dotsare used only when the meaning of \\\"and so on\\\" is clear. The method of listing the members of a set within braces is sometimes referred to as the roster notation. The first basic concept that relates one set to another is equality of sets:) DEFINITION OF SET EQUALITY. Two sets A and B are said to be equal (or identical) if they consist of exactly the same elements,in which case we write A = B. If one of the sets contains an element not in the other, we say the sets are unequal and we write A \\037 B.) EXAMPLE 1. According to this definition, the two sets {2, 4, 6, 8} and {2, 8, 6, 4} are equalsince they both consist of the four integers 2, 4, 6, and 8. Thus, when we use the roster notation to describea set, the order in which the elements appear is irrelevant.) EXAMPLE 2. The sets {2, 4, 6, 8} and {2, 2, 4, 4, 6, 8}are equal even though, in the second set, each of the elements 2 and 4 is listedtwice. Both sets contain the four elements 2, 4, 6, 8 and no others; therefore, the definition requires that we call these setsequal. This example shows that we do not insist that the objects listed in the roster notation bedistinct. A similar example is the set of letters in the word Mississippi, which is equal to the set {M, i, s, p}, consisting of the four distinct letters M, i, s, and p.) I 2.3 Subsets From a given set S we may form new sets, called subsetsof S. For example, the set consisting of those positive integers less than 10 which are divisible by 4 (the set {4, 8}) is a subsetof the set of all even integers lessthan 10. In general, we have the following definition.) DEFINITION OF A SUBSET. A set A is said to be a subsetof a set B, and we write) A c B,) whenever every element of A also belongs to B. We also say that A is contained in B or that B contains A. The relation c is referred to as set inclusion.))) Unions, intersections, complements) 13) The statement A c B does not rule out the possibility that B c A. In fact, we may have both A c Band B c A, but this happens only if A and B have the same elements. In other words,) A=B) if and only if A c Band B c A.) This theorem is an immediate consequence of the foregoing definitions of equality and inclusion. If A c B but A -jC B, then we say that A is a proper subset of B; we indicate this by writing A c B. In all our applications of set theory, we have a fixed set S given in advance, and we are concerned only with subsets of this given set. The underlying set S may vary from one application to another; it will be referred to as the universal set of each particular discourse. The notation) {x I XES and x satisfies P} will designate the set of all elements x in S which satisfy the property P. When the universal set to which we are referring is understood, we omit the reference to S and write simply {x I x satisfies P}. This is read \\\"the set of all x such that x satisfies P.\\\" Sets designated in this way are said to be described by a defining property. For example, the set of all positive real numbers could be designatedas{xI x > O}; the universal set S in this case is understood to be the set of all real numbers. Similarly, the set of all even positive integers{2,4, 6, . . .} can be designated as {x I x is a positive even integer}. Of course,the letter x is a dummy and may be replaced by any other convenient symbol. Thus, we may write) {x I x > O} = {y I y > O} = {t It> O}) and so on. It is possible for a set to contain no elements whatever. This set is called the empty set or the void set, and will be denoted by the symbol 0. We will consider 0 to be a subsetof every set. Some people find it helpful to think of a set as analogous to a container (such as a bag or a box)containing certain objects, its elements. The empty set is then analogous to an empty container. To avoid logical difficulties, we must distinguish between the element x and the set {x} whose only element is x. (A box with a hat in it is conceptually distinct from the hat itself.) In particular, the empty set 0 is not the same as the set {0}. In fact, the empty set 0 contains no elements, whereas the set {0} has one element, 0. (A box which contains an empty box is not empty.) Setsconsistingof exactly one element are sometimes called one-element sets. Diagrams often help us visualize relations between sets. For example, we may think of a set S as a region in the plane and each of its elementsas a point. Subsets of S may then be thought of as collections of points within S. For example, in Figure I.6(b) the shadedportion is a subsetof A and also a subset of B. Visual aids of this type, called Venn diagrams, are useful for testing the validity of theorems in set theory or for suggestingmethods to prove them. Of course, the proofs themselvesmust rely only on the definitions of the conceptsand not on the diagrams.) I 2.4 Unions,intersections, complements From two given sets A and B, we can form a new set called the union of A and B. This new set is denoted by the symbol A U B (read: \\\"A union B\\)) 14) Introduction) (a) A u B) (b) A (\\\\ B) (c) A (\\\\ B = 0) FIGURE 1.6 Unions and intersections.) and is definedas the set of those elements which are in A, in B, or in both. That is to say, A u B is the set of all elements which belong to at least one of the sets A, B. An example is illustrated in Figure I.6(a), where the shaded portion represents A u B. Similarly, the intersection of A and B, denoted by A n B (read: \\\"A intersection B\\\") ,) is defined as the set of those elements common to both A and B'. This is illustrated by the shaded portion of Figure I.6(b). In Figure I.6(c),the two sets A and B have no elements in common; in this case, their intersection is the empty set 0. Two sets A and B are said to be disjoint if A n B = 0. If A and B are sets, the difference A - B (also called the complement of B relative to A) is defined to be the set of all elements of A which are not in B. Thus, by definition, A - B = {xI x E A and x \\037B}.) In Figure I.6(b) the un shaded portion of A represents A - B; the unshaded portion of B represents B - A. The operations of union and intersection have many formal similarities to (as well as differences from) ordinary addition and multiplication of real numbers. For example, since there is no question of order involved in the definitions of union and intersection, it follows that A U B = B u A and that A n B = B n A. That is to say, union and inter- section are commutative operations. The definitions are also phrased in such a way that the operations are associative:) (A U B) U C = A U (B U C)) and) (A n B) n C = A n (B n C) .) These and other theorems related to the \\\"algebra of sets\\\" are listed as Exercisesin Section I 2.5. One of the best ways for the reader to become familiar with the terminology and notations introduced aboveis to carry out the proofs of each of theselaws. A sample of the type of argument that is needed appears immediately after the Exercises.

A Set of Axioms for the Real-Number System) I 3.1 Introduction) There are many ways to introduce the real-number system. One popular method is to begin with the positive integers 1, 2, 3, . . . and use them as building blocks to construct a more comprehensive system having the properties desired. Briefly, the idea of this method is to take the positive integers as undefined concepts, state some axioms concerning them, and then use the positive integersto build a larger system consisting of the positive rational numbers (quotients of positive integers). The positive rational numbers, in turn, may then be used as a basisfor constructing the positive irrational numbers (real numbers like V2 and 11' that are not rational). The final step is the introduction of the negativereal numbers and zero. The most difficult part of the whole process is the transition from the rational numbers to the irrational numbers. Although the need for irrational numbers was apparent to the ancient Greeks from their study of geometry, satisfactory methods for constructing irrational numbers from rational numbers were not introduced until late in the 19th century. At that time, three different theories were outlined by Karl Weierstrass (1815-1897), Georg Cantor (1845- 1918),and Richard Dedekind (1831-1916). In 1889, the Italian mathematician Guiseppe Peano (1858-1932) listed five axioms for the positive integers that could be used as the starting point of the whole construction. A detailed account of this construction, beginning with the Peano postulates and using the method of Dedekind to introduce irrational numbers, may be found in a book by E. Landau, Foundations of Analysis (New York, Chelsea Publishing Co., 1951). The point of view we shall adopt here is nonconstructive. We shall start rather far out in the process, taking the real numbers themselvesas undefined objects satisfying a number of properties that we use as axioms. That is to say, we shall assume there exists a set R of objects, called real numbers, which satisfy the 10 axioms listed in the next few sections. All the properties of real numbers can be deducedfrom the axioms in the list. When the real numbers are defined by a constructive process, the properties we list as axioms must be proved as theorems. In the axioms that appear below, lower-case letters a, b, c, . . . , x, y, z represent arbitrary real numbers unlesssomething is said to the contrary. The axioms fall in a natural way into three groups which we refer to as the field axioms, the order axioms, and the least-upper- bound axiom (also called the axiom of continuity or the completeness axiom).) I 3.2 The field axioms) Along with the set R of real numbers we assume the existence of two operations called addition and multiplication, such that for every pair of real numbers x and y we can form the sum of x and y, which is another real number denoted by x + y, and the product of x and y, denoted by xy or by x . y. It is assumed that the sum x + y and the product xy are uniquely determined by x and y. In other words,given x and y, there is exactly one real number x + y and exactly one real number xy. We attach no special meanings to the symbols + and, other than those contained in the axioms.))) 18) Introduction) AXIOM 1. COMMUTATIVELAWS. X + Y = Y + x, xy = yX. AXIOM 2. ASSOCIATIVE LAWS. X + (y + Z) = (x + y) + Z, X(yZ) = (XY)Z. AXIOM 3. DISTRIBUTIVE LAW. X(y + Z) = xy + XZ. AXIOM 4. EXISTENCE OF IDENTITY ELEMENTS. There exist two aistinct real numbers, which we denote by 0 and 1, such that for every real x we have x + 0 = x and 1 \\302\\267x = X. AXIOM 5. EXISTENCE OF NEGATIVES. For every real number x there is a real number y such that x + y = O. AXIOM 6. EXISTENCE OF RECIPROCALS. For every real number x -jC 0 there is a real number y such that xy = 1. Note: The numbers 0 and 1 in Axioms 5 and 6 are thoseof Axiom 4.) From the above axioms we can deduceall the usual laws of elementary algebra. The most important of these laws are collected here as a list of theorems. In all these theorems the symbolsa, b, c, d represent arbitrary real numbers.) THEOREM 1.1. CANCELLATION LAW FOR ADDITION. If a + b = a + c, then b = c. (In particular, this shows that the number 0 of Axiom 4 is unique.) THEOREM 1.2. POSSIBILITY OF SUBTRACTION. Given a and b, there is exactly one x such that a + x = b. This x is denoted by b - a. In particular, 0 - a is written simply -a and is called the negative of a. THEOREM 1.3. b - a = b + (-a). THEOREM 1.4. -( -a) = a. THEOREM 1.5. a(b - c) = ab - ac. THEOREM 1.6. O. a = a . 0 = O. THEOREM 1.7. CANCELLATION LAW FOR lVIULTIPLICATION. If ab = ac and a -jC 0, then b = C. (In particular, this shows that the number 1 of Axiom 4 is unique.) THEOREM 1.8. POSSIBILITY OF DIVISION. Given a and b with a -jC 0, there is exactly one x such that ax = b. This x is denotedby bja or Q and is called the quotient of band a. Ina particular, Ifa is also written a-I and is called the reciprocal of a. THEOREM 1.9. If a -jC 0, then bja = b \\302\\267a-I. THEOREM 1.10. If a -jC 0, then (a-I)-I = a. THEOREM 1.11. If ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = O. THEOREM 1.12. (-a)b = -(ab) and (-a)( -b) = ab. THEOREM 1.13. (ajb) + (cjd) = (ad + bc)j(bd) if b -jC 0 and d -jC O. THEOREM 1.14. (ajb)(cjd) = (ac)j(bd)if'b -jC 0 and d -jC O. THEOREM 1.15. (ajb)j(cjd) = (ad)j(bc)if' b -jC 0, c -jC 0, and d -jC O.))) The order axioms) 19) To illustrate how these statements may be obtained as consequences of the axioms, we shall present proofs of Theorems 1.1 through 1.4. Those readers who are interested may find it instructive to carry out proofs of the remaining theorems.) Proof of 1.1. Given a + b = a + c. By Axiom 5, there is a number y suchthat y + a = O. Since sums are uniquely determined, we have y + (a + b) = y + (a + c). Using the associative law, we obtain (y + a) + b = (y + a) + c or 0 + b = 0 + c. But by Axiom 4 we have 0 + b = band 0 + c = c,sothat b = c. Notice that this theorem shows that there is only one real number having the property of 0 in Axiom 4. In fact, if 0 and 0' both have this property, then 0 + 0' = 0 and 0 + 0 = O. Hence 0 + 0' = 0 + 0 and, by the can- cellation law, 0 = 0'.) Proof of 1.2. Given a and b, choose y so that a + y = 0 and let x = y + b. Then a + x = a + (y + b) = (a + y) + b = 0 + b = b. Therefore there is at least one x such that a + x = b. But by Theorem 1.1 there is at most one such x. Hencethere is exactly one.) Proof of 1.3. Let x = b - a and let y = b + (-a). We wish to prove that x = y. Now x + a = b (by the definition of b - a) and) y + a = [b + (-a)] + a = b + [( -a) + a] = b + 0 = b.) Therefore x + a = y + a and hence, by Theorem 1.1, x = y.) Proof of 1.4. We have a + (-a) = 0 by the definition of -a. But this equation tells us that a is the negative of -a. That is, a = -( -a), as asserted.) * I 3.3 Exercises 1.

I 3.4 The order axioms This group of axioms has to do with a concept which establishes an ordering among the real numbers. This ordering enables us to make statements about one real number being larger or smaller than another. We choose to introduce the order properties as a set of))) 20) Introduction) axioms about a new undefined concept called positiveness and then to define terms like lessthan and greater than in terms of positiveness. We shall assume that there exists a certain subset R+ c R, called the set of positive numbers, which satisfies the following three order axioms:) AXIOM 7. If x and yare in R+, so are x + y and xy. AXIOM 8. For every real x \\037 0, either x E R+ or -x E R+, but not both. AXIOM 9. 0 tt R+.) Now we can definethe symbols <, >, < , and > , called, respectively, less than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal to, as follows:) x < y means that y - x is positive; y > x means that x < y; x < y,means that either x < y or x = y; y > x means that x < y .) Thus, we have x > 0 if and only if x is positive. If x < 0, we say that x is negative; if x > 0, we say that x is nonnegative. A pair of simultaneous inequalities such as x < y, y < z is usually written more briefly as x < y < z; similar interpretations are given to the compound inequalitiesx < y < z, x < y < z, and x < y < z. From the order axioms we can derive all the usual rules for calculatingwith inequalities. The most important of these are listed here as theorems.) THEOREM 1.16. TRICHOTOMY LAW. For arbitrary real numbers a and b, exactly one of the three relations a < b, b < a, a = b holds. THEOREM 1.17. TRANSITIVE LAW. If a < band b < c, then a < c. THEOREM 1.18. If a < b, then a + c < b + c. THEOREM 1.19. Ifa < band c > 0, then ac < bc. THEOREM 1.20. If a \\037 0, then a 2 > O. THEOREM 1.21. 1 > O. THEOREM 1.22. If a < band c < 0, then ac > bc. THEOREM 1.23. If a < b, then -a > -b. In particular, if a < 0, then -a > O. THEOREM 1.24. If ab > 0, tben both a and b are positiveor both are negative. THEOREM 1.25. Ifa < c and b < d, then a + b < c + d.) Again, we shall prove only a few of these theorems as samples to indicate how the proofs may be carried out. Proofs of the others are left as exercises.))) Integers and rational numbers) 21) Proof of 1.16.Let x = b - a. If x = 0, then b - a = a - b = 0, and hence, by Axiom 9, we cannot have a > b or b > a. If x \\037 0, Axiom 8 tells us that either x > 0 or x < 0, but not both; that is, either a < b or b < a, but not both. Therefore, exactly one of the three relations, a = b, a < b, b < a, holds.) Proof of I. 17. If a < band b < e, then b - a > 0 and e - b > O. By Axiom 7 we may add to obtain (b - a) + (e - b) > O. That is, e - a > 0, and hence a < e.) Proof of 1.18. Let x = a + e, y = b + c. Then y - x = b - a. But b - a > 0 since a < b. Hence y - x > 0, and this means that x < y.) Proof of 1.19. If a < b, then b - a > O. If e > 0, then by Axiom 7 we may multiply e by (b - a) to obtain (b - a)e > O. But (b - a)e = be - ae. Hence be - ae > 0, and this means that ae < be, as asserted.) Proof of 1.20. If a > 0, then a . a > 0 by Axiom 7. If a < 0, then -a > 0, and hence (-a) . (-a) > 0 by Axiom 7. In either case we have a2 > o.) Proof of 1.21. Apply Theorem 1.20 with a = 1.) *1 3.5 Exercises) 1. Prove Theorems1.22 through 1.25, using the earlier theorems and Axioms 1 through 9.) In Exercises 2 through 10, prove the given statements or establish the given inequalities. You may use Axioms 1 through 9 and Theorems 1.1 through 1.25. 2. There is no real number x such that x 2 + 1 = O. 3. The sum of two negative numbers is negative. 4. If a > 0, then Ija > 0; if a < 0, then 1 ja < O. 5. If 0 < a < b, then 0 < b- I < a-I. 6. If a < band b < c, then a < C. 7. If a < band b < c, and a = c, then b = C. 8. For all real a and b we have a2 + b 2 > O. If a and b are not both 0, then a 2 + b 2 > O. 9. There is no real number a such that x < a for all real X. 10. If x has the property that 0 < x < h for every positive real number h, then x = O.) 1 3.6 Integers and rational numbers There exist certain subsets of R which are distinguished becausethey have special prop- erties not shared by all real numbers. In this section we shall discuss two such subsets, the integers and the rational numbers. To introduce the positive integers we begin with the number 1, whose existence is guar- anteed by Axiom 4. The number 1 + 1 is denoted by 2, the number 2 + 1 by 3, and so on. The numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , obtained in this way by repeated addition of 1 are all positive, and they are called the positiveintegers. Strictly speaking, this description of the positive integersis not entirely complete because we have not explained in detail what we mean by the expressions \\\"and so on,\\\" or \\\"repeated addition of I.\\\" Although the intuitive meaning))) 22) Introduction) of these expressions may seemclear, in a careful treatment of the real-number system it is necessary to give a more precise definition of the positive integers. There are many ways to do this. One convenientmethod is to introduce first the notion of an inductive set.) DEFINITION OF AN INDUCTIVE SET. A set of real numbers is called an inductive set if it has the following two properties: (a) The number 1 is in the set. (b) For every x in the set, the number x + 1 is also in the set.) For example, R is an inductive set. So is the set R+. Now we shall define the positive integers to be those real numbers which belong to every inductive set.) DEFINITION OF POSITIVE INTEGERS. A real number is called a positive integer if it belongs to every inductive set.) Let P denote the set of all positive integers. Then P is itself an inductive set because(a) it contains 1, and (b) it contains x + 1 whenever it contains x. Since the members of P belong to every ind uctive set, we refer to P as the smallest ind uctive set. This property of the set P forms the logical basis for a type of reasoning that mathematicians call proof by, induction, a detailed discussion of which is given in Part 4 of this Introduction. The negatives of the positive integersare calledthe negative integers. The positive integers, together with the negative integers and 0 (zero), form a set Z which we call simply the set of integers. In a thorough treatment of the real-number system, it would be necessary at this stage to prove certain theoremsabout integers. For example, the sum, difference,or product of two integers is an integer, but the quotient of two integers need not be an integer. However, we shall not enter into the details of such proofs. Quotients of integers afb (whereb \\037 0) are called rational numbers. The set of rational numbers, denoted by Q, contains Z as a subset. The reader should realize that all the field axioms and the order axioms are satisfied by Q. For this reason, we say that the set of rational numbers is an orderedfield. Real numbers that are not in Q are called irrational.) I 3.7 Geometric interpretation of real numbers as points on a line The reader is undoubtedly familiar with the geometric representation of real numbers by means of points on a straight line. A point is selected to represent0 and another, to the right of 0, to represent 1, as illustrated in Figure I. 7. This choice determines the scale. If one adopts an appropriate set of axioms for Euclidean geometry, then each real number corresponds to exactly one point on this line and, conversely, each point on the line corre- sponds to one and only one real n urn ber . For this reason the line is often called the real line or the real axis, and it is customary to use the words real number and point interchangeably. Thus we often speak of the point x rather than the point corresponding to the real number x. The ordering relation among the real numbers has a simple geometric interpretation. If x < y, the point x lies to the left of the point y, as shown in Figure I. 7. Positive numbers))) Upper bound of a set, maximum element, least upper bound (supremum) 23) lie to the right of 0 and negative numbers to the left of O. If a < b, a point x satisfies the inequalities a < x < b if and only if x is betw,'een a and b. This device for representing real numbers geometrically is a very worthwhile aid that helps us to discover and understand better certain properties of real numbers. However, the reader should realize that all properties of real numbers that are to be accepted as theorems must be deducible from the axioms without any reference to geometry. This does not mean that one should not make use of geometry in studying properties of real numbers. On the contrary, the geometry often suggests the method of proof of a particular theorem, and sometimesa geometric argument is more illuminating than a purely analytic proof (one dependingentirely on the axioms for the real numbers). In this book, geometric) I o) x) y) FIGURE 1.7 Real numbers represented geometrically on a line.) arguments are used to a large extent to help motivate or clarify a particular discussion. Nevertheless, the proofs of all the important theorems are presented in analytic form.) I 3.8 Upper bound of a set, maximum element, least upper bound (supremum) The nine axioms listed above contain all the properties of real numbers usually discussed in elementary algebra. There is another axiom of fundamental importance in calculus that is ordinarily not discussed in elementary algebra courses. This axiom (or some property equivalent to it) is used to establish the existence of irrational numbers. Irrational numbers arise in elementary algebra when we try to solve certain quadratic equations. For example,it is desirable to have a real number x such that x 2 = 2. From the nine axioms above, we cannot prove that such an x exists in R, because these nine axioms are alsosatisfied by Q, and there is no rational number x whosesquare is 2. (A proof of this statement is outlined in Exercise 11 of Section I 3.12.) Axiom 10 allows us to introduce irrational numbers in the real-number system, and it gives the real-number system a property of continuity that is a keystone in the logical structure of calculus. Before we describe Axiom 10, it is convenient to introduce some more terminology and notation. SupposeS is a nonempty set of real numbers and suppose there is a number B such that) x < B) for every x in S. Then S is saidto be bounded above by B. The number B is called an upper bound for S. We sayan upper bound because every number greater than B will also be an upper bound. If an upper bound B is also a member of S, then B is called the largest member or the maximum element of S. There can be at most one such B. If it exists, we write) B = max S .) Thus, B = max S if B E S and x < B for all x in S. A set with no upper bound is saidto be unbounded above. The following examples serveto illustrate the meaning of these terms.))) 24) Introduction) EXAMPLE 1. Let S be the set of all positive real numbers. This set is unbounded above. It has no upper boundsand it has no maximum element.) EXAMPLE 2. Let S be the set of all real x satisfying 0 < x < 1. This set is bounded above by 1. In fact, 1 is its maximum element.) EXAMPLE 3. Let T be the set of all real x satisfying 0 < x < 1. This is like the set in Example 2 except that the point 1 is not included. This set is boundedabove by 1 but it has no maximum element.) Some sets, like the one in Example 3, are bounded above but have no maximum element. For these setsthere is a concept which takes the place of the maximum element. This is called the least upper bound of the set and it is defined as follows:) DEFINITION OF LEAST UPPER BOUND. A number B is calleda least upper bound of a nonempty set S if B has the following two properties: (a) B is an upper boundfor S. (b) No number less than B is an upper bound for S.) If S has a maximum element, this maximum is also a least upperbound for S. But if S does not have a maximum element, it may still have a least upper bound. In Example 3 above, the number 1 is a least upper bound for T although T has no maximum element. (See Figure 1.8.)) . o) Upper bounds for S S // .///////////////////////// I \\\"\\\" Largest member of S) . o) T /) Upper bounds for T / I r:\\302\\253 / / / / ////////////.(/ / /,- Least upper bound of T) (a) S has a largest member: (b) Thas no largest member, but it has max S = 1 a least upper bound: sup T = 1) FIGURE 1.8 Upper bounds, maximum element, supremum.) THEOREM 1.26. Two different numbers cannot be least upper bounds for the same set.) Proof Suppose that Band C are two least upper boundsfor a set S. Property (b) implies that C > B since B is a least upper bound; similarly, B > C since C is a leastupper bound. Hence, we have B = C.) This theorem tells us that if there is a least upper bound for a set S, there is only on\\037 and we may speak of the least upper bound. It is common practiceto refer to the least upper bound of a set by the more concise term supremum, abbreviatedsup. We shall adopt this convention and write) B = sup S) to expressthe fact that B is the least upper bound, or supremum, of S.))) The Archimedean property of the real-number s}'stem) 25) I 3.9 The least-upper-bound axiom (completenessaxiom) Now we are ready to state the least-upper-boundaxiom for the real-number system.) AXIOM 10. Every nonempty set S oj'real numbers \\037fhich is bounded above has a supremum; that is, there is a real number B such that B = sup S.) We emphasize once more that the supremum of S need not be a member of S. In fact, sup S belongs to S if and only if S has a maximum element, in which case max S = sup S. Definitions of the terms lo\\037'er bound, bounded belo\\037v, smallest member (or minimum element) may be similarly formulated. The reader should formulate these for himself. If S has a minimum element, we denote it by min S. A number L is called a greatest lower bound (or infimum) of S if (a) L is a lower bound for S, and (b) no number greater than L is a lower bound for S. The infimum of S, when it exists, is uniquely determined and we denote it by inf S. If S has a minimum element, then min S = inf S. Using Axiom 10, we can prove the following.) THEOREM 1.27. Every nonempty set S that is bounded beloH'has a greatest 10H'er bound; that is, there is a real number L such that L = inf S.) Proof Let -S denote the set of negatives of numbers in S. Then -S is nonempty and boundedabove. Axiom 10 tells us that there is a number B which is a supremum for -So It is easy to verify that - B = inf S.) Let us refer once more to the examples in the foregoing section. In Example 1,the set of all positive real numbers, the number 0 is the infimum of S. This set has no minimum element. In Examples 2 and 3, the number 0 is the minimum element. In all these examples it was easy to decide whether or not the set S was bounded above or below, and it was also easy to determine the numbers sup Sand inf S. The next example shows that it may be difficult to determine whether upper or lower boundsexist.) EXAMPLE 4. Let Sbe the set of all numbers of the form (1 + l/n)n, where n = 1,2,3, . . . . For example, taking n = 1, 2, and 3\\037we find that the numbers 2, 1, and l\\037 are in S. Every number in the set is greater than 1, so the set is bounded below and hence has an infimum. With a little effort we can show that 2 is the smallest element of S so inf S = min S = 2. The set S is also bounded above, although this fact is not as easy to prove. (Try it!) Once we know that S is bounded above, Axiom 10tells us that there is a number which is the supremum of S. In this case it is not easy to determine the value of sup S from the description of S. In a later chapter we will learn that sup S is an irrational number approximately equal to 2.718. It is an important number in calculus called the Euler number e.) I 3.10 The Archimedean property of the real-numbersystem This section contains a number of important properties of the real-number system which are consequences of the least-upper-bound axiom.))) 26 Introduction) THEOREM 1.28. The set P of positive integers 1, 2, 3, . . . is unbounded above.) Proof Assume P is bounded above. We shall show that this leads to a contradiction. SinceP is nonempty, Axiom 10 tells us that P has a least upper bound, say b. The number b - 1, being less than b, cannot be an upper bound for P. Hence, there is at least one positive integer n such that n > b - 1. For this n we have n + 1 > b. Sincen + 1 is in P, this contradicts the fact that b is an upper bound for P.) As corollaries of Theorem 1.28,we immediately obtain the following consequences:) THEOREM 1.29. For every real x there exists a positive integer n such that n > x.) Proof If this were not so, some x would be an upper bound for P, contradicting Theorem 1.28.) THEOREM 1.30. If x > 0 and ify is an arbitrary real number, there exists a positive integer n such that nx > y.) Proof Apply Theorem 1.29 with x replaced by yJx.) The property described in Theorem 1.30 is called the Archimedean property of the real- number system. Geometrically it means that any line segment, no matter how long, may be covered by a finite number of line segments of a given positive length, no matter how small. In other words,a small ruler used often enough can measure arbitrarily large distances. Archimedes realized that this was a fundamental property of the straight line and stated it explicitly as one of the axioms of geometry. In the 19th and 20th centuries, non-Archimedeangeometries have been constructed in which this axiom is rejected. From the Archimedean property, we can prove the following theorem, which will be useful in our discussion of integral calculus.) THEOREM 1.31. If three real numbers a, x, and y satisfy the inequalities) (1.14 )) a < x < a+\\037) for every integer n > 1, then x = a.) Proof If x > a, Theorem 1.30 tells us that there is a posItIve integer n satisfying n(x - a) > y, contradicting (1.14). Hence we cannot have x > a, so we must have x = a.) I 3.11 Fundamental properties of the supremum and infimum This section discusses three fundamental properties of the supremum and infimum that we shall use in our development ofcalculus.The first property states that any set of numbers with a supremum contains points arbitrarily close to its supremum; similarly, a set with an infimum contains points arbitrarily close to its infimum.))) Fundamental properties of the supremum and infimum) 27) THEOREM 1.32. Let h be a given positive number and let S be a set of real numbers. (a) If S has a supremum, then for some x in S vre hare) x > sup S - h .) (b) If S has an infimum, then for some x in S \\037t'ehave) x < inf S + h .) Proof of (a). If we had x < sup S - h for all x in S, then sup S - h would be an upper bound for S smaller than its least upper bound. Therefore we must have x > sup S - h for at least one x in S. This proves (a). The proof of (b) is similar.) THEOREM 1.33. ADDITIVE PROPERTY. Given nonen1pty subsets A and B of R, let C denote the set) C = {a + b I a E A, b E B} .) (a) If each of A and B has a supremum, then C has a supremum, and) sup C = sup A + sup B .) (b) If each of A and B has an infimum, then C has an infimum, and) inf C = inf A + inf B .) Proof Assume each of A and B has a supremum. If C E C, then c = a + b, where a E A and b E B. Therefore c < sup A + sup B; so sup A + sup B is an upper bound for C. This shows that C has a supremum and that) sup C < sup A + sup B .) Now let n be any positive integer. By Theorem 1.32 (with h = Iln) there is an a in A and a b in B such that) 1 a > sup A - n ') 1 b > sup B - n .) Adding these inequalities, we obtain) 2 a + b > sup A + sup B - n ') or) 2 2 sup A + sup B < a + b + n < sup C + n ') since a + b < sup C. Therefore we have shown that) 2 sup C < sup A + sup B < sup C + n))) 28) Introduction) for every integer n > 1. By Theorem 1.31, we must have sup C = sup A + sup B. This proves (a), and the proof of (b) is similar.) THEOREM 1.34. Given two nonempty subsets Sand T of R such that) s < t) for every s in S and every t in T. Then S has a supremum, and T has an infimum, and they satisfy the inequality) sup S' < inf T .) Proof Each t in T is an upper bound for S. Therefore S has a supremum which satisfies the inequality sup S < t for all t in T. Hence sup S is a lower bound for T, so T has an infimum which cannot be less than sup S. In other words, we have sup S < inf T, as asserted.) *I 3.12 Exercises) 1. If x and yare arbitrary real numbers with x < y, prove that there is at least one realz satisfying x < z < y. 2. If x is an arbitrary real number, prove that there are integers m and n such that m < x < n. 3. If x > 0, prove that there is a positive integer n such that Iln < x. 4. If x is an arbitrary real number, prove that there is exactly one integer n which satisfies the inequalities n < x < n + 1. This n is called the greatest integer in x and is denoted by [x].

If x and yare arbitrary real numbers, x < y, prove that there exists at least one rational num- ber r satisfying x < r < y, and hence infinitely many.

Prove that there is no rational number whose square is 2.) [Hint: Argue by contradiction. Assume (ajb)2 = 2, where a and b are integers, at least one of which is odd. Use parts of Exercise 10 to deduce a contradiction.]))) Existence of square roots of nonnegative real numbers) 29) 12. The Archimedean property of the real-number system was deduced as a consequenceof the least-upper-bound axiom. Prove that the set of rational numbers satisfies the Archimedean property but not the least-upper-bound property. This shows that the Archimedean prop- erty does not imply the least-upper-bound axiom.) *13.13 Existenceof square roots of nonnegative real numbers It was pointed out earlier that the equation x 2 = 2 has no solutions among the rational numbers. With the help of Axiom 10, we can prove that the equation x 2 = a has a solution among the real numbers if a > 0. Each such x is called a square root of a. First, let us see what we can say about square roots without using Axiom 10. Negative numbers cannot have square roots because if x 2 = a, then a, being a square, must be nonnegative (by Theorem 1.20). Moreover, if a = 0, then x = 0 is the only square root (by Theorem 1.1I). Suppose, then, that a > O. If x 2 = a, then x \\037 0 and (_X)2 = a, so both x and its negative are square roots. In other words, if a has a square root, then it has two square roots, one positive and one negative. Also, it has at most two because if x2 = a and y2 = a, then x 2 = y2 and (x - y)(x + y) = 0, and so, by Theorem 1.11, either x = y or x = -yo Thus, if a has a square root, it has exactly two. The existence of at least one square root can be deducedfrom an important theorem in calculus known as the intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions, but it may be instructive to see how the existenceof a square root can be proved directly from Axiom 10.) THEOREM 1.35. Every nonnegative real number a has a unique nonnegative square root. Note: If a > 0, we denote its nonnegative square root by a 1/ 2 or by\\037. If a > 0, the negative square root is -a 1/ 2 or -\\037.) Proof If a = 0, then 0 is the only square root. Assume, then, that a > O. Let S be the set of all positive x such that x 2 < a. Since (I + a)2 > a, the number 1 + a is an upper bound for S. Also, S is nonempty because the number al(l + a) is in S; in fact, a 2 < a(1 + a)2 and hence a2 /(1 + a)2 < a. By Axiom 10, S has a least upper bound which we shall call b. Note that b > al(1 + a) so b > O. There are only three possibilities: b2 > a, b 2 < a, or b 2 = a. Suppose b 2 > a and let c = b - (b 2 - a)/(2b) = \\037(b + alb). Then 0 < c < band c 2 = b 2 - (b 2 - a) + (b 2 - a)2/(4b 2 ) = a + (b2 - a)2j(4b 2 ) > a. Therefore c2 > x 2 for each x in S, and hence c > x for each x in S. This means that c is an upper bound for S. Sincec < b, we have a contradiction because b was the least upper bound for S. Therefore the inequality b 2 > a is impossible. Supposeb 2 < a. Since b > 0, we may choose a positive number c such that c < band such that c < (a - b 2 )/(3b). Then we have) (b + C)2 = b 2 + c(2b + c) < b 2 + 3bc < b 2 + (a - b 2 ) = a .) Therefore b + c is in S. Since b + c > b, this contradicts the fact that b is an upper bound for S. Therefore the inequality b 2 < a is impossible, and the only remaining alternative is b 2 = a.))) 30) Introduction) *1 3.14 Roots of higher order. Rational powers The least-upper-bound axiom can alsobe used to show the existence of roots of higher order. For example, if n is a positive odd integer, then for each real x there is exactly one real y such that yn = x. This y is called the nth root of x and is denoted by) (1.15)) y = xlI n) or) y='\\\\Y\\037.) When n is even, the situation is slightly different. In this case, if x is negative, there is no real y such that yn = x because yn > 0 for all real y. However, if x is positive, it can be shown that there is one and only one positive y such that yn = x. This y is called the positive nth root of x and is denoted by the symbols in (1.15). Since n is even, ( - y)n = yn and hence each x > 0 has two real nth roots, y and -Yo However, the symbols xl/n and -v<\\037 are reserved for the positive nth root. We do not discuss the proofs of these statements here because they will be deduced later as consequences of the intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions (see Section3.10). If r is a positive rational number, say r = m/n, where m and n are positive integers,we define x r to be (xm)l/n, the nth root of x m , whenever this exists. If x \\037 0, we define x-r = l/xr whenever x r is defined. From these definitions, it is easy to verify that the usual laws of exponentsare valid for rational exponents: xr. X s = x r+s , (xr)S= x rs , and (xy)r = xryr.) *13.15 Representation of real numbers by decimals A real number of the form) (1.16)) al a2 anr=a +-+-+...+-o 10 10 2 lon') where ao is a nonnegative integer and a l , a2 , . . . , an are integers satisfying 0 < a i < 9, is usually written more briefly as follows:) r = aO.a l a 2 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 an .) This is said to be a finite decimal representation of r. For example,) 1 5- = - = 0.5 2 10 ') 1 2- = - = 0.02 50 10 2 ') 29 2 5- = 7 + - + - = 7.25. 4 10 10 2) Real numbers like these are necessarily rational and, in fact, they all have the form r = a/IOn, where a is an integer. However, not all rational numbers can be expressed with finite decimal representations. For example, if i could be so expressed, then we would have i = a/IOnor 3a = Ion for some integer a. But this is impossible since 3 is not a factor of any power of 10. Nevertheless, we can approximate an arbitrary real number x > 0 to any desired degree of accuracy by a sum of the form (1.16)if we take n large enough. The reasonfor this may be seen by the following geometric argument: If x is not an integer, then x lies betweentwo consecutive integers, say ao < x < ao + 1. The segment joining ao and ao + 1 may be))) Representation of real numbers by decimals) 31) subdivided into ten equal parts. If x is not one of the subdivision points, then x must lie between two consecutive subdivisionpoints. This gives us a pair of inequalitiesof the form) a + al < x < a + al + 1 o 10 0 10) where a l is an integer (0 < al < 9). Next we divide the segment joining ao + a 1/l0 and ao + (a l + 1)/10 into ten equal parts (each of length 10- 2 ) and continue the process. If after a finite number of steps a subdivision point coincides with x, then x is a number of the form (1.16). Otherwise the process continues indefinitely, and it generates an infinite set of integersal , a2 , a 3 , . .. . In this case, we say that x has the infinite decimal representation) x = aO.a l a 2a 3 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 .) At the nth stage, x satisfiesthe inequalities) at an a l a + 1 a +-+\\\"'+-<x<a +-+...+ n .o 10 Ion 0 10 Ion) This gives us two approximations to x, one from above and one from below, by finite decimals that differ by 10- n . Therefore we can achieve any desired degree of accuracy in our approximations by taking n large enough. When x = 1, it is easy to verify that ao = 0 and an = 3 for all n > 1, and hence the corresponding infinite decimal expansion is) 1 = 0.333 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 \\302\\267) Every irrational number has an infinite decimal representation. For example, when x = v2 we may calculate by trial and error as many digits in the expansion as we wish. Thus, v2 lies between 1.4 and 1.5, because (1.4)2 < 2 < (1.5)2.Similarly, by squaring and com- paring with 2, we find the following further approximations:) 1.41 < v2 < 1.42,) 1.414< v2 < 1.415,) 1.4142 < v2 < 1.4143 .) Note that the foregoing process generatesa successionof intervals of lengths 10-1, 10- 2 , 10- 3 , . . . , each contained in the preceding and each containing the point x. This is an example of what is known as a sequence of nested intervals, a concept that is sometimes used as a basis for constructing the irrational numbers from the rational numbers. Sincewe shall do very little with decimals in this book, we shall not developtheir prop- erties in any further detail except to mention how decimal expansions may be defined analytically with the help of the least-upper-boundaxiom. If x is a given positive real number, let ao denote the largest integer < x. Having chosen ao , we let al denote the largest integer such that) a l <ao + - x . 10 -))) 32) Introduction) More generally, having chosen ao , at , . . . , an - t , we let an denote the largest integer such that) (1.17)) at a2 ana +-+-+\\\"'+-<x.o 10 10 2 Ion -) Let S denote the set of all n um bers) (1.18)) at a2 ana +-+-+...+-o 10 10 2 Ion) obtained in this way for n = 0, 1, 2, . . . . Then S is nonempty and bounded above, and it is easy to verify that x is actually the least upper bound of S. The integers a o , at , a2 , . . . so obtained may be used to define a decimal expansion of x if we write) x = aO.a t a 2a 3 \\302\\267. \\302\\267) to mean that the nth digit an is the largest integer satisfying (1.17). For example, if x = 1, we find ao = 0, at = 1, a2 = 2, a 3 = 5, and an = 0 for all n > 4. Therefore we may write) 1 = 0.125000 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 .) If in (1.17) we replace the inequality sign < by <, we obtain a slightly different definition of decimal expansions. The least upper bound of all numbers of the form (1.18)is again x, although the integers ao , at , a 2 , .. . need not be the sameas those which satisfy (1.17). For example, if this second definition is applied to x = 1, we find a o = 0, at = 1, a2 = 2, a 3 = 4, and an = 9 for all n > 4. This leads to the infinite decimal representation) 1 = 0.124999 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 .) The fact that a real number might have two different decimal representations is merely a reflection of the fact that two different sets of real numbers can have the same supremum.) Part 4. Mathematical Induction, SummationNotation,and Related Topics) 14.1 An example of a proof by mathematical induction There is no largest integer becausewhen we add 1 to an integer k, we obtain k + 1, which is larger than k. Nevertheless, starting with the number 1, we can reach any positive integer whatever in a finite number of steps, passing successively from k to k + 1 at each step. This is the basis for a type of reasoning that mathematicians call proof by induction. We shall illustrate the use of this method by proving the pair of inequalities used in Section))) An example of a proofby mathematical induction) 33) I 1.3 in the computation of the area of a parabolic segment, namely) (1.19)) n 3 1 2 + 2 2 + . . . + (n - 1)2 < - < 1 2 + 2 2 + . . . + n 2 . 3) Consider the leftmost inequality first, and let us refer to this formula as A(n) (an assertion involving n). It is easy to verify this assertion directly for the first few values of n. Thus, for example, when n takes the values 1, 2, and 3, the assertion becomes) 13 A(l):O<-, 3) A(2): ]2 < 2 3 , 3) A(3): ]2 + 2 2 < 33 , 3) provided we agree to interpret the sum on the left as 0 when n = 1. Our object is to prove that A(n) is true for every positive integer n. The procedure is as follows: Assume the assertion has been proved for a particular value of n, say for n = k. That is, assume we have proved) A(k): 1 2 + 2 2 + ... + (k _ 1)2 < k 3 3) for a fixed k > 1. Now using this, we shall deduce the corresponding result for k + 1:) A(k + 1): ]2 + 2 2 + . . . + k 2 < (k + 1)3. 3) Start with A(k) and add k 2 to both sides. This gives the inequal,ity) 1 2 + 2 2 + . . . + k 2 < k 3 + k 2 . 3) To obtain A(k + 1) as a consequence of this, it suffices to show that) k 3 + k 2 < (k + 1)3. 3 3) But this follows at once from the equation) (k + 1)3 3) _ k 3 + 3k2 + 3k + ] = k 3 + k 2 + k + ! .333) Therefore we have shown that A(k + 1) follows from A(k). Now, since A(l) has been verified directly, we conclude that A(2) is also true. Knowing that A(2) is true, we conclude that A(3) is true, and so on. Since every integer can be reached in this way, A(n) is true for all positiveintegers n. This proves the leftmost inequality in (1.19). The rightmost ineq uality can be proved in the same way.))) 34) Introduction) I 4.2 The principle of mathematical induction The reader should make 'certain that he understands the pattern of the foregoingproof. First we proved the assertion A(n) for n = 1. Next we showed that lfthe assertion is true for a particular integer, then it is also true for the next integer. From this, we concluded that the assertion is true for all positiveintegers. The idea of induction may be illustrated in many nonmathematical ways. For example, imagine a row of toy soldiers, numbered consecutively, and suppose they are so arranged that if anyone of them falls, say the one labeled k, it will knock over the next one, labeled k + 1. Then anyone can visualize what would happen if soldier number 1 were toppled backward. It is also clear that if a later soldier were knocked over first, say the one labeled n 1 , then all soldiers behind him would fall. This illustrates a slight generalization of the method of induction which can be described in the following way.) Method of proof by induction. Let A(n) be an assertion involving an integer n. We conclude that A(n) is true for every n > n l if we can perform the following two steps: (a) Prove that A(n l ) is true. (b) Let k be an arbitrary but fixed integer > n l . Assume that A(k) is true and prove that A(k + 1) is also true.) In actual practice n l is usually 1. The logical justification for this method of proof is the following theorem about real numbers.) THEOREM 1.36. PRINCIPLE OF MATHEMATICAL INDUCTION. Let S be a set of positive integers }vhich has the following two properties: (a) The number 1 is in the set S. (b) If an integer k is in S, then so is k + 1. Then every positive integer is in the set S.) Proof Properties (a) and (b) tell us that S is an inductive set. But the positive integers were defined to be exactly those real numbers which belong to every inductive set. (See Section I 3.6.) Therefore S contains every positiveinteger. Whenever we carry out a proof of an assertion A(n) for all n > 1 by mathematical induc- tion, we are applying Theorem 1.36 to the set S of all the integers for which the assertion is true. If we want to prove that A(n) is true only for n > n l , we apply Theorem 1.36to the set of n for which A(n + n l - 1)is true.) * I 4.3 The well-orderingprinciple There is another important property of the positive integers, called the well-ordering principle,that is also used as a basis for proofs by induction. It can be stated as follows.) THEOREM 1.37. WELL-ORDERING PRINCIPLE. Every nonempty set of positive integers contains a smallest member.) Note that the well-ordering principle refers to sets of positive integers. The theorem is not true for arbitrary sets of integers. For example, the set of all integers has no smallest member.))) Exercises) 35) The well-ordering principle can be deducedfrom the principle of induction. This is demonstrated in Section I 4.5. We conclude this section with an example showing how the well-ordering principlecan be usedto prove theorems about positive integers. Let A(n) denote the following assertion:) n 3 n 2 n A(n): 12 + 22 + . . . + n 2 = - + - + -. 3 2 6) Again, we note that A( 1) is true, since) 1 2 - .1 + .l. + J_- 3 2 6 .) Now there are only two possibilities. We have either (i) A(n) is true for every positive integer n, or (ii) there is at least one positive integer n for which A(n) is false. We shall prove that alternative (ii) leads to a contradiction. Assume (ii) holds. Then by the well-ordering principle, there must be a smallest positive integer, say k, for which A(k) is false. (We apply the well-ordering principle to the set of all positive integers n for which A(n) is false. Statement (ii) says that this set is nonempty.) This k must be greater than 1, because we have verified that A( 1) is true. Also, the assertion must be true for k - 1,since k was the smallest integer for which A(k) is false; therefore we may write) A(k _ 1): 12 + 22 + . . . + (k _ 1)2= (k - 1)3 + (k - 1)2+ k - 1 . 226) Adding k 2 to both sides and simplifying the right-hand side, we find) k 3 k 2 k 1 2 + 2 2 + . . . + k 2 = - + - + - . 3 2 6) But this equation states that A(k) is true; therefore we have a contradiction, because k is an integer for which A(k) is false. In other words, statement (ii) leads to a contradiction. Therefore (i) holds,\\037nd this proves that the identity in question is valid for all values of n > 1. An immediate consequence of this identity is the rightmost inequality in (1.19). A proof like this which makes use of the well-ordering principle is also referred to as a proof by induction. Of course, the proof could also be put in the more usual form in which we verify A(I) and then pass from A(k) to A(k + 1).) I 4.4 Exercises) 1.

Given positive real numbers at , a 2 , a 3 , . . . , such that an < ca n- 1 for all n > 2, where c is a fixed positive number, use induction to prove that an < a1C n- 1 for all n > 1. 9. Prove the following statement by induction: If a line of unit length is given, then a line of length ,y;; can be constructed with straightedge and compass for each positive integer n. 10. Let b denote a fixed positive integer. Prove the following statement by induction: For every integer n > 0, there exist nonnegative integers q and r such that) n = qb + r ,) o < r <b.) 11. Letnand d denote integers. We say that d is a divisor of n if n = cd for someinteger c. An integer n is calleda prime if n > 1 and if the only positive divisors of n are 1 and n. Prove, by induction, that every integer n > 1 is either a prime or a product of primes. 12.Describe the fallacy in the following \\\"proof\\\" by induction: Statement. Given any collection of n blonde girls. If at least one of the girls has blue eyes, then all n of them have blue eyes. \\\"Proof\\\" The statement is obviously true when n = 1. The step from k to k + 1 can be illustrated by going from n = 3 to n = 4. Assume, therefore, that the statement is true))) The summation notation) 37) when n = 3 and let G1, G2 , G 3, G 4 be four blonde girls, at least one of which, say G b has blue eyes. Taking G 1, G 2 , and G3 together and using the fact that the statement is true when n = 3, we find that G 2 and G 3 also have blue eyes. Repeating the process with G1, G2 , and G4' we find that G 4 has blue eyes. Thus all four have blue eyes. A similar argument allows us to make the step from k to k + 1 in general. Corollary. All blonde girls have blue eyes. Proof Sincethere exists at least one blonde girl with blue eyes, we can apply the foregoing result to the collection consisting of all blonde girls. Note: This exampleis from G. P6lya, who suggests that the reader may want to test the validity of the statement by experiment.) *1 4.5 Proof of the well-ordering principle In this section we deduce the well-ordering principle from the principle of induction. Let T be a nonempty collection of positive integers. We want to prove that T has a smallest member, that is, that there is a positive integer to in T such that to < t for all t in T. Suppose T has no smallest member. We shall show that this leads to a contradiction. The integer 1 cannot be in T (otherwise it would be the smallest member of T). Let S denote the collection of all positive integers n such that n < t for all t in T. Now 1 is in S because 1 < t for all t in T. Next, let k be a positive integer in S. Then k < 1for all t in T. We shall prove that k + 1 is also in S. If this were not so, then for some 11 in T we would have 11 < k + 1. Since T has no smallest member, there is an integer t 2 in T such that t 2 < t 1 , and hence t 2 < k + 1. But this means that 12 < k, contradicting the fact that k < t for all t in T. Therefore k + 1 is in S. By the induction principle, S contains all positive integers. Since Tis nonempty, there is a positive integer t in T. But this 1 must also be in S (since S contains all positiveintegers).It follows from the definition of S that t < t, which is a contradiction. Therefore, the assumption that T has no smallest member leads to a contradiction. It follows that T must have a smallest member, and in turn this proves that the well-ordering principle is a consequence of the principle of induction.) I 4.6 The summation notation In the calculations for the area of the parabolic segment, we encountered the sum) (1.20)) 1 2 + 2 2 + 32 + . . . + n 2 .) Note that a typical term in this sum is of the form k 2 , and we get all the terms by letting k run through the values 1,2, 3, . . . , n. There is a very useful and convenient notation which enables us to write sums like this in a more compact form. This is called the summation notation and it makes use of the Greek letter sigma, 2. Using summation notation, we can write the sum in (1.20) as follows:) n 2 k 2. k=1) This symbol is read: \\\"The sum of k 2 for k running from 1 to n.\\\" The numbers appearing under and above the sigma tell us the range of values taken by k. The letter k itself is))) 38) Introduction) referred to as the index of summation. Of course, it is not important that we use the letter k; any other convenient letter may take its place. For example,instead of L\\037=l k 2 we could write LF=l i 2 , L \\037=lj2, L \\037=l m 2, etc., all of which are considered as alternative notations for the same thing. The letters i,j, k, m, etc. that are used in this way are called dummy indices. It would not be a good idea to use the letter n for the dummy indexin this particular example because n is already being used for the number of terms. More generally, when we want to form the sum of several real numbers, say al , a2 , . . . , an , we denote such a sum by the symbol) (1.21)) a l + a 2 + . . . + an) which, using summation notation, can be written as follows:) (1.22)) n La k . k=l) For example, we have) 4 L a k = al + a2 + a 3 + a 4 , k=l 5 L Xi = Xl + X2 + X3 + X 4 + X5 . i=l) Sometimes it is convenient to begin summations from 0 or from some value of the index beyond I. For example, we have) 4 L Xi = Xo + Xl + X 2 + X3 + X 4 , i=O) 5 L n 3 = 23 + 33 + 43 + 53. n=2) Other uses of the summation notation are illustrated below:) 4 L Xm+l = X + X2 + X3 + X4 + X5, m=O) 6 L 2 i- l = 1 + 2 + 2 2 + 2 3 + 24 + 2 5. j=l) To emphasize once more that the choice of dummy index is unimportant, we note that the last sum may also be written in each of the following forms:) 6 5 5 6 L2 q- 1 = L 2 r = L2 5- n = L 2 6- k . q=l r=O n=O k=l) Note: From a strictly logicalstandpoint, the symbols in (1.21) and (1.22) do not appear among the primitive symbols for the real-number system. In a more careful treatment, we could define these new symbols in terms of the primitive undefined symbols of our system.))) Exercises) 39) This may be done by a process known as definition by induction which, like proof by induc- tion, consists of two parts: (a) We define) 1 L ak = al . k=1) (b) Assuming that we have defined L\\037=1 ak for a fixed n > 1, we further define) n+l ( n ) L ak = L ak + a n + 1 . k=1 k=l) To illustrate, we may take n = 1 in (b) and use (a) to obtain) 2 1 \\037 ak = \\037 ak + a 2 = a1 + a2 . k= 1 k= 1) Now, having defined \\037\\037=1ak , we can use (b) again with n = 2 to obtain) 3 2 L ak = L ak + a3 = (al + a2 ) + a 3 . k=1 k=1) By the associative law for addition (Axiom 2', the sum (a 1 + a 2 ) + a 3 is the sam\\037 as al + (a 2 + a 3), and therefore there is no danger of confusion if we drop the parentheses and simply write al + a2 + a 3 for L\\037=1 ak. Similarly, we have) 4 3 L ak = \\037 ak + a 4 = (a1 + a2 + a 3) + a 4 . k= 1 k=1) In this case we can prove that the sum (a 1 + a2 + a 3) + a 4 is the sanle as (a1 + a2 ) + (a 3 + a4)or a1+ (a2 + a 3 + a 4 ), and therefore the parenthesescan bedroppedagain with- out danger of ambiguity, and we agree to write) 4 \\037 ak = a 1 + a2 + a3 + a 4 . k=l) Continuing in this way, we find that (a) and (b) together give us a complete definition of the symbol in (1.22). The notation in (1.21) is considered to be merely an alt\\037rnative way of writing (1.22). It is justified by a general associative law for addition which we shall not attempt to state or to prove here. The reader should notice that definition by induction and proof by induction involve the same underlying idea. A definition by induction is also called a recursive definition.) I 4.7 Exercises 1.

In particular, when m = 10 6 , the sum lies between 1998and 1999.) I 4.8 Absolute values and the triangle inequality Calculations with inequalities arise quite frequently in calculus. They are of particular importance in dealing with the notion of absolute value. If x is a real number, the absolute value of x is a nonnegative real number denoted by Ixl and defined as follows:) Ixl = { X -x) if x > 0 , if x < 0 .) Note that -Ixl < x < Ixl. When real numbers are represented geometrically on a real axis, the number Ixl is called the distance of x from O. If a > 0 and if a point x lies between -a and a, then Ixl is nearer to 0 than a is. The analytic statement of this fact is given by the following theorem.) THEOREM 1.38. If a > 0, then Ixl < a if and only if -a < x < a.) Proof There are two statements to prove: first, that the inequality Ixl < a implies the two inequalities -a < x < a and, conversely, that -a < x < a implies Ixl < a. Suppose Ixl < a. Then we also have -a < -Ixl. But either x = Ixl or x = -Ixl and hence -a < -Ixl < x < Ixl < a. This proves the first statement. To prove the converse, assume -a < x < a. Then if x > 0, we have Ixl = x < a, whereas if x < 0, we have Ixl = -x < a. In either case we have Ixl < a, and this com- pletes the proof. Figure 1.9 illustrates the geometrical significance of this theorem.) I x I < a in this interval) -a) o) a) FIGURE 1.9 Geometrical significance of Theorem1.38.) As a consequence of Theorem 1.38, it is easy to derive an important inequality which states that the absolute value of a sum of two real numbers cannot exceedthe sum of their absolute values.))) 42 Introduction) THEOREM 1.39. For arbitrary real numbers x and y, we have) Ix + yl < Ixl + Iyl \\302\\267) Note: This property is called the triangle inequality, because when it is generalized to vectors it states that the length of any side of a triangle is less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.) Proof Adding the inequalities -Ixl < x < Ixl and -Iyl < y < Iyl, we obtain) - (Ixl + Iyl) < x + y < Ixl + Iyl ,) and hence, by Theorem 1.38, we conclude that Ix + yl < Ixl + Iyl. If we take x = a - c and y = c - b, then x + \\037= a - b and the triangle inequality becomes) la - bl < la - cl + Ib - cl .) This form of the triangle inequality is often used in practice. Using mathematicalinduction, we may extend the triangle inequality as follows:) THEOREM 1.40. For arbitrary real numbers a l , a2 , . . . , an, we have) n n La k < \\037Iakl. k=l k=l) Proof When n = 1 the inequality is trivial, and when n = 2 it is the triangle inequality. Assume, then, that it is true for n real numbers. Then for n + 1 real numbers al , a2 , . . . , a n+l , we have) n+l n n n n+l \\037 a k - \\037 a k + a n + l < L a k + lan+ll < L lakl + lan+ll = L lakl . k=l k=l k=l k=l k=l) Hence the theorem is true for n + 1 numbers if it is true for n. By induction, it is true for every positive integer n. The next theorem describes an important inequality that we shall use later in connection with our study of vector algebra.) THEOREM 1.41. THE CAUCHY-SCHWARZ INEQUALITY. If aI' . . . , an and bl , . . . , b n are arbitrary real numbers, we have) (1.23)) Ctakbkr < Cta:) Ct b :) .)

If A = 0, then each ak = 0, so B = 0 and the res,ult is trivial. If A :rf 0, we may complete the square and write) ( B ) 2 AC - B 2 AX2 + 2Bx + C = A x + A + A \\302\\267) The right side has its smallest value when x = -BIA. Putting x = -BIA in (1.24), we obtain B2 < AC. This proves (1.23). The reader should verify that the equality sign holds if and only if there is an x such that akx + b k = 0 for each k.)

To understand the definition one must have some acquaintance with the function concept; the next few sections are devoted to an explanation of this and related ideas.) 1.1 The basic ideas of Cartesian geometry As mentioned earlier, one of the applications of the integral is the calculation of area. Ordinarily we do not talk about area by itself. Instead, we talk about the area of something. This means that we have certain objects(polygonal regions, circular regions, parabolic segments, etc.) whoseareaswe wish to measure. If we hope to arrive at a treatment of area that will enable us to deal with many different kinds of objects, we must first find an effective way to describe these objects. The most primitive way of doing this is by drawing figures, as was done by the ancient Greeks. A much better way was suggested by Rene Descartes (1596-1650),who introduced the subject of analytic geometry (also known as Cartesian geometry). Descartes' idea was to represent geometric points by numbers. The procedure for points in a plane is this: Two perpendicular reference lines (called coordinate axes) are chosen, one horizontal (called the \\\"x-axis\\,\") the other vertical(the \\\"y-axis\\.\") Their point of intersection, denoted by 0, is called the origin. On the x-axis a convenient point is chosen to the right of 0 and its distance from 0 is called the unit distance. Vertical distances along the y-axis are usually measured with the same unit distance, although sometimes it is convenient to usea different scale on the y-axis. Now each point in the plane (sometimes called the xy-plane)is assigned a pair of numbers, called its coordinates. These numbers tell us how to locate the point. Figure 1.1 illustrates some examples. The point with coordinates (3, 2) lies three units to the right of the y-axis and two units above the x-axis. The number 3 is calledthe x-coordinate of the point, 2 its y-coordinate. Points to the left of the y-axis have a negative x-coordinate; those below the x-axis have a negative y-coordinate. The x-coordinate of a point is some- times called its abscissa and the y-coordinate is called its ordinate. When we write a pair of numbers such as (a, b) to represent a point, we agree that the abscissa or x-coordinate, a, is written first. For this reason, the pair (a, b) is often referred to as an ordered pair. It is clear that two ordered pairs (a, b) and (c,d) represent the same point if and only if we have a = c and b = d. Points (a, b) with both a and b positive are said to lie in the first quadrant; those with a < 0 and b > 0 are in the second quadrant; 48))) The basic ideas of Cartesian geometry) 49) those with a < 0 and b < 0 are in the third quadrant; and those with a > 0 and b < 0 are in the fourth quadrant. Figure 1.1 shows one point in each quadrant. The procedure for points in space is similar. We take three mutually perpendicular lines in space intersecting at a point (the origin). These lines determine three mutually perpendicular planes, and each point in space can be completely described by specifying, with appropriate regard for signs,its distancesfrom these planes. We shall discuss three-dimen- sional Cartesian geometry in more detail later on; for the present we confine our attention to plane analytic geometry. A geometric figure, such as a curve in the plane, is a collection of points satisfying one or more special conditions. By translating these conditions into expressions involving the) y-axis) y) ( -2,I)r-----l I) ---- -----\\037(3,2) I I I I I I) Iyl) x) 4; I I I I I I I -3 -------------..

For example,considera circleof radius r with its center at the origin, as shown in Figure 1.2. Let P be an arbitrary point on this circle, and suppose P has coordinates (x,y). Then the line segment OP is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have lengths Ixl and Iyl and hence, by the theorem of Pythagoras,) x 2 + y2 = r2 .) This equation, called a Cartesian equation of the circle, is satisfied by all points (x, y) on the circle and by no others, so the equation completely characterizes the circle. This example illustrates how analytic geometry is used to reduce geometrical statements about points to analytical statements about real numbers. Throughout their historical development, calculus and analytic geometry have been intimately intertwined. New discoveries in one subject led to improvements in the other. The developmentof calculus and analytic geometry in this book is similar to the historical development, in that the two subjects are treated together. However, our primary purpose is to discusscalculus.Concepts from analytic geometry that are required for this purpose))) 50) The concepts of integral calculus) will be discussed as needed. Actually, only a few very elementary conceptsof plane analytic geometry are required to understand the rudiments of calculus. A deeper study of analytic geometry is needed to extend the scope and applications of calculus,and this study will be carried out in later chapters using vector methods as well as the methods of calculus. Until then, all that is required from analytic geometry is a little familiarity with drawing graphs of functions.) 1.2 Functions. Informal description and examples Various fields of human endeavor have to do with relationships that exist between one collectionof objects and another. Graphs, charts, curves,tables,formulas, and Gallup polls are familiar to everyone who reads the newspapers. These are merely devices for describing special relations in a quantitative fashion. Mathematicians refer to certain types of these relations as functions. In this section, we give an informal description of the function concept. A formal definition is given in Section 1.3.) EXAMPLE 1. The force F necessary to stretch a steelspring a distancex beyond its natural length is proportional to x. That is, F = cx, where c is a number independent of x called the spring constant. This formula, discovered by Robert Hooke in the mid-17th century, is called Hooke's law, and it is said to expressthe force as a function of the displacement.) EXAMPLE 2. The volume of a cube is a function of its edge-length. If the edges have length x, the volume V is given by the formula V = x 3 .) EXAMPLE 3. A prime is any integer n > 1 that cannot be expressed in the form n ;::: ab, wherea and b are positive integers, both less than n. The first few primes are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13,17,19.For a given real number x > 0, it is possible to count the number of primesless than or equal to x. This number is said to be a function of x even though no simplealgebraic formula is known for computing it (without counting) when x is known.) The word \\\"function\\\" was introduced into mathematics by Leibniz, who used the term primarily to refer to certain kinds of mathematical formulas. It was later realized that Leibniz's idea of function was much too limited in its scope, and the meaning of the word has since undergone many stages of generalization. Today, the meaning of function is essentially this: Given two sets, say X and Y, a function is a correspondence which associates with each element of X one and only one element of Y. The set X is called the domain of the function. Those elements of Yassociatedwith the elements in X form a set called the range of the function. (This may be all of Y, but it need not be.) Letters of the English and Greek alphabets are often used to denote functions. The particular letters f, g, h, F, G, H, and cp are frequently used for this purpose. If j' is a given function and if x is an object of its domain, the notationf(x) is used to designatethat object in the range which is associated to x by the function f, and it is called the value of f at x or the image of x under f The symbolf(x) is read as ''I of X.\\\" The function idea may be illustrated schematicallyin many ways. For example, in Figure 1.3(a) the collections X and Yare thought of as sets of points and an arrow is used to suggest a \\\"pairing\\\" of a typical point x in X with the image point f(x) in Y. Another scheme is shown in Figure 1.3(b). Here the function f is imagined to be like a machine into))) Functions. Informal description and examples) 51) x \\037) f) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 1.3 Schematic representations of the function idea.) which objects of the collectionXare fed and object\\037 of Yare produced. When an object x is fed into the machine, the output is the object f(x). Although the function idea places no restriction on the nature of the objects in the domain X and in the range Y, in elementary calculus we are primarily interested in functions whose domain and range are setsof real numbers. Such functions are called real-valued functions of a real variable, or, more briefly, real functions, and they may be illustrated geometrically by a graph in the xy-plane. We plot the domain X on the x-axis,and above each point x in X we plot the point (x, y), where y = f(x). The totality of such points (x, y) is called the graph of the function. Now we consider some more examplesof real functions.) EXAMPLE 4. The identity function. Suppose that f(x) = x for all real x. This function is often called the identity function. Its domain is the real line, that is, the set of all real numbers. Herex = y for each point (x, y) on the graph off The graph is a straight line making equal angleswith the coordinates axes (see Figure 1.4). The range of fis the set of all real numbers.) EXAMPLE 5. The absolute-value function. Consider the function which assigns to each real number x the nonnegative number Ixl. A portion of its graph is shown in Figure 1.5.) y) y q;(x) = I xl) x) x) FIGURE 1.4 Graph of the identity function f(x) = x.) FIGURE 1.5 Absolute-value function q;(x) = \\\\x\\\\.))) 52) The concepts of integral calculus) Denoting this function by cp, we have cp(x) = Ixl for all real x. For example, cp(O) = 0, cp(2) = 2, cp( -3) = 3. We list here some properties of absolute valuesexpressed in function notation.) (a) cp(-x) = cp(x).) ( d) cp [ cp( x )] = cp( x) . (e) cp(x) = V x 2 .)(b) cp(x 2 ) = x 2 .) (c) cp(x + y) < cp(x) + cp(y) (the triangle inequality) .) EXAMPLE 6. The prime-number function. For any x > 0, let 1T(X) be the number of primes lessthan or equal to x. The domain of 1T is the set of positivereal numbers. Its range is the set of nonnegative integers {O, 1, 2, . . .}. A portion of the graph of 1T is shown in Figure 1.6.) y 6 . 5 . 4 . 3 . 2 . --- 0 x 2 3 5 7 11 13 FIGURE 1.6 The prime-number function.) n n! 1 1 2 2 3 6 4 24 5 120) n n! 6 720 7 5,040 8 40,320 9 362,880 10 3,628,800) FIGURE 1.7 The factorial function.) (Different scalesare used on the x- and y-axes.) As x increases, the function value 1T(X) remains constant until x reaches a prime, at which point the function value jumps by 1. Therefore the graph of 1T consists of horizontal line segments. This is an example of a class of functions calledstepfunctions; they playa fundamental role in the theory of the integral.) EXAMPLE 7. The factorial function. For every positive integer n, we define f(n) to be n! = 1\\302\\2672 \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267n. In this example, the domain of f is the set of positive integers. The function values increase so rapidly that it is more convenient to display this function in tabular form rather than as a graph. Figure 1.7 shows a table listing the pairs (n, n!) for n = 1, 2, . . . , 10.) The reader should note two features that all the above exampleshave in common. (1) For each x in the domain X there is one and only one image y that is paired with that particular x. (2) Each function generates a set of pairs (x, y), where x is a typical element of the domain X, and y is the unique element of Y that goes with x. In most of the above examples, we displayed the pairs (x, y) geometricallyas points on a graph. In Example 7 we displayed them as entries in a table. In each case,to know the function is to know, in one way or another, all the pairs (x,y) that it generates. This simple))) Functions. Formal definition as a set of ordered pairs) 53) observation is the motivation behind the formal definition of the function concept that is given in the next section.) *1.3 Functions. Formal definition as a set of ordered pairs In the informal discussion of the foregoing section, a function was described as a corre- spondencewhich associates with each object in a set X one and only one object in a set Y. The words \\\"correspondence\\\" and \\\"associates with\\\" may not convey exactly the same meaning to all people, so we shall reformulate the wholeidea in a different way, basing it on the set concept. First we require the notion of an ordered pair of objects. In the definition of set equality, no mention is made of the order in which elements appear. Thus, the sets {2 ,5} and {5, 2} are equal because they consist of exactly the same elements. Sometimesthe order is important. For example, in plane analytic geometry the coordinates (x,y) of a point represent an ordered pair of numbers. The point with co- ordinates (2, 5) is not the same as the point with coordinates (5, 2), although the sets {2,5} and {5, 2} are equal. In the same way, if we have a pair of objectsa and b (not necessarily distinct) and if we wish to distinguish one of the objects, say a, as the first member and the other, b, as the second, we enclose the objects in parentheses, (a, b). We refer to this as an ordered pair. We say that two ordered pairs (a, b) and (c, d) are equal if and only if their first members are equal and their second membersare equal. That is to say, we have) (a, b) = (c, d)) if and only if a = c and b = d .) Now we may state the formal definition of function.) DEFINITION OF FUNCTION. A function f is a set of ordered pairs (x, y) no t\\302\\273'oof \\037fhich have the same first member.) Iff is a function, the set of all elements x that occur as first members of pairs (x,y) in f is called the domain off The set of second members y is called the range off, or the set of values of f Intuitively, a function can be thought of as a table consisting of two columns. Each entry in the table is an ordered pair (x,.y); the column of x's is the domain off, and the column of y's, the range. If two entries (x, y) and (x, z) appearin the table with the same x-value, then for the table to be a function it is necessary that y = z. In other words, a function cannot take two different values at a given point x. Therefore, for every x in the domain off there is exactly one y such that (x, y) E f Since this y is uniquely determined once x is known, we can introduce a special symbol for it. It is customary to write) y = f(x)) instead of (x, y) E f to indicate that the pair (x, y) is in the set f As an alternative to describinga function f by specifying explicitly the pairs it contains, it is usually preferable to describethe domain off, and then, for each x in the domain, to describe how the function value f(x) is obtained. In this connection, we have the following theorem whoseproof is left as an exercise for the reader.))) 54) The concepts of integral calculus) THEOREM 1.1. T'vvo functions f and g are equal if and only if (a) f and g have the same domain, and (b) f(x) = g(x)forevery x in the domain of!) It is important to realize that the objects x and f(x) which appear in the ordered pairs (x,f(x)) of a function need not be numbers but may be arbitrary objects of any kind. Occasionally we shall use this degree of generality, but for the most part we shall be interested in real functions, that is, functions whose domain and range are subsets of the real line. Someof the functions that arise in calculus are described in the next few examples.) 1.4 More examples of real functions) 1. Constant functions. A function whose range consists of a single number is called a constant function. An example is shown in Figure 1.8, wheref(x) = 3 for every real x. The graph is a horizontal line cutting the y-axis at the point (0, 3).) y) x) x) y) y) f(x) = 3) 2 1 o) o) x) FIGURE 1.8 A constant functionf(x) = 3.) FIGURE 1.9 A linear function g(x) = 2x - 1.) FIGURE 1.10 A quadratic polynomialf(x) = x 2 .) 2. Linear functions. A function g defined for all real x by a formula of the form) g(x) = ax + b) is called a linear function because its graph is a straight line. The number b is called the y-intercept of the line; it is the y-coordinate of the point (0, b) where the line cuts the y-axis. The number a is called the slope of the line. One example, g(x) = x, is shown in Figure 1.4. Another, g(x) = 2x - 1,is shown in Figure 1.9.) 3. Thepowerfunctions. For a fixed positive integer n, let f be defined by the equation f(x) = x n for all real x. When n = 1, this is the identity function, shown in Figure 1.4. For n = 2, the graph is a parabola, part of which is shown in Figure 1.1 O. For n = 3, the graph is a cubic curve and has the appearance of that in Figure 1.11 (p. 56).))) More examples of real functions) 55) 4. Polynomial functions. A polynomial function P is one defined for all real x by an equation of the form) n P(x) = Co+ C1X + . . . + cnx n = !CkX k. k=O) The numbers co, c1 , . . . , C n are called the coefficients of the polynomial, and the nonnegative integer n is called its degree (if C n -:;C 0). They include the constant func- tions and the power functions as specialcases. Polynomials of degree 2, 3, and 4 are called quadratic, cubic, and quartic polynomials, respectively. Figure 1.12 shows a portion of the graph of a quartic polynomial P given by P(x) = !x 4 - 2x 2 .) 5. The circle. Suppose we return to the Cartesian equation of a circle,x 2 + y2 = r 2 and solve this equation for y in terms of x. There are two solutions given by) y = Vr 2 - x 2) and) y = - V r 2 - x 2 .) (We remind the reader that if a > 0, the symbol \\037 denotes the positive square root of a. The negative square root is -\\037.) Therewasa time whe n mathe maticians would say that y is a double-valued function of x given by y = :i:V r 2 - x 2 . However, the more modern point of view does not admit \\\"double-valuedness\\\" as a property of functions. The definition of function requires that for each x in the domain, there corresponds one and only one y in the range. Geometrically, this means that vertical lines which intersect the graph do so at exactly one point. Therefore to make this example fit the theory, we say that the two solutions for y define two functions, say f and g, where) f(x) = v r 2 - x 2) and) g(x) = - v r 2 - x 2) for each x satisfying -r < x < r. Each of these functions has for its domain the interval extending from -r to r. If Ixl > r, there is no realy such that x 2 + y2 = r 2 , and we say that the functions..f and g are not defined for such x. Sincef(x) is the non- negative square root of r 2 - x 2 , the graph offis the upper semicircleshown in Figure 1.13. The function values of g are < 0, and hence the graph of g is the lowersemicircle shown in Figure 1.13.) 6. Sums, products, and quotients of functions. Let f and g be two real functions having the same domain D. We can construct new functions fromf and g by adding, multi- plying, or dividing the function values. The function u defined by the equation) u(x) = f(x) + g(x)) if XED) is called the sum off and g and is denoted by f + g. Similarly, the product v = f' g and the quotient w = fig are the functions defined by the respective formulas) v(x) = f(x)g(x)) if xED,) w(x) = f(x)/g(x)) if xED and g(x) \\037 o.))) 56) The concepts of integral calculus) y) FIGURE 1.11 A cubic polynomial: P(x) = x 3 .) y) P(x) = !x 4 - 2X2) x) \\\\ \\\\ ./', g ..........-) III// -\\\"\\\"''') y) x) x) FIGURE 1.12 A quartic polynomial: P(x) = fx 4 - 2x 2 .)

He then uses these properties as fundamental building blocks of his theory. Euclid used this process when he developed elementary geometryas a deductive system based on a set of axioms. We used the same process in our axiomatic treatment of the real number system, and we shall use it once more in our dis- cussionof area. When we assign an area to a plane region, we associate a number with a set S in the plane. From a purely mathematical viewpoint, this means that we have a function a (an area function) which assigns a real number a(S) (the area of S) to each set S in some given collection of sets. A function of this kind, whose domain is a collection of sets and whose function values are real numbers, is called a setfunction. The basic problem is this: Given a plane set S, what area a(S) shall we assign to S? Our approach to this problem is to start with a number of properties we feel area should have and take these as axioms for area. Any set function which satisfies these axioms will be called an area function. To make certain we are not discussing an empty theory, it is necessary to show that an area function actually exists. We shall not attempt to do this here. Instead, we assume the existence of an area function and deduce further properties from the axioms. An elementary construction of an area function may be found in Chapters 14 and 22 of Edwin E. Moise, Elementary Geometry From An Advanced Standpoint, Addison- Wesley Publishing Co., 1963.))) 58) The concepts of integral calculus) Before we state the axioms for area, we will make a few remarks about the collectionof sets in the plane to which an area can be assigned. These sets will be called measurable sets; the collection of all measurable sets will be denoted by A. The axiomscontain enough information about the sets in A to enable us to prove that all geometric figures arising in the usual applications of calculus are in A and that their areas can be calculated by integra- tion. One of the axioms (Axiom 5) states that every rectangle is measurableand that its area is the product of the lengths of its edges. The term \\\"rectangle\\\" as used here refers to any set congruentt to a set of the form) {(x, y) I 0 < x < h, 0 < y < k},) where h > 0 and k > O. The numbers hand k are called the lengths of the edges of the rectangle. We consider a line segment or a point to be a special case of a rectangle by allowing h or k (or both) to be zero.) \\037 \\\"\\\"\\\"- ,/; '\\\" \\037 ....'..\\\"/,.) T /') .) ..,) A step region) Ordinate set (a)) Inner step region (b)) Outer step region (c)) FIGURE 1.14) FIGURE 1.15 An ordinate set enclosed by two step regions.) From rectangles we can build up more complicated sets. The set shown in Figure 1.14 is the union of a finite collection of adjacentrectangleswith their bases resting on the x-axis and is calleda stepregion. The axioms imply that each step region is measurable and that its area is the sum of the areas of the rectangular pieces. The region Q shown in Figure 1.15(a) is an example of an ordinate set. Its upper boundary is the graph of a nonnegative function. Axiom 6 will enable us to prove that many ordinate sets are measurable and that their areas can be calculated by approximating such sets by inner and outer stepregions,as shown in Figure 1.15(b) and (c). We turn now to the axioms themselves.) AXIOMATIC DEFINITION OF AREA. We assume there existsa classvii of measurable sets in the plane and a set function a, whose domain is A, \\\\-vith the following properties:) 1. Nonnegative property. For each set S in A, we have a(S) > O.) t Congruence is used here in the same sense as in elementary Euclidean geometry. Two sets are said to be congruent if their points can be put in one-to-one correspondence in such a way that distances are preserved. That is, if two points p and q in one set correspond to p' and q' in the other, the distance from p to q must be equal to the distance from p' to q'; this must be true for all choices of p and q.)))

If there is one and only one number c \\037t'hich satisfies the inequalities) a(S) < c < aCT)) for all step regions Sand T satisfying (1.1), then Q is measurable and a(Q) = c.) Axiom 1 simply states that the area of a plane measurable set is either a positive number or zero. Axiom 2 tells us that when a set is formed from two pieces (which may overlap), the area of the union is the sum of the areas of the two parts minus the area of their inter- section. In particular, if the intersection has zero area, the area of the whole is the sum of the areas of the two parts. If we remove a measurable set S from a larger measurable set T, Axiom 3 states that the remaining part, T - S, is measurable and its area is obtained by subtraction, a(T - S) = aCT) - a(S). In particular, this axiom implies that the empty set 0 is measurable and has zero area. Since aCT - S) > 0, Axiom 3 also implies the monotone property:) a(S) < aCT),) for sets Sand T in A with S c T.) In other words, a set which is part of another cannot have a larger area. Axiom 4 assigns equal areas to sets having the same size and shape. The first four axioms would be trivially satisfied if we assigned the number 0 as the area of every set in e.-It. Axiom 5 assigns a nonzero area to some rectangles and thereby excludes this trivial case. Finally, Axiom 6 incorporates the Greek method of exhaustion; it enables us to extend the class of measurable sets from step regions to more general regions. Axiom 5 assigns zero area to each line segment. Repeated use of the additive property shows that every step region is measurable and that its area is the sum of the areas of the rectangular pieces. Further elementary consequences of the axioms are discussedin the next set of exercises.))) 60) The concepts of integral calculus) 1.7 Exercises) The properties of area in this set of exercises are to be deduced from the axioms for area stated in the foregoing section. 1. Prove that each of the following sets is measurable and has zeroarea:(a)A set consisting of a single point. (b) A set consisting of a finite number of points in a plane. (c) The union of a finite collection of line segments in a plane. 2. Every right triangular region is measurable becauseit can be obtained as the intersection of two rectangles. Prove that every triangular region is measurable and that its area is one half the product of its base and altitude. 3. Prove that every trapezoid and every parallelogram is measurable and derive the usual formulas for their areas. 4. A point (x, y) in the plane is called a lattice point if both coordinates x and yare integers. Let P be a polygon whose verticesare lattice points. The area of P is I + !B - I,where I denotes the number of lattice points inside the polygon and B denotesthe number on the boundary. (a) Provethat the formula is valid for rectangleswith sides parallel to the coordinate axes. (b) Prove that the formula is valid for right triangles and parallelograms. (c) Useinduction on the number of edges to construct a proof for general polygons. 5. Prove that a triangle whose verticesare lattice points cannot be equilateral.) [Hint: Assume there is such a triangle and compute its area in two ways, using Exercises 2 and 4.]) 6. Let A = {I, 2, 3, 4, 5},and let JI denote the class of all subsets of A. (There are 32altogether, counting A itself and the empty set 0.) For each set S in JI, let n(S) denote the number of distinct elements in S. If S = {I, 2, 3, 4} and T = {3, 4, 5}, compute n(S U T), n(S (\\\\ T), n(S - T), and neT - S). Prove that the set function n satisfies the first three axioms for area.) 1.8 Intervals and ordinate sets) In the theory of integration we are concerned primarily with real functions whose domains are intervals on the x-axis. Sometimes it is important to distinguish between intervals which include their endpoints and those which do not. This distinction is made by introducing the following definitions.) . . 0 0 0 . . 0 a b a b a b a b a < x < b a<x<b a<x < b a < x<b Closed Open Half-open. Hal f-open) FIGURE 1.16 Examples of intervals.) If a < b, we denote by [a, b] the set of all x satisfying the inequalities a < x < band refer to this set as the closed interval from a to b. The correspondingopen interval, written (a, b), is the set of all x satisfying a < x < b. The closed interval [a, b] includes the end- points a and b, whereas the open interval does not. (SeeFigure 1.16.) The open interval (a, b) is also called the interior of [a, b]. Half-open intervals (a, b] and [a, b), which include just one endpoint are definedby the inequalities a < x < b and a < x < b, respectively. Letf be a nonnegative function whose domain is a closedinte:-val [a, b]. The portion of the plane between the graph of f and the x-axis is called the ordinate set of f More))) Partitions and step functions) 61) precisely, the ordinate set off is the collection of all points (x, y) satisfying the inequalities) a < x < b,) o < y < f(x) .) In each of the examples shown in Figure 1.17 the shaded portion represents the ordinate set of the corresponding function. Ordinate setsare the geometric objects whose areas we want to compute by means of the integral calculus. We shall define the concept of integral first for step functions and then use the integral of a step function to formulate the definition of integral for more general) a) b) a) b) FIGURE 1.17 Examples of ordinate sets.) functions. Integration theory for step functions is extremely simpleand leadsin a natural way to the corresponding theory for more general functions. To start this program, it is necessary to have an analytic definition of a step function. This may be given most simply in terms of the concept of a partition, to which we turn now.) 1.9 Partitions and step functions Suppose we decompose a given closed interval [a, b] into n subintervals by inserting n - 1 points of subdivision, say Xl , X2 , . . . , Xn-l , subject only to the restriction) ( 1.2)) a < Xl < X2 < \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 < Xn-l < b .) It is convenient to denote the point a itself by Xo and the point b by Xn' A collection of points satisfying (1.2) is called a partition P of [a, b], and we use the symbol I) P = {Xo, Xl , . . . ; Xn}) to designate this partition. The partition P determines n closed subintervals) [Xo , Xl], [Xl' X2] , . . . , [Xn-l , Xn] .) A typical closed subinterval is [X k- l , x k ], and it is referred to as the kth closed subinterval of P; an exampleis shown in Figure 1.18. The corresponding open interval (Xk-l , x k) is called the kth open subinterval of P. N ow we are ready to formulate an analytic definition of a step function.))) 62) The concepts of integral calculus) .) .) .)

DEFINITION OF A STEP FUNCTION. A function s, vvhose domain is a closedinterval [a, b], is called a stepfunction if there is a partition P = {Xo, Xl , . . . , Xn} of [a, b] such that s is constant on each open subinterval of P. That is to say, for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n, there is a real number Sk such that) seX) = Sk) if) Xk- l < X < Xk \\302\\267) Step functions are sometimes called piecewise constant functions. Note: At each of the endpoints Xk-l and Xk the function must have some well-defined value, but this need not be the same as Sk') EXAMPLE. A familiar example of a step function is the \\\"postage function,\\\" whose graph is shown in Figure 1.19. Assume that the charge for first-class mail for parcels weighing up to 20 pounds is 5 cents for every ounce or fraction thereof. The graph shows the number of 5-cent stamps required for mail weighing up to 4 ounces. In this case the line segments on the graph are half-open intervals containing their right endpoints. The domain of the function is the interval [0, 320].) From a given partition P of [a, b], we can always form a new partition P' by adjoining more subdivision points to those already in P. Such a partition P' is called a refineme!lt of P and is said to be finer than P. For example, P = {O, 1, 2, 3, 4} is a partition of the interval [0, 4]. If we adjoint the points 3/4, V2, and 7/2, we obtain a new partition P' of) 4) .) .

Exercises) 63) [0, 4], namely, P' = {O, 3/4, 1, V2, 2, 3, 7/2,4}, which is a refinement of P. (See Figure 1.20.) If a step function is constant on the open subintervals of P, then it is also constant on the open subintervals of every refinement P'.) 1.10 Sum and product of step functions New step functions may be formed from given step functions by adding corresponding function values. For example, suppose sand t are step functions, both defined on the sameinterval [a, b]. Let PI and P 2 be partitions of [a, b] such that s is constant on the open subintervals of PI and t is constant on the open subintervals of P 2 . Let u = s + t be the function defined by the equation) u(X) = sex) + t(x)) if) a < x < b.) Graph ofs + t Graph of s Graph of t . . . . . .. . . . I I I I I I a Xl b a , b , Xl bXl a Xl FIGURE 1.21 The sum of two step functions.) To show that u is actually a step function, we must exhibit a partition P such that u is constant on the open subintervals of P. For the new partition P, we take all the points of PI along with all the points of P2 . This partition, the union of PI and P 2 , is called the common refinement of PI and P 2 . Since both sand t are constant on the open subintervals of the common refinement, the same is true of u. An example is illustrated in Figure 1.21. The partition PI is {a, Xl , b}, the partition P 2 is {a, x\\037, b}, and the common refinement is {a, x\\037, Xl , b}. Similarly, the product v = s \\302\\267t of two step functions is another step function. An important special case occurs when one of the factors, say t, is constant throughout [a, b]. If t(x) = c for each X in [a, b], then each function value vex) is obtained by multiplying the step function sex) by the constant c.) 1.11 Exercises) In this set of exercises,[x] denotes the greatest integer < x. 1.

The formulas in Exercises 4(d) and 4(e) suggest a generalization for [nx]. State and prove such a generalization. 6. Recall that a lattice point (x, y) in the plane is one whose coordinates are integers. Let [be a nonnegative function whose domain is the interval [a, b], where a and b are integers, a < b.

(b) Derive the result analytically as follows: By changing the index of summation, note that !\\037:i [na/b] = !\\037:i[a(b - n)/b]. Now apply Exercises 4(a) and (b) to the bracket on the right. 8. Let S be a set of points on the real line. The characteristic [unction of S is, by definition, the function Xs such that xs(x) = 1 for every x in S, and xs(x) = 0 for thosex not in S. Let f be a step function which takes the constant value Ck on the kth open subinterval Ik of some partition of an interval [a, b]. Prove that for each x in the union II U 12 U . . . U In we have) n [(x) = L CkXlk(X). k=1) This property is described by saying that every step function is a linear combination of char- acteristic functions of intervals.) 1.12 The definition of the integral for step functions In this section we introduce the integral for step functions. The definition is constructed so that the integral of a nonnegative step function is equal to the area of its ordinate set.))) The definition of the integral for stepfunctions) 65) Let s be a step function defined on [a, b], and let P = {xo , Xl , . . . , xn} be a partition of [a, b] such that s is constant on the open subintervals of P. Denote by Sk the constant value that s takes in the kth open subinterval, so that) seX) = Sk) if) Xk-l < X < X k ,) k = 1, 2, . . . , n .) DEFINITION OF THE INTEGRAL OF STEP FUNCTIONS. The integral of s from a to b, denoted by the symbol S:sex)dx, is defined by the following formula:) (1.3)) J b n S(x) dx = .2 Sk \\302\\267 (X k - X k- l) . a k=l) That is to say, to compute the integral, we multiply each constant value Sk by the length of the kth subinterval, and then we add together all these products. Note that the values of s at the subdivision points are immaterial sincethey do not appear on the right-hand side of (1.3). In particular, if s is constant on the open interval (a, b), say sex)= c if a < x < b, then we have) J b n sex) dx = c .2(x k - X k- l) = c(b - a) ,a k=l) regardless of the values sea) and s(b). If c > 0 and if sex) = c for all x in the closed interval [a, b], the ordinate set of s is a rectangle of base b - a and altitude c; the integral of s is c(b - a), the area of this rectangle. Changingthe value of s at one or both endpoints a or b changes the ordinate set but does not alter the integral of s or the area of its ordinate set. For example,the two ordinate sets shown in Figure 1.22 have equal areas.) y) y) y) 3) .) 2) 2) 2) x) .) x) x) o) 2 3) o) 2 3) o) 23456) FIGURE 1.22 Changes in function values at two points do not alter area of ordinate set.) FIGURE 1.23 The ordinate set of a step function.) The ordinate set of any nonnegative step function s consists of a finite number of rect- angles, one for each interval of constancy; the ordinate set may also contain or lack certain vertical-linesegments,dependingon how s is defined at the subdivision points. The integral of s is equal to the sum of the areas of the individual rectangles, regardless of the values s takes at the subdivision points. This is consistent with the fact that the vertical segments have zero area and make no contribution to the area of the ordinate set. In Figure 1.23, the step function s takes the constant values 2, 1, and \\302\\243in the open intervals (1, 2), (2, 5), and (5, 6), respectively. Its integral is equal to) t s(x) dx = 2 \\302\\267 (2 - 1) + 1 \\302\\267 (5 - 2) + t. (6 - 5) = 2.1.))) 66) The concepts of integral calculus) It should be noted that the formula for the integral in (1.3) is independent of the choice of the partition P as long as s is constant on the open subintervals of P. For example, suppose we change from P to a finer partition P' by inserting exactly one new subdivision point t, where Xo < t < Xl' Then the first term on the right of (1.3) is replaced by the two terms Sl \\302\\267 (t - xo) and Sl \\302\\267 (Xl - t), and the rest of the terms are unchanged. Since) Sl \\302\\267 (t - xo) + Sl \\302\\267 (Xl - t) = Sl \\302\\267 (Xl - xo) ,) the value of the entire sum is unchanged. We can proceed from P to any finer partition P' by inserting the new subdivision points one at a time. At each stage, the sum in (1.3) remains unchanged, so the integral is the same for all refinements of P.) 1.13 Properties of the integral of a step function In this section we describe a number of fundamental properties satisfied by the integral of a step function. Most of these properties seem obvious when they are interpreted geometrically, and some of them may even seem trivial. All these properties carryover to integrals of more general functions, and it will be a simple matter to prove them in the general case once we have established them for step functions. The properties are listed belowas theorems, and in each case a geometricinterpretation for nonnegative step functions is given in terms of areas. Analytic proofs of the theorems are outlined in Section 1.15.) s) a) b) a) b) a) b) FIGURE 1.24 Illustrating the additive property of the integral.)

For every real number c, we have) J: c \\302\\267 sex) dx = c J: sex)dx \\302\\267 These two theorems can be combined into one formula known as the linearity property.)))

For every real C 1 and c2 , we have) J: [CIS(X) + C2t(X)] dx = Cl J: sex) dx + C2 I: t(x) dx \\302\\267) Next, we have a comparison theorem which tells us that if one step function has larger values than another throughout [a, b], its integral over this interval is also larger.) THEOREM 1.5. COMPARISON THEOREM. If sex) < t(x) for every x in [a, b], then) J: sex) dx < J: t(x) dx \\302\\267) Interpreted geometrically, this theorem reflects the monotone property of area. If the ordinate set of a nonnegative step function lies inside another, the area of the smaller region is less than that of the larger. The foregoingproperties all refer to step functions defined on a common interval. The integral has further important properties that relate integrals over different intervals. Among these we have the following.) THEOREM 1.6. ADDITIVITY WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERVAL OF INTEGRATION.) I: sex) dx + I: sex)dx = J: sex) dx) if) a<c<b.) This theorem reflectsthe additive property of area, illustrated in Figure 1.26. If an ordinate set is decomposed into two ordinate sets, the sum of the areas of the two parts is equal to the area of the whole. The next theorem may be described as invariance under translation. If the ordinate set of a step function s is \\\"shifted\\\" by an amount c, the resulting ordinate set is that of another step function t related to s by the equation leX) = s(x - c). If s is defined on [a, b], then t is defined on [a + c, b + c],and their ordinate sets, being congruent, have equal areas.))) 68) The concepts of integral calculus) s) t) --..) a) c) b) a) b) a+c) b+c) FIGURE 1.26 Additivity with respect to the interval of integration.)

The homogeneous property (Theorem 1.3) explains what happens to an integral under a change of scale on the y-axis. The following theorem deals with a change of scaleon the x-axis. If s is a step function defined on an interval [a, b] and if we distort the scale in the horizontal direction by multiplying all x-coordinates by a factor k > 0, then the new graph is that of another step function t defined on the interval [ka, kb] and related to s by the equation) t(x) = s( \\037)) if) ka < x < kb .)

Until now, when we have used the symbol S\\037, it has been understood that the lower limit a was less than the upper limit b.

Other notations for integrals) 69) We also define) t sex) dx = 0 ,) a definition that is suggested by putting a = b in (1.4). These conventions allow us to con- clude that Theorem 1.6 is valid not only when c is between a and b but for any arrangement of the points a, b, c. Theorem 1.6 is sometimes written in the form) J: sex) dx + t sex) dx + J: sex) dx = 0 \\302\\267) Similarly, we can extend the range of validity of Theorem 1.8 and allow the constant k to be negative.

We shall referto this as the reflection property of the integral, since the graph of the function t given by t(x) = s( -x) is obtained from that of s by reflection through the y-axis. An example is shown in Figure 1.29.) 1.14 Other notations for integrals The letter x that appears in the symbol S\\037sex) dx plays no essential role in the definition of the integral. Any other letter would serve equally well. The letters t, u, v, z are frequently used for this purpose, and it is agreed that instead of S\\037sex) dx we may write S\\037set) dt, S\\037s(u) du, etc., all these being consideredas alternative notations for the same thing. The symbols x, t, u, etc. that are used in this way are called \\\"dummy variables.\\\" They are analogous to dummy indicesusedin the summation notation. There is a tendency among some authors of calculus textbooks to omit the dummy variable -and the d-symbol altogether and to write simply S\\037s for the integral. One good reason for using this abbreviated symbol is that it suggests more strongly that the integral depends only on the function s and on the interval [a, b]. Also, certain formulas appear simpler in this notation. For example, the additive property becomes S\\037(s + t) = S\\037s + S\\037t. On the other hand, it becomes awkward to write formulas like Theorems 1.7 and 1.8 in the abbreviated notation. More important than this, we shall find later that the))) 70) The concepts of integral calculus) original Leibniz notation has certain practical advantages.

In this section we shall formulate a definition of S\\037,f(x) dx that will apply to more general functions f The definition will be constructed so that the resulting integral has all the properties listed in Section 1.13.) / t, approximation from above /1 ________/s, approximation from below) a) b) FIGURE 1.30 Approximating a function f from above and below by step functions.) The approach will be patterned somewhat after the method of Archimedes, which was explained above in Section I 1.3. The idea is simply this: We begin by approximating the function f from below and from above by step functions, as suggested in Figure 1.30. That is, we choose an arbitrary step function, say s, whose graph lies below that off, and a arbitrary step function, say t, whose graph lies above that of f. Next, we consider the collectionof all the numbers S\\037sex) dx and S\\037 t(x) dx obtained by choosing sand t in all possible ways. In general, we have) J: s(x) dx < J: t(x) dx) because of the comparison theorem. If the integral offis to obey the comparison theorem, then it must be a number which falls between S\\037sex) dx and S\\037t(x) dx for every pair of approximating functions sand t. If there is only one number which has this property we define the integral of fto be this number. There is only one thing that can cause trouble in this procedure, and it occurs in the very first step. Unfortunately, it is not possible to approximate every function from above and from below by step functions. For example, the function f given by the equations) 1 I(x) = - x) if x \\302\\245=0 ,) 1(0) = 0 ,))) The integral of more general functions) 73) is defined for all real x, but on any interval [a, b] containing the origin we cannot surround f by step functions. This is due to the fact that fhas arbitrarily large values near the origin or, as we say,fis unbounded in every neighborhood of the origin (see Figure 1.31).There- fore, we shall first restrict ourselves to those functions that are bounded on [a, b], that is, to those functions f for which there exists a number M > 0 such that) ( 1.5)) -M < f(x) < M) for every x in [a, b]. Geometrically,the graph of such a function lies between the graphs of two constant step functions sand t having the values - M and + M, respectively.

In a case like this, we say that f is bounded by M. The two inequalities in ( 1.5) can also be wri tten as) I f(x) I < M.) With this point taken care of, we can proceed to carry out the plan described above and to formulate the definition of the integral.) DEFINITION OF THE INTEGRAL OF A BOUNDED FUNCTION. Let f be a function defined and bounded on [a, b]. Let sand t denote arbitrary step functions defined on [a, b] such that) (1.6)) sex) < f(x) < t(x)) for every x in [a, b]. If there is one and only one number I such that) ( 1. 7)) I: s(x) dx < I < I: t(x) dx) for every pair of step functions sand t satisfying (1.6), then this number I is called the integral of f from a to b, and is denotedby the symbol S\\037f(x) dx or by S\\037f When such an I exists, the function f is said to be integrable on [a, b].))) 74) The concepts of integral calculus) If a < b, we define Sgf(x) dx = - S\\037f(x) dx, provided f is integrable on [a, b]. We also define S\\037f(x) dx = O. If f is integrable on [a, b], we say that the integral S\\037f(x) dx exists. The function f is called the integrand, the numbers a and b are called the limits of integration, and the interval [a, b] the interval of integration.) 1.17 Upper and lower integrals Assume f is bounded on [a, b]. If sand t are step functions satisfying (1.6), we say s is below f, and t is abovef, and we write s < f < t. Let S denote the set of all numbers S\\037s(x) dx obtained as s runs through all step functions below f, and let T be the set of all numbers S\\037t(x) dx obtained as t runs through all step functions above f That is, let) s = {J: s(x)dxl s < f},) T= {J: t(x) dx If < t} \\302\\267) Both sets S and Tare nonempty sincefis bounded. Also, S\\037s(x) dx < S\\037t(x) dx if s < f < t, so every number in S is less than every number in T. Therefore, by Theorem 1.34, S has a supremum, and T has an infimum, and they satisfy the inequalities) J: sex)dx < sup S < inf T < J: t(x) dx) for all sand t satisfying s < f < t. This shows that both numbers sup Sand inf T satisfy (1.7). Therefore,fis integrable on [a, b] if and only if sup S = inf T, in which case we have) J: f(x) dx = sup S = inf T \\302\\267) The number sup S is called the lower integral off and is denoted by [(f). The number inf T is called the upper integral off and is denoted by l(f). Thus, we have) l(f) = sup {J: sex)dxI s < f} ,) j(f) = inf {J: t(x) dx If < t} \\302\\267) The foregoing argument proves the following theorem.) THEOREM 1.9. Every function f which is bounded on [a, b] has a lower integral [(f) and an upper integrall(f) satisfying the inequalities) J: sex) dx < l(f) < j(f) < J: t(x) dx) for all step functions sand t with s < f < t. The function f is integrable on [a, b] if and only if its upper and lower integrals are equal, in which case we have) J: f(x) dx = l(f) = j(f) \\302\\267))) Informal remarks on the theory and technique of integration) 75) 1.18 The area of an ordinate set expressed as an integral The conceptof area was introduced axiomatically in Section 1.6 as a set function having certain properties. From these properties we proved that the area of the ordinate set of a nonnegative step function is equal to the integral of the function. Now we show that the same is true for any integrable nonnegative function. We recall that the ordinate set of a nonnegative function f over an interval [a, b] is the set of all points (x, y) satisfying the inequalities 0 < y \\037f(x), a < x < b.) THEOREM 1.10. Let f be a nonnegative function, integrable on an interval [a, b], and let Q denote the ordinate set of f over [a, b]. Then Q is measurable and its area is equal to the integral S:f(x) dx. Proof Let Sand T be two step regions satisfying S c Q c T. Then there are two step functions sand t satisfying s < f < t on [a, b], such that) a(S) = J: s(x) dx) and) a(T) = J: t(x) dx \\302\\267) Since f is integrable on [a, b], the number I = S:f(x) dx is the only number satisfying the inequalities) J: s(x)dx < I \\037 J: t(x) dx) for all step functions sand t with s < f < t. Thereforethis is also the only number satisfying a(S) < I < a(T) for all step regionsSand Twith S c Q c T. By the exhaustion property, this proves that Q is measurable and that a(Q) = I.) Let Q denote the ordinate set of Theorem 1.10, and let Q' denote tge set that remains if we remove from Q those points on the graph off That is, let) Q' = {(x,y) I a < x < b, 0 < y <f(x)}.) The argument used to prove Theorem 1.10also shows that Q' is measurable and that a(Q') = a(Q). Therefore, by the difference property of area, the set Q - Q'is measurable and) a(Q - Q') = a(Q) - a(Q') = o.) In other words, we have proved the following theorem.) THEOREM 1.11. Let f be a nonnegative function, integrable on an interval [a, b]. Then the graph off, that is, the set {(x, y) I a < x < b, Y = f(x)} ,) is measurable and has area equal to O.) 1.19 Informal remarks on the theory and technique of integration Two fundamental questions arise at this stage: (1) Which bounded functions are integrable? (2) Given that a function f is integrable, how do we compute the integral off?))) 76) The concepts of integral calculus) The first question comes under the heading \\\"Theory of Integration\\\" and the second under the heading \\\"Technique of Integration.\\\" A complete answer to question (1)lies beyond the scope of an introductory course and will not be given in this book. Instead, we shall give partial answers which require only elementary ideas. First we introduce an important class of functions known as monotonic functions. In the following section we define these functions and give a number of examples. Then we prove that all bounded monotonic functions are integrable. Fortunately, most of the functions that occur in practice are monotonic or sums of monotonic functions, so the results of this miniature theory of integration are quite comprehensive. The discussion of \\\"Technique of Integration\\\" begins in Section 1.23, where we calculate the integral S\\037x P dx, when p is a positiveinteger. Then we develop general properties of the integral, such as linearity and additivity, and show how these properties help us to extend our knowledge of integrals of specific functions.) 1.20 Monotonic and piecewise monotonic functions. Definitions and examples A functionfis said to be increasing on a set S if f(x) < fey) for every pair of points x and y in S with x < y. If the strict inequality f(x) <fey) holds for all x < y in S, the function is said to be strictly increasing on S. Similarly, f is called decreasingon S if) .) /l I I I I I I , b) \\037 . a) . b) \\037 .)

If f(x) > fey) for all x < y in S, then f is called strictly decreasing on S. A function is called monotonic on S if it is increasing on S or if it is de- creasing on S. The term strictly monotonic means that f is strictly increasing on S or strictly decreasing on S. Ordinarily, the set S under considerationis either an open interval or a closedinterval. Examples are shown in Figure 1.33.) FIGURE 1.34 A piecewise monotonic function.))) Integrability of bounded monotonic functions) 77) A function f is said to be piecewise monotonic on an interval if its graph consists of a finite number of monotonic pieces. That is to say,f is piecewise monotonic on [a, b] if there is a partition P of [a, b] such that f is monotonic on each of the open subintervals of P. In particular, step functions are piecewise monotonic, as are all the examplesshown in Figures 1.33 and 1.34.) EXAMPLE 1. The power functions. If p is a positive integer, we have the inequality) x P < yP) if 0 < x < Y ,) which is easily proved by mathematical induction. This shows that the power function f, defined for all real x by the equation f(x) = x P , is strictly increasing on the nonnegative real axis. It is also strictly monotonic on the negative real axis (it is decreasing if p is even and increasingif p is odd). Therefore, f is piecewise monotonic on every finite interval.) EXAMPLE 2. The square-root function. Let f(x) = \\037 for x > O. This function is strictly increasing on the nonnegative real axis. In fact, if 0 < x < y, we have) y-x 0-0= 0 0 ; y+ x) hence, v(Y - \\037 > O.) EXAMPLE 3. The graph of the function g defined by the equation) g(x) = Vr 2 - x 2) if -r < x < r) is a semicircle of radius r. This function is strictly increasing on the interval -r < x < 0 and strictly decreasing on the interval 0 < x < r. Hence, g is piecewise monotonic on [-r,r].) 1.21 Integrability of bounded monotonic functions The importance of monotonic functions in integration theory is due to the following theorem.) THEOREM 1.12. If f is monotonic on a closed interval [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].) Proof We shall prove the theorem for increasing functions. The proof for decreasing functions is analogous. Assume f is increasing and let !(f) and l(f) denote its lower and upper integrals, respectively . We shall prove that !(f) = j(f). Let n be a positive integer and construct two specialapproximating step functions Sn and t n as follows: Let P = {xo,Xl' . . ., x n } be a partition of [a, b] into n equal subintervals, that is, subintervals [X k- l , xk ] with Xk - Xk-l = (b - a)/n for each k. Now define Sn and t n by the formulas) sn(X) = f(x k - l) ,) tn(X) = f(x k)) if Xk- l < x < X k .))) 78) The concepts of integral calculus) At the subdivision points, define Sn and t n so as to preserve the relations sn(x) < f(x) < tn(x) throughout [a, b]. An example is shown in Figure 1.35(a). For this choice of step functions, we have) i b i b n n t n - Sn = 2,!(X k )(X k - X k- 1) - 2,!(X k - 1)(Xk - X k- 1) a a k=l k=l = b - a! (f(Xk) _ f(Xk-l)] = (b - a)(f(b)- f(a)], n k=l n) where the last equation is a consequenceof the telescoping property of finite sums. This last relation has a simple geometric interpretation. The difference S\\037t n - S\\037Sn is equal to the sum of the areas of the shaded rectangles in Figure 1.35(a). By sliding these rectanglesto the right so that they rest on a common base as in Figure 1.35(b), we see that they fill out a) a = Xo Xl X2) X n = b) T f(b) - f(a) \\037) \\037 \\\"' b - a) (a)) (b)) n) FIGURE 1.35 Proof of integrability of an increasing function.) rectangle of base (b - a)fn and altitude f(b) - f(a); the sum of the areas is therefore Cfn, whereC = (b - a)[f(b) -f(a)]. Now we rewrite the foregoing relation in the form) (1.8)) i b i b C t n - Sn = - \\302\\267 a a n) The lower and upper integrals off satisfy the inequalities) f: Sn < [(1) s f: t n) and) f b - f b a Sn < 1(f) \\037 a tn') Multiplying the first set of inequalities by (-1) and adding the result to the second set, we obtain) 1(1) - [(1) < f: t n - f: Sn \\302\\267 Using (1.8) and the relation l(f) < j(f), we obtain o S 1(1) - [(1)< C n))) Calculation of the integral S\\037 x P dx when p is a positive integer) 79) for every integer n > 1. Therefore, by Theorem 1.31, we must have [(f) = i(f). This proves thatfis integrable on [a, b].) 1.22 Calculation of the integral of a bounded monotonic function The proof of Theorem 1.12not only shows that the integral of a bounded increasing function exists, but it also suggests a method for computing the value of the integral.This is described by the following theorem.) THEOREM 1.13. Assume fis increasing on a closedinterval [a, b]. Let X k = a + k(b - a)/n for k = 0, 1, . . . , n. If I is any number which satisfies the inequalities) (1.9)) b n-l b n : a 2/(X k ) < I < : a L/(X k) k=O k=l) for every integer n > 1, then I = S:f(x) dx.) Proof Let Sn and t n be the special approximating step functions obtained by subdivision of the interval [a, b] into n equal parts, as described in the proof of Theorem 1.12. Then, inequalities (1.9) state that) r Sn < I < r t n) for every n > 1. But the integral S: f(x) dx satisfies the same inequalities as I. Using Equation (1.8)we see that) J b C o < I - !(x) dx < - a n) for every integer n > 1. Therefore, by Theorem 1.31, we have 1= S:f(x) dx,as asserted. An analogous argument gives a proof of the corresponding theorem for decreasing functions.) THEOREM 1.14. Assume f is decreasing on [a, b]. Let x k = a + k(b - a)/n for k = 0, 1, . . . , n. If I is any number which satisfies the inequalities) b : a \\037/(Xk) < I < b : a \\037f(Xk) k=l k=O) for every integer n > 1, then I = S: f(x) dx.) 1.23 Calculation of the integral S\\037x P dx when p is a positive integer To illustrate the use of Theorem 1.13 we shall calculate the integral S\\037x P dx where b > 0 and p is any positive integer. The integral exists because the integrand is bounded and increasingon [0, b].))) 80) The concepts of integral calculus) THEOREM 1.15. If P is a positive integer and b > 0, we have) l b bP+1 x P dx = . o p + 1) Proof We begin with the inequalities) n-1 p+1 n 2>1> < n < 2 p k=l P + 1 k=l) valid for every integer n > 1 and every integer p > 1. These inequalities may be easily proved by mathematical induction. (A proof is outlined in Exercise 13 of Section I 4.10.) Multiplication of these inequalities by b P + 1/n P+1 gives us) b \\037 ( kb ) 1> < b1>H <!? \\037 ( kb ) P . n L n p+l n L n k=1 k=l) If we let f(x) = xP and Xk = kb/n, for k = 0, 1,2, . . ., n, these inequalities become) b n-1 bP + 1 b n n 2 f (xk ) < 1 < n 2 f (xk ) \\302\\267 k=O P + k=l) Therefore, the inequalities (1.9) of Theorem 1.13are satisfied with f(x) = x P , a = 0, and I = b P + 1/(p + 1). It follows that Sg x P dx = b P + 1/(p + 1).) 1.24 The basic properties of the integral From the definition of the integral, it is possible to deducethe following properties. Proofs are given in Section 1.27.) THEOREM 1.16. LINEARITY WITH RESPECT TO THE INTEGRAND. If both f and g are in- tegrable on [a, b], so is c1f + c2g for every pair of constantsC 1 and c2 . Furthermore, we have) f [cd(x) + c2 g(x)] dx = C1 f f(x) dx + C 2 f g(x) dx \\302\\267) Note: By use of mathematical induction, the linearity property can be generalizedas follows: If 11 , . . . , In are integrable on [a, b], then sojs c1f1 + . . . + cnfn for all real c1, . . ., c n , and) (b n n (b L \\\"2 ckfk(X) dx = \\\"2 C k JI1 fk(X) dx . a k=l k=l a) THEOREM 1.17.

THEOREM 1.18. INVARIANCE UNDER TRANSLATION. If f is integrable on [a, b], then for every real c we have) f b l b+ c f(x) dx = f(x - c)dx. a a+c) THEOREM 1.19. EXPANSION OR CONTRACTION OF THE INTERVAL OF INTEGRATION. If f is integrable on [a, b], then for every real k \\037 0 we have) i b 1 i kb ( x ) f(x) dx = - f - dx. a k ka k) Note: In both Theorems 1.18 and 1.19,the existence of one of the integrals implies the existence of the other. When k = -1, Theorem1.19is calIed the reflection property.) THEOREM 1.20. COMPARISON THEOREM. If both f and g are integrable on [a, b] and if g(x) < f(x)for every x in [a, b], then we have) f g(x) dx < f f(x) dx \\302\\267) An important special case of Theorem 1.20occurswhen g(x) = 0 for every x. In this case, the theorem states that if f(x) > 0 everywhere on [a, b], then S:f(x) dx > O. In other words, a nonnegative function has a nonnegative integral. It can also be shown that if we have the strict inequality g(x) < f(x) for all x in [a, b], then the same strict inequality holds for the integrals, but the proof is not easy to give at this stage. In Chapter 5 we shall discuss various methods for calculating the value of an integral without the necessity of using the definition in each case. These methods, however,are applicable to only a relatively small number of functions, and for most integrable functions the actual numerical value of the integral can only be estimated. This is usually done by approximating the integrand above and belowby step functions or by other simple functions whose integrals can be evaluated exactly. Then the comparison theorem is used to obtain corresponding approximations for the integral of the function in question. This idea will be explored more fully in Chapter 7.) 1.25 Integration of polynomials In Section 1.23we established the integration formula) (1.10)) i b bP+l x P dx = o p + 1) for b > 0 and p any positive integer. The formula is also valid if b = 0, sinceboth members))) 82) The concepts of integral calculus) are zero. We can use Theorem 1.19to show that (1.10) also holds for negativeb. We simply take k = -1 in Theorem 1.19 to obtain) i - b i b i b ( b)1'+1 x1'dx = - (-x)1'dx= (_1)1'+1x1'dx = - , o 0 0 p + 1) which shows that (1.10) holds for negative b. The additive property S\\037x 1' dx = Sg x 1'dx - Sg x P dx now leads to the more general formula) i b b1'+1 - a1'+1 x1'dx = , a p + 1) valid for all real a and b, and any integer p > O. Sometimesthe special symbol) P(x) I:) is used to designate the difference P(b) - Pea). Thus the foregoing formula may also be written as follows:) f b X1'+1 b b 1'+ 1 - a1'+1 x1'dx = = . a p+1a p+l) This formula, along with the linearity property, enables us to integrate every polynomial. For example, to compute the integral S\\037(X2 - 3x + 5) dx, we find the integral of each term and then add the results. Thus, we have) i 3 i 3 i 3 i 3 X3 3 x 2 3 3 (x 2 - 3x + 5) dx = x 2 dx - 3 x dx + 5 dx = - - 3 - + 5x 1 1 1 1 31 21 1) = 33 - 1 3 _ 3 32 - 1 2 + 5 31 - 11= 26_ 12+ 10 = 20 . 3 2 1 3 3) More generally, to compute the integral of any polynomial we integrate term by term:) f b n n f b n b k+1 k+1 '\\\" Ckx k dx = L C k Xk dx = L C k - a \\302\\267 a \\037 a k + 1 k=O k=O k=O) We can also integrate more complicated functions formed by piecing together various polynomials. For example,considerthe integral S\\037Ix(2x - 1)1dx. Becauseof the absolute- value signs, the integrand is not a polynomial. However, by considering the sign of))) Exercises) 83) x(2x - 1),we can split the interval [0, 1] into two subintervals, in each of which the inte- grand is a polynomial. As x varies from 0 to 1, the product x(2x - 1) changes sign at the point x = !; it is negative if 0 < x < ! and positive if ! < x < 1. Therefore, we use the additive property to write) 1 1 1 1/2 J l Ix(2x - 1)1dx = - x(2x - 1) dx + x(2x- 1)dx o 0 1/2) 1 1/2 J,1 = (x - 2X2) dx + (2x 2 - x) dx o 1/2) = (t - i1 2) + (l-2 - i) = 1 .) 1.26 Exercises) Compute each of the following integrals.) 1.

We make repeated use of the fact that every function f which is bounded on an interval [a, b] has a lower integral [(f) and an upper integral l(f) given by) !(f) = sup (f 8 I 8 < f} ,) leg) = inf (f t 1/ < t} ,) where sand t denote arbitrary step functions below and above f, respectively. We know, by Theorem 1.9, thatfis integrable if and only if [(f) = 1(/), in which case the value of the integral off is the common value of the upper and lower integrals.) Proof of the Linearity Property (Theorem1.16).We decompose the linearity property into tw 0 parts:) (B)) f (f + g) = f / + f g, f cf = c f f \\302\\267) (A)) To prove (A), let I(f) = S\\037fand let I(g) = S\\037g. We shall prove that [(f + g) = 1(1+ g) = I(f)+ I(g). Let Sl and S2 denote arbitrary step functions below f and g, respectively. Sincef and g are integrable, we have) 1(1) = sup (f 81 181 < /},) leg)= sup (f 8 2 I 82 \\037 g} .))) Proofs of the basic properties of the integral) 85) By the additive property of the supremum (Theorem 1.33), we also have) (1.11)) 1(f) + l(g) = sup (f Sl + f S2 I Sl < f, S2 < g} .) But if S1 < f and S2 < g, then the sum s = S1 + S2 is a step function below f + g, and we have) f Sl + f S2 = f S < f(f + g) .) Therefore, the number /(f + g) is an upper bound for the set appearing on the right of (1.11). This upper bound cannot be less than the least upper bound of the set, so we have) (1.12)) l(f) + leg) < /(f + g) .) Similarly, if we use the relations) 1(f) = inf (f t 1 If < t 1 } ,) l(g) = inf (f t 2 I g < t 2} ,) where 11 and t 2 denote arbitrary step functions above f and g, respectively, we obtain the inequality) (1.13)) l(f + g) < l(f) + leg) .) Inequalities (1.12) and (1.13) together show that/(f + g) = j(f + g) = I(f) + l(g). There- fore f + g is integrable and relation (A) holds. Relation (B) is trivial if c = O. If c > 0, we note that every step function S1 below cfis of the form S1= cs,where s is a step function below f Similarly, every step function 11 above cfis of the form t 1 = ct, where 1 is a step function above f Therefore we have) f(ef) = sup {f sll Sl < ef} = sup (e f S Is < f} = cJ(f)) and) i(ef) = inf(f t 1 1 ef < t 1} = inf(e f t If < t} = cI(f).) Therefore [(cf) = j(cf) = cl(f). Here we have used the following properties of the supremum and infimum:) (1.14) sup {cx I x E A} = c sup {x I x E A} ,) inf {cx I x E A} = c inf {x I x E A} ,) which hold if c > O. This proves (B) if c > O. If c < 0, the proof of (B) is basically the same,except that every step function S1below cf is of the form S1 = ct, where 1 is a step function above f, and every step function 11 above cfis of the form 11 = cs, where s is a step function below f Also, instead of (1.14)we use the relations) sup {cx I x EA} = cinf{x I x EA},) inf {cx I x E A} = c sup {xI x E A} ,))) 86) The concepts of integral calculus) which hold if c < O. We now have) !(c/) = sup {f sll Sl < c/} = sup {cf t 1/ < t} = cinf{f t 1/ < t} = cI(f).) Similarly, we find i(cf) = cI(f). Therefore(B)holds for all real c.) Proof of Additivity with Respect to the Interval of Integration (Theorem 1.17). Suppose that a < b < c,and assume that the two integrals S:f and Sg f exist. Let l(f) and i(f) denote the upper and lower integrals off over the interval [a, c]. We shall prove that) ( 1.15)) !(f) = i(f) = f 1 + t 1\\302\\267) If s is any step function below f on [a, c], we have) [ c S = f b S + J. c s ..a a b) Conversely, if SI and S2are step functions below f on [a, b] and on [b,c], respectively, then the function s which is equal to SI on [a, b) and equal to S2 on [b, c] is a step function below f on [a, c] for which we have) [C S = f b SI + J. c S2. \\037a a b) Therefore, by the additive property of the supremum (Theorem 1.33), we have) !(f) = sup {f S 1 S < I} = sup {f Sl 1 Sl < I} + sup {t S21S2 < I} = f 1 + t 1\\302\\267) Similarly, we find) i(f) = f 1 + t 1 ,) which proves (1.15) when a < b < c. The proof is similar for any other arrangement of the points a, b, c.) Proof of the Translation Property (Theorem1.18). Let g be the function defined on the interval [a + c, b + c] by the equation g(x) = I(x - c). Let leg) and i(g) denote the lower and upper integrals of g on the interval [a + c, b + c]. We shall prove that) ( 1.16)) !(g) = I(g) = f I(x) dx \\302\\267) Let s be any step function below g on the interval [a + c, b + c]. Then the function SI defined on [a, b] by the equation SI(X) = s(x + c) is a step function below f on [a, b]. Moreover, every step function SI below I on [a,b] has this form for some s belowg. Also, by the translation property for integrals of stepfunctions, we have) f b+C f b i b sex) dx = sex + c) dx = SI(X) dx . a+c a a))) Proofs of the basic properties of the integral) 87) Therefore we have) leg) = sup {L:cC S I S < g} = sup {t Sl I Sl < f} = t f(x) dx \\302\\267 Similarly, we find leg) = S: f(x) dx, which proves (1.16).) Proof of the Expansion Property (Theorem 1.19). Assume k > 0 and define g on the interval [ka, kb] by the equation g(x) = f(x/k). Let l(g) and i(g) denote the lower and upper integrals of g on [ka, kb]. We shall prove that) (1.1 7)) leg) = leg)= k f f(x) dx \\302\\267) Let s be any step function below g on [ka, kb]. Then the function Sl defined on [a, b] by the equation Sl(X) = s(kx) is a step function below f on [a, b]. Moreover, every step function Sl below f on [a, b] has this form. Also, by the expansion property for integrals of step functions, we have) f. kb J b J b s(x) dx = k s(kx) dx = k Sl(X) dx . ka a a) Therefore we have) leg) = sup {t b S Is < g} = sup {kf sll Sl < f} = k f f(x) dx \\302\\267 Similarly, we find i(g) = kS:f(x) dx, which proves (1.17) if k > O. The same type of proof can be usedif k < O.) Proof of the Comparison Theorem (Theorem1.20). Assume g < f on the interval [a, b]. Let s be any step function below g, and let t be any step function above f Then we have S\\037s < S\\037t, and hence Theorem 1.34 gives us) f g = sup {f S I S < g} < inf {f t If < t} = f f \\302\\267) This proves that S: g < S\\037f, as required.))) 2) SOME APPLICATIONS OF INTEGRATION) 2.1 Introduction In Section 1.18 we expressed the area of the ordinate set of a nonnegative function as an integral. In this chapter we will show that areas of more general regions can also be expressed as integrals. We will also discuss further applications of the integral to concepts such as volume, work, and averages. Then, at the end of the chapter, we will study properties of functions defined by integrals.) 2.2 The area of a region between two graphs expressed as an integral If two functions f and g are related by the inequality f(x) < g(x) for all x in an interval [a, b], we write f < g on [a, b]. Figure 2.1 shows two examples. Iff < g on [a,b], the set S consisting of all points (x,y) satisfying the inequalities) f(x) < y < g(x),) a < x < b,) is called the region between the graphs off and g. The following theorem tells us how to express the area of S as an integral.) a) b) a) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 2.1 The area of a region between two graphs expressed as an integral: a(S) = J: [g(x) - I(x)] dx.) 88))) Worked examples) 89) THEOREM 2.1. Assume f and g are integrable and satisfy f < g on [a, b]. Then the region S between their graphs is measurable and its area a(S) is given by the integral) (2.1 )) a(S) = I: [g(x) - f(x)]dx \\302\\267) Proof Assume first that f and g are nonnegative, as shown in Figure 2.1(a). Let F and G denote the following sets:) F = {(x,y)I a < x < b, 0 < y <f(x)},) G = {(x, y) I a < x < b, 0 < Y < g(x)} .) That is, G is the ordinate set of g, and F is the ordinate set off, minus the graph off The region S between the graphs off and g is the differenceS = G - F. By Theorems 1.10and 1.11,both F and G are measurable. Since F c G, the difference S = G - F is also measurable, and we have) a(S) = a(G) - a(F) = I: g(x) dx - I: f(x) dx = f: [g(x) - f(x)] dx .) This proves (2.1) when f and g are nonnegative. Now consider the general case wheref < g on [a, b], but f and g are not necessarily nonnegative. An example is shown in Figure 2.1(b). We can reduce th'is to the previous case by sliding the region upward until it lies above the x-axis. That is, we choose a positive number c large enough to ensure that 0 < f(x) + c < g(x) + c for all x in [a, b]. By what we have already proved, the new region T between the graphs of f + c and g + c is measurable, and its area is given by the integral) aCT) = I: [(g(x)+ c) - (f(x) + c)] dx = I: [g(x) - f(x)] dx \\302\\267) But T is congruent to S; so S is also measurable and we have) a(S) = aCT) = I: [g(x)- f(x)] dx .) This completes the proof.) 2.3 Worked examples EXAMPLE 1. Compute the area of the region S between the graphs of f and g over the interval [0, 2] if f(x) = x(x - 2) and g(x) = x/2.) Solution. The two graphs are shown in Figure 2.2. The shaded portion represents S. Since f < g over the interval [0, 2], we use Theorem 2.1 to write) } 2 } 2 ( 5 ) 5 2 2 23 7 a(S) = [g(x) - f(x)]dx= - x - x 2 dx = - - - - = - . o 02 22 3 3))) 90) Some applications of integration) x g(x) = 2 \\\\) f(x) = x 2 - 2x) FIGURE 2.2 Example 1.) x) FIGURE 2.3 Example 2.) EXAMPLE 2. Compute the area of the region S between the graphs of f and g over the interval [-1, 2] if f(x) = x and g(x) = x 3 /4.) Solution. The region S is shown in Figure 2.3. Here we do not have f < g throughout the interval [-1, 2]. However, we do have f < g over the subinterval [-1, 0] and g < f over the subinterval [0, 2]. Applying Theorem 2.1 to each subinterval, we have) a(S) = fl[g(X) - f(x)] dx + f: [f(x) - g(x)] dx) = fl( \\0373 - x) dx + f(x - \\0373) dx) 1 (_1)4 (_1)2 2 2 12 4 23--- + + ------- - . 4 4 2 2 4 4 16) In examples like this one, where the interval [a, b] can be broken up into a finite number of subintervals such that either f < g or g < fin each subinterval, formula (2.1) of Theorem 2.1 becomes) a(S) = I: Ig(x) - f(x)1dx \\302\\267) EXAMPLE 3. Area of a circular disk. A circular disk of radius r is the set of all points inside or on the boundary of a circle of radius r. Such a disk is congruent to the region))) Worked examples) 91) between the graphs of the two functions f and g defined on the interval [-r, r] by the formulas) and) f(x) = -Vr 2 - x 2 .) g(x) = V r 2 - x 2) Each function is bounded and piecewise monotonic so each is integrable on [-r, r]. Theorem 2.1 tells us that the region between their graphs is measurable and that its area is S\\037r [g(x) - f(x)) dx. Let A(r) denote the area of the disk. We will prove that) A(r) = r 2 A(I) .) That is, the area of a diskof radius r is r 2 times the area of a unit disk (a disk of radius 1). Since g(x) - f(x) = 2g(x), Theorem 2.1 gives us) A(r) = t r 2g(x) dx = 2 t r V r 2 - x2 dx .) In particular, when r = 1, we have the formula) A(1) = 2 fl V1 - x 2 dx.) Now we change the scale on the x-axis, using Theorem 1.19 with k = l/r, to obtain) A(r) = 2 t r g(x) dx = 2r fl g(rx) dx = 2rfl V r 2 - (rx)2 dx = 2r 2 fl V 1 - x 2 dx = r 2 A(t) .) This proves that A(r) = r 2 A(I), as asserted.) DEFINITION. We define the number 7T to be the area of a unit disk.) The formula just proved states that A(r) = 7Tr 2 . The foregoing example illustrates the behavior of area under expansion or contraction of plane regions. SupposeS is a given set of points in the plane and consider a new set of points obtained by multiplying the coordinates of each point of S by a constant factor k > O. We denote this set by kS and say that it is similar to S. The processwhich produces kS from S is called a similarity transformation. Each point is moved along a straight line which passes through the origin to k times its original distance from the origin. If k > 1, the transformation is also called a stretching or an expansion (from the origin) and, if o < k < 1,it is called a shrinking or a contraction (toward the origin). For example, if S is the region bounded by a unit circle with center at the origin, then kS is a concentric circular region of radius k. In Example 3 we showed that for circular regions, the area of kS is k 2 times the area of S. Now we prove that this property of area holds for any ordinate set.))) 92) Some applications of integration) EXAMPLE 4. Behavior of the area of an ordinate set under a similarity transformation. Let f be nonnegative and integrable on [a, b] and let S be its ordinate set. An example is shown in Figure 2.4(a). If we apply a similarity transformation with a positive factor k, then kS is the ordinate set of a new function, say g, over the interval [ka, kb]. [SeeFigure 2.4(b).] A point (x, )l) is on the graph of g if and only if the point (x/k, y/k) is on the graph off Hence y/k = f(x/k), soY = kf(x/k). In other words, the new function g is related to f by the formula) g(x) = kf(xJk)) kb)a) b) ka) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 2.4 The area of kS is k 2 times that of S.) for each x in [ka, kb]. Therefore, the area of kS is given by) f kb f kb J b a(kS) = g(x) dx = k f(x/k) dx = k 2 f(x) dx , \\037 h a) where in the last step we usedthe expansion property for integrals (Theorem 1.19). Since S\\037f(x) dx = a(S), this proves that a(kS) = k 2 a(S). In other words, the area of kSis k 2 times that of S.) EXAMPLE 5. Calculation of the integral S\\037X 1/ 2 dx. The integral for area is a two-edged sword. Although we ordinarily use the integral to calculate areas,sometimes we can use our knowledge of area to calculate integrals. We illustrate by computing the value of the integral S\\037X 1/ 2 dx, where a > O. (The integral exists since the integrand is increasing and bounded on [0,aJ.) Figure 2.5 shows the graph of the function f given by f(x) = X 1/ 2 over the interval [0, a]. Its ordinate set S has an area given by) a(S) = f: X 1/ 2 dx .) Now we compute this area another way. We simply observe that in Figure 2.5 the region S and the shaded region T together fill out a rectangle of base a and altitude a 1/ 2 . Therefore, a(S) + a(T) = a3 / 2 , so we have) a(S) = a3 / 2 - a(T) .)))

The foregoing argument can also be used to compute the integral S\\037xl/n dx, if n is a positiveinteger. We state the result as a theorem.) THEOREM 2.2.

Use an argument similar to that in Example 5 of Section 2.3 to prove Theorem2.2.) 2.5 The trigonometric functions Before we introduce further applications of integration, we will digress briefly to discuss the trigonometric functions. We assume that the reader has some knowledge of the properties of the six trigonometric functions, sine, cosine,tangent, cotangent, secant, and cosecant; and their inverses, arc sine, arc cosine,arc tangent, etc. These functions are discussed in elementary trigonometry courses in connection with various problems involving the sides and angles of triangles.))) The trigonometric functions) 95) The trigonometric functions are important in calculus, not so much because of their relation to the sides and angles of a triangle, but rather because of the properties they possess as functions. The six trigonometric functions have in common an important property known as periodicity. A functionfis said to beperiodic with period p \\037 0 if its domain contains x + p whenever it contains x and if f(x + p) = f(x) for every x in the domain off The sine and cosine functions are periodic with period 21T, where 1T is the area of a unit circular disk. Many problems in physics and engineering deal with periodic phenomena (such as vibrations, planetary and wave motion) and the sine and cosinefunctions form the basis for the mathematical analysisof such problems. The sine and cosine functions can be introduced in many different ways. For example, there are geometric definitions which relate the sine and cosine functions to angles, and there are analytic definitions which introduce these functions without any reference whatever to geometry. All these methods are equivalent, in the sense that they all lead to the same functions. Ordinarily, when we work with the sine and cosine we are not concerned so much with their definitions as we are with the properties that can be deduced from the definitions. Some of these properties, which are of importance in calculus, are listed below. As usual, we denote the values of the sine and cosine functions at x by sin x, cos x, respectively.) FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THE SINE AND COSINE.) 1. Domain of definition. The sine and cosine functions are definedeverywhere on the real line.) 2. Special values. We have cos 0 = sin !1T= 1,cos1T = -1. 3. Cosineof a difference. For all x and y, \\037vehave) (2.3)) cos (y - x) = COS}' cos x + sin y sin x .) 4. Fundamental inequalities. For 0 < x < !1T,we have) (2.4 )) sIn x 1 o < cos x < - < x cos x) From these four properties we can deduceall the properties of the sine and cosinethat are of importance in calculus. This suggests that we might introduce the trigonometric functions axiomatically. That is, we could take properties 1 through 4 as axioms about the sine and cosineand deduceall further properties as theorems. To make certain we are not discussing an empty theory, it is necessary to show that there are functions satisfying the above properties. We shall by-pass this problem for the moment. First we assume that functions exist which satisfy these fundamental properties and show how further properties can then be deduced. Then, in Section 2.7, we indicate a geometricmethod of defining the sine and cosineso as to obtain functions with the desired properties. In Chapter 11we also outline an analytic method for defining the sine and cosine.))) 96) Some applicationsof integration) THEOREM 2.3. If t\\037vo functions sin and cos satisfy properties 1 through 4, then they also satisfy the following properties: (a) Pythagorean identity. sin 2 x + cos 2 x = 1 for all x. (b) Special values. sin 0 = cas !17= sin 17 = O. (c) Even and oddproperties. The cosine is an even function and the sine is an oddfunction. That is, for all x we have) cas (-x) = cas x,) sin (-x) = -sin x .) Cd) Co-relations. For all x, we have) sin (!1T + x) = cas x,) cos (i17 + x) = -sin x.) (e) Periodicity. For all x, we have sin (x + 217) = sin x, cas (x + 217) = cas x. (f) Addition fornlulas. For all x and y, tve have) cas (x + y) = casx cas y - sin x sin y , sin (x + y) = sin x cas y + cosx sin y .) (g) Difference formulas. For all a and b, we have) . . b 2 .a-b a+b sIn a - sIn = sIn cos , 2 2 b 2 .a-b.a+bcasa - cas = - sIn SIn . 2 2) (h) Monotonicity. In the interval [0, !17], the sine is strict(,v increasing and the cosine is strictly decreasing.) Proof Part (a) follows at once if we take x = y in (2.3) and use the relation cas 0 = 1. Property (b) follows from (a) by taking x = 0, x = !17,X = 1T and using the relation sin !17 = 1. The even property of the cosine also follows from (2.3) by taking y = O. Next we deduce the formula) (2.5)) cas (!1T - x) = sin x ,) by taking y = !17in (2.3). From this and (2.3), we find that the sine is odd, since) sin (-x) = cos(; + x) = cos [7T - (; - x) ]) ( 1T ) . . ( 1T ) . = cas 1Tcas 2 - x + sIn 1T sIn 2 - x = - sIn x \\302\\267) This proves (c). To prove (d), we again use (2.5), first with x replaced by !1T + x and then with x replaced by -x. Repeated use of (d) then gives us the periodicity relations (e).))) Integration formulas for the sine and cosine) 97) To prove the addition formula for the cosine, we simply replace x by -x in (2.3) and use the evenand oddproperties.Then we use part (d) and the addition formula for the cosine to obtain sin (x + y) = -cos (x + y + ; ) = -cos x cos (y + ; ) + sin x sin (y + ; ) = cosx sin y + sin x cos y .) This proves (f). To deduce the differenceformulas (g), we first replace y by - Y in the addition formula for sin (x + y) to obtain) sin (x - y) = sin x cos y - cosx sin y . Subtracting this from the formula for sin (x + y) and doing the same for the cosinefunction, we get) sin (x + y) - sin (x - y) = 2 siny cosx , cos(x+ y) - cos(x - y) = -2sinysinx. Taking x = (a + b)j2,Y = (a - b)j2, we find that these become the difference formulas in (g). Properties (a) through (g) were deducedfrom properties 1 through 3 alone. Property 4 is used to prove (h). The inequalities (2.4) show that cos x and sin x are positive if o < x < l1T. Now, if 0 < b < a < !1T,the numbers (a + b)j2 and (a - b)j2 are in the interval (0, t1T), and the difference formulas (g) show that sin a > sin band cos a < cosb. This completes the proof of Theorem 2.3. Further properties of the sine and cosine functions are discussedin the next set of exercises (page 104). We mention, in particular, two formulas that are used frequently in calculus. These are called the double-angle or duplication formulas. We have) sin 2x = 2 sin x cos x ,) cos 2x = cos 2 X - sin 2 x = 1 - 2 sin 2 x .) These are, of course, merely special cases of the addition formulas obtained by taking y = x. The second formula for cos 2x follows from the first by use of the Pythagorean identity. The Pythagorean identity also shows that Icos xl < 1 and Isin xl < 1 for all x.) 2.6 Integration formulas for the sine and cosine The monotonicity properties in part (h) of Theorem 2.3, along with the co-relations and the periodicity properties, show that the sine and cosine functions are piecewise monotonic on every interval. Therefore, by repeated use of Theorem 1.12, we see that the sine and cosine are integrable on every finite interval. Now we shall calculate their integrals by applying Theorem 1.14. This calculation makesuse of a pair of inequalities which we state as a separate theorem.) THEOREM 2.4. If 0 < a < l 1T and n > 1, we have) (2.6)) n n-l a \\037 ka . a \\037 ka- L cos - < sIn a < - L cos- \\302\\267 n k=l n n k=O n))) 98) Some applications of integration) Proof The inequalities in (2.6) will be deduced from the trigonometric identity) (2.7)) n 2 sin !x 2cos kx = sin (n + !)x - sin !x , k=l) which is valid for n > 1 and all real x. To prove (2.7), we use one of the differenceformulas (g) of Theorem 2.3 to write) 2 sin !x cos kx = sin (k + !)x- sin (k - !)x.) Taking k = 1,2,. .., n and adding these equations, we find that the sum on the right telescopes and we obtain (2.7). If !x is not an integer multiple of 7T we can divide both members of (2.7)by 2 sin !x to obtain) 2: n k sin (n + !)x - sin !x cos x = . 2 sin !x k=l) Replacing n by n - 1 and adding 1 to both members we also obtain) 2: n- 1 k sin (n - !)x + sin !x cos x = . 2 sin !x k=O) Both these formulas are valid if x \\037 2m1T, where m is an integer. Taking x = ajn, where o < a < !1Twe find that the pair of inequalitiesin (2.6) is equivalent to the pair) sin (n + !)!!: - sin ( .E-. )a n 2n 2 sin ( \\037) 2n,) sin (n - !) !!:+ sin ( \\037). a n 2n < SIn a < - ( ) ' n 2 . a SIn - 2n) n) This pair, in turn, is equivalent to the pair) (2.8)) ( a ) ( ) sin - ( ) . a. a 2n . . a. a SIn (n + !) - - SIn - < ( ) sIn a < sIn (n - !) - + sIn - . n ,2n a n 2n 2n) Therefore, proving (2.6) is equivalent to proving (2.8). We shall prove that we have) (2.9)) sin (2n + 1)\\302\\2431 - sin \\302\\2431< sin \\302\\2431 sin 2n\\302\\2431< sin (2n - 1)\\302\\2431+ sin \\302\\2431 ()) for 0 < 2nO < !1T. When 0 = aj(2n) this reduces to (2.8).))) Integration formulas for the sine and cosine) 99) To prove the leftmost inequality in (2.9), we use the addition formula for the sine to wri te) (2.10)) sin (2n + 1)0 = sin 2nO cos 0 + cos 2nO sin 0 < sin 2nO sin 0 + sin 0 , o) where we have also used the inequalities) O < sin 0 cos - o ') o < cos 2nO < 1 ,) sin 0 > 0 ,) all of which are valid since 0 < 2nO < !1T. Inequality (2.10) is equivalent to the leftmost inequality in (2.9). To prove the rightmost inequality in (2.9), we again use the addition formula for the sine and write) sin (2n - 1)0= sin 2nO cos 0 - cos2nO sin 0 .) Adding sin 0 to both members, we obtain) (2.11 )) sin (2n - 1)0 + sin 0 = sin 2nO (cos 0 + sin 0 1 -. cos 2nO) . sIn 2nO) But since we have) 1 - cos 2nO sin 2nO) 2 sin 2 nO 2 sin nO cos nO) sin nO , cos nO) the right member of (2.11) is equal to) . 2 0 ( 0 + . 0 sin nO ) . 2 0 cos 0 cos nO + sin 0 sin nO sIn n cos sIn = sIn n cos nO cos nO) . 2 0 cos (n - 1)0= sIn n . cos nO) Therefore, to complete the proof of (2.9),we need only show that) (2.12)) cos (n - 1)0 > sin 0 . cosnO 0) But we have) cos nO = cos (n - 1)0cos0- sin (n - 1)0 sin 0 o < cos(n - 1)0 cos 0 < cos(n - 1)0 -:-- , sIn 0))) 100) Some applications of integration) where we have again used the fundamental inequality cos () < ()/(sin ()). This last relation implies (2.12), so the proof of Theorem 2.4 is complete.) THEOREM 2.5. If two functions sin and cos satisfy the fun dan1 en tal properties 1 through 4, then for every real a tve have) (2.14)) Joa cas x dx = sin a , f sin x dx = 1 - cas a \\302\\267) (2.13)) Proof First we prove (2.13), and then we use (2.13) to deduce (2.14). Assume that o < a < !7T. Sincethe cosine is decreasing on [0, a], we can apply Theorem 1.14 in con- junction with the inequalities of Theorem 2.4 to obtain (2.13). The formula also holds trivially for a = 0, since both membersare zero. The general properties of the integral can now be usedto extend its validity to all real a. For example, if -\\0377T < a < 0, then 0 < -a < !7T,and the reflectionproperty gives us) r cas x dx = - Jo-a cas (-x) dx = - Jo-a cas x dx = -sin (-a) = sin a . Thus (2.13) is valid in the interval [-!7T, l7T]. Now suppose that l7T < a < !7T. Then -!7T < a - 7T < \\037-7T,so we have) ] a ] TT/2 f a i a-TT cos X dx = cos X dx + cos X dx = sin !7T + cos (x + 7T) dx o 0 rr/2 -rr/2 = 1 - i a - TTcos x dx = 1 - sin (a - 7T) + sin (-!7T) = sin a . -rr /2) Thus (2.13) holds for all a in the interval [- !7T,!7T]. But this interval has length 27T, so formula (2.13) holds for all a since both members are periodic in a with period 27T. Now we use (2.13) to deduce (2.14). First we prove that (2.14) holds when a = 7T/2. Applying, in succession, the translation property, the co-relation sin (x + !7T) = cos x, and the reflection property, we find) i TT/ 2 J o ( ) J o i TT/2 sin x dx = sin x + 7T dx = cos x dx = cos(-x) dx. o -rr/2 2 -r,/2 0) Using the relation cos (-x) = cosx and Equation (2.13), we obtain) ] TT/2 o sin x dx = 1 .) Now, for any real a, we may write) i a i rr/2 f a i a-rr/2 ( 7T ) sin x dx = sin x dx + sin x dx = 1 + sin x + - dx o 0 rr/2 0 2 i a - TT/ 2 ( 7T ) = 1 + 0 cos x dx = 1 + sin a - 2 = 1 - cosa .) This shows that Equation (2.13) implies (2.14).))) Integration formulas for the sine and cosine) 101) EXAMPLE 1. Using (2.13) and (2.14)in conjunction with the additive property) r f(x) dx = r f(x) dx - Iou f(x) dx,) we get the more general integration formulas) r cas x dx = sin b - sin a) and) r b . L sIn x dx = (1 - casb) - (1 - cosa) = -(cos b - cosa) . \\037a) If again we use the special symbolf(x) I\\037 to denote the difference f(b) - f(a), we can write these integration formulas in the form) r cos x dx = sin x I:) and) r sin x dx = -cos x I: \\302\\267) EXAMPLE 2. Using the results of Example 1 and the expansion property) f b 1 f Cb I(x) dx = - I(x/e) dx, a e ca) we obtain the following formulas, valid for e \\037 0:) f b 1 f Cb 1 cas ex dx = - cosx dx = - (sin eb - sin ea), a e ca e) and) f b 1 f Cb 1 sin ex dx = - sin x dx = - - (cos eb - cos ea) . a C ca e) EXAMPLE 3. The identity cos 2x = 1 - 2 sin 2 x implies sin 2 x = l(1 - cos2x) so, from Example 2, we obtain) f asin2 x dx = ! f a(1 - cos 2x) dx = a - ! sin 2a . o 2 0 2 4) Since sin 2 x + cos 2 x = 1, we also find) f a f a f a a 1 cos 2 x dx = (1 - sin 2 x) dx = a - sin 2 x dx = - + - sin 2a . o 0 0 2 4))) 102) Some applications of integration) 2.7 A geometric description of the sine and cosine functions In this section we indicate a geometric method for defining the sine and cosine functions, and we give a geometric interpretation of the fundamental propertieslisted in the Section 2.5. Consider a circle of radius r with its center at the origin. Denote the point (r, 0) by A, and let P be any other point on the circle. The two line segments OA and OP determine a geometric configuration called an angle which we denote by the symbol LAOP. An example is shown in Figure 2.6. We wish to assign to this angle a nonnegative real number x which can be used as a measurementof its size. The most common way of doing this is to take a circle of radius 1 and let x be the length of the circular arc AP, traced counterclockwise) twice area of sector ,2) FIGURE 2.6 An angle L AOP consisting of x radians.) b = sin x) FIGURE 2.7 Geometric description of sin x and cos x.) from A to P, and to say that the measure of LAOP is x radians. From a logical point of view, this is unsatisfactory at the present stage becausewe have not yet discussed the concept of arc length. Arc length will be discussed later in Chapter 14. Since the concept of area has already been discussed, we prefer to use the area of the circular sector AOP rather than the length of the arc AP as a measure of the size of LAOP. It is understood that the sector AOP is the smaller portion of the circular disk when P is above the real axis, and the larger portion when P is below the real axis. Later, when arc length is discussed, we shall find that the length of arc AP is exactly twice the area of sector AOP. Therefore, to get the same scale of measurement for angles by both methods, we shall use twice the area of the sector AOP as a measure of the angle LAOP. However, to obtain a \\\"dimensionless\\\" measure of angles, that is, a measure independentof the unit of distance in our coordinate system, we shall define the measure of LAOP to be twice the area of sector AOP divided by the square of the radius. This ratio does not change if we expand or contract the circle, and therefore there is no loss in generality in restricting our considerations to a unit circle. The unit of measure so obtained is called the radian. Thus, we say the measure of an angle LAOP is x radians if x/2 is the area of the sector AOP cut from a unit circular disk. We have already introduced the symbolTT to denote the area of a unit circular disk. When P = (-1, 0), the sector A 0 P is a semicircular disk of area ITT,so it subtends an angle of TT radians. The entire disk is a sectorconsistingof 2TT radians. If P is initially at (1, 0) and if))) A geometric description of the sine and cosine functions) 103) P moves once around the circle in a counterclockwise direction, the area of sector AOP increases from 0 to 1T, taking every value in the interval [0, 1T] exactly once. This property, which is geometrically plausible, can be proved by expressing the area as an integral, but we shall not discuss the proof. The next step is to define the sine and cosineof an angle. Actually, we prefer to speak of the-'sine and cosine of a number rather than of an angle, so that the sine and cosine will be functions defined on the real line. We proceed as follows: Choose a number x satisfying o < x < 21T and let P be the point on the unit circle such that the area of sectorAOP is equal to x/2. Let (a, b) denote the coordinates of P. An example is shown in Figure 2.7. The numbers a and b are completely determined by x. We define the sine and cosineof x as follows:) cos x = a ,) sin x = b .) In other words, cas x is the abscissaof P and sin x is its ordinate. For example, when x = 1T, we have P = (-1, 0) so that cos 1T = -1 and sin 1T = O. Similarly, when x = !1Twe have P = (0, 1) and hence cos!1T= 0 and sin \\0371T= 1. This procedure describes the sine and cosine as functions defined in the open interval (0, 21T). We extend the definitions to the whole real axis by means of the following equations:) sin 0 = 0 ,) cos 0 = 1 ,) sin (x + 21T)= sin x ,) cos (x + 21T)= COSX .) The other four trigonometric functions are now defined in terms of the sine and cosine by the usual formulas,) sin x tan x = . cos x ') cos x cot x = . ,sin x) 1 sec x = ,cos x) 1 csc x = --:-- . sIn x) These functions are defined for all real x exceptfor certain isolated points where the denominators may be zero. They all satisfy the periodicity property f(x + 21T) = f(x). The tangent and cotangent have the smaller period 1T. Now we give geometric arguments to indicate how these definitions lead to the funda- mental properties listed in Section 2.5. Properties 1 and 2 have already been taken care of by the way we have defined the sine and cosine. The Pythagorean identity becomes evident when we refer to Figure 2.7. The line segment 0 P is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs have lengths Icos xl and I sin xl. Hence the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles implies the identity cos 2 x + sin 2 x = 1. Now we use the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles again to give a geometric proof of formula (2.3) for cos (y - x). Refer to the two right triangles PA Q and PBQ shown in Figure 2.8. In triangle P A Q, the length of side A Q is Isin y - sin xl, the absolute value of the difference of the ordinates of Q and P. Similarly, AP has length Icos x - cos yl. If d denotes the length of the hypotenuse PQ, we have, by the Pythagorean theorem, d 2 = (sin y - sin X)2 + (cos x - cos y)2.) On the other hand, in right triangle PBQ the leg BP has length 11 - cos (y - x)1and the leg BQ has length Isin (y - x)l. Therefore, the Pythagorean theorem gives us) d 2 = [1 - cos (y - X)]2 + sin 2 (y - x) .))) 104) Some applications of integration) Equating the two expressions for d2 and solving for cos (y - x), we obtain the desired formula (2.3) for cos (y - x). Finally, geometric proofs of the fundamental inequalitiesin property 4 may be given by referring to Figure 2.9. We simply compare the area of sector OAP with that of triangles OQP and OAB. Becauseof the way we have defined angular measure, the area of sector OAP is lx. Triangle OAB has base 1 and altitude h, say. By similar triangles, we find hjl = (sin x)j(cos x), so the area of triangle OAB is !h = !(sinx)j(cosx). Therefore, comparison of areas gives us the inequalities) 1 . 1 1 sin x- sin x cos x < - x < - . 2 2 2cosx) Q = (cos y, sin y)) B) h = sIn x cos x) sIn x) cos x) o) o) Q) A) FIGURE 2.8 Geometric proof of the formula for cos (y - x).) FIGURE 2.9 Geometric proof of the inequalities sin x 1 o < cosx < - < - .x cosx) Dividing by \\037.sin x and taking reciprocals, we obtain the fundamental inequalities (2.4). We remind the reader once more that the discussion of this section is intended to provide a geometric interpretation of the sine and cosine and their fundamental properties. An analytic treatment of these functiuns, making no use of geometry, will be described in Section 11.11. Extensive tables of values of the sine, cosine, tangent, and cotangent appear in most mathematical handbooks. The graphs of the six trigonometric functions are shown in Figure 2.10 (page 107) as they appear over one complete period-interval. The rest of the graph in each case is obtained by appealing to periodicity.) 2.8 Exercises) In this set of exercises, you may use the properties of the sine and cosine listed in Sections 2.5 through 2.7. 1.

FIGURE 2.12 A figure-eigh t curve with polar equation r = v l sin 81.) The positive number r is called the radial distance of P, and () is called a polarangle. We say a polar angle rather than the polar angle because if () satisfies (2.15),so does () + 2n1T for any integer n. We agree to call all pairs of real numbers (r, ()) polar coordinates of P if they satisfy (2.15) with r > O. Thus, a given point has more t han one pair of polar coordinates. The radial distance r is uniquely determined, r = V x 2 + y2, but the polar angle () is determined only up to integer multiples of 27T. When P is the origin, the equations in (2.15) are satisfied with r = 0 and any () . For this reason we assign to the origin the radial distance r = 0, and we agree that any real () may be used as a polar angle. Letf be a nonnegative function defined on an interval [a, b]. The set of all points with polar coordinates (r, ()) satisfying r = f(()) is called the graph of f in polar coordinates. The equation r = f(()) is called a polar equation of this graph. For some curves, polar))) The integral for area in polar coordinates) 109) equations may be simpler and more convenient to use than Cartesian equations. For example, the circle with Cartesian equation x2 + y2 = 4 has the simpler polar equation r = 2. The equations in (2.15) show how to convert from rectangular to polar coordinates.) EXAMPLE. Figure 2.12 shows a curve in 'the shape of a figure eight whose Cartesian equation is (x2 + },2)3 = y2. Using (2.15),we find x 2 + y2 = r 2 , so the polar coordin ates of the points on this curve satisfy the equation r 6 = r 2 sin 2 0, or r 2 = Isin 01, r = V lsin 01. It is not difficult to sketch this curve from the polar equation. For example, in the interval o < 0 < 7Tj2, sin 0 increases from 0 to 1, so r also increases from 0 to 1. Plotting a few values which are easy to calculate, for example,those correspondingto 0 = 7Tj6, 7Tj4, and 1Tj3, we quickly sketch the portion of the curve in the first quadrant. The rest of the curve is obtained by appealing to symmetry in the Cartesian equation, or to the symmetry and periodicity of I sin 01. It would be a more difficult task to sketch this curve from its Cartesian equation alone.) 2.10 The integral for area in polar coordinates) Let f be a nonnegative function defined on an interval [a, b], where 0 < b - a < 27T.

The shaded region shown in Figure 2.13 is an example. If f is constant on [a, b], its radial set is a circular sector subtending an angle of b - a radians. Figure 2.14 shows the radial set S of a step function s. Over each of the n open subintervals (Ok-I' Ok) of [a, b] in which s is constant, say s(O) = Sk , the graph of s in polar coordinates is a circular arc of radius Sk , and its radial set is a circular sector subtending an angle of Ok - 0k-l radians. Becauseof the way we have defined angular measure, the area of this sector is !(Ok- Ok-l)S\\037. Since b - a < 27T , none of these sectors overlap so, by))) 110) Some applications of integration) additivity, the area of the radial set of s over the full interval [a, b] is given by) f bn 2 2 a(5) = \\0372 Sk . (Ok - Ok-I)=! a S (0) dO , k=I) where S2(O) means the square of s(O).Thus, for step functions, the area of the radial set has been expressed as an integral. Now we prove that this integral formula holds more generally .) THEOREM 2.6. Let R denote the radial set of a nonnegative function f over an interval [a, b], where 0 < b - a < 21T, and assume that R is measurable. Iff2 is integrable on [a, b] the area of R is given by the integral) a(R) = t f fV) de \\302\\267) Proof Choose two step functions sand t satisfying) o < s(O) < i(O) < t(O)) for all 0 in [a, b], and let Sand T denote their radial sets, respectively. Since s < f < t on [a, b], the radial sets are related by the inclusion relations S c R c T. Hence, by the monotone property of area, we have a(S) < a(R) < a(T). But Sand T are radial sets of step functions, so a(8) = is: S2(O) dO and aCT) = !S\\037 t 2(O) dO. Therefore we have the inequalities) t s2(e) de < 2a(R) < t t\\\\e) de ,) for all step functions sand t satisfying s < f < t on [a, b]. But S2 and t 2 are arbitrary step functions satisfying S2 < [2 < t 2 on [a, b] hence, since f2 is integrable, we must have 2a(R) = S:f 2 (O) dO. This proves the theorem. Note: It can be proved that the measurability of R is a consequence of the hypothesis that [2 is integrable, but we shall not discuss the proof.) EXAMPLE. To calculate the area of the radial set R enclosed by the figure-eight curve shown in Figure 2.12, we calculate the area of the portion in the first quadrant and multiply by four. For this curve, we have f2(O)= Isin 01 and, since sin 0 > 0 for 0 < () < 1Tj2, we find) (1T/2 (1T/2 ( 1T ) a(R) = 4)0 if2(e) de = 2)0 sin e de = 2 cos 0 - cos 2\\\" = 2.) 2.11 Exercises) In each of Exercises 1 through 4, show that the set of points whose rectangular coordinates (x, y) satisfy the given Cartesian equation is equal to the set of all points whose polar coordinates (r, 6) satisfy the corresponding polar equation.)))

Then, in Sections 1.18 and 2.2, we showed that the areas of many regions could be calculated by integration. The same approach can be used to discuss the concept of volume. We assume there exist certain sets S of points in three-dimensional space, which we call measurablesets, and a set function v, called a volume function, which assigns to each measurableset S a number v(S), called the volume of S. We use the symbol d to denote the class of all measurable sets in three-dimensional space, and we call each set S in d a solid. As in the case of area, we list a number of properties we would like volume to have and take theseas axiomsfor volume. The choice of axioms enablesus to prove that the volumes of many solids can be computed by integration. The first three axioms, like those for area, describe the nonnegative, additive, and differenceproperties. Instead of an axiom of invariance under congruence, we use a different type of axiom,calledCavalieri'sprinciple. This assigns equal volumes to congruent solids and also to certain solids which, though not congruent, have equal cross-sectional areascut by planes perpendicular to a given line. More precisely, suppose S is a given solid and L a given line. If a plane F is perpendicular to L, the intersection F n S is called a cross-section perpendicular to L. If every cross-section perpendicular to L is a measurable set in its own plane, we call S a Cavalieri solid. Cavalieri's principle assigns equal volumes to two Cavalieri solids, Sand T, if a(S n F) = a(Tn F) for every plane F perpendicular to the given line L. Cavalieri's principle can be illustrated intuitively as follows. Imagine a Cavalieri solid as being a stack of thin sheets of material, like a deckof cards,eachsheet being perpendicular to a given line L. If we slide each sheet in its own plane we can change the shape of the solid but not its volume. The next axiom states that the volume of a rectangular parallelepipedis the product of))) 112) Some applications of integration) the lengths of its edges. A rectangular parallelepiped is any set congruent to a set of the form) (2.16)) {(x,y,z)IO < x < a, O < y < b, O < z < c}.) We shall use the shorter term \\\"box\\\" rather than \\\"rectangular parallelepiped.\\\" The non- negative numbers a, b, c in (2.16) are called the lengths of the edges of the box. Finally, we include an axiom which states that every convex set is measurable. A set is called convex if, for every pair of points P and Q in the set, the line segment joining P and Q is also in the set. This axiom, along with the additive and difference properties, ensures that all the elementary solids that occur in the usual applications of calculusare measurable. The axioms for volume can now be stated as follows.) AXIOMATIC DEFINITION OF VOLUME. We assume there exists a class d of solids and a set function v, whose domain is d, 'vvith the follo'vving properties: 1. Nonnegative property. For each set S in d we have v(S) > O. 2. Additive property. If'S and T are in d, then S U T and S n Tare in d, and we have) v(S U T) = v(S) + veT) - v(S n T).) 3. Difference property. If Sand T are in d with S c T, then T - S is in d, and we have veT- S) = veT) - v(S). 4. Cavalieri's principle. If Sand T are two Cavalieri solids in d with a(S n F) < aCTn F)for every plane F perpendicular to a given line, then v(S) < v(T). 5. Choiceof scale. Every box B is in d. If the edges of B have lengths a, b, and c, then v(B) = abc. 6. Every convex set is in d. Axiom 3 shows that the empty set 0 is in d and has zero volume. SinceveT - S) > 0, Axiom 3 also implies the following monotone property:) v(S) < veT),) for setsS and Tin d with S c T.) The monotone property, in turn, shows that every bounded plane set S in d has zero volume. A plane set is called bounded if it is a subset of some square in the plane. If we consider a box B of altitude c having this square as its base,then S c B so that we have v(S) < v(B) = a2 c, where a is the length of each edge of the square base. If we had v(S) > 0, we could choosec so that c < v(S)fa 2 , contradicting the inequality v(S) < a 2c. This shows that v(S) cannot be positive, so v(S) = 0, as asserted. Note that Cavalieri's principle has been stated in the form of inequalities. If a(S n F) = aCT n F) for every plane F perpendicular to a given line, we may apply Axiom 5 twice to deduce v(S) < v(T) and v(T) < v(S), and hence we have v(T) = v(S). Next we show that the volume of a right cylindrical solid is equal to the area of its base multiplied by its altitude. By a right cylindrical solid we mean a set congruent to a set S of the form) S={(X,y,Z)I(X,y)EB, a < z < b},))) Application of integration to the calculation of volunle) 113) where B is a bounded plane measurableset. The areas of the cross sections of S perpen- dicular to the z-axis determine a cross-sectionalarea function as which takes the constant value a(B) on the interval a < z < b, and the value 0 outside [a, b]. Now let T be a box with cross-sectional area function aT equal to as. Axiom 5 tells us that veT) = a(B)(b- a), where a(B) is the area of the base of T, and b - a is its altitude. Cavalieri's principle states that v(S) = veT), so the volume of S is the area of its base, a(B), multiplied by its altitude, b - a. Note that the product a(B)(b - a) is the integral of the function as over the interval [a, b]. In other words, the volume of a right cylindrical solid is eq ual to the integral of its cross-sectional area function,) v(S) = [\\\" as(z) dz . \\037a) We can extend this formula to more general Cavalieri solids. Let R be a Cavalieri solid with measurable cross-sections perpendicular to a given line L. Introduce a coordinate axis along L (call it the u-axis), and let a u(u) be the area of the cross section cut by a plane perpendicular to L at the point u. The volume of R can be computed by the following theorem.) THEOREM 2.7. Let R be a Cavalierisolidin d with a cross-sectional area function a R which is integrable on an interval [a, b] and zero outside [a, b]. Then the volume of R is equal to the integral of the cross-sectional area:) v(R) = [b aR(u) du . \\037a) Proof Choose step functions sand t such that s < all < t on [a, b] and define sand t to be zero outside [a, b]. For each subinterval of [a, b] on which s is constant, we can imagine a cylindrical solid (for example, a right circular cylinder) constructed so that its cross-sectional area on this subinterval has the same constant value as s. The union of these cylinders over all intervals of constancy of s is a solid S whose volume v(S) is, by additivity, equal to the integral S\\037s(u) duo Similarly, there is a solid T, a union of cylinders, whose volume veT)= S\\037t(u) duo But as(u) = s(u) < azlu) < t(u) = aT(u) for all u in [a, b], so Cavalieri's principle implies that v(S) < vCR) < veT). In other words,vCR) satisfies the inequalities) r s(u) du < v(R) < f t(u) du) for all step functions sand t satisfying s < as < t on [a, b]. Since as is integrableon [a, b], it follows that v(R) = S\\037as(u) duo) EXAMPLE. Volume of a solid of revolution. Let f be a function which is nonnegative and integrable on an interval [a, b]. If the ordinate set of this function is revolved about the x-axis, it sweeps out a solid of revolution. Each crosssection cut by a plane perpendicular to the x-axis is a circular disk. The area of the circular disk cut at the point x is 'TTf2(x), where f2(X) means the square off(x). Therefore, by Theorem 2.7, the volume of the solid (if the solid is in d) is equal to the integral S\\037'TTf2(x) dx, if the integral exists. In particular,))) 114) Some applications of integration) iff(x) = Vr 2 - x 2 for -r < x < r, the ordinate set off is a semicirculardisk of radius r and the solid swept out is a sphere of radius r.

Its volume is equal to) f r 7Tf2(X) dx = 7T f r (r2 - x 2) dx = 27T (r (r2 - x 2 ) dx = t7Tr3 . -r -r Jo) More generally, suppose we have two nonnegativefunctions f and g which are integrable on an interval [a, b] and satisfy f < g on [a, b]. When the region between their graphs is rotated about the x-axis, it sweeps out a solid of revolution such that each cross section cut by a plane perpendicular to the x-axis at the point x is an annulus (a region bounded by two concentric circles) with area 7Tg2(X) - 7Tf2(X). Therefore, if g2 - f2 is integrable, the volume of such a solid(if the solid is in d) is given by the integral) f 7T[g2(X) - P(x)] dx .) 2.13 Exercises) 1.

Now we discuss an application to l1'ork, a concept from physics. Work is a measure of the energy expended by a force in moving a particle from one point to another. In this section we consider only the simplest case, linear motion. That is, we assume that the motion takes place along a line (which we take as the x-axis) from one point, say x = a, to another point, x = b, and we also assume that the force acts along this line. We permit either a < b or b < a. We assume further that the force acting on the particle is a function of the position. If the particle is at x, we denote by f(x) the force acting on it, where f(x) > 0 if the force acts in the direction of the positive x-axis, and f(x) < 0 if the force acts in the opposite direction. When the force is constant, say f(x) = c for all x betweena and b, we define the work done by f to be the number c . (b - a), force times displacement. The work may be positive or negative. If force is measured in pounds and distance in feet, we measure work in foot-pounds; if force is in dynes and distance in centinleters (the cgs system),work is measured in (\\037vne- centinleters. One dyne-centimeter of work is called an erg. If force is in newtolls and distance in n1eters (the Inks system), work is in newtoll-nleters. One newton-meter of work is called a joule. One newton is 103 dynes, and one joule is 10 7 ergs.) EXAMPLE. A stone weighing 3 pounds (lb) is thrown upward along a straight line, rising to a height of 15 feet (ft) and returning to the ground. We take the x-axis pointing up along the line of motion. The constant force of gravity acts downward, sof(x) = - 3 lb for each x, 0 < x < 15. The work done by gravity in moving the stone from, say, x = 6 ft to x = 15 ft is - 3 \\302\\267 (15 - 6) = - 27 foot-pounds (ft-I b). When the same stone falls from x = 15 ft to x = 6 ft, the work done by gravity is - 3(6 - 15) = 27 ft-lb. Now suppose the force is not necessarily constant but is a given function of position de- fined on the interval joining a and b. How do we define the work done by f in moving a particle from a to b? We proceed much as we did for area and volume. We state some properties of work which are dictated by physical requirements. Then we prove that for any definition of work which has these properties, the work done by an integrable force function f is equal to the integral J\\037 f(x) dx.) FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF WORK. Let Wa(j) denote the l1'ork done b)' a force function fin mOL'ing a particle from a to b. Then \\\\tfork has the .lollo\\0371.'ing properties: 1. Additive property. If a < c < b, then W\\037(f) = W\\037(f) + W\\037(f). 2. Monotone propert}'. If f < g on [a, b], then W\\037(f) < W:(g). That is, a greaterforce does greater l1'ork. 3. Elementar)' fornlula. Iff is constant, say f(x) = c for all x in the open interral (a, b), then W\\037(f) = c . (b - a). The additive property can be extended by induction to any finite number of intervals.))) 116) Some applications of integration) That is, if a = Xo < Xl < \\302\\267. . < Xn = b, we have) n W\\037(f) = I Wk , k=l) where Wk is the work done by jfrom Xk- l to X k . In particular, if the force is a stepfunction s which takes a constant value Sk on the open interval (X k- l , xk ), property 3 states that W k = Sk \\302\\267 (x k - X k- l), so we have) n I b W\\037(s) = ISk' (x k - X k- l) = sex)dx . k=l a) Thus, for step functions, work has been expressed as an integral. Now it is an easy matter to prove that this holds true more generally.) THEOREM 2.8. Suppose \\037vork has been defined for a class offorcefunctions f in such a way that it satisfies properties 1'12, and 3. Then the 'vvork done oy an integrable force function f in moving a particlefronl a to b is equal to the integral off,) W\\037(f) = r f(x) dx .) Proof Let sand t be two step functions satisfying s < f < t on [a, b]. The monotone property of work states that W\\037(s) < W\\037(f) < W\\037(t). But W\\037(s) = S\\037sex) dx and W:(t) = S\\037t(x) dx, so the number W\\037(j) satisfies the inequalities) I b b I b a sex) dx < Wa(f) < a t(X) dx) for all step functions sand t satisfying s < f < t on [a, b]. Since f is integrable on [a, b], it follows that W\\037(f) = S\\037f(x) dx. Note: Many authors simply define work to be the integral of the force function. The foregoing discussion serves as motivation for this definition.) EXAMPLE. Work required to stretch a spring. Assume that the force f(x) needed to stretch a steel spring a distance X beyond its natural length is proportional to X (Hooke's law). We place the x-axis along the axis of the spring. If the stretching force acts in the positive direction of the axis, we have f(x) = cx,where the spring constant c is positive. (The value of c can be determined if we know the force f(x) for a particular value of x \\302\\245:-0.) The work required to stretch the spring a distance a is S\\037f(x) dx = S\\037cx dx = ca 2 f2, a number proportional to the square of the displacement.) A discussion of work for motion along curves other than straight lines is carried out in Volume II with the aid of line integrals.) 2.15 Exercises) In Exercises 1 and 2 assume the force on the spring obeys Hooke'slaw. 1.

There are many useful types of averages, the most common being the arithlnetic mean. If aI' a 2 , . . . , an are n real numbers, their arithmetic mean a is defined by the equation) (2.17)) 1 n ii = - 2 ak . n k=I) If the numbers a k are the values of a function f at n distinct points, saya k = f(x k), then the number) 1 n - 2!(x k ) n K=I) is the arithmetic mean of the function values f(x 1), . . . ,f(xn). We can extend this concept to compute an average value not only for a finite number of valuesoff(x) but for all values of f(x) where x runs through an interval. The following definition serves this purpose.) DEFINITION OF AVERAGE VALUE OF A FUNCTION ON AN INTERVAL. If f is integrable on an interval [a, b], we define A(f), the average value off on [a, b], by the formula) (2.18)) 1 J b A(f) = f(x) dx . b - a a))) 118) Some applications of integration) When f is nonnegative, this formula has a simple geometric interpretation. Written in the form (b - a)A(f) = S\\037f(x) dx, it states that the rectangle of altitude A(f) and base [a, b] has an area equal to that of the ordinate set off over [a, b]. Now we can show that formula (2.18) is actually an extension of the concept of the arithmetic mean. Letf be a step function which is constant on n equal subintervals of [a, b]. Specifically, let X k = a + k(b - a)fn for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n, and suppose that f(x) = f(x k ), if Xk- 1 < x < xk . Then Xk - X k- 1 = (b - a)fn, so we have) 1 f b 1 n b - a 1 n A(f) = f(x) dx = 2J(x k ) = - Lf(x k ). b - a a b - a k=1 n n k=1) Thus, for step functions, the average A(f) is the same as the arithmetic mean of the values f(x 1), . . \\302\\267,f(x n) taken on the intervals of constancy. Weighted arithmetic means are often used in p\\037ace of the ordinary arithmetic mean in (2.17). If W b w 2 , . . . , Wn are n nonnegative numbers (called weights), not all zero, the weighted arithmetic mean a of aI, a 2 , . . . , an is defined by the formula) n L wka k - k=1 a= n LW k k=1) When the weights are all equal, this reduces to the ordinary arithmetic mean. The extension of this concept to integrable functions is given by the formula) (2.19)) [bw(x)f(x) dx A (f) = \\\"a b ' L w(x) dx) where w is a nonnegative weight function with S\\037w(x) dx \\302\\245:-O. Weighted averages are widely used in physics and engineering, as well as in mathematics. For example, consider a straight rod of length a made of a material of varying density. Place the rod along the positive x-axis with one end at the origin 0, and let m(x) denote the mass of a portion of the rod of length x, measured from O. If m(x) = S\\037pet) dt for some integrable function p (p is the Greek letter rho), then p is called the mass density of the rod. A uniform rod is one whose mass density is constant. The integralSg xp(x) dx is called the first moment of the rod about 0, and the centerof massis the point whose x-coordinate is) _ fXp(x) dx x- - tp(x) dx .) This is an example of a weighted average. We are averaging the distance function/(x) = x with the mass density p as weight function.))) Exercises) 119) The integralfg x 2 p(x) dx is called the second moment, or moment of inertia, of the rod about 0, and the positive number r given by the formula) J.\\\\2p(X) dx r2 = 0 f: p(x) dx) is called the radius of gyration of the rod. In this case, the function being averaged is the square of the distance function, f(x) = x2 , with the mass density p as the weight function. Weighted averages like these also occur in the mathematical theory of probability where the concepts of expectation and variance play the same role as centerof mass and moment of inertia.) 2.17 Exercises In Exercises 1 through 10, compute the average A(f) for the given function f over the specified in terva 1. 1. f(x) = x 2 , a < x < b. 6.f(x) = cosx, - 7T/2 < x < 7T/2. 2. f(x) = x 2 + x 3 , 0 < X < 1. 7. f(x) = sin 2x, 0 < x < 7Tj2. 3. f(x) = X 1/ 2, 0 < X < 4. 8. f(x) = sin x cos x, 0 < x < 7Tj4. 4. f(x) = X 1/ 3, 1 < x < 8. 9.f(x) = sin 2 x, 0 < x < 7T/2. 5. f(x) = sin x, 0 < x < 7Tj2. 10. f(x) = cos 2 x, 0 < x < 7T. 11.

Cal- culate the following: (a) the average voltage over the time interval [0, 1Tf2]; (b) the root-mean- square of the voltage; that is, the square root of the average of the function e 2 in the interval [0, 1Tj2]. 24. In an electrical circuit, the voltage e(t) and the current i(t) at time t are given by the formulas e(t) = 160sin t, i(t) = 2 sin (t - 1T/6). The averagepower is defined to be) l i T T 0 e(t)i(t) dt ,) where T is the period of both the voltage and the current. Determine T and calculate the a verage power.) 2.18 The integral as a function of the upper limit. Indefinite integrals In this section we assume thatfis a function such that the integral S\\037f(t) dt exists for each x in an interval [a, b]. We shall keep a and ffixed and study this integral as a function of x. We denote the value of the integral by A(x), so that we have) (2.20)) A(x) = I: f(t) dt) if a < x < b .) An equation like this enables us to construct a new function A from a given function f, the value of A at each point in [a, b] being determined by Equation (2.20). The function A is sometimes referred to as an indefinite integral of f, and it is said to be obtained from f by integration. We sayan indefinite integral rather than the indefinite integral because A also depends on the lower limit a. Different values of a will lead to different functions A. If we use a different lower limit, say c, and define another indefinite integral F by the equation) F(x) = t' f(t) dt ,) then the additive property tells us that) A(x) - F(x) = I: f(t) dt - t' f(t) dt = f f(t) dt ,) and hence the difference A(x) - F(x)is independent of x. Therefore any two indefinite integrals of the same function differ only by a constant (the constant dependson the choice of a and c). When an indefinite integral off is known, the value of an integral such as S\\037f(t) dt may be evaluated by a simple subtraction. For example, if n is a nonnegative integer, we have the formula of Theorem 1.15,) i x xn+l t n dt = , o n + 1))) The integral as a function of the upper limit. Indefinite integrals 121) and the additive property implies that) f b f b f a bn+l a n + 1 t n dt = t n dt - t n dt = . a 0 0 n + 1) In general, if F{x) = S\\037I{t) dt, then we have) (2.21 )) fJ(t) dt = f J(t) dt - t J(t) dt = F(b) - F(a) .) A different choice of c merely changesF{x)by a constant; this does not alter the difference F{b)- F{a), because the constant cancels out in the subtraction. If we use the special symbol) F{x)I:) to denote the difference F{b)- F{a), Equation (2.21) may be written as) I: J(x) dx = F(x)j: = F(b)- F(a) \\302\\267) There is, of course, a very simple geometric relationship between a function f and its indefinite integrals. An example is illustrated in Figure 2.15{a), where I is a nonnegative function and the number A{x) is equal to the area of the shaded region under the graph of f from a to x. If I assumes both positive and negative values, as in Figure 2.15{b), the integral A{x) gives the sum of the areas of the regions above the x-axis minus the sum of the areas below the x-axis. Many of the functions that occur in various branches of science arise exactly in this way, as indefinite integrals of other functions. This is one of the reasons that a large part of calculus is devoted to the study of indefinite integrals. Sometimesa knowledge of a special property of limplies a correspondingspecial property of the indefinite integral. For example, if f is nonnegative on [a, b], then the indefinite integral A is increasing, since we have) A(y) - A(x) = tJ(l) dt - f: J(t) dl = J:J(l) dt > 0 ,) A(x) = 1/(1) dt) 1/(1) dt = algebraic sum of areas) f I) a) x) x) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 2.15 Indefinite integral interpreted geometrically in terms of area.))) 122) Some applications of integration) g (x) + g (y) 2) g(y)) g(x) gr \\037Y) x x+y y 2 (a) A convex function) g(y)) g(x)) g (x) + g (y) 2) x) x+y 2) y) (b) A concave function) FIGURE 2.16 Geometric interpretation of convexity and concavity.) whenever a < x < y < b. Interpreted geometrically, this means that the area under the graph of a nonnegative function from a to x cannot decreaseas x increases. Now we discuss another property which is not immediately evident geometrically. Supposefis increasing on [a, b]. We can prove that the indefinite integral A has a property known as convexity. Its graph bends upward, as illustrated in Figure 2.16(a); that is, the chord joining any two points on the graph always lies above the graph. An analytic definition of convexity may be given as follows.) DEFINITION OF A CONVEX FUNCTION. A function g is said to be convex on an interval [a, b] if, for all x and y in [a, b] and for every rx satisfying 0 < rx < 1, }1'e have) (2.22)) g(z) < rxg(y) + (1 - rx)g(x),) \\037'here z = rxy + (1 - rx)x.) We say g is concave on [a, b] if the reverse inequality holds,) g(z) > rxg(y) + (1 - rx)g(x),) where z = rxy + (I - rx)x.) These inequalities have a simple geometricinterpretation. The point z = rxy + (I - rx)x satisfies z - x = rx(y - x). If x < y, this point divides the interval [x, y] into two sub- intervals, [x, z] and [z,y], the length of [x, z] being rx times that of [x, y]. As rx runs from 0 to 1, the point rxg(y) + (1 - rx)g(x) traces out the line segment joining the points (x, g(x)) and (y, g(y)) on the graph of g. Inequality (2.22) states that the graph of g never goes above this line segment. Figure 2.16(a) shows an example with rx = t. For a concave function, the graph never goes below the line segment,as illustrated by the example in Figure 2.16(b).) THEOREM 2.9. Let A(x) = S\\037f(t) dt. Then A is convex on every interval where f is in- creasing, and concaveon every interval where f is decreasing.) Proof Assumefis increasing on [a, b], choose x < y, and let z = rxy + (I - rx)x. We are to prove that A(z) < rxA(y) + (1 - rx)A(x). Since A(z) = rxA(z) + (1 - rx)A(z), this))) The integral as a function of the upper limit. Indefinite integrals 123) is the same as proving that Cl.A(z) + (1 - CI.)A(z) < Cl.A(y) + (1 - CI.)A(x), or that) (1 - CI.)[A(z) - A(x)] < CI.[A(y) - A(z)] .) Since we have A(z) - A(x) = S\\037f(t) dt and A(y) - A(z) = S;f(t) dt, we are to prove that) (2.23 )) (1 - at) J: J(t) dt < at r J(t) dt \\302\\267) But f is increasing, so we have the inequalities) f(t) < f(z)) if x < t < z,) and) fez) < f(t)) if z < t < Y .) Integrating these inequalities we find) J: J(t) dt < J(z)(z - x),) and) J(z)(y - z) < r J(t) dt \\302\\267) But (1 - CI.)(Z - x) = CI.(y - z), so these inequalities give us) (1 - at) J: J(t) dt < (1 - at)J(z)(z - x) = atJ(z)(y - z) < at r J(t) dt ,) which proves (2.23). This proves that A is convex when fis increasing. When fis decreasing, we may apply the result just proved to -f) EXAMPLE. The cosine function decreases in the interval [0, 7T]. Since sin x = S\\037cos t dt, the graph of the sine function is concave in the interval [0, 7T]. In the interval [7T,27T], the cosine increases and the sine function is convex.) Figure 2.17 illustrates further properties of indefinite integrals. The graph on the left is that of the greatest-integer function, f(x) = [x]; the graph on the right is that of the indefinite integral A(x) = S\\037[t] dt. On those intervals where f is constant, the function A is linear. We describe this by saying that the integral of a step function is piece\\037vise linear.) = [x]) A(x) = l(t l dt) o) x) o) x) .--) FIGURE 2.17 The indefinite integral of a step function is piecewise linear.))) 124) Some applications of integration) Observe also that the graph of f is made up of disconnected line segments. There are points on the graph of fwhere a small change in x produces a sudden jump in the value of the function. Note, however, that the corresponding indefinite integral does not exhibit this behavior. A small change in x produces only a small change in A(x). That is why the graph of A is not disconnected. This illustrates a general property of indefinite integrals known as continuity. In the next chapter we shall discuss the concept of continuity in detail and prove that the indefinite integral is always a continuous function.) 2.19 Exercises) Evaluate the integrals in Exercises 1 through 16. 1. f'\\\" (1 + t + t 2 ) dt. 9. . 0 2.

Before we give a precise technical definition of continuity, we shall briefly discuss the concept in an informal and intuitive way to give the reader a feeling for its meaning. Roughly speaking, the situation is this: Supposea function f has the value f(p) at a certain point p. Thenfis said to be continuous at p if at every nearby point x the function) y) y) x) x) -3 -2 -1 0) 2) 3) 4) o) (a) A jump discontinuity at each integer. (b) An infinite discontinuity at O. FIGURE 3.1 Illustrating two kinds of discontinlJities.) valuef(x) is closeto f(p). Another way of putting it is as follows: If we let x move toward p, we want the corresponding function values f(x) to become arbitrarily close to f(p), regardless of the manner in which x approaches p. We do not want sudden jumps in the values of a continuous function, as in the examples in Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1(a) shows the graph of the function f defined by the equation f(x) = x - [x], where [x] denotes the greatest integer < x. At each integer we have what is known as a jump discontinuity. For example, f(2) = 0, but as x approaches 2 from the left, f(x) approaches the value 1, which is not equal to f(2). Therefore we have a discontinuity at 2. Note that f(x) does approach f(2) if we let x approach 2 from the right, but this by itself is not enough to establish continuity at 2. In a case like this, the function is called continuous from the right at 2 and discontinuous from the left at 2. Continuity at a point requires both continuity from the left and from the right. 126))) The definition of the limit of a function) 127) In the early development of calculus almost all functions that were dealt with were continuous and there was no real need at that time for a penetrating look into the exact meaning of continuity. It was not until late in the 18th century that discontinuous functions began appearing in connection with various kinds of physicalproblems.In particular, the work of J. B. J. Fourier (1758-1830)on the theory of heat forced mathematicians of the early 19th century to examine more carefully the exact meaning of such conceptsas function and continuity. Although the meaning of the word \\\"continuous\\\" seems intuitively clear to most people, it is not obvious how a good definition of this idea should be formulated. One popular dictionary explains continuity as follows: Continuity: Quality or state of being continuous. Continuous: Having continuity of parts. Trying to learn the meaning of continuity from these two statements alone is like trying to learn Chinese with only a Chinese dictionary. A satisfactory mathematical definition of continuity, expressed entirely in terms of properties of the real-number system, was first formulated in 1821 by the French mathematician, Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789-1857). His definition, which is still used today, is most easily explained in terms of the limit concept to which we turn now.) 3.2 The definition of the limit of a function Let f be a function defined in some open interval containing a point p, although we do not insist that f be defined at the point p itself. Let A be a real number. The equation) limf{x) = A x-p) is read: \\\"The limit of f{x), as x approaches p, is equal to A,\\\" or \\\"f(x) approaches A as x approaches p.\\\" It is also written without the limit symbol, as follows:) f(x) \\037 A) as x \\037 p .) This symbolism is intended to convey the idea that we can make f(x) as close to A as we please, provided we choose x sufficiently close to p. Our first task is to explain the meaning of thesesymbolsentirely in terms of real numbers. We shall do this in two stages. First we introduce the concept of a neighborhood of a point, then we define limits in terms of neighborhoods.) DEFINITION OF NEIGHBORHOOD OF A POINT. Any open interval containing a point p as its midpoint is called a neighborhood of p.) Notation. We denote neighborhoods by N(p), Nt(p), N 2(p), etc. Since a neighborhood N(p) is an open interval symmetric about p, it consists of all real x satisfying p - r < x < p + r for some r > O. The positive number r is called the radius of the neighborhood. We designate N(p) by N(p; r) if we wish to specify its radius. The inequalitiesp - r < x < p + r are equivalent to -r < x - p < r, and to Ix - pi < r. Thus, N(p; r) consists of all points x whosedistance from p is less than r.))) 128) Continuous functions) In the next definition, we assume that A is a real number and that f is a function defined on some neighborhood of a point p (except possibly at p). The function f may also be defined at p but this is irrelevant in the definition.) DEFINITION OF LIMIT OF A FUNCTION. The symbolism) limf(x) = A x-+p) [or f(x) \\037 A) as x \\037 p]) means that for every neighborhood NI(A) there is some neighborhood N 2 (p) such that) (3.1 )) f(x) E N 1(A)) whenever x E N 2(p)) and x \\037 p .) The first thing to note about this definition is that it involves two neighborhoods, N I (A) and N 2 (p). The neighborhood NI(A) is specifiedfirst,. it tells us how close we wish f(x) to) A) f) 7 P Neighborhood N 2 (p))Neighborhood N 2(p)) FIGURE 3.2 Here lim f(x) = A, but there x--p is no assertion about f at p.) FIGURE 3.3 Here f is defined at p and lim f(x) = f(p), hence fis continuous at p. x--p) be to the limit A. The secondneighborhood,N2(p), tells us how close x should be to p so that f(x) will be within the first neighborhood NI(A). The essential part of the definition is that, for every NI(A), no matter how small, there is some neighborhood N2 (p) to satisfy (3.1). In general, the neighborhoodN2 (p) will depend on the choice of NI(A). A neighbor- hood N 2(p) that works for one particular NI(A) will also work, of course, for every larger NI(A), but it- may not be suitable for any smaller NI(A). The definition of limit may be illustrated geometrically as in Figure 3.2. A neighborhood N 1(A) is shown on the y-axis. A neighborhood N 2 (p) corresponding to NI(A) is shown on the x-axis. The shaded rectangle consists of all points (x, y) for which x E N 2(p) and y E NI(A). The definition of limit asserts that the entire graph off above the interval N 2 (p) lies within this rectangle, exceptpossibly for the point on the graph above p itself.))) The definition of the limit of a function) 129) The definition of limit can also be formulated in terms of the radii of the neighborhoods N1(A) and N 2 (p). It is customary to denote the radius of N 1(A) by E (the Greek letter epsilon) and the radius of N2 (p) by D (the Greek letter delta). The statementf(x) E N 1(A) is equivalent to the inequality If(x) - A I < E, and the statement x E N 2(p), X \\302\\245:p, is equivalent to the inequalities 0 < Ix- pi < D. Therefore, the definition of limit can also be expressed as follows: The symbollim x -+ pf(x) = A means that for every E > 0, there is aD> 0 such that) (3.2)) If(x) - A I < E) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D .) We note that the three statements,) limf(x) = A ,) lim (f(x) - A) = 0 , x-+p) lim If(x) - AI = 0,) x-+p) x-+p) are all equivalent. This equivalence becomes apparent as soon as we write each of these statements in the E, D-terminology (3.2). In dealing with limits as x \\037 p, we sometimes find it convenient to denote the difference x - p by a new symbol, say h, and to let h \\037 O. This simply amounts to a change in notation, because, as can be easily verified, the following two statements are equivalent:) limf(x) = A , x-+p) limf(p + h) = A . h-+O) EXAMPLE 1. Limit of a constant function. Let f(x) = c for all x. It is easy to prove that for every p, we have lim x -+ pf(x) = c. In fact, given any neighborhood N 1(c), relation (3.1)is trivially satisfied for any choice of N2 (p) because f(x) = c for all x and c E N 1(c) for all neighborhoods N 1(c). In limit notation, we write) lim c = c .) x-+p) EXAMPLE 2. Limit of the identity function. Here f(x) = x for all x. We can easily prove that limx-+pf(x) = p. Choose any neighborhood N 1(p) and take N2 (p) = N 1(p). Then relation (3.1)is trivially satisfied. In limit notation, we write) lim x = p . x-+p) \\\"One-sided\\\" limits may be defined in a similar way. For example, iff(x) \\037 A as x \\037 p through values greater than p, we say that A is the right-hand limit off at p, and we indicate this by writing) limf(x) = A . x-+p+) In neighborhood terminology this means that for every neighborhood N1(A), there is some neighborhood N 2 (p) such that) (3.3)) I(x) E N 1(A)) whenever x E N 2(p)) and x > p.))) 130) Continuous functions) Left-hand limits, denoted by writing x \\037 p -, are similarly defined by restricting x to val ues less than p. Iff has a limit A at p, then it also has a right-hand limit and a left-hand limit at p, both of these beingequal to A. But a function can have a right-hand limit at p different from the left-hand limit, as indicated in the next example.) EXAMPLE 3. Let f(x) = [x] for all x, and let p be any integer. For x near p, x < p, we have f(x) = p - 1, and for x near p, x > p, we have f(x) = p. Therefore we see that) lim f(x) = p - 1 x-+p-) and) lim f(x) = p . x-+p+) In an example like this one, where the right- and left-hand limits are unequal, the limit of fat p does not exist.) EXAMPLE 4. Let f(x) = Ijx 2 if x \\302\\245:0, and let f(O) = O. The graph of f near zero is shown in Figure 3.1 (b). In this example, f takes arbitrarily large values near 0 so it has no right-hand limit and no left-hand limit at O. To prove rigorously. that there is no real number A such that limx-+o+f(x) = A, we may argue as follows: Suppose there were such an A, say A > 0. Choose a neighborhood N1(A) of length 1. In the interval 0 < x < 1j(A + 2), we have f(x) = Ijx2> (A + 2)2 > A + 2, sof(x) cannot lie in the neighborhood N 1(A). Thus, every neighborhood N(O) contains points x > 0 for which f(x) is outside N 1(A), so (3.3)is violated for this choice of N1(A). Hencef has no right-hand limit at O.) EXAMPLE 5. Let f(x) = 1 if x \\302\\245:0, and let f(O) = O. This function takes the constant value 1 everywhereexcept at 0, where it has the value O. Both the right- and left-hand limits are 1 at every point p, so the limit of f(x), as x approachesp, exists and equals 1. Note that the limit off is 1 at the point 0, even though f(O) = O.) 3.3 The definition of continuity of a function In the definition of limit we made no assertion about the behavior of f at the point p itself. Statement (3.1) refers to those x \\302\\245:p which lie in N 2 (p), so it is not necessary that f be defined at p. Moreover, even iff is defined at p, its value there need not be equal to the limit A. However, if it happens thatfis defined atp and if it also happens thatf(p) = A, then we say the function f is continuous at p. In other words,we have the following defini ti on.) DEFINITION OF CONTINUITY OF A FUNCTION AT A POINT. A function f is said to be con- t inuous at a poin t p if) (a) f is defined at p, and (b) limf(x)=f(p) .) x--+-p) This definition can also be formulated in terms of neigh borhoods. A function f is continuous at p if for every neighborhoodN1[f(p)] there is a neighborhood N 2 (p) such that) (3.4)) f(x) E N 1[f(p)]) whenever x E N 2(p).))) The basic limit theorems. More examplesof continuous functions 131) Since f(p) always belongs to N1[f(p)], we do not need the condition x \\302\\245:p in (3.4). In the E, \\037-terminology, where we specify the radii of the neighborhoods, the definition of continuity can be restated as follows: A function f is continuous at p if for every E > 0 there is a \\037> 0 such that) If(x) - f(p) I < E) whenever Ix - pi < \\037.) The definition of continuity is illustrated geometrically in Figure 3.3. This is like Figure 3.2 except that the limiting value, A, is equal to the function value f(p) so the entire graph off above N 2(p) lies in the shaded rectangle.) EXAMPLE 1. Constant functions are continuous everywhere. If f(x) = c for all x, then) limf(x) = lim c = c = f(p)) x.....p X\\\"'\\\"1)) for every p, so f is continuous everywhere.) EXAMPLE 2. The identity function is continuous everYM'here. If f(x) = x for all x, we have) limf(x) = lim x = p = f(p)) x.....p x.....p) for every p, so the identity function is continuous everywhere.) EXAMPLE 3. Let f(x) = [x] for all x. This function is continuous at every point p which is not an integer. At the integers it is discontinuous, since the limit off does not exist, the right- and left-hand limits being unequa1. A discontinuity of this type, where the right- and left-hand limits exist but are unequal, is called a jump discontinuity. However, since the right-hand limit equals f(p) at each integerp, we say that f is continuous from the right at p.) EXAMPLE 4. The function f for which f(x) = 1/ x 2 for x \\302\\245:0, f(O) = 0, is discontinuous at O. [SeeFigure 3.1 (b).] We say there is an infinite discontinuity at 0 because the function takes arbitrarily large values near O.) EXAMPLE 5. Let f(x) = 1 for x \\302\\245:0, f(O) = O. This function is continuous everywhere except at O. It is discontinuousat 0 because f(O) is not equal to the limit of f(x) as x -+ O. In this example, the discontinuity could be removed by redefining the function at 0 to have the value 1 instead of O. For this reason, a discontinuity of this type is called a removable discontinuity. Note that jump discontinuities, such as those possessedby the greatest-integer function, cannot be removed by simply changing the value off at one point.) 3.4 The basic limit theorems. More examples of continuous functions Calculations with limits may often be simplified by the use of the following theorem which provides basic rules for operating with limits.))) 132 Continuous functions) THEOREM 3.1. Let f and g be functions such that) lim f(x) = A , x-+p) limg(x) = B. x-+p) Then )-i'e have) (i) lim [f(x) + g(x)]= A + B , x-+p) (ii) lim [f(x) - g(x)]= A - B ,) x-+p) (iii) lim f(x) . g(x) = A . B ,) x-+p) (iv) limf(x)/g(x) = A/B x-+p) if B \\037 0 .) Note: An important special case of (iii) occurs whenfis constant, say f(x) = A for all x. In this case, (iii) is written as lim A . g(x) = A . B. x-+p) The proof of Theorem 3.1 is not difficult but it is somewhat lengthy so we have placed it in a separate section (Section 3.5). We discuss here some simple consequences of the theorem. First we note that the statements in the theorem may be written in a slightly different form. For example, (i) can be written as follows:) lim [f(x) + g(x)] = lim f(x) + lim g(x) .) x-+p) x-+p) x-+p) It tells us that the limit of a sum is the sum of the lin1its. It is customary to denote by f + g, f - g,f' g, and fig the functions whose values at each x under consideration are) f(x) + g(x),) f(x) - g(x),) f(x) \\302\\267 g(x),) and) f(x)lg(x) ,) respectively. These functions are called the sum, difference, product, and quotient off and g. Of course,the quotient fig is defined only at those points for which g(x) \\302\\245:O. The following corollary to Theorem 3.1 is stated in this terminology and notation and is concerned with continuous functions.) THEOREM 3.2. Let f and g be continuous at a point p. Then the sum f + g, the difference f - g, and the product f' g are also continuous at p. The same is true of the quotient fig if g(p) \\302\\245:O.) Proof Since f and g are continuous at p, we have lim x -+ pf(x) = f(p) and lim x -+ p g(x) = g(p). Therefore we may apply the limit formulas in Theorem 3.1 with A = f(p) and B = g(p) to deduce Theorem 3.2.))) The basic /inlit theore/1ls. More examplesof continuous functions 133) We have already seen that the identity function and constant functions are continuous everywhere. Using these examples and Theorem 3.2,we may construct many more examples of continuous functions.) EXAMPLE 1. Continuity of polynomials.If we take f(x) = g(x) = x, the result on conti- nuity of products proves the continuity at each point for the function whose value at each x is x2 . By mathematical induction, it follows that for every real c and every positive integer n, the function f for which f(x) = cx U is continuous for all x. Since the sum of two con- tinuous functions is itself continuous, by induction it follows that the same is true for the sum of any finite number of continuous functions. Therefore every polynomial p(x) = L\\037=o CkX k is continuous at all points.) EXAMPLE 2. Continuity of rational functions. The quotient of two polynomials is called a rational function. If r is a rational function, then we have) rex) = p(x) , q(x)) where p and q are polynomials. The function r is defined for all real x for which q(x) \\302\\245:O. Since quotients of continuous functions are continuous, we see that every rational function is continuous wherever it is defined. A simple example is rex) = 1 Ix if x \\302\\245:O. This function is continuous everywhereexcept at x = 0, where it fails to be defined. The next theorem shows that if a function g is squeezed between two other functions which have equal limits as x \\037 p, then g also has this limit as x \\037 p.) THEOREM 3.3. SQUEEZING PRINCIPLE. Suppose that f(x) < g(x) < hex) for all x \\302\\245:p in some neighborhood N(p). Supposealso that) limf(x) = lim hex) = a . x-+p x-+p) Then \\\\re also have lim x-+ p g(x) = a.) Proof Let G(x) = g(x) - f(x), and H(x) = hex) - f(x). The inequalities f < g < h imply 0 < g - f < h - f, or) o < G(x) < H(x)) for all x \\302\\245:p in N(p). To prove the theorem, it suffices to show that G(x) \\037 0 as x \\037 p, given that H(x) \\037 0 as x \\037 p. Let N 1(0) be any neighborhood of o. Since H(x) \\037 0 as x \\037 p, there is a neighborhood N2 (p) such that) H(x) E N 1(0)) whenever x E N 2(p)) and x \\302\\245:p .) We can assume that N 2 (p) c N(p). Then the inequality 0 < G < H states that G(x) is no))) 134) Continuous functions) further from 0 than H(x) if x is in N 2(p), x \\302\\245:p. Therefore G(x) E N 1(0) for such x, and hence G(x) \\037 0 as x \\037 p. This proves the theorem. The same proof is valid if all the limits are one-sidedlimits. The squeezing principle is useful in practice because it is often possible to find squeezing functions f and h which are easier to deal with than g. We shall use the result now to prove that every indefinite integral is a continuous function.) THEOREM 3.4. CONTINUITY OF INDEFINITE INTEGRALS. Assume f is integrable on [a, x] for ever}' x in [a, b], and let) A(x) = I: f(t) dt .) Then the ind\\037finite integral A is continuous at each point of [a, b]. (At each endpoint 11'ehave one-sided continuity.)) Proof Choose p in [a, b]. We are to prove that A(x) \\037 A(p) as x \\037 p. We have) (3.5)) A(x) - A(p) = .r: f(t) dt \\302\\267) Now we estimate the size of this integral. Since f is bounded on [a, b], there is a constant M > 0 such that - M < f(t) < M for all t in [a, b]. If x > p, we integrate these inequalities over the interval [p, x] to obtain) -M(x - p) < A(x) - A(p) < M(x - p).) If x < p, we obtain the same inequalities with x - p replaced by p - x. Therefore, in either case we can let x \\037 p and apply the squeezing principle to find that A(x) \\037 A(p). This proves the theorem. If p is an endpoint of [a, b], we must let x \\037 p from inside the interval, so the limits are one-sided.) EXAMPLE 3. Continuity of the sine and cosine. Since the sine function is an indefinite integral, sin x = J: cos t dt, the foregoing theorem tells us that the sine is continuous everywhere. Similarly, the cosine is everywhere continuous since cosx = 1- J: sin t dt. The continuity of these functions can also be deduced without making use of the fact that they are indefinite integrals. An alternate proof is outlined in Exercise 26 of Section 3.6.) EXAMPLE 4. In this example we prove an important limit formula,) (3.6)) 1 . SIn x 11m - = , x-+O X) that is needed later in our discussion of differential calculus. Sincethe denominator of the quotient (sin x)fx approaches0 as x \\037 0, we cannot apply the quotient theorem on limits))) Proofs of the basic /inlit theorems) 135) to deduce (3.6). Instead, we use the squeezing principle. From Section 2.5 we have the fundamental inequalities) SIn x 1 o < cos x < - < x cos x) valid for 0 < x < !7T. They are also valid for -!7T < x < 0 since cos (-x) = cos x and sin (-x) = -sin x,and hence they hold for all x \\037 0 in the neighborhood N(O; t7T). When x \\037 0, we find cos x \\037 1 since the cosine is continuous at 0, and hence 1/(cosx) \\037 1. Therefore, by the squeezing principle, we deduce (3.6). If we define f(x) = (sin x)lx for x \\302\\245:0, f(O) = 1, then f is continuous everywhere. Its graph is shown in Figure 3.4.) y) lim/(x) = I = /(0) x--o /) x) FIGURE 3.4 ,(x) = (sin x)/x if x \\0370, [(0) = 1. This function is continuous everywhere.) EXAMPLE 5. Continuity offM-'henf(x) = x Tfor x > 0, M-,here r is a positive rational number. From Theorem 2.2 we have the integration formula) I x xl+lln t lln dt = , o 1 + 11n) valid for all x > 0 and every integer n > 1. Using Theorems3.4and 3.1, we find that the function A given by A(x) = xl+l/n is continuous at all points p > O. Now let g(x) = xl/n = A(x)lx for x > O. Since g is a quotient of two continuous functions it, too, is continuous at all points p > O. More generally, if f(x) = xm / n , where m is a positive integer, then f is a product of continuous functions and hence is continuous at all points p > O. This establishes the continuity of the rth-power function, f(x) = x T , when r is any positive rational number, at all points p > O. At P = 0 we have right-hand continuity. The continuity of the rth-power function for rational r can also be deducedwithout using integrals. An alternate proof is given in Section 3.13.) 3.5 Proofs of the basic limit theorems In this section we prove Theorem 3.1 which describes the basic rules for dealing with limits of sums, products, and quotients. The principal algebraic tools used in the proof))) 136) Continuous functions) are two properties of absolute values that were mentioned earlier in Sections 14.8 and 14.9. They are (1) the triangle inequality, which states that la + bl < lal + Ibl for all real a and b, and (2) the equation labl = lallbl, which states that the absolute value of a product is the product of absolute values.) Proofs of (i) and (ii). Since the two statements) limf(x) = A) and) lim [f(x) - A] = 0) x-+p) x-+p) are equivalent, and since we have) f(x) + g(x) - (A + B) = [f(x) - A] + [g(x) - B] ,) it suffices to prove part (i) of the theorem when the limits A and B are both zero. Suppose,then, thatf(x) --* 0 and g(x) --*0 as x --* p. We shall prove thatf(x) + g(x) \\037 0 as x --*p. This means we must show that for every E > 0 there is aD> 0 such that) (3.7)) If(x) + g(x)1 < E) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D .) Let E be given. Since f(x) --*0 as x --* p, there is a Dl > 0 such that) (3.8)) E If(x)1 < - 2) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < Dl .) Similarly, since g(x) \\037 0 as x \\037 p, there is a D 2 > 0 such that) (3.9)) E Ig(x)1 < - 2) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D 2 .) If we let D denote the smaller of the two numbers Dl and D 2 , then both inequalities (3.8) and (3.9)are valid if 0 < Ix - pi < D and hence, by the triangle inequality, we find that) E E If(x) + g(x) I < If(x)1 + Ig(x)1< '2 + 2 = E .) This proves (3.7) which, in turn, proves (i). The proof of (ii) is entirely similar, except that in the last step we use the inequality If(x) - g(x)I < If(x)1 + Ig(x)l.) Proof of (iii). Suppose that we have proved part (iii) for the special case in which one of the Ilmits is O. Then the general case follows easily from this special case. In fact, all we need to do is write) f(x)g(x) - AB = f(x) [g(x)- B] + B[f(x) - A] .) The special case implies that each term on the right approaches 0 as x ---+ p and, by property))) Proofs of the basic Ii/nit theore/11s) 137) (i), the sum of the two terms also approaches O. Therefore, it remains to prove (iii) in the special case where one of the limits, say B, is O. Suppose,then, thatj'(x) --* A and g(x) -> 0 as x --* p. We wish to prove thatf(x)g(x) \\037 0 as x --*p. To do this we must show that if a positive E is given, there is aD> 0 such that) (3.10)) If(x)g(x) I < E) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D .) Since f(x) --* A as x --*p, there is a Dl such that) (3.11)) If(x) - AI < 1) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < Dl .) For such x, we have I/(x)1 = 11'(.x)- A + AI < I/(x) - AI + IAI < 1 + IAI, and hence) (3.12)) If(x)g(x) I = If(x)llg(x)1 < (1 + IAI) Ig(x)l.) Since g(x) --* 0 as x ---+ p, for every E > 0 there is a D 2 such that) (3.13)) E Ig(x)1 < 1 + IAI) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D 2 .) Therefore, if we let D be the smaller of the two numbers Dl and D 2 , then both inequalities (3.12) and (3.13) are valid whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D, and for such x we deduce (3.10). This completes the proof of (iii).) Proof of(iv). Sincethe quotientf(x)/g(x) is the product of f(x)/B with B/g(x), it suffices to prove that B/g(x) --* 1 as x --*p and then appeal to (iii). Let hex) = g(x)/B. Then hex) \\037 1 as x --* p, and we wish to prove that l/h(x) --* 1 as x --* p. Let E > 0 be given. We must show that there is aD> 0 such that) (3.14)) 1 --1 <E hex)) whenever 0 < Ix - pi < b .) The difference to be estimated may be written as follows.) (3.15)) --L-1 _ hex)) Ihex) - 11 Ih(x)1) Since hex) --* 1 as x \\037 p, we can choose aD> 0 such that both inequalities) (3.16)) E Ih(x) - 11 < - 2) and) 1 Ih(x) - 11< - 2) are satisfied whenever 0 < Ix - pi < D. The second of these inequalitiesimplies hex) > t so 1/lh(x)1= l/h(x)< 2 for such x. Using this in (3.15) along with the first inequality in (3.16), we obtain (3.14). This completes the proof of (iv).))) 138) Continuous functions) 3.6 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 10, compute the limits and explain which limit theorems you are using in each case.) 1 1. lim 2 \\302\\267 x\\0372X 25x 3 + 2 2. lim 75 7 - 2 \\302\\267 x\\037o X x 2 - 4 3. lim 2 ' x\\0372 X - 2X2 - 3x + 1 4. lim l ' 00--1 X - (t + h)2 - t 2 5. lim h . h\\037O) x 2 - a 2 8. lim 2 2 ' a \\037 O. x\\037ax +2ax+a) 9. lim tan t. t\\037o) 10. lim (sin 2t + t 2 cos 5t). t\\037O) .

In this section we learn a new way to construct functions by an operation known as composition. We illustrate with an example. Let f(x) = sin (x 2). To compute f(x), we first square x and then take the sine of x 2 . Thus, f(x) is obtained by combining two other functions, the squaring function and the sine function. If we let vex) = x2 and u(x) = sin x, we can expressf(x) in terms of u and v by writing) f(x) = u[v(x)] .) We say that f is the composition of u and v (in that order). If we compose v and u in the opposite order, we obtain a different result, v[u(x)] = (sin X)2. That is, to compute v[u(x)], we take the sine of x first and then square sin x. Now we can carry out this process more generally. Let u and v be any two given functions. The compositeor compositionof u and v (in that order) is definedto be the function f for which) f(x) = u[v(x)]) (read as \\\"u of v of x\\\") .) That is, to evaluate f at x we first compute vex) and then evaluate u at the point vex). Of course,this presupposes'that it makes sense to evaluate u at vex), and therefore f will be defined only at those points x for which vex) is in the domain of u. For ex ample, if u(x) = v\\037 and vex) = 1 - x 2 , then the composite f is given by f(x) = VI - x 2 . Note that v is defined for all real x, whereasu is defined only for x > 0. There- fore the composite f is defined only for those x satisfying 1 - x 2 > O. Formally, f(x) is obtained by substituting vex) for x in the expression u(x). For this reason, the function f is sometimes denoted by the symbol f = u(v) (read as \\\"u of v\\. Another notation that we shall use to denote composition isf = u 0 v (read as \\\"u circle v\\.\") This resembles the notation for the product u . v. In fact, we shall see in a moment that the operation of compositionhas some of the properties possessed by multiplication. The composite of three or more functions may be found by composing them two at a time. Thus, the functionf given by) f(x) = cas [sin (x2)]) is a composition, f = u 0 (v 0 w), where) u(x) = cos x ,) v(x) = sin x ,) and) w(x) = x 2 .) Notice that the samefcan be obtained by composing u and v first and then composing u 0 v))) Composite functions and continuity) 141) with }v, thus: f = (u 0 v) 0 w. This illustrates the associative law for composition which states that) (3.17)) u 0 (v 0 J-v) = (u 0 v) 0 w) for all functions u, v, }v, provided it makes sense to form all the composites in question. The reader will find that the proof of (3.17)is a straightforward exercise. It should be noted that the commutative la\\302\\273',u 0 v = v 0 u, does not always hold for composition.For example, if u(x) = sin x and vex) = x 2 , the composite f = u 0 v is given by f(x) = sin x2 (which means sin (x 2 )], whereas the composition g = v 0 u is given by g(x) = sin2 x [which means (sin X)2]. Now we shall prove a theorem which tells us that the property of continuity is preserved under the operation of composition. More precisely, we have the following.) THEOREM 3.5. Assume v is continuous at p and that u is continuous at q, }vhere q = v(p). Then the composite function f = u 0 v is continuous at p.) Proof Sinceu is continuous at q, for every neighborhoodN1[u(q)] there is a neighborhood N 2 (q) such that) (3.18)) u(y) E N 1[u(q)]) whenever y E N 2 (q) .) But q = v(p) and v is continuous at p, so for the neighborhood N2 (q) there is another neighborhood N3 (p) such that) (3.19)) vex) E N 2(q)) whenever x E N 3(p) .) If we let y = vex) and combine (3.18)with (3.19), we find that for every neighborhood Nt(u[v(p)]) there is a neighborhood N 3 (p) such that) u[v(x)] E N 1(u[v(p)]) whenever x E N 3(p) ,) or, in other words, since f(x) = u[v(x)],) f(x) E N 1[f(p)]) whenever x E N 3(p) .) This means that f is continuous at p, as asserted.) EXAMPLE 1. Let f(x) = sin x2 . This is the composition of two functions continuous everywhere so f is continuous everywhere.) EXAMPLE 2. Let f(x) = V I - x 2 = u[v(x)], where u(x) =\\037, vex) = 1 - x2 . The function v is continuous everywhere but u is continuous only for points x > 0. Hence f is continuous at those points x for which vex) > 0, that is at all points satisfying x 2 < 1.))) 142 Continuous functions) 3.8 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 10, the functions [and g are defined by the formulas given.

Most of these properties appear obvious when inter- preted geometrically; consequently many people are inclined to accept them as self-evident.))) Bolzano's theorem for continuous functions) 143) However, it is important to realize that these statements are no more self-evident than the definition of continuity itself, and therefore they require proof if they are to be used with any degree of generality. The proofs of most of theseproperties make use of the least-upper- bound axiom for the real number system. Bernard Bolzano(1781-1848),a Catholic priest who made many important contributions to mathematics in the first half of the 19th century, was one of the first to recognize that many \\\"obvious\\\" statements about continuous functions require proof. His observations concerning continuity were published posthumously in 1850 in an important book, Para- doxien des Unendlichen. One of his results, now known as the theorem of Bolzano, is illustrated in Figure 3.6, where the graph of a continuous function f is shown. The graph liesbelowthe x-axis at x = a and above the axis at x = b. Bolzano's theorem asserts that the curve must cross the axis somewhere between a and b. This property, first published by Bolzano in 1817, may be stated formally as follows.) THEOREM 3.6. BOLZANO'S THEOREM. Let f be continuous a,t each point of a closedinterval [a, b] and assume that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. Then there is at least one c in the open interval (a, b) such that f(c) = o.) We shall base our proof of Bolzano'stheorem on the following property of continuous functions which we state here as a separate theorem.) THEOREM 3.7. SIGN-PRESERVING PROPERTY OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS. Let f be con- tinuous at c and suppose that f( c) \\037 O. Then there is an interval (c - \\037,c + \\037) about c in }vhich f has the same sign asf( c).) Proof of Theorem 3.7. Suppose f(c) > O. By continuity, for every \\342\\202\\254> 0 there IS a \\037> 0 such that) (3.20)) f(c) - \\342\\202\\254<f(x) <f(c) + \\342\\202\\254)whenever c - \\037< x < c + \\037.) If we take the \\037corresponding to \\342\\202\\254= f(c)/2 (this \\342\\202\\254is positive), then (3.20) becomes) !f(c) <f(x) < !f(c)) whenever c - \\037< x < c + \\037.) \\037!(c) !(c)) !!( c)) C - 0) c) C + 0) FIGURE 3.6 Illustrating Bolzano's theorem.) FIGURE 3.7 Here f(x) > 0 for x near c because f(c) > O.))) 144) Continuous junctions) (See Figure 3.7). Therefore f(x) > 0 in this interval, and hence f(x) and fee) have the same sign. Iff(e) < 0, we take the \\037corresponding to \\342\\202\\254= -tf(e) and arrive at the same conclusion.) Note: If there is one-sided continuity at c, then there is a corresponding one-sided interval [c, c + 0) or (c - 0, c] in which f has the same sign as f(c).) Proof of Bolzano's theorem. To be specific, assume f(a) < 0 and f(b) > 0, as shown in Figure 3.6. There may be many values of x between a and b for which f(x) = O. Our problem is to find one. We shall do this by finding the largest x for which f(x) = O. For this purpose we let S denote the set of all those points x in the interval [a, b] for which f(x) < O. There is at least one point in S because f(a) < O. Therefore S is a nonempty set. Also, S is bounded above since all of S lies within [a, b], so S has a supremum. Let e = sup S. We shall prove thatf(e) = O. There are only three possibilities: fee) > 0,fee)< 0, and fee) = O. If fee) > 0, there is an interval (e - \\037, e + \\037), or (e - \\037,e] if e = b, in which f is positive. Therefore no points of S can lie to the right of e - \\037,and hence e - \\037is an upper bound for the set S. But e - \\037< e, and e is the least upper bound of S. Therefore the inequality fee) > 0 is impossible. If fee) < 0, there is an interval (e - \\037, e + \\037), or [e, e + \\037) if e = a, in which f is negative. Hence f(x) < 0 for some x > e, contradicting the fact that e is an upper bound for S. Thereforef(e)< 0 is also impossible, and the on'ly remaining possibility is fee) = o. Also, a < e < b because f(a) < 0 and f(b) > O. This proves Bolzano's theorem.) 3.10 The intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions An immediate consequence of Bolzano's theorem is the intermediate-valuetheorem for continuous functions, illustrated in Figure 3.8.) THEOREM 3.8. Let f be continuous at each point of a closedinterval [a, b]. Choose t}-vo arbitrary points Xl < X 2 in [a, b] such that f(x l ) \\302\\245:-f(x 2). Then f takes on every value between f(x t ) and f(x2) somea'here in the interval (Xl' x 2 ).) Proof Suppose f(x 1) < f(x2)and let k be any value between f(x l) and f(x 2). Let g be the function defined on [Xl' X 2 ] as follows:) g(x) = f{x) - k .) - f(x) = k) . a: I f(a)-') b) a) Xl) X2) I b) FIGURE 3.8 Illustrating the intermediate- value theorem.) FIGURE 3.9 An example for which Balzano's theorem is not applicable.))) Exercises) 145) Then g is continuous at each point of [Xl' X2], and we have) g(X!) = f(x l) - k < 0 ,) g(X 2) = f(x2) - k > 0 .) Applying Bolzano's theorem to g, we have g(c)= 0 for some c between Xl and x 2 . But this means f(c) = k, and the proof is complete.) Note: In both Bolzano's theorem and the intermediate-value theorem, it is assumed that lis continuous at each point of [a, b], including the endpoints a and b. To understand why continuity at both endpoints is necessary, we refer to the curve in Figure 3.9. Here I is continuous everywhere in [a, b] except at a. Although I(a) is negative and I(b) is positive, there is no x in [a, b] for which I(x) = o. We conclude this section with an application of the intermediate-value theorem in which we prove that every positive real number has a positive nth root, a fact mentioned earlier in Section I 3.14. We state this as a formal theorem.) THEOREM 3.9. If n is a positive integer and if a > 0, then there is exactly one positive b such that b n = a.) Proof Choose c > 1 such that 0 < a < c, and considerthe function f defined on the interval [0, c] by the equation f(x) = x n . This function is continuous on [0,c], and at the endpoints we have f(O) = 0,f(c) = en. Since 0 < a < c < en, the given number a lies between the function values f(O) and fee). Therefore, by the intermediate-value theorem, we have f(x) = a for some X in (0, c), say for X = b. This proves the existence of at least one positive b such that b n = a. There cannot be more than one such b because f is strictly increasing on [0, c]. This completesthe proof.) 3.11 Exercises) 1. LetI be a polynomial of degree n, say I(x) = 'L;=ockxh:,such that the first and last coefficients Co and Cn have opposite signs. Prove that I(x) = 0 for at least one positive x. 2. A real number Xl , such that I(x l ) = 0, is said to be a real root of the equation I(x) = o. We say that a real root of an equation has been isolated if we exhibit an interval [a, b] containing this root and no others. With the aid of Bolzano's theorem, isolatethe real roots of each of the following equations (each has four real roots). (a) 3x4 - 2x 3 - 36x 2 + 36x - 8 = O. (b) 2x 4 - 14x 2 + 14x - 1 = O.

Although 1(1Tf4) = 1 and 1(31Tf4)= -1, there is no X in the interval [1T/4, 31T/4] such that I(x) = O. Explain why this does not contradict Bolzano's theorem. 5. Given a real-valued function I which is continuous on the closed interval [0, 1]. Assume that o < /(x) < 1 for each X in [0, 1]. Prove that there is at least one point C in [0, 1] for which I(c) = c. Such a point is called a fixed point off The result of this exercise is a special case of Brouwer's fixed-point theorem. [Hint: Apply Bolzano's theorem to g(x) = I(x) - x.] 6. Given a real-valued function.r which is continuous on the closed interval [a, b]. Assume that I(a) \\037a and that I(b) > b. Prove that I has a fixed point in [a, b]. (See Exercise5.)))) 146) Continuous functions) 3.12 The process of inversion This section describes another important method that is often used to construct new functions from given ones. Before we describethe method in detail, we will illustrate it with a simple example. Considerthe function f defined on the interval [0, 2] by the equation f(x) = 2x + 1. The range off is the interval [1, 5]. Each point x in [0, 2] is carried by f onto exactly one point y in [1, 5], namely) (3.21 )) y = 2x + 1.) Conversely, for every y in [1, 5], there is exactlyone x in [0, 2] for which y = I(x). To find this x, we solve Equation (3.21) to obtain) x = !(y - 1).) This equation defines x as a function of y. If we denote this function by g, we have) g(y) = !(y - 1)) for each y in [1, 5]. The function g is called the inverse off Note that g[f(x)] = x for each x in [0,2], and thatf[g(y)] = y for eachy in [1,5]. Consider now a more general functionfwith domain A and range B. For each x in A, there is exactly one y in B such that)l = f(x). For eachy in B, there is at least one x in A such that f(x) = y. Suppose that there is exactly one such x. Then we can define a new function g on B as follows:) g(y) = x) means y = f(x).) In other words, the value of g at each point y in B is that unique x in A such that f(x) = y. This new function g is called the inverse off The process by which g is obtained fromfis called inversion. Note that g[f(x)] = x for all x in A, and thatf[g(y)] = y for all y in B. The process of inversion can be applied to any function f having the property that for each y in the range off, there is exactly one x in the domain off such that f(x) = y. In particular, a function that is continuous and strictly monotonic on an interval [a, b] has this property. An example is shown in Figure 3.10. Let c = f(a), d = f(b). The intermediate- value theorem for continuous functions tells us that in the interval [a, b], f takeson every value between c and d. Moreover,f cannot take on the same value twice becausef(x l) \\302\\245=- f(x 2) whenever Xl \\302\\245=-X2' Therefore, every continuous strictly monotonic function has an Inverse. The relation between a function f and its inverse g can also be simply explained in the ordered-pair formulation of the function concept. In Section 1.3 we describeda function f as a set of ordered pairs (x, y) no two of which have the same first element. The inverse function g is formed by taking the pairs (x, y) infand interchanging the elements x and y. That is, (y, x) E g if and only if (x, y) Ef Iff is strictly monotonic, then no two pairs in! have the same second element, and hence no two pairs of g have the same first element. Thus g is, indeed, a function.))) Properties of functions preserved by inversion) 147) EXAMPLE. The nth-root function. If n is a positive integer, let f(x) = x n for x > O. Then f is strictly increasing on every interval [a, b] with 0 < a < b. The inverse function g is the nth-root function, definedfor y > 0 by the equation) g(y) = yl/n .) 3.13 Properties of functions preserved by inversion Many properties possessed by the function fare transmi tted to the inverse g. Figure 3.11 illustrates the relationship between their graphs. One can be obtained from the other merely by reflection through the line )' = x, because a point (u, v) lies on the graph of f if and only if the point (v, u) lies on the graph of g.) y) y) f( a) = c - - ---) ,,\\\", \\\"\\\"\\\"\\\" \\\"\\ f(b} = d ------------------) f(x) = Y) f \\\"1 Point (u,v) with v = f(u)) x) a) x) b) FIGURE 3.10 A continuous, strictly increasing function.) FIGURE 3.11 Illustrating the process of . . Inversion.) The properties of monotonicity and continuity posse ssed by f are transmitted to the inverse function g, as described by the following theorem.) THEOREM 3.10. Assume f is strictly increasing and continuous on an interval [a, b]. Let c = f(a) and d = f(b) and let g be the inverse off That is, for each)Jin [c, d], let g(y) be that x in [a, b] such that y = f(x). Then (a) g is strictly increasing on [c, d]; (b) g is continuous on [c, d].) Proof Choose Yl < Y2 in [c, d] and let Xl = g(Yl), X 2 = g(Y2)' Then Yl' = f(x l) and Y2 = f(x2)' Since f is strictly increasing, the relation Yl < Y2 implies Xl < x 2 , which, in turn, implies g is strictly increasing on [c, d]. This proves part (a). Now we prove (b). The proof is illustrated in Figure 3.12. Choose a point Yo in the open interval (c, d). To prove g is continuous at Yo, we must show that for every \\342\\202\\254> 0 there is a \\037> 0 such that) (3.22)) g(yo) - \\342\\202\\254< g(y) < g(yo) + \\342\\202\\254)whenever )'0 - b < y < Yo + \\037.)

A slight modification of the argument proves that g is continuous from the right at c, and continuous fronl the left at d. There is a correspondingtheorem for decreasing functions. That is, the inverse of a strictly decreasing continuous function f is strictly decreasing and continuous. This follows by applying Theorem 3.10 to - f) b) g(yo) + f) () is the smaller of these two distances) c -----) \\037f I I I I I I I I I I I a Xo - f Xo Xo+ f b) g(yo) - f) d f(xo + f) Yo f( x 0 - f)) FIGURE 3.12 Proof of the continuity of the inverse function.) EXAMPLE. Continuity of the nth-root function. The nth-root function g, defined for y > 0 by the equation g(y) = yl/n, is strictly increasing and continuous on every interval [c, d] \\\\vith 0 < c < d, since it is the inverse of a strictly increasing continuous function. Th\\037s gives an alternate proof of the continuity of the nth-root function, independent of the thebry of integration. Since the product of continuous functions is continuous, we again deduce the continuity of the rth-power function, hey) = yr, where r = m/n is a positive rational number and y > o.) 3.14 Inverses of piecewise monotonic functions Suppose we try to apply the process of inversion to a function that is not monotonic on [a, b]. For example, suppose thatf(x) = x 2 on an interval of the form [-c, c] on the x-axis. Each point x in this interval is carried by f into exacdy one point y in the interval [0, c2 ], namely,) (3.23)) y = x 2 .) We can solve Equation (3.23) for x in terms of y, but there are t}t1;'O values of x corresponding to each y in (0, c 2 ], namely,) x=0) and) x = -0))) Exercises) 149) As we have mentionedonce before, there was a time when mathematicians would have said that the inverse g in this case is a double-valued function defined by) g(y) = :l:yY.) But since the more modern point of view does not admit double-valuednessas a property of functions, in a case like this we say that the process of inversion gives rise to tu'o new functions, say gl and g2 , where) (3.24)) gl(y) = vY) and) g2(y) = -yY) for each )' in [0, c 2 ] .) To fit this in with the notion of inverseas explained above, we can look upon the equation y = x 2 as defining not one function f but tH'O functions f1 and 12 , say, where) f1(x) = x 2) if 0 < x < c) and) f2(x) = x 2) if -c < x < 0 .) These may be considered as distinct functions because they have different domains. Each function is monotonic on its domain and each has an inverse, the inverse of fl being gl and the inverse off2 being g2, where gl and g2 are given by (3.24). This illustrates how the process of inversion can be applied to piecewise monotonic functions. We simply consider such a function as a union of monotonic functions and invert each monotonic piece. We shall make extensiveuse of the process of inversion in Chapter 6.) 3.15 Exercises) In each of Exercises 1 through 5, show that I is strictly monotonic on the whole real axis. Let g denote the inverse off Describethe domain of g in each case.

The functionfis said to have an absolutemaximum on the set S if there is at least one point c in S such that) f(x) < f(c)) for all x in S .)

These concepts are illustrated in Figure 3.13. In Figure 3.13(a),S is the closed interval [0, 1T] and f(x) = sin x. The absolute minimum, which occurs at both endpoints of the interval, is O. The absolute maximum isf(l1T) = 1. In Figure 3.13(b), S is the closed interval [0, 2] and f(x) = 1/x if x > 0, f(O) = 1. In this example, f has an \\037bsolute minimum at x = 2, but it has no absolute maximum. It fails to have a maximum because of a discontinuity at a point of S. We wish to prove that if S is a closedinterval and if fis continuous everywhere on S, then f has both an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum on S. This result, known as the extreme-value theorem for continuous functions, will be deduced asa simpleconsequence of the following theorem.) THEOREM 3.11. BOUNDEDNESS THEOREM FOR CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS.

The extreme-value theorem for continuous functions) 151) Proof We argue by contradiction, using a technique called the method of successive bisection. Assume that f is unbounded (not bounded) on [a, b]. Let c be the midpoint of [a, b]. Since f is unbounded on [a, b] it is unbounded on at least one of the subintervals [a, c] or [c, b]. Let [aI' b l ] be that half of [a, b] in whichfis unbounded. Iffis unbounded in both halves, let [aI' bl] be the left half, [a, c]. Now continue the bisection process repeatedly, denoting by [a n+ 1 , b n+l ] that half of [an, b n ] in which f is unbounded, with the understanding that we choose the left half iff is un bounded in both halves. Since the length of each interval is half that of its predecessor, we note that the length of [an, b n ] is (b - a)/2 n . Let A denote the set of leftmost endpoints a , a l , a 2 , . . . , so constructed, and let rx be the supremum of A. Then rx lies in [a, b]. By continuity of f at rx, there is an interval of the form (rx - 0, rx + 0) in which) (3.25)) If(x) - f(rx) I < 1 \\302\\267) If rx = a this interval has the form [a, a + 0), and if rx = b it has the form (b - 0,b]. Inequality (3.25) implies) If(x) I < 1 + If(rx)1 ,) so f is bounded by 1 + If( rx)1 in this interval. However, the interval [an, bn ] lies inside (rx - 0, rx + 0) when n is so large that (b - a)/2 n < O. Therefore f is also bounded in [an, b n ], contradicting the fact thatfis unboundedon [an,b n ]. This contradiction completes the proof.) Iff is bounded on [a, b], then the set of all function values f(x) is bounded above and below. Therefore, this set has a supremum and an infimum which we denote by sup f and inf f, respectively. That is, we write) supf= sup {f(x) I a < x < b},) inff= inf {f(x) I a < x < b}.) For any bounded function we have inff < f(x) < supffor all x in [a, b]. Now we prove that a continuous function takes on both values inf f and sup f somewherein [a, b].) THEOREM 3.12. EXTREME-VALUE THEOREM FOR CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS. Assume f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b]. Then there exist points c and d in [a, b] such that) f(c) = sup f) and fed) = inff) Proof It suffices to prove thatfattains its supremum in [a, h]. The result for the infimum then follows as a consequence because the infimum off is the supremum of - f Let M = sup f We shall assume that there is no x in [a, b] for which I(x) = M and obtain a contradiction. Let g(x) = M - f(x). Then g(x) > 0 for all x in [a, b] so the reciprocal 1Ig is continuous on [a, b]. By Theorem 3.11, l/g is bounded on [a, b], say l/g(x) < C for all x in [a, b], where C > O. This implies M - f(x) > l/C,so thatf(x) < M - I/C for all x in [a, b]. This contradicts the fact that M is the least upper bound off on [a, b]. Hence, f(x) = M for at least one x in [a, b].))) 152) Continuous functions) Note: This theorem shows that iff is continuous on [a, b], then sup f is its absolute maximum, and inf fits absolute minimum. Hence, by the intermediate-value theorem, the range off is the closed interval [inf f, sup f].) 3.17 The small-span theorem for continuous functions (uniform continuity) Let f be real-valued and continuous on a closedinterval [a, b] and let M(f) and m(f) denote, respectively, the maximum and minimum values of f on [a, b]. We shall call the difference) M(}') - m(f)) the span of f in the interval [a, b]. Someauthors use the term oscillation instead of span. However, oscillation has the disadvantage of suggesting undulating or wavelike functions. Older texts use the word saltus, which is Latin for leap. The word \\\"span\\\" seems more suggestive of what is being measured here. We note that the span off in any subinterval of [a, b] cannot exceed the span of fin [a, b]. We shall prove next that the interval [a, b] can be partitioned so that the span off in each subinterval is arbitrarily small. More precisely, we have the following theorem which we call the small-span theorem for continuousfunctions. It is usually referred to in the literature as the theorem on uniform continuity.) THEOREM 3.13. Let f be continuous on a closed interval [a, b]. Then, for every E > 0 there is a partition of [a, b] into a finite number of subintervals such that the span off in every subinterval is less than E.) Proof We argue by contradiction, using the method of successive bisections. Assume the theorem isfalse. I'hat is, assume that for some E, say for E = EO , the interval [a, b] cannot be partitioned into a finite number of subintervals in each of which the span off is less than EO' Let c be the midpoint of [a, b]. Then for the same EO , the theorem is false in at least one of the two subintervals [a, c] or [c, b]. (If the theorem were true in both intervals [a, c] and [c, b], it would also be true in the full interval [a, b].) Let [aI' b l ] be that half of [a, b] in which the theorem is false for EO' If it is false in both halves, let [aI' bl] be the left half, [a, c]. Now continue the bisectionprocessrepeatedly, denoting by [a n -/ I , b n+ l ] that half of [an, brJ in which the theoren1 is false for EO , with the understanding that we choose the left half if the theorem is false in both halves of [an, b n ]. Note that the span off in each subinterval [an, b n ] so constructed is at least EO . Let A denote the collection of leftmost endpoints a, a l , a 2 , . . . , so constructed, and let lJ.. be the least upper bound of A. Then lJ.. lies in [a, b]. By continuity off at lJ.., there is an interval (lJ.. - c5, lJ.. + c5) in which the span off' is less than EO' (If lJ.. = a, this interval is [a, a + c5), and if lJ.. = b, it is (b - c5, b].) However, the interval [an, bnl lies inside (lJ.. - c5, lJ.. + c5) when n is so large that (b - a)j2 n < 0, so the span off in [an, b n ] is also less than EO , contradicting the fact that the span of f is at least EO in [an, b n ]. This contradiction completesthe proof of Theorem 3.13.) 3.18 The integrability theorem for continuous functions The small-spantheorem can be used to prove that a function which is continuous on [a, b] is also integrable on [a, b].))) The integrahility theorenl for continuous functions) 153) THEOREM 3.14. INTEGRABILITY OF CONTINUOUS FUNCTIONS. If a function f is continuous at each point of a closedinterral [a, b], then f is integrable on [a, b].) Proof Theorem 3.11 shows that f is bounded on [a, b], so f has an upper integral, l(f), and a lower integral, l(f). We shall prove that !(f) = l(f). Choose an integer N > 1 and let E = 11N. By the small-span theorem, for this choice of E there is a partition P = {xo , Xl' . . . , x,J of [a, b] into n subintervals such that the span offin every subinterval is less than E. Denote by Mk(f) and 111k (f), respectively, the absolute maximum and minimum values off in the kth subinterval [Xk - 1 , -'\\\"k]' Then we have) Mk(f) - nl k (f) < E) for each k = 1,2, . . ., n. Now let Sn and t n be two step functions defined on [a, b] as follows:) Sn(X) = nl k (f)) if Xk-l < X < XIf ,) s,la) = m1(f),) tnCx) = Mk(f)) if Xk-l < X < Xk ,) t neb) = M,l!).) Then we have s,lx) < f(x) < t n(x) for all x in [a, b]. Also, we have) [ V n Sn = \\\"2,m k(f)(x k - X k- l ).. a k=l) and) [ V n t n = \\037Mk(f)(Xk- X k - l ).\\302\\267a k=l) The difference of these two integrals is) [ b [ V n n t n - Sn = \\\"2, [Mk(f) - mk(f)](x k - X k- l ) < E \\037(Xk - X k - l ) = E(b - a) . \\\"'a \\\"a k=l k=l) Since E = 11N, this inequality can be written in the form) (3.26)) I b I v b - a t n - Sn < . a a N) On the other hand, the upper and lower integrals of f satisfy the inequalities) e Sn < I(f) < [b t n.. a .. a) and) (b - (b ,. Sn < I(f) < ,. tn'..a .. a) Multiplying the first set of inequalities by (-1) and adding the result to the second set, we obtain) - [ V (b I(f) - l(f) < t n - ,. Sn'..a .. a) Using (3.26) and the relation !(f\\302\\273 < l(f), we have) o < l(f) - l(f) < b - a N))) 154) Continuous functions) for every integer N > 1. Therefore, by Theorem 1.31, we must have l(f) = l(f). This proves that j\\\" is integrable on [a, b].) 3.19 Mean-valuetheorems for integrals of continuous functions) In Section 2.16 we defined the average value A(f) of a function f over an interval [a, b] to be the quotient S\\037f(x) dx/(b - a). Whenfis continuous, we can prove that this average value is equal to the value off at some point in [a, b].) THEOREM 3.15. MEAN-VALUE THEOREM FOR INTEGRALS. If f is continuous on [a, b], then for somec in [a, b] we have) J: f(x) dx = f(e)(b - a) .) Proof Let m and M denote, respectively, the minimum and maximum values of f on [a, b]. Then m < fCx) < M for all x in [a, b]. Integrating these inequalities and dividing by b - a, we find m < A(f) < M, where A(f) = S\\037f(x) dx/(b - a). But now the inter- mediate-value theorem tells us that A(f) = fCc) for some c in [a, b]. This completes the proof.) There is a corresponding result for weighted mean values.) THEOREM 3.16. WEIGHTED MEAN-VALUE THEOREM FOR INTEGRALS. Assume f and g are continuous on [a, b]. If g never changessign in [a, b] then, for somec in [a, b], H'e have) (3.27)) J: f(x)g(x) dx = fee)J: g(x) dx .) Proof Since g never changes sign in [a, b], g is always nonnegative or always nonpositive on [a, b]. Let us assume that g is nonnegative on [a, b]. Then we may argue as in the proof of Theorem 3.15, except that we integrate the inequalities mg(x) < f(x)g(x) < Mg(x) to obtain) (3.28)) mJ:g(x) dx < J:f(x)g(x)dx < M J:g(x) dx.) If S\\037g(x) dx = 0, this inequality shows that S\\037f(x)g(x) dx = O. In this case, Equation (3.27) holds trivially for any choice of c since both members are zero. Otherwise, the integral of g is positive, and we may divide by this integral in (3.28) and apply the intermediate-value theorem as before to complete the proof. If g is nonpositive, we apply the same argument to -g.) The weighted mean-value theorem sometimes leads to a useful estimate for the integral of a product of two functions, especially if the integral of one of the factors is easy to compute.

The successful accomplishments of these men were primarily due to the fact that they were able to fuse together the integral calculus with the second main branch of calculus, differential calculus. The central idea of differential calculus is the notion of derivative. Like the integral, the derivative originated from a problem in geometry-the problem of finding the tangent line at a point of a curve. Unlike the integral, however, the derivative evolved very late in the history of mathematics. The concept was not formulated until early in the 17th century when the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat, attempted to determine the maxima and minima of certain special functions. Fermat's idea, basically very simple, can be understood if we refer to the curve in Figure 4.1. It is assumed that at each of its points this curve has a definite direction that can be described by a tangent line. Some of these tangents are indicated by broken lines in the figure. Fermat noticed that at certain points where the curve has a maximum or) Xo) Xl) FIGURE 4.1 The curve has horizontal tangents above the points Xo and Xl .) 156))) A problem involving velocity) 157) mInImum, such as those shown in the figure with abscissae Xo and Xl , the tangent line must be horizontal. Thus the problem of locating such extreme values is seen to depend on the solution of another problem, that of locating the horizontal tangents. This raises the more general question of determining the direction of the tangent line at an arbitrary point of the curve. It was the attempt to solve this general problem that led Fermat to discover some of the rudimentary ideas underlying the notion of derivative. At first sight there seems to be no connection whatever between the problem of finding the area of a region lying under a curve and the problem of finding the tangent line at a point of a curve. The first person to realize that these two seemingly remote ideas are, in fact, rather intimately related appears to have been Newton'steacher,Isaac Barrow (1630-1677). However, Newton and Leibniz were the first to understand the real impor- tance of this relation and they exploited it to the fullest, thus inaugurating an unprece- dented era in the development of mathematics. Although the derivative was originally formulated to study the problem of tangents, it was soon found that it also provides a way to calculate velocity and, more generally, the rate of change of a function. In the next section we shall consider a specialproblem in- volving the calculation of a velocity. The solution of this problem contains all the essential features of the derivative concept and may help to motivate the general definition of derivative which is given in Section 4.3.) 4.2 A problem involving velocity Suppose a projectile is fired straight up from the ground with initial velocity of 144 feet per second. Neglect friction, and assume the projectile is influenced only by gravity so that it moves up and back along a straight line. Let f(t) denote the height in feet that the projectile attains t seconds after firing. If the force of gravity were not acting on it, the projectile would continue to move upward with a constant velocity, traveling a distance of 144 feet every second, and at time t we would have f(t) = 144t. In actual practice, gravity causes the projectile to slow down until its velocity decreases to zero and then it drops back to earth. Physical experiments suggest that as long as the projectile is aloft, its height f(t) is given by the formula) (4.1 )) f(t) = 144t - 16t 2 .) The term -16t 2 is due to the influence of gravity. Note that f(t) = 0 when t = 0 and when t = 9. This means that the projectile returns to earth after 9 secondsand it is to be understood that formula (4.1) is valid only for 0 < t < 9. The problem we wish to consider is this: To determine the velocity of the projectile at each instant of its motion. Before we can understand this problem, we must decide on what is meant by the velocity at each instant. To do this, we introduce first the notion of average velocity during a time interval, say from time t to time t + h. This is defined to be the quotient) change in distance during time interval length of time interval) J(t + h) - J(t)- h) This quotient, called a difference quotient, is a number which may be calculated whenever))) 158) Differential calculus) both t and t + h are in the interval [0, 9]. The number h may be positive or negative, but not zero. We shall keep t fixed and see what happens to the differencequotient as we take values of h with smaller and smaller absolute value. For example,considerthe instant t = 2. The distance traveled after 2 seconds is) f(2) = 288 - 64 = 224.) At time t = 2 + h, the distance covered is) f(2 + h) = 144(2 + h) - 16(2+ h)2 = 224 + 80h - 16h 2 .) Therefore the average velocity in the interval from t = 2 to t = 2 + h is) J(2 + h) - J(2) = 80h - 16h 2 = 80 _ 16h . h h) As we take values of h with smaller and smaller absolute value, this average velocity gets closer and closer to 80. For example,if h =.0.1, we get an average velocityof 78.4; when h = 0.001, we get 79.984; when h = 0.00001, we obtain the value 79.99984; and when h = -0.00001, we obtain 80.00016. The important thing is that we can make the average velocity as close to 80 as we please by taking Ihl sufficiently small. In other words, the average velocity approaches 80 as a limit when h approaches zero. It seems natural to call this limiting value the instantaneous velocity at time t = 2. The same kind of calculation can be carried out for any other instant. The average velocity for an arbitrary time interval from t to t + h is given by the quotient) J(t + h) - J'(t) [144(t + h) - 16(t+ h)2] - [144t - 16t 2 ] = = 144 - 32t - 16h . h h) When h approaches zero, the expression on the right approaches 144 - 32t as a limit, and this limit is defined to be the instantaneous velocity at time t. If we denote the in- stantaneous velocity by vet), we may write) (4.2)) vet) = 144 - 32t.) The formula in (4.1) for the distance f(t) defines a function f which tells us how high the projectile is at each instant of its motion. We may refer to f as the position function. Its domain is the closed interval [0, 9] and its graph is shown in Figure 4.2(a). [The scale on the vertical axis is distorted in both Figures 4.2(a) and (b).] The formula in (4.2) for the velocity vet) defines a new function v which tells us how fast the projectile is moving at each instant of its motion. This is called the velocity function, and its graph is shown in Figure 4.2(b). As t increases from 0 to 9, vet) decreases steadily from v(O) = 144 to v(9) = -144. To find the time t for which vet) = 0, we solve the equation 144= 32t to obtain t = 9/2. Therefore, at the midpoint of the motion the influence of gravity reduces the velocity to zero, and the projectile is momentarily at rest. The height at this instant is f(9/2) = 324. When t > 9/2, the velocity is negative, indicating that the height is decreasing.))) The derivative of a function) 159) The limit process by which vet) is obtained from the difference quotient is written sym- bolically as follows:) (4.3)) v(t) = lim f(t + h) - f(t) . h-+O h) This equation is used to define velocity not only for this particular example but, more generally, for any particle moving along a straight line, provided the position function f is such that the difference quotient tends to a definite limit as h approaches zero.) f(t) 100 300 50 200 t 0 100 - 50) o) \\037) 9) - 100) t) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 4.2 (a) Graph of the position function [(t) = 144/ - 16t 2 . (b) Graph of the velocity function: v(t) = 144 - 32t.) 4.3 The derivative of a function The example described in the foregoing section points the way to the introduction of the concept of derivative. We begin with a function f defined at least on some open interval (a, b) on the x-axis. Then we choose a fixed point x in this interval and introduce the difference quotient) l(x + h) - f(x) h) where the number h, which may be positive or negative (but not zero), is such that x + h also lies in (a, b). The numerator of this quotient measures the change in the function))) 160) Differential calculus) when x changes from x to x + h. The quotient itself is referred to as the averagerate of change off in the interval joining x to x + h. Now we let h approach zero and see what happens to this quotient. If the quotient approaches some definite value as a limit (which implies that the limit is the same whether h approaches zero through positive values or through negative values), then this limit is called the derivative off at x and is denoted by the symbol f'ex) (read as ''/ prime of x\\. Thus, the formal definition of f'ex) may be stated as follows:) DEFINITION OF DERIVATIVE.) The derivative f' (x) is defined by the equation) (4.4)) f'(x) = Iim f(x + h) - f(x) , h-+O h) provided the limit exists. The number f'ex) is also called the rate of change off at x.) By comparing (4.4) with (4.3), we see that the concept of instantaneous velocity is merely an example of the concept of derivative. The velocity vet) is equal to the derivative f'(t), where f is the function which measures position. This is often described by saying that velocity is the rate of change of position with respect to time. In the exampleworked out in Section 4.2, the position function f is described by the equation) f(t) = 144t - 16t 2 ,) and its derivative f' is a new function (velocity) given by) f'(t) = 144 - 32t .) In general, the limit process which produces f'ex) from f(x) gives us a way of obtaining a new function f' from a given function f The process is called differentiation, and f' is called the first derivative off. Iff', in turn, is defined on an open interval, we can try to compute its first derivative, denoted by f\\\" and called the secondderivative off Similarly, the nth derivative off, denoted by f<n\\\\ is defined to be the first derivative of f<n-l). We make the convention that f<O) = f, that is, the zeroth derivative is the function itself. For rectilinear motion, the first derivative of velocity (second derivative of position) is called acceleration. For example, to compute the acceleration in the example of Section 4.2,we can use Equation (4.2) to form the difference quotient) vet + h) - v(t) h) [144 - 32(t + h)] - [144 - 32t] h) _ -32h = -32 . h) Since this quotient has the constant value - 32 for each h \\037 0, its limit as h \\037 0 is also - 32. Thus, the acceleration in this problem is constant and equal to - 32.. This result tells us that the velocity is decreasingat the rate of 32 feet per second every second. In 9 seconds the total decrease in velocity is 9 \\302\\26732 = 288 feet per second. This agrees with the fact that during the 9 seconds of motion the velocity changes from v(O) = 144 to v(9) = -144.))) Examples of derivatives) 161) 4.4 Examples of derivatives) EXAMPLE 1. Derivative of a constant .function. Suppose f is a constant function, say f(x) = c for all x. The difference quotient is) f(x + h) - f(x) = c - c = 0 . h h) Since the quotient is 0 for all h \\037 0, its limit,f'(x), is also 0 for every x. In other words, a constant function has a zero derivative everywhere.) EXAMPLE 2. Derivative of a linear .function. Suppose f is a linear function, say f(x) = mx + b for all real x. If h \\037 0, we have) f(x + h) - f(x) m(x + h) + b - (mx + b) mh = =-=m. h h h) Since the difference quotient does not change when h approaches 0, we conclude that) f'(x) = m) for every x.) Thus, the derivative of a linear function is a constant function.) EXAMPLE 3. Derivative of a positive integer pou'er function. Consider next the case f(x) = x n , where n is a positive integer. The difference quotient becomes) f(x + h) - f(x) h) (x + h)n - xn h) To study this quotient as h approaches 0, we can proceed in two ways, either by factoring the numerator as a difference of two nth powers or by using the binomial theorem to expand (x + h)n. We shall carry out the details by the first method and leave the other method as an exercise for the reader. (See Exercise39 in Section 4.6.) From elementary algebra we have the identityt) n-l an - b n = (a - b)Iakb n - 1- k . k=O) If we take a = x + hand b = x and divide both sides by 11, this identity becomes) ( + h ) n n n-l X h - x = L (x + hlxn-l-k. k=O) t This identity is an immediate consequenceof the telescoping property of finite sums. I n fact, if we multiply each term of the sum by (a - b), we find) n-l n-l (a - b) I akbn - 1- k = I (ak+1bT!-Ck+1) - akbT!-k) = aT! - bT!. k=O k=O))) 162) Differential calculus) There are n terms in the sum. As h approaches 0, (x + h)k approaches x\\\\ the kth term approaches xkxn-l-k= xn-l, and therefore the sum of all n terms approaches nx n - 1. From this it follows that) f'(x) = nx n - 1) for every x.) EXAMPLE 4. Derivative of the sine function. Let sex) = sin x. The difference quotient in question is) sex + h) - sex) h) sin (x + h) - sin x h) To transform this into a form that makes it possible to calculate the limit as h \\037 0, we use the trigonometric identity) . . 2 . v-x y+x sIn y - sIn x = sIn '\\\" cos 2 2) with Y = x + h. This leadsto the formula) sin (x + h) - sin x sin (h/2) ( h ) = cos x + - . h h/2 2) As h \\037 0, the factor cos (x + !h) \\037 cos x because of the continuity of the cosine.

Therefore the difference quotient has the limit cos x as h \\037 O. In other words, s'(x) = cosx for every x; the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function.) EXAMPLE 5. The derivative of the cosine function. Let c(x) = cos x. We shall prove that c' (x) = - sin x; that is, the derivative of the cosine function is minus the sine function. We start with the identity) . v-x. y+xcos y - cos x = -2 sIn \\037 sIn 2 2) and take y = x + h.

EXAMPLE 6. Derivative of the nth-root function. If n is a positive integer, let f(x) = xl/n for x > O. The difference quotient for f is) f(x + h) - f(x) h) (x + h)l/n _ x l/ n h) Let u = (x + h)l/n and let v = xl/no Then we have un = x + hand v n = x, so h = un - v n , and the difference quotient becomes) f(x + h) - f(x) h) u-v) 1 u n - l + U n - 2 V + . . . + UV n - 2 + V n - 1 .) un _ V n) The continuity of the nth:'root function shows that u --+ V as h --+ O. Therefore each term in the denominator on the right has the limit v n - l as h ---+ O. There are n terms altogether, so the difference quotient has the limit vl-nln. Since v = xl/n, this proves that) f'ex) = 1.xl/ n - l . n) EXAMPLE 7. Continuity of functions having derivatives. If a function f has a derivative at a point x, then it is also continuous at x. To prove this, we use the identity) f(x + h) = f(x) + h (I(X + \\037 - f(X) )) which is valid for h \\037 O. If we let h --+ 0, the difference quotient on the right approaches f' (x) and, since this quotient is multiplied by a factor which tends to 0, the second term on the right approaches 0 .f'ex) = O. This shows that f(x + h) ---+ f(x) as h ---+ 0, and hence that f is continuous at X.) This example provides a new way of showing that functions are continuous. Every time we establish the existence of a derivative f'ex), we also establish, at the same time, the continuity off at X. It should be noted, however, that the converse is not true. Con- tinuity at x does not necessarily mean that the derivative f'ex) exists. For example, when f(x) = lxi, the point x = 0 is a point of continuity off [since f(x) ---+ 0 as x ---+ 0] but there is no derivative at O. (See Figure 4.3.) The difference quotient [f(O + h) - f(O)]lh is y) o) x) FIGURE 4.3 The function is continuous at 0 but.f'(O) does not exist.))) 164) Differential calculus) equal to Ihllh. This has the value + 1 if h > 0 and -1 if h < 0, and hence does not tend to a limit as h --* O.) 4.5 The algebra of derivatives Just as the limit theorems of Section 3.4 tell us how to compute limits of the sum, differ- ence, product, and quotient of two functions, so the next theorem provides us with a corresponding set of rules for computing derivatives.) THEOREM 4.1. Let f and g be t}1'O functions defined on a common interval. At each point where f and g have a derivative, the same is true of the sum f + g, the difference f - g, the product f' g, and the quotient fig. (For fig we need the extra proviso that g is not zero at the point in question.) The derivatives of these functions are given by the follo}1'ingformulas:) (i) (f + g)' = f' +g', (ii) (f - g)' = f' - g', (iii) (I. g)' = f \\302\\267 g' + g \\302\\267 f' , (iv) ( I )'= g . f' - I' g' at points x where g(x) :;f= 0 . g g2) We shall prove this theorem in a moment, but first we want to mention some of its consequences. A special case of (iii) occurs when one of the two functions is constant, say g(x) = c for all x under consideration. In this case, (iii) becomes (c \\302\\267 f)' = C .f'. In other words,the derivative of a constant times f is the constant times the derivative off. Combining this with the fact that the derivative of a sum is the sum of derivatives [property (0], we find that for every pair of constants C 1 and C 2 we have) ( C If + c2g) I = C If' + c2g I.) This is called the linearity property of the derivative, and it is analogous to the linearity property of the integral. Using mathematical induction, we can extend the linearity property to arbitrary finite sums as follows:) ( n ) ' n i\\037 Ci \\302\\267 Ii = \\037/i \\302\\267 I\\037 ,) where C1 , . . . , Cn are constants and fl , . . . ,fn are functions with derivatives f\\037 , . . . ,f\\037 \\302\\267 Every derivative formula can be written in two ways, either as an equality between two functions or as an equality involving numbers. The properties of Theorem 4.1, as written above, are equations involving functions. For example, property (i) states that the deriva- tive of the function f + g is the sum of the two functions f' and g'. When these functions))) The algebra of derivatives) 165) are evaluated at a point x, we obtain formulas involving numbers. Thus formula (i) implies) (f + g)'(x) = f'(x) + g'(x).) We proceed now to the proof of Theorem 4.1.) Proof of (i). Let x be a point where both derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) exist. The difference quotient for f + g is) [f(x + h) + g(x + h)] - [f(x) + g(x)] f(x + h) - f(x) g(x + h) - g(x) h = h + h .) When h --* 0 the first quotient on the right approaches f'ex), the second approaches g'(x), and hence the sum approachesf'(x) + g'(x). This proves (i), and the proof of (ii) is similar.) Proof of (iii). The difference quotient for the product f' g is) (4.6)) f(x + h)g(x + h) - f(x)g(x) h) To study this quotient as h --* 0, we add and subtract in the numerator a term which enables us to write (4.6) as a sum of two terms involving difference quotients of I and g. Adding and subtracting g(x)/(x + h), we see that (4.6) becomes) f(x + h)g(x+ h) - f(x)g(x) ( ) j(x + h) - f(x) f( h) g(x + h) - g(x) =gx + x+ . h h h) When h --* 0 the first term on the right approaches g(x)f'(x). SinceI is continuous at x, we have f(x + h) --* I(x), so the second term approaches f(x)g'(x). This proves (iii).) Proof of(iv). A special case of (iv) occurs whenf(x) = 1 for all x. In this casef'(x) = 0 for all x and (iv) reduces to the formula) (4.7)) G )' = - :\\037) provided g(x) \\037 O. We can deduce the general formula (iv) from this special case by writingflg as a product and using (iii), since) ( 1) ' 1 I ( 1 ) , f' f' g' g .f' - f' g'f'- =-'f +f' - =---= . g g g g g2 g2) Therefore it remains to prove (4.7). The difference quotient for I/g is) (4.8)) [11 g( x + h)] - [11g( x ) ] h) g(x + h) - g(x) h) 1 1.-. g(x) g(x+ h)))) 166) Differential calculus) When h --+ 0, the first quotient on the right approaches g'(x) and the third factor approaches I/g(x). The continuity of g at x is required since we are using the fact that g(x + h) --+ g(x) as h --+ O. Hence the quotient in (4.8) approaches -g'(x)/g(X)2, and this proves (4.7). Note: In order to write (4.8) we need to know thatg(x + h) \\302\\245:0 for all sufficiently small h. This follows from Theorem 3.7. Theorem 4.1, when used in conjunction with the examples worked out in Section 4.4, enables us to derive new examplesof differentiation formulas.) EXAMPLE 1. Polynomials. In Example 3 of Section4.4 we showed that if f(x) = xn , where n is a positive integer, then f'ex) = nx n - 1. The reader may find it instructive to rederive this result as a consequence of the specialcasen = 1, using mathematical induction in conjunction with the formula for differentiating a product. Using this result along with the linearity property, we can differentiate any polynomial by computing the derivative of each term and adding the derivatives. Thus, if) n f(x) = !CkX k , k=O) then, by differentiating term by term, we obtain) n f'ex) = ! kC k X k- 1 . k=O) Note that the derivative of a polynomial of degree n is a new polynomialof degree n - 1. For example, if f(x) = 2x 3 + 5x2 - 7x + 8, thenf'(x) = 6x 2 + lOx - 7.) EXA\\037IPLE 2. Rational functions. If r is the quotient of two polynomials, say rex) = p(x)lq(x), then the derivative r'(x) may be computed by the quotient formula (iv) in Theorem 4.1. The derivative r'(x) exists at every x for which the denominator q(x) \\037 O. Note that the function r' so defined is itself a rational function. In particular, when rex) = 1Ix m , where m is a positive integer and x \\037 0, we find) xm'0-mx m- 1 -m r' (x) = = - 2m m+l . X X) If this is written in the form r'(x) = -mx- m - 1 , it provides an extension from positive exponents to negative exponents of the formula for differentiating nth powers.) EXAMPLE 3. Rational pou,'ers. Let I(x) = x r for x > 0, where r is a rational number. We have already proved the differentiation formula) (4.9)) f'(x) = rx r - 1) for r = 1In, where n is a positive integer. Now we extend it to all rational powers. The formula for differentiating a product shows that Equation (4.9) is also valid for r = 21n))) Exercises) 167) and, by induction, for r = m/n, where m is any positive integer. (The induction argument refers to m.) Therefore Equation (4.9)is valid for all positive rational r. The formula for differentiating a quotient now shows that (4.9) is also valid for negative rational r. Thus, if f(x) = X 2 / 3, we have f'ex) = !X-1/3 . If f(x) = X- 1/2 , then f'ex) = -tx-3/2.

(This result was derived in another way in Example 3 of Section4.4.)) 4.7 Geometric interpretation of the derivative as a slope The procedure used to define the derivative has a geometric interpretation which leads in a natural way to the idea of a tangent line to a curve. A portion of the graph of a function f is shown in Figure 4.4. Two of its points P and Q are shown with respective coordinates) f) / Q / 71 / 1 / I / I / I / I / If(x + h) - f(x) /\\037 --_J I) Vertical ( no slope)) h) \\037I I I I I I I I I x+h) m = 0 Horizontal) -\\037) m=) x) m indicates the slope) FIGURE 4.4 Geometric interpretation of the difference quotient as the tangent of an angle.) FIGURE 4.5 Lines of various slopes.) (x,f(x)) and (x + h,f(x + h)). Consider the right triangle with hypotenuse PQ; its altitude, f(x + h) - f(x), represents the difference of the ordinates of the two points Q and P. Therefore, the difference quotient) (4.1 0)) f(x + h) - f(x) h) represents the trigonometric tangent of the angle r:J.. that PQ makes with the horizontal. The real number tan r:J.. is called the slope of the line through P and Q and it provides a way of measuring the \\\"steepness\\\" of this line. For example, if f is a linear function, say f(x) = mx + b, the difference quotient (4.10) has the value m, so m is the slope of the line. Some examples of lines of various slopes are shown in Figure 4.5. For a horizontal line,))) 170) Differential calculus) rJ.. = 0 and the slope, tan rJ.., is also O. If rJ..liesbetween 0 and !1T, the line is rising as we move from left to right and the slope is positive. If rJ.. lies between !1T and 1T, the line is falling as we move from left to right and the slope is negative. A line for which rJ.. = !1T has slope 1. As rJ.. increases from 0 to !1T,tan rJ.. increases without bound, and the corresponding lines of slope tan rJ.. approach a vertical position. Since tan !1T is not defined, we say that vertical lines have no slope. Suppose now that f has a derivative at x. This means that the difference quotient approaches a certain limit f' (x) as h approaches O. When this is interpreted geometrically it tells us that, as h gets nearer to 0, the point P remains fixed, Q moves along the curve toward P, and the line through PQ changes its direction in such a way that its slope approaches the number f'(x) as a limit. For this reason it seems natural to define the slope of the curve at P to be the number f'(x). The line through P having this slope is called the tangent line at P. Note: The concept of a line tangent to a circle(and to a few other specialcurves) was considered by the ancient Greeks. They defined a tangent line to a circleas a line having one of its points on the circle and all its other points outside the circle. From this defini- tion, many properties of tangent lines to circlescan be derived. For example, we can prove that the tangent at any point is perpendicular to the radius at that point. However, the Greek definition of tangent line is not easily extended to more generalcurves. The method described above, where the tangent line is defined in terms of a derivative, has proved to be far more satisfactory. Using this definition, we can prove that for a circlethe tangent line has all the properties ascribed to it by the Greek geometers. Concepts such as per- pendicularity and parallelism can be explained rather simply in analytic terms making use of slopes of lines. For example, from the trigonometric identity) tan a - tan {3 tan (a - (3) = ,1 + tan a tan {3) it follows that two nonvertical lines with the same slope are parallel. Also, from the identity) 1 + tan rJ. tan (3 cot (a - (3) = , tan a - tan (3) we find that two nonverticallines with slopes having product -1 are perpendicular.) The a1gebraic sign of the derivative of a function gives us useful information about the behavior of its graph. For example, if x is a point in an open interval where the derivative is positive, then the graph is rising in the immediate vicinity of x as we move from left to right. This occurs at X 3 in Figure 4.6. A negative derivative in an interval means the graph is falling, as shown at Xl' while a zero derivative at a point means a horizontal tangent line. At a maximum or minimum, such as those shown at X2, Xs, and x 6, the slope must be zero. Fermat was the first to notice that points like X2, Xs, and x 6' wheref has a maximum or minimum, must occur among the roots of the equation f'(x) = O. It is important to realize thatf'(x) may also be zero at points where there is no maximum or minimum, such as above the point x 4. Note that this particular tangent line crosses the graph. This is an example of a situation not covered by the Greek definition of tangency.)))

The foregoingremarks concerning the significance of the algebraic sign of the derivative may seem quite obvious when we interpret them geometrically. Analytic proofs of these statements, based on general properties of derivatives, will be given in Section 4.16.) 4.8 Other notations for derivatives Notation has played an extremely important role in the developmenI of mathematics. Some mathematical symbols, such as xn or n!, are merely abbreviations that compress long statements or formulas into a short space. Others, like the integration symbol S\\037f(x) dx, not only remind us of the process being represented but also help us in\\037carrying out computations. Sometimes several different notations are used for the same idea, preference for one or another being dependent on the circumstances that surround the use of the symbols. This is especially true in differential calculus where many different notations are use9 for derivatives. The derivative of a function f has been denoted in our previous discussions by f', a notation introduced by J. L. Lagrange (1736-1813) late in the 18th century. This emphasizes the fact that f' is a new function obtained from f by differentiation, its value at x being denoted by f'(x). Each point (x, y) on the graph off has its coordinates x and y related by the equation y = f(x), and the symbol y' is also used to represent the derivative f'(x). Similarly, y\\\",... ,y(n) represent the higher derivatives f\\\"(x),. .. ,f(n)(x). For example, if y = sin x, then y' = cos x, y\\\" = -sin x, etc. Lagrange's notation is not too far removed from that used by Newton who wrote y and Y, instead of y' and y\\\". Newton's dots are still used by some authors, especially to denote velocity and acceleration. Another symbol was introduced in 1800 by L. Arbogast (1759-1803) who denoted the derivative of f by Df, a symbol that has widespread use today. The symbol D is called a))) 172) Differential calculus) differentiation operator, and it helps to suggest that Df is a new function obtained from f by the operation of differentiation. Higher derivativesf\\\", fill, . . . , r<n) are written D2J, D3f, . . . , Drtj, respectively, the values of these derivatives at x being written D2J(x), D3j(x), . . . , Drtj(x). Thus, we have D sin x = cosx and D2 sin x = D cos x = -sin x. The rule for differentiating a sum of two functions becomes, in the D-notation, D(f + g) = Df + Dg. Evaluation of the derivatives at x leads to the formula [D(f + g)](x)= Df(x) + Dg(x) which is also written in the form D[f(x) + g(x)] = Df(x) + Dg(x). The reader may easily formulate the product and quotient rules in the D-notation. Among the early pioneers of mathematical analysis, Leibniz, more than anyone else, understood the importance of well-chosen symbols. He experimented at great length and carried on extensive correspondence with other mathematicians, debating the merits or drawbacksof various notations. The tremendous impact that calculus has had on the development of modern mathematics is due in part to its well-developed and highly suggestive symbols, many of them originated by Leibniz. Leibniz developeda notation for derivatives quite different from those mentioned above. Using y for f(x), he wrote the difference quotient) f(x + h) - f(x) h) in the form) \\037y \\037x') where \\037x (read as \\\"delta x\\\") was written for h, and \\037y for f(x + h) - f(x). The symbol \\037 is called a difference operator. For the limit of the difference quotient, that is, for the derivativef'(x), Leibniz wrote dyfdx. In this notation, the definition of derivative becomes) dy = lim \\037y . dx Ax-+O \\037x) Not only was Leibniz's notation different, but his way of thinking about derivatives was different. He thought of the limit dyfdx as a quotient of \\\"infinitesimal\\\" quantities dy and dx called \\\"differentials,\\\" and he referred to the derivative dyfdx as a \\\"differential quotient.\\\" Leibniz imagined infinitesimals as entirely new types of numbers which, although not zero, were smaller than every posi ti ve real n urn ber. Even though Leibniz was not able to give a satisfactory definition of infinitesimals, he and his followers used them freely in their development of calculus. Consequently,-many people found calculus somewhat mysterious and began to question the validity of the methods. The work of Cauchy and others in the 19th century gradually led to the replace- ment of infinitesimals by the classical theory of limits. Nevertheless, many people have found it helpful to try to think as Leibniz did in terms of infinitesimals. This kind of thinking has intuitive appeal and often leads quickly to results that can be proved correct by more conventional means. Recently Abraham Robinson has shown that the real number system can be extended to incorporate infinitesimals as envisaged by Leibniz. A discussion of this extension and its))) Exercises) 173) impact on many branches of mathematics is given in Robinson's book, Non-standard Analysis, North-Holland Publishing Company, Amsterdam, 1966. Although some of Leibniz's ideas fell into temporary disrepute, the same cannot be said of his notations. The symbol d}'/dx for the derivative has the obvious advantage that it summarizes the whole process of forming the difference quotient and passing to the limit. Later we shall find the further advantage that certain formulas become easier to remember and to work with when derivatives are written in the Leibniz notation.) 4.9 Exercises) 1.

As yet, however, we have not learned to deal with something like f(x) = sin (x 2 ) without going back to the definition of derivative. In this section we shall present a theorem, called the chain rule, that enables us to differentiate composite functions such as f(x) = sin (x 2). This increases substantially the number of functions that we can differentiate. We recall that if u and v are functions such that the domain of u includes the range of v, we can define the composite function f = u 0 v by the equation) f(x) = u[v(x)] .) The chain rule tells us how to express the derivative offin terms of the derivatives u' and v'.) THEOREM 4.2. CHAIN RULE. Let f be the composition of two functions u and v, say f = u 0 v. Suppose that both derivatives v'(x) and u'(y) exist, 1,vhere y = vex). Then the))) The chain rule for difJerentiating composite functions) 175) derivative f'(x) also exists and is given by the formula) (4.11 )) f'(x) = u'(y) \\302\\267 v'(x) .) In other words, to compute the derivative of u 0 v at x, we first compute the derivative of u at the point y, where y = vex), and multiply this by v'(x). Before we discussthe proof of (4.11), we shall mention some alternative ways of expressing the chain rule formula. If we write (4.11) entirely in terms of x, we obtain the formula) f' (x) = u'[v(x)] . v'(x) .) Expressed as an equation involving/unctions rather than numbers, the chain rule assumes the following form) (u 0 v)' = (u' 0 v) . v'.) In the u(v)-notation, let us write u(v)' for the derivative of the composite function u(v) and u'(v) for the composition u' 0 v. Then the last formula becomes) u(v)' = u'(v) \\302\\267v'.) Proof of Theorem 4.2. We turn now to the proof of (4.11). We assume that v has a derivative at x and that u has a derivative at vex), and we wish to prove thatfhas a derivative at x given by the product u'[v(x)]. v'(x). The difference quotient for / is) (4.12 )) f(x + h) - f(x) h) u [v( x + h)] - u [ v( x) ] h) It is helpful at this stage to introduce some new notation. Let y = vex) and let k = vex + h) - vex). (It is important to realize that k depends on h.) Then we have vex + h) = Y + k and (4.12) becomes) (4.13)) fex + h) - f(x) h) u(y + k) - u(y) h) The right-hand side of (4.13) resembles the difference quotient whose limit defines u'(y) except that h appears in the denominator instead of k. If k =;60, it is easy to complete the proof. We simply multiply numerator and denominator by k, and the right-hand side of (4.13)becomes) (4.14 )) u(y + k) - u(y) . \\037_ u(y + k) - u(y) . vex + h) - vex) k h k h) When h -+ 0, the last quotient on the right tends to v'(x). Also, k -+ 0 as h -+ 0 because))) 176) Differential calculus) k = vex + h) - vex) and v is continuous at x. Therefore the first quotient on the right of (4.14) approaches u' (y) as h --+ 0, and this leads at once to (4.11). Although the foregoing argument seemsto be the most natural way to proceed, it is not completely general. Sincek = vex + h) - vex), it may happen that k = 0 for infinitely many values of h as h --+ 0, in which case the passage from (4.13) to (4.14) is not valid. To overcome this difficulty, a slight modification of the proof is needed. Let us return to Equation (4.13) and express the quotient on the right in a form that does not involve k in the denominator. For this purpose we introduce the difference between the derivative u'(y) and the difference quotient whose limit is u'(y). That is, we define a new function g as foJJows:) ( 4.15)) ( u(y + t) - u(y) ' ( )g t) = - u Y t) if t =F 0 .) This equation defines get) only if t =F O. Multiplying by t and rearranging terms, we may write (4.15) in the following form:) (4.16)) u(y + t) - u(y) = t[g(t) + u'(y)] .) Although (4.16) has been derived under the hypothesisthat t =F 0, it also holds for t = 0, provided we assign some definite value to g(O). Since get) \\037 0 as t \\037 0, we shall define g(O) to be O. This will ensure the continuity of g at O. If, now, we replace t in (4.16) by k, where k = vex + h) - vex), and substitute the right-hand side of (4.16)in (4.13), we obtain) (4.17)) f(x + h\\037 - f(x) = \\037 [g(k) + u'(y)] ,) a formula that is valid even if k = O. When h \\037 0 the quotient k/h \\037 v'(x) and g(k) --+ 0 so the right-hand side of (4.17) approaches the limit u'(y) . v' (x). This completes the proof of the chain rule.) 4.11 Applications of the chain rule. Related rates and implicit differentiation The chain rule is an excellentexampleto illustrate the usefulness of the Leibniz notation for derivatives. In fact, if \\037e write (4.11) in the Leibniz notation, it assumes the appearance of a trivial algebraic identity. First we introduce new symbols, say) y = vex)) and) z = u(y) .) Then we write dy/dx for the derivative v'(x), and dz/dy for u'(y). The formation of the composite function is indicated by writing) z = u(y) = u[v(x)] = f(x) ,) and dz/dx is written for the derivative f'(x). The chain rule, as expressed in Equation))) Applications of the chain rule. Related rates and in1plicit difJerentiatio/1 177) ( 4.11), now becomes) (4.18)) dz = dz dy dx dy dx The strong suggestive power of this formula is obvious. It is especially attractive to people who use calculus in physical problems. For example, suppose the foregoing symbol z represents a physical quantity measured in terms of other physical quantities x and y. The equation z = f(x) tells us how to find z if x is given, and the equation z = u(y) tells us how to find z if y is given. The relation between x and y is expressed by the eq uation y = vex). The chain rule, as expressed in (4.18), tells us that the rate of change of z with respect to x is equal to the product of the rate of change of z with respect to y and the rate of change of y with respect to x. The following example illustrates how the chain rule may be used in a special physical problem.) EXAMPLE 1. Suppose a gas is pumped into a spherical balloon at a constant rate of 50 cubic centimeters per second. Assume that the gas pressure remains constant and that the balloon always has a spherical shape. How fast is the radius of the balloon increasing when the radius is 5 centimeters?) Solution. Let r denote the radius and V the volume of the balloon at time I. We are given dV/dt, the rate of change of volume with respect to time, and we want to determine dr/dt, the rate of change of the radius with respect to time, at the instant when r = 5. The chain rule provides the connection between the given data and the unknown. It states that) (4.19)) dV dV dr---- dt dr dt) To compute dV/dr, we use the formula V = 41Tr 3 /3 which expresses the volume of the sphere in terms of its radius. Differentiation gives us dV/dr = 41Tr 2 , and hence (4. 19) becomes) dV = 41Tr2 dr . dt dt Substituting dV/dt = 50 and r = 5, we obtain dr/dt = I/(21T). That is to say, the radius is increasing at a rate of I/(21T) centimeters per second at the instant when r = 5. The foregoingexampleis calleda problem in related rates. Note that it was not necessary to express r as a function of t in order to determine the derivative dr/dl. It is this fact that makes the chain rule especially useful in related-rate problems. The next two examples show how the chain rule may be used to obtain new differentiation formulas.) EXAMPLE 2. Given I(x) = sin (x 2 ), compute I' (x). Solution. The function f is a composition, f(x) = u[v(x)], where vex) = x 2 and u(x) = sin X. To use the chain rule, we need to determine u'[v(x)] = u'(x 2 ). Since u'(x) = cosx, we have u' (x 2 ) = cos (x 2 ), and hence (4.11) gives us) f'(x) = cos (x 2 ) \\302\\267 v'(x) = cos (x 2 ) . 2x .))) 178) Differential calculus) We may also solve the problem using the Leibniz notation. If we write y = x 2 and z = f(x), then z = sin y and dz/dx = f'(x). The chain rule yields) dz dz dy 2- = - - = (cos y)(2x) = cos (x ) . 2x , dx dy dx) which agrees with the foregoing result for f'(x).) EXAMPLE 3. If f(x) = [v(x)]n, where n is a positive integer, compute f'(x) in terms of vex) and v'(x).) Solution. The function f is a composition, f(x) = u[v(x)], where u(x) = x n . Since u'(x) = nxn-l, we have u'[v(x)]= n[v(x)]n-l, and the chain rule yields) f'(x) = n[v(x)]n-Iv'(x) .) If we omit the reference to x and write this as an equality involving functions, we obtain the important formula) (v n)' = nvn-Iv') which tells us how to differentiate the nth power of v when v' exists. The fornlula is also valid for rational powers if v n and v n- I are defined. To solve the problem in the Leibniz notation, we write y = v(x) and z = f(x). Then z = yn, dz/dx = f'ex), and the chain rule gIves us) dz dz dy n I I nIl- = - - = ny - v (x) = n[v(x)] - v (x)dx dy dx ') which agrees with the first solution.) EXAMPLE 4. The equation x2 + y2 = r 2 represents a circle of radius r and center at the origin. If we solve this equation for y in terms of x, we obtain two solutions which serve to definetwo functions f and g given on the interval [- r, r] by the formulas) f(x) = V r 2 - x 2) and) g(x) = - V r 2 -x 2 .) (The graph off is the upper semicircleand the graph of g the lower semicircle.) We may compute the derivatives off and g by the chain rule. For f we use the result of Example 3 with vex) = r 2 - x 2 and n = t to obtain) ( 4.20)) f'ex) = !(r 2 _ X 2)-1/2( -2x) = -x _ - x Vr 2 - x 2 f(x)) whenever f(x) =;6O. The same method, applied to g, gives us) (4.21)) -x -x g/(x) = - V 2 2 - - r - x g(x)))) Exercises) 179) whenever g(x) \\037 O. Notice that if we let y stand for either I(x) or g(x), then both formulas (4.20) and (4.21) can be combined into one, namely,) (4.22)) , -x y = - if Y \\037 0 . y) Another useful application of the chain rule has to do with a technique known as implicit differentiation. We shall explain the method and illustrate its advantages by rederiving the result of Example4 in a simpler way.) EXAMPLE 5. Implicit differentiation. Formula (4.22) may be derived directly from the equation x2 + y2 = r 2 without the necessity of solving for y. We remember that y is a function of x [either y = I(x) or y = g(x)]. Assuming that y' exists, we differentiate both sides of the equation x 2 + ),2 = r 2 to obtain) (4.23)) 2x + 2yy' = 0 .) (The term 2yy' comes from differentiating y2 as explained in Example 3.) When Equation (4.23) is solved for y' it yields (4.22).) The equation x 2 + y2 = r 2 is said to define y ilnplicitly as a function of x (it actually defines tit'O functions), and the process by which (4.23) is obtained from this equation is called inlplicit differentiation. The end result is valid for either of the two functions f and g so defined. Notice that at a point (x, y) on the circle with x \\037 0 and y \\037 0, the tangent line has a slope-xl)', whereas the radius from the center to (x, )J) has the slope ylx. The product of the two slopes is -1 so the tangent is perpendicular to the radius.) 4.12 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 14, determine the derivative f'ex).

Actually, there are two different uses of the word \\\"maximum\\\" in calculus, and they are distinguished by the two prefixes absolute and relative. The concept of absolute maximum was introduced in Chapter 3. We recall that a real-valued function f is said to have an absolute maximum on a set S if there is at least one point e in S such that) f(x) < fee)) for all x in S .) The concept of relative maximum is definedas follows.))) 182) Differential calculus) DEFINITION OF RELATIVE MAXIMUM. A function j: defined on a set S, is said to have a relative maximum at a point c in S if there is some open interval I containing c such that) f(x) < f(c)) for all x \\302\\273'hichlie in InS.) The concept of relative minimum is similarly defined by reversing the inequality. In other words, a relative maximum at c is an absolute maximum in some neighborhood of c, although this need not be an absolute maximum on the whole of S. Examples are shown in Figure 4.7. Of course, every absolute maximum is, in particular, a relative maXImum.) 0\\\\ Absolute mInImum) x) maXImum) Absolute / maximum) Relative maXImum) 1r) 2) x) - 2 Absolute mInImum) f(x) = sin x, 0 < x < 1r) f(x) = x( 1 - X)2, - \\037< x < 2 Absolute minimum) FIGURE 4.7 Extrema of functions.) DEFINITION OF EXTREMUM. A number \\0371'hich is either a relative maximum or a relative minimum of a function f is called an extreme value or an extremum off) The next theorem, which is illustrated in Figure 4.7, relates extrema of a function to horizontal tangents of its graph.) THEOREM 4.3. VANISHING OF THE DERIVATIVE AT AN INTERIOR EXTREMUM. Let f be defined on an open interval I, and assume that f has a relative maximu/n or a relative minimun1 at an interior point c of I. If the derivative f'(c) exists, then f'(c) = O.) Proof Define a function Q on I as follows:) Q(x) = f(x) - f(c) x-e) if x \\037 e,) Q(e) = f'(e) .) Since f'(c) exists, Q(x) --* Q(c) as x --* c, so Q is continuous at c. We wish to prove that Q(c) = o. We shall do this by showing that each of the inequalities Q(c) > 0 and Q(c) < 0 leads to a contradiction.))) The mean-value theoren1 for derivatives) 183) Assume Q(e) > O. By the sign-preserving property of continuous functions, there is an interval about e in which Q(x) is positive. Therefore the numerator of the quotient Q(x) has the same sign as the denominator for all x \\037 c in this interval. In other words, f(x) > fee) when x > c, and f(x) <fee) when x < c. This contradicts the assumption that f has an extremum at c. Hence,the inequality Q(c) > 0 is impossible. A similar argument shows that we cannot have Q(c) < O. Therefore Q(c) = 0, as asserted. Since Q(c)= f'(c), this proves the theorem.) It is important to realize that a zero derivative at c does not imply an extremum at c. For example, let f(x) = x 3. The graph off is shown in Figure 4.8. Here f'(x) = 3x 2 , so y) f(x) = x 3) y) 'x) o) FIGURE 4.8 Here,f'CO) equals o but there is no extremum at O.) FIGURE 4.9 There is an ex- tremum at 0, but ['(0) does not exist.) f'(O) = O. However, this function is increasing in every interval containing 0 so there is no extremum at O. This example shows that a zero derivative at e is not sufficient for an extremum at e. Another example, f(x) = lxi, shows that a zero derivative does not always occur at an extremum. Herethere is a relative minimum at 0, as shown in Figure 4.9, but at the point o itself the graph has a sharp corner and there is no derivative. Theorem 4.3 assumes that the derivative f'(c) exists at the extremum. In other words,Theorem 4.3 tells us that, in the absence of sharp corners, the derivative must necessarily vanish at an extremum if this extremum occurs in the interior of an interval. In a later section we shall describe a test for extrema which is comprehensive enough to include both the examples in Figure 4.7 and also the example in Figure 4.9. This test, which is described in Theorem 4.8, tells us that an extremum always occurs at a point where the derivative changes its sign. Although this fact may seem geometrically evident, a proof is not easy to give with the materials developed thus far. We shall deduce this result as a consequence of the mean-value theorem for derivatives which we discuss next.) 4.14 The mean-value theorem for derivatives) The mean-value theorem for derivatives holds a posItIon of importance in calculus because many properties of functions can easily be deduced from it. Before we state the mean-value theorem, we will examine one of its special cases from which the more general))) 184) Differential calculus) theorem will be deduced. This special case was discovered In 1690 by Michel Rolle (1652-1719), a French mathematician.) THEOREM 4.4. ROLLE'S THEOREM. Let f be a function }vhich is continuous everywhere on a closed interval [a, b] and has a derivative at each point of the open interval (a, b). Also, assumethat) f(a) = f(b) \\302\\267) Then there is at least onepoint c in the open interval (a, b) such that f'(c) = o.) The geometric significance of Rolle's theorem is illustrated in Figure 4.10. The theorem simply asserts that the curve shown must have a horizontal tangent somewhere between a and b.) /f'(C) = 0) B) A) A) B) A) f(a)) a) b) a) C) b) a Cl) C2 b) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 4.10 Geometric interpre- tation of Rolle's theorem.) FIGURE 4.11 Geometric significance of the mean-value theorem.) Proof We assume thatf'(x) \\037 0 for every x in the open interval (a, b), and we arrive at a contradiction as follows: By the extreme-value theorem for continuous functions,f must take on its absolute maximum M and its absolute minimum m somewhere in the closed interval [a, b]. Theorem 4.3 tells us that neither extreme value can be taken at any interior point (otherwise the derivative would vanish there). Hence, both extreme values are taken on at the endpoints a and b. But since f(a) = f(b), this means that m = M, and hencef is constant on [a, b]. This contradicts the fact that f' (x) \\302\\245=0 for all x in (a, b). It follows that f'(c) = 0 for at least one c satisfying a < c < b, which proves the theorem.) We can use Rolle'stheorem to prove the mean-value theorem. Before we state the mean-value theorem, it may be helpful to examine its geometric significance. Each of the curves shown in Figure 4.11 is the graph of a continuous function f with a tangent line above each point of the open interval (a, b). At the point (c,f(c)) shown in Figure 4.11(a), the tangent line is parallel to the chord AB. In Figure 4.11 (b), there are two points where the tangent line is parallel to the chord AB. The mean-value theorem guarantees that there will be at least one point with this property. To translate this geometric property into an analytic statement, we need only observe that parallelism of two lines means equality of their slopes. Since the slope of the chord))) The mean-ralue theoremfor derivatives) 185) AB is the quotient [f(b) - f(a)]/(b- a) and since the slope of the tangent line at c is the derivative f' (c), the above assertion states that) (4.24)) f(b) - f(a) = f'(c)b-a) for some e in the open interval (a, b). To exhibit strong intuitive evidence for the truth of (4.24), we may think of f(t) as the distance traveled by a moving particle at time t. Then the quotient on the left of (4.24) represents the mean or average speed in the time interval [a, b], and the derivative f'(t) represents the instantaneous speed at time t. The equation asserts that there must be some moment when the instantaneous speed is equal to the average speed. For example, if the average speed during an automobile trip is 45 mph, then the speedometer must register 45 mph at least once during the trip. The mean-valuetheorem may be stated formally as follows.) THEOREM 4.5. MEAN-VALUE THEOREM FOR DERIVATIVES. Assun1e that f is continuous everYH'here on a closed interval [a, b] and has a derivative at each point of the open interval (a, b). Then there is at least one interior point e of (a, b)for which) ( 4.25)) f(b) - f(a) = f'(e)(b- a) .) Proof To apply Rolle's theorem we need a function which has equal values at the endpoints a and b. To construct such a function, we modify f as follows. Let) hex) = f(x)(b - a) - x[f(b) - f(a)] .) Then h(a) = h(b) = bf(a) - af(b). Also, h is continuous on [a, b] and has a derivative in the open interval (a, b). Applying Rolle's theorem to h, we find that h'(e) = 0 for some e in (a, b). But) h'(x) = f'(x)(b - a) - [f(b) - f(a)] .) When x = c, this gives us Equation (4.25).) Notice that the theorem makes no assertion about the exact location of the one or more \\\"mean values\\\" e, except to say that they all lie some\\0371'here between a and b. For some functions the position of the mean values may be specified exactly, but in most cases it is very difficult to make an accurate determination of these points. Nevertheless, the real usefulness of the theorem lies in the fact that many conclusions can be drawn from the knowledge of the mere existenceof at least one mean value.) Note: It is important to realize that the conclusion of the mean-valuetheorem may fail to hold if there is any point between a and b where the derivative does not exist. For ex- ample, the function f defined by the equation f(x) = Ixl is continuous everywhere on the))) 186) Differential calculus) real axis and has a derivative everywhere except at O. Let A = ( -1, [( -1\\302\\273and let B = (2,[(2\\302\\273. The slope of the chord joining A and B is) [(2) - [( -1) 2 - ( -1)) 2 - 1- 3) 1 3) but the derivative is nowhere equal to t. The following extension of the mean-value theorem is often useful.) THEOREM 4.6. CAUCHY'S MEAN-VALUE FORMULA. Let f and g be two functions con- tinuous on a closedinterval [a, b] and having derivatives in the open interval (a, b). Then, for some c in ( a, b), \\037vehave) f'(c)[g(b) - g(a)] = g'(c)[f(b)- .r(a)] \\302\\267) Proof The proof is similar to that of Theorem 4.5. We let) hex) = f(x) [g(b) - g(a)]- g(x)[f(b) - f(a)] .) Then h(a) = h(b) = f(a)g(b) - g(a)f(b). Applying Rolle's theorem to h, we find that h'(c) = 0 for some c in (a, b). Computing h'(c) from the formula defining h, we obtain Cauchy's mean-value formula. Theorem 4.5 is the special case obtained by taking g(x) = x.) 4.15 Exercises) 1.

(a) Define a new function g on [a, b] as follows:) f(x) - f(a) g(x) = x - a) if x:rf a,) g(a) = f'(a) .) Prove that g takes on every value between f'(a) and g(b) in the open interval (a, b). Use the mean-value theorem for derivatives to show that f' takes on every value between f'(a) and g(b) in the open interval (a, b). (b) Definea new function h on [a, b] as follows:) f(x) - f(b) hex) = bx-) if x:rf b,) h(b) = .!'(b).) By an argument similar to that in part (a), show that f' takes on every value between ,f'(b) and h(a) in (a, b). Since h(a) = g(b),this proves the intermediate-value theorem for derivatives.) 4.16 Applications of the mean-value theorem to geometric properties of functions The mean-value theorem may be used to deduce properties of a function from a knowledge of the algebraic sign of its derivative. This is illustrated by the following theorem.) THEOREM 4.7. Let f be a function which is continuous on a closedinterval [a, b] and assunle f has a derivative at each point of the open interl'al (a, b). Then ire have: (a) If.('(x) > 0for every x in (a, b),f is strictly increasing on [a, b]; (b) Iff'(x) < 0for every x in (a, b),f is strictly decreasing on [a, b]; (c) Iff'(x) = 0for every x in (a, b), f is constant throughout [a, b].) Proof To prove (a) we must show thatf(x) <fey) whenever a < x < y < b. There- fore, suppose x < y and apply the mean-value theorem to the closed subinterval [x, y]. We obtain) (4.26)) fey) - f(x) = f'(c)(y - x),) where x < c < Y .) Since both f'(e) and y - x are positive, so is fey) - f(x), and this means f(x) < fey), as))) 188) Differential calculus) asserted. This proves (a), and the proof of (b) is similar. To prove (c), we use Equation (4.26) with x = a. Since f'(C) = 0, we have fey) = I(a) for every y in [a, b], so fis constant on [a, b].) We can use Theorem 4.7 to prove that an extremum occurs whenever the derivative changes sign.) THEOREM 4.8. Assume f is continuous on a closed interval [a, b] and assume that the derivative f' exists everywhere in the open interval (a, b), exceptpossibly at a point c. (a) If j\\\"(x) is positive for all x < c and negative for all x > c, then f has a relative maximum at c. (b) If, on the other hand, f'(X) is negative for all x < c and positive for all x > c, then f has a relative minimum at c.) Proof In case (a), Theorem 4.7(a) tells us that f is strictly increasing on [a, c] and strictly decreasing on [c, b]. Hence f(x) <f(c) for all x \\302\\245=c in (a, b), so f has a relative) a) c) b) a) c) b) (a) Relative maximum at c) (b) Relative minimum at c) FIGURE 4.12 An extremum occurs when the derivative changes sign.) maximum at c. This proves (a) and the proof of (b) is entirely analogous. The two cases are illustrated in Figure 4.12.) 4.17 Second-derivative test for extrema If a function f is continuous on a closedinterval [a, b], the extreme-value theorem tells us that it has an absolute maximum and an absolute minimum somewhere in [a, b]. If f has a derivative at each interior point, then the only places where extrema can occurare: (1) at the endpoints a and b; (2) at those interior points x where f'ex) = O. Points of type (2) are often called critical points off To decide whether there is a maximum or a minimum (or neither) at a critical point c, we need more information aboutf Usually the behavior of f at a critical point can be determined from the algebraic sign of the derivative near c. The next theorem shows that a study of the sign of the second derivative near c can also be helpful.))) Curve sketching) 189) THEOREM 4.9. SECOND-DERIVATIVE TEST FOR AN EXTREMUM AT A CRITICAL POINT. Let c be a critical point off in an open interval (a, b); that is, assume a < c < band f'(C) = O. Assume also that the second derivative f\\\" exists in (a, b). Then H'e have the folloH'ing: (a) Iff\\\" is negative in (a, b), f has a relative n1aximum at c. (b) Iff\\\" is positivein (a, b),f has a relative minimum at c.) The two cases are illustrated in Figure 4.12.) Proo.f Consider case (a),f\\\" < 0 in (a, b). By Theorem 4.7 (applied to f'), the function f' is strictly decreasing in (a, b). But f'(c) = 0, sof' changes its sign from positive to negative at c, as shown in Figure 4.12(a). Hence, by Theorem 4.8,fhas a relative maximum at c. The proof in case (b) is entirely analogous.) Iff\\\" is continuous at c, and iff\\\"(c) -=;f 0, there will be a neighborhood of c in which f\\\" has the same sign as f\\\"(c). Therefore, if f'(c) = 0, the functionf has a relative maximum at c if f\\\"(c) is negative, and a relative minimum if f\\\"(c) is positive. This test suffices for many examples that occur in practice. The sign of the second derivative also governs the convexity or the concavity off The next theorem shows that the function is convex in intervals wheref\\\" is positive,as illustrated by Figure 4.12(b). In Figure 4.12(a),f is concave because f\\\" is negative. It sufficesto discuss only the convex case, becauseiff' is convex, then - f is concave.) THEOREM 4.10. DERIVATIVE TEST FOR CONVEXITY. Assume f is continuous on [a, b] and has a derivative in the open interval (a, b). Iff' is increasing on ( a, b), then f is convex on [a, b]. In particular,fis convex iff\\\" exists and is nonnegative in (a, b).) Proof Take x < y in [a, b] and let z = ay + (1 - a)x, where 0 < a < 1. We wish to prove that fez) < af(y) + (1- a)f(x). Since f(z) = af(z) + (1 - a)f(z), this is the same as proving that) (1 - a)[f(z) - f(x)] < a[f(y) - fez)] .) By the mean-value theorem (applied twice),there exist points c and d satisfying x < c < z and z < d < Y such that) fez) - f(x) = f\\037(c)(z - x),) and) f(y) - fez) = f'(d)(y - z) .) Sincef' is increasing, we havef'(c) < f'ed). Also, we have (1 - a)(z - x) = a(y - z), so we may write) (1 - a)[f(z) - f(x)] = (1 - a)f'(c)(z- x) < af'(d)(y - z) = a[f(y) - fez)] ,) which proves the required inequality for convexity.) 4.18 Curve sketching The information gathered in the theorems of the last few sectionsis often useful in curve sketching. In drawing the graph of a function f, we should first determine the domain off))) 190) Differential calculus) [the set of x for which f(x) is defined] and, if it is easy to do so, we should find the range off (the set of values taken on by f). A knowledge of the domain and range givesus an idea of the extent of the curvey = f(x), since it specifies a portion of the xy-plane in which the entire curve must lie. Then it is a good idea to try to locate those points (if any) where the curve crosses the coordinate axes. These are called intercepts of the graph. The y-intercept is simply the point (O,f(O)), assuming 0 is in the domain off, and the x-intercepts are those points (x,0) for which f(x) = O. Computing the x-intercepts may be extremely difficult in practice, and we may have to be content with approximate values only. We should also try to determine intervals in which f is monotonic by examining the sign of f', and to determine intervals of convexity and concavity by studying the sign of f\\\". Specialattention should be paid to those points where the graph has horizontal tangents.) EXAMPLE 1. The graph of y = f(x), where f(x) = x + 11xfor x -=;f O. In this case, there are no intercepts on either axis. The first two derivatives are given by the formulas) f'(x) = 1 - llx 2 ,) f\\\"(x) = 21x 3 .) y) y) x) 1 v1) 1 V3) 2) FIGURE 4.13 Graph of f(x) = x + IJx.) FIGURE 4.14 Graph of f(x) = IJ(x 2 + I).) The first derivative is positive if x 2 > 1, negative if x 2 < 1, and zero if x 2 = 1. Hence there is a relative minimum at x = 1 and a relative maximum at x = -1. For x > 0, the second derivative is positive so the first derivative is strictly increasing. For x < 0, the second derivative is negative, and therefore the first derivative is strictly decreasing. For x near 0, the term x is small compared to llx, and the curve behaves like the curvey = llx. (See Figure 4.13.) On the other hand, for very large x (positive or negative), the term 11 x is small compared to x, and the curve behaves very much like the line y = X. In this example, the function is odd, f( -x) = - f(x), so the graph is symmetric with respect to the origin. In the foregoing example, the line y = x is an asymptote of the curve. In general, a nonverticalline with equation y = mx + b is called an asymptote of the graph of y = f(x) if the difference f(x) - (mx + b) tends to 0 as x takes arbitrarily large positive values or))) Worked examples of extremum problems) 191) arbitrarily large negative values. A vertical line, x = a, is called a vertical asymptote if If(x) I takes arbitrarily large values as x \\037 a from the right or from the left. In the foregoing example, the y-axis is a vertical asymptote.) EXAMPLE 2. The graph of y = f(x), H'here f(x) = If(x 2 + 1). This is an even function, positive for all x, and has the x-axis as a horizontal asymptote. The first derivative is given by) -2x f'(x) = (x2 + 1)2') so f'ex) < 0 if x > 0, f'(x) > 0 if x < 0, and f'(x) = 0 when x = O. Therefore the function increases over the negative axis, decreases over the positive axis, and has a relative maximum at x = O. Differentiating once more, we find that) j\\\"(x) = (x 2 + 1)2( -2) - (-2x)2(x 2 + 1)(2x) = 2(3x2 - 1) . (x 2 + 1)4 (x 2 + 1)3) Thus f\\\"(x) > 0 if 3x 2 > 1, and f\\\"(x) < 0 if 3x 2 < 1. Hence, the first derivative increases when x 2 > \\037and decreases when x 2 < \\037. This information suffices to draw the curve in Figure 4.14. The two points on the graph corresponding to x 2 = i, where the second derivative changes its sign, are called points of in.flection.) 4.19 Exercises) In the following exercises, (a) find all points x such that j\\\"(x) = 0; (b) examine the sign of [' and determine those intervals in which [is monotonic ; (c) examine the sign of,f\\\" and determine those intervals in which ,f' is monotonic; (d) make a sketch of the graph of f In each case, the function is defined for all x for which the given formula for [(x) is meaningful. 1 8.

As a matter of fact, the rudiments of differential calculus were first developed when Fermat tried to find general methods for determining maxima and minima. We shall solve a few examples in this section and give the reader an opportunity to solve others in the next set of exercises. First we formulate two simple principles which can be used to solve many extremum pro blems.))) 192) Differential calculus) EXAMPLE 1. Constant-sum, maximum-product principle. Given a posItIve number S. Prove that among all choicesof positive numbers x and y with x + Y = S, the product xy is largest when x = y = is.) Proof If x + y = S, then y = S - x and the product xy is equal to xeS - x) = xS - x 2 . Let I(x) = xS - x 2 . This quadratic polynomial has first derivative f'ex) = S - 2x which is positive for x < ts and negative for x > tS. Hence the maximum of xy occurs when x = ts, y = S - x = is. This can also be proved without the use of calculus. We simply write I(x) = !S2 - (x- is)2and note that I(x) is largest when x = tS.) EXAMPLE 2. Constant-product, mlnlmum-sum principle. Given a posItIve number P. Prove that among all choices of positive numbers x and y with xy = P, the sum x + y is smallest when x = y = vip .) Proof We must determine the minimum of the function I(x) = x + Pix for x > O. The first derivative is f'ex) = 1 - Plx 2 . This is negative for x2 < P and positive for x2 > P, so I(x) has its minimum at x = vIP. Hence, the sum x + y is smallest when x = y = vIP.) EXAMPLE 3. Among all rectangles of given perimeter, the square has the largest area.) Proof We use the result of Example 1. Let x and y denote the sides of a general rectangle. If the perimeter is fixed, then x + y is constant, so the area xy has its largest value when x = y. Hence, the maximizing rectangleis a square.) EXAMPLE 4. The geometric mean of two positive numbers does not exceed their arith- metic mean. That is, VQb < t(a + b).) Proof Given a > 0, b > 0, let P = ab. Among all positive x and y with xy = P, the sum x + y is smallest when x = y = vIP. In other words, if xy = P, then x + y > vIP + vIP = 2 vIP. In particular, a + b > 2vIP = 2VQb, so VQb < t(a + b). Equality occurs if and only if a = b.) EXAMPLE 5. A block of weight W is to be moved along a fiat table by a force inclined at an angle 8 with the line of motion, where0 < 8 < t1T, as shown in Figure 4.15. Assume the motion is resisted by a frictional force which is proportional to the normal force with which the block presses perpendicularly against the surface of the table. Find the angle 8 for which the propelling force needed to overcome friction will be as small as possible.) Solution. Let F(8) denote the propelling force. It has an upward vertical component F(8) sin 8, so the net normal force pressingagainst the table is N = W - F(8) sin 8. The frictional force is flN, where fl (the Greek letter mu) is a constant called the coefficient of friction. The horizontal component of the propelling force is F(8) cos 8. When this is))) Worked exan1ples of extremum problen1s) 193) equated to the frictional force, we get F(O)cas 0 = fl[ W - F(O) sin 0] from which we find) F(O) = ,uW . cas 0 + fl sin 0) To minimize F(O), we maximize the denominator g(O) = cas 0 + fl sin 0 in the interval o < 0 < \\0371T. At the endpoints, we have g(O)= 1 and g(\\0371T) = fl. In the interior of the interval.. we have) g'(O) = -sin 0 + fl cas 0 ,) so g has a critical point at 0 = rx, where sin rJ.. = fl cas rx. This gives g( rx) = cas rJ.. + fl2 cas rx = (1 + fl2) cas rx. We can express cas rx in terms of fl. Since fl2 cos 2 rx = s in 2 rx = 1 - cos 2 rx, we find (1 + fl2) cos 2 rx = 1, so cas rx = I/ V l + fl2.

Find the shortest distance from a given point (0, b) on the y-axis to the parabola x 2 = 4y. (The number b may have any real value.)) Solution. The parabola is shown in Figure 4.16. The quantity to be minimized is the distance d, where) d = V x 2 + (y - b)2 ,) subject to the restriction x 2 = 4y. It is clear from the figure that when b is negative the minimum distance is Ibl. As the point (0, b) moves upward along the positive y-axis,))) 194) Differential calculus) the minimum is b until the point reaches a certain special posItIon, above which the minimum is <b. The exact location of this special position will now be determined. First of all, we observe that the point (x, y) that minimizes d also minimizes d 2 . (This observation enables us to avoid differentiation of square roots.) At this stage, we may express d 2 in terms of x alone or elsein terms of y alone. We shall expressd2 in terms of y and leave it as an exercise for the reader to carry out the calculations when d 2 is expressed in terms of x. Therefore the function f to be minimized is given by the formula) fey) = d 2 = 4y + (y - b)2.) Although fey) is defined for all real y, the nature of the problem requires that we seek the minimum only among those y > O. The derivative, given by f'(y) = 4 + 2(y - b), is zero only when y = b - 2. When b < 2, this leads to a negative critical point y which is excluded by the restriction y > O. In other words,if b < 2, the minimum does not occur at a critical point. In fact, when b < 2, we see that f'(y) > 0 when y > 0, and hence f is strictly increasing for y > O. Therefore the absolute minimum occurs at the endpoint y = O. The corresponding minimum d is V b 2 = Ibl. If b > 2, there is a legitimate crItical point at y = b - 2. Since f\\\"(y) = 2 for all y, the derivative f' is increasing, and hence th e absolute m inimum of f occurs at this critical point. The minimum d is V 4(b - 2) + 4 = 2V b - 1. Thus we have shown that the minimum distanceis I bl if b < 2 and is 2V b - 1 if b > 2. (The value b = 2 is the special value referred to above.)) 4.21 Exercises) 1.

We shall not make use of the results of this section anywhere else in Volume I, so this material may be omitted or postponed without loss in continuity. In Chapter 1, a function was defined to be a correspondence which associates with each object in a set X one and only one object in another set Y; the set X is referred to as the domain of the function. Up to now, we have dealt with functions having a domain consisting of points on the x-axis. Such functions are usually called functions of one real variable. It is not difficult to extend many of the ideas of calculus to functions of two or more real variables. By a real-valued function of two real variables we mean one whose domain X is a set of points in the xy-plane. If f denotes such a function, its value at a point (x, y) is a real number, written f(x, y). It is easy to imagine how such a function might arise in a physical problem. For example,supposea fiat metal plate in the shape of a circular disk of radius 4 centimeters is placed on the xy-plane, with the center of the disk at the origin and with the disk heated in such a way that its temperature at each point (x,y) is 16- x 2 - y2 degrees centigrade. If we denote the temperature at (x, y) by f(x, y), then f is a function of two variables defined by the equation) ( 4.27)) f(x,y) = 16 - x 2 - y2.) The domain of this function is the set of all points (x,y) whose distance from the origin does not exceed4. The theorem of Pythagoras tells us that all points (x, y) at a distance))) Partial derivatives) 197) r from the origin satisfy the equation) (4.28)) x 2 + y2 = r2.) Therefore the domain in this case consists of all points (x, y) which satisfy the inequality x 2 + y2 < 16. Note that on the circle described by (4.28), the temperature is f(x, y) = 16- r 2 . That is, the function f is constant on each circle with center at the origin. (See Figure 4.19.) We shall describe two useful methods for obtaining a geometric picture of a function of two variables. One is by means of a surface in space. To construct this surface, we introduce a third coordinate axis (called the z-axis); it passes through the origin and is perpendicular) z) y) x) 16 2 2z= -x-y) (0,4)) (4,0))x) y) (X,y,O)) FIGURE 4.19 The temperature is constant on each circle with center at the origin.) FIGURE 4.20 The surface represented by the equation z = 16 - x 2 - y2.) to the xy-plane. Above each point (x,y) we plot the point (x, y, z) whose z-coordinate is obtained from the equation z = f(x, y). The surface for the example deseribed above is shown in Figure 4.20. If we placed a thermometer at a point (x, y) on the plate, the top of the mercury column would just touch the surface at the point (x, y, z) where z = f(x, y) provided, of course,that unit distances on the z-axis are properly chosen. A different kind of picture of a function of two variables can be drawn entirely in the xy-plane. This is the method of contour lines that is used by map makers to represent a three-dimensionallandscapeby a two-dimensional drawing. We imagine that the surface described above has been cut by various horizontal planes (parallel to the xy-plane). They intersect the surface at those points (x,y, z) whose elevation z is constant. By projecting these points on the xy-plane, we get a family of contour lines or level curves. Each level curve consists of those and only those points (x, y) whose coordinates satisfy the equation))) 198) Differential calculus) z) y) y) x) (a)) z = xy) (b) Levelcurves:xy = c) FIGURE 4.21 (a) A surface whose equation is z = xy. (b) The corresponding level curves xy = constant.) I(x, y) = c, where c is the constant elevation for that particular curve. In the example mentioned above, the level curves are concentric circles, and they represent curves. of constant temperature, or isothermals, as might be drawn on a weather map. Another example of a surface and its level curves is shown in Figure 4.21. The equation in this case is z = xy. The \\\"saddle-shaped\\\" surface is known as a hyperbolic paraboloid. Contour lines on topographic maps are often shown for every 100 ft of elevation. When they are close together, the elevation is changing rapidly as we move from one contour to the next; this happens in the vicinity of a steep mountain. When the contour lines are far apart the elevation is changing slowly . We can get a general idea of the steepness of a) z) / Plane where y = Yo) z = f(x,yo) on this curve) Surface whose is z = f(x,y)) y) x) FIGURE 4.22 The curve of intersection of a surface z = f(x, y) and a plane y = Yo.))) Partial derivatives) 199) landscape by considering the spacing of its level curves. However, to get precise information concerning the rate of change of the elevation, we must describe the surface in terms of a function to which we can apply the ideas of differential calculus. The rate at which the elevation is changing at a point (xo,Yo) depends on the direction in which we move away from this point. For the sake of simplicity, we shall consider at this time just the two special directions parallel to the x- and y-axes. Suppose we examine a surface described by an equation of the form z = f(x, y); let us cut this surface with a plane perpendicular to the y-axis, as shown in Figure 4.22. Such a plane consistsof all points (x, y, z) in space for which the y-coordinate is constant, say y = Yo. (The equation y = Yo is called an equation of this plane.) The intersection of this plane with the surface is a plane curve, all points of which satisfy the equation z = f(x, Yo)' On this curve the elevation f(x, Yo) is a function of x alone. Suppose now we move from a point (xo,Yo) to a point (xo + h, Yo)' The corresponding change in elevation is f(x o + h, Yo) - f(x o , Yo)' This suggests that we form the difference quotient) ( 4.29)) f(x o + h, Yo) - f(x o , Yo) h) and let h --+ O. If this quotient approaches a definite limit as h --+ 0, we call this limit the partial derivative off tvith respect to x at (xo,Yo)' There are various symbols that are used to denote partial derivatives, some of the most common ones being) \\037f(xo' Yo) ox) f \\037(xo, Yo) ,) fx(xo, Yo) ,) fl(X O' Yo) ,) DJf(x o , Yo) .) The subscript 1 in the last two notations refers to the fact that only the first coordinate is allowed to change when we form the difference quotient in (4.29). Thus we have) t ( ) 1 . f (x 0 + h, Yo) - f( x0 , Yo) J 1 xo , Yo = 1m h . h--O) Similarly, we define the partial derivative a'ith respect to y at (xo , Yo) by the equation) I' ( ) 1 . f(xo, Yo + k) - f(xo , Yo) J2 Xo , Yo = 1m , k-+O k) alternative notations being) of(x o , Yo) oy) f\\037(xo , Yo) ,) fy(x o , Yo) ,) D2f(xo, Yo) .) If we write z = f(x, y), then ozjox and ozjoy are also used to denote partial derivatives. Partial differentiation is not a new concept. If we introduce another function g of one variable, defined by the equation) g(x) = f(x, Yo) ,))) 200) Differential calculus) then the ordinary derivative g'(xo) is exactly the same as the partial derivative f1(XO , Yo)' Geometrically, the partial derivative f1(X,Yo) represents the slope of the tangent line at a typical point of the curve shown in Figure 4.22. In the same way, when x is constant, say x = Xo, the equation z = f(x o , y) describes the curve of intersection of the surface with the plane whose equation is x = Xo. The partial derivative f2(X O , y) gives the slope of the line tangent to this curve. From theseremarks we see that to compute the partial derivative off(x, y) with respect to x, we can treat y as though it were constant and use the ordinary rules of differential calculus. Thus, for example, if f(x, y) = 16- x 2 - y2, we get fleX, y) = -2x. Similarly, if we hold x fixed, we find f2(x, y) = -2y. Another example is the function given by) ( 4.30)) f(x,y) = x siny + y2 cos xy.) Its partial derivatives are) flex, y) = sin y - y3 sin xy ,) f2(x, y) = X cos y - xy2 sin xy + 2y cos xy .) Partial differentiation is a process which produces new functions f1 = of/ox and f2 = of/oy from a given function f Since fl and f2 are also functions of two variables, we can consider their partial derivatives. These are called second-order partial derivatives of f, denoted as follows:) 02f fl,l = fxx = ox 2 ') 02f /1,2 =/XY = oy OX') 02f /2,1 =/YX = ox oy') 02f /2,2 = /YY = oy2 .) Notice that fl,2 means (f1)2 , the partial derivative offl with respect to y. In the o-notation, we indicate the order of derivatives by writing) 02f 0 ( Of )oy ox = oy ox \\302\\267) This does not always yield the same result as the other mixed partial derivative,) 02j 0 ( Of )ox oy = ax oy .) However, equality of the two mixed partial derivatives does hold under certain conditions that are usually satisfied by most functions that occur in practice. We shall discuss these conditions further in Volume II. Referring to the example in (4.27), we find that its second-order partial derivatives are given by the following formulas:) fl,l(x, y) = -2,) fl,2(x,y) = J2,1(X, y) = 0,) f2,2(x, y) = -2 .)))

The first fundamental theorem of calculus We come now to the remarkable connection that exists between integration and differentiation. The relationship between these two processes is somewhat analogous to that which holds between \\\"squaring\\\" and \\\"taking the square root.\\\" If we square a positive number and then take the positive square root of the result, we get the original number back again. Similarly, if we operate on a continuous function f by integration, we get a new function (an indefinite integral of f) which, when differentiated, leads back to the original function f For example, if f(x) = x 2 , then an indefinite integral A of f may be defined by the equation) f x f x X3 c 3 A(x) = f(t) dt = t 2 dt = - - - , c c 3 3) where c is a constant. Differentiating, we find A'(x) = x 2 = f(x). This example illustrates a general result, called the first fundamental theorem of calculus, which may be stated as follows:) THEOREM 5.1. FIRST FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS. Let f be a function that is integrable on [a, x] for each x in [a, b]. Let c be such that a < c < b and define a new function A as follows:) A(x) = r J(t) dt) if) a < x < h.) Then the derivative A'(x) exists at each point x in the open interval (a, b) wherefis continuous, and for such x lve have) (5.1)) A'(x) = f(x) .) First we give a geometric argument which suggests why the theorem ought to be true; then we give an analytic proof. 202))) Derivative of an indefinite integral. Thefirst fundamental theorem of calculus 203) Geometric motivation. Figure 5.1 shows the graph of a function f over an interval [a, b]. In the figure, h is positive and) f X+h f X+h f x x J(t) dt = c J(t) dt - c J(t) dt = A(x + h) - A(x) .) The example shown is continuous throughout the interval [x, x + h]. Therefore, by the mean-value theorem for integrals, we have) A(x + h) - A(x) = hf(z),) where x < z < x + h .) Hence we have) (5.2)) A(x + h\\037 - A(x) = f(z) ,) a) x) z x + h) b) FIGURE 5.1 Geometric motivation for the first fundamental theorem of calculus.) and, since x < z < x + h, we find that fez) \\037 f(x) as h \\037 0 through positive values. A similar argument is valid if h \\037 0 through negative values. Therefore, A'(x) exists-and is equal to f(x). This argument assumes that the function f is continuous in some neighborhood of the point x. However,the hypothesis of the theorem refers only to continuity off at a single point x. Therefore, we use a different method to prove the theorem under this weaker hypothesis.) Analytic Proof Let x be a point of continuity off, keep x fixed, and form the quotient) A(x + h) - A(x) h) To prove the theorem we must show that this quotient approaches the limit f(x) as h \\037 O. The numerator is) f X+h f x f X+h A(x + h) - A(x) = c J(t) dt - c J(t) dt = x J{t) dt .))) 204) The relation between integration and differentiation) If we write f(t) = f(x) + [f(t) - f(x)] in the last integral, we obtain) J X+h J X+h A(x + h) - A(x) = x J(x) dt + x [J(t) - J(x)] dt J X+h = hJ(x) + x [J(t) - J(x)] dt ,) from which we find) (5.3)) A(x + h) - A(x) = f(x) + 1 f \\\"+h[f(t) - f(x)] dt . h h x) Therefore, to complete the proof of (5.1),all we need to do is show that) 1 f X+h lim - [J(t) - J(x)]dt = 0 . h-+Q h x) It is this part of the proof that makes use of the continuity off at x. Let us denote the second term on the right of (5.3) by G(h). We are to prove that G(h) --+ 0 as h --+ O. Using the definition of limit, we must show that for every E > 0 there is a 0 > 0 such that) (5.4)) IG(h)1 < E) whenever 0 < Ihl < 0 .) Continuity off at x tells us that, if E is given, there is a positive 0 such that) (5.5)) If(t) - f(x) I < iE) whenever) (5.6)) x-o<t<x+o.) If we choose h so that 0 < h < 0, then every t in the interval [x, x + h) satisfies (5.6) and hence (5.5) holds for every such t. Using the property IS\\037+hg(t) dt I < S\\037+hlg(t)1 dt with g(t) = J(t) - f(x), we see that the inequality in (5.5) leads to the relation) I J X+h I J X+h J X+h x [J(t) - J(x)] dt < x IJ(t) - J(x)1dt < x lE dt = thE < hE .) If we divide by h, we see that (5.4) holds for 0 < h < o. If h < 0, a similar argument proves that (5.4) holds whenever 0 < Ihl < 0, and this completes the proof.) 5.2 The zero-derivativetheorem If a functionfis constant on an open interval (a, b), its derivative is zero everywhereon (a, b). We proved this fact earlier as an immediate consequence of the definition of derivative. We also proved, as part (c) of Theorem 4.7, the converse of this statement which we restate here as a separate theorem.))) Primitive functions and the second fundamental theoren1 of calculus 205) THEOREM 5.2. ZERO-DERIVATIVE THEOREM. If f'ex) = 0 for each x in an open interval I, then f is constant on I.) This theorem, when used in combination with the first fundamental theorem of calculus, leads to the second fundamental theorem which is described in the next section.) 5.3 Primitive functions and the second fundamental theorem of calculus) DEFINITION OF PRIMITIVE FUNCTION. A function P is called a primitive (or an antiderivative) of a function f on an open interval I if the derivative of P isf, that is, if P'(x) = f(x) for all x in I.) For example, the sine function is a primitive of the cosine on every interval because the derivative of the sine is the cosine. We speak of a primitive, rather than the primitive, because if P is a primitive of fthen so is P + k for every constant k. Conversely, any two primitives P and Q of the same function f can differ only by a constant because their differenceP - Q has the derivative) PI(X) - Q'(X) = f(x) - f(x) = 0) for every x in I and hence, by Theorem 5.2, P - Q is constant on I. The first fundamental theorem of calculus tells us that we can always construct a primitive of a continuous function by integration. When we combine this with the fact that two primitives of the same function can differ only by a constant, we obtain the second fundamental theorem of calcul us.) THEOREM 5.3. SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS. Assume f is continuous on an open interval I, and let P be an.y primitive of f on I. Then,for each c and each x in I, \\037vehave) (5.7)) P(x) = P(c) + f' f(t) dt .) Proof Let A(x) = S\\037f(t) dt. Since f is continuous at each x in I, the first fundamental theorem tells us that A'(x) = f(x) for all x in I. In other words, A is a primitive off on I. Since two primitives of f can differ only by a constant, we must have A(x) - P(x) = k for some constant k. When x = c, this formula implies -P(c) = k, since A(c) = O. Therefore, A(x) - P(x)= -P(c),from which we obtain (5.7).) Theorem 5.3tellsus how to find every primitive P of a continuous functionf We simply integrateffrom a fixed point c to an arbitrary point x and add the constant P(c)to get P(x). But the real power of the theorem becomes apparent when we write Equation (5.7) in the following form:) (5.8)) r f(t) dt = P(x) - P(c) \\302\\267) In this form it tells us that we can compute the value of an integral by a mere subtraction))) 206) The relation between integration and differentiation) if we know a primitive P. The problem of evaluating an integral is transferred to another problem-that of finding a primitive P of f In actual practice, the second problem is a great deal easierto deal with than the first. Every differentiation formula, when read in reverse, gives us an example of a primitive of some function f and this, in turn, leads to an integration formula for this function. From the differentiation formulas worked out thus far we can derive the following integration formulas as consequences of the second fundamental theorem.) EXAMPLE 1. Integration of rational powers. The integration formula) (5.9)) f b bn+l - a n + 1 x n dx = a n + 1) (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .)) was proved in Section 1.23 directly from the definition of the integral. The result may be rederived and generalized to rational exponents by using the second fundamental theorem. First of all, we observe that the function P defined by the equation) (5.10)) xn+l P(x) = n + 1) has the derivative P'(X) = xn if n is any nonnegative integer. Sincethis is valid for all real x, we may use (5.8) to write) f b bn+l - a n + 1 x n dx = PCb) - Pea)= a n + 1) for all intervals [a, b]. This formula, proved for all integers n > 0, also holds for all negative integersexcept n = -1, which is excluded because n + 1 appears in the denominator. To prove (5.9) for negative n, it suffices to show that (5.10) implies P'(x) = x n when n is negative and \\302\\245:--1, a fact which is easily verified by differentiating P as a rational -function. Of course, when n is negative, neither P(x) nor P'(X) is defined for x = 0, and when we use (5.9) for negative n, it is important to exclude those intervals [a, b] that contain the point x = o. The results of Example 3 in Section 4.5 enable us to extend (5.9) to all rational exponents (except -1), provided the integrand is defined everywhere on the interval [a, b] under consideration. For example, if 0 < a < band n = -!, we find) f b 1 f b Xl/2 b - dx = x-l/ 2 dx = 1 = 2(0 - va). a.yX a 2\\\" a) This result was proved earlier, using the area axioms. The present proof makesno use of these axioms. In the next chapter we shall define a general power function f such that .(x) = XC for every real exponent c. We shall find that this function has the derivative f'ex) = CX C- 1 and))) Properties of a function deducedfrom properties of its derivative) 207) the primitive P(x) = X C+ 1j(c + 1) if c \\302\\245:--1. This will enable us to extend (5.9) to all real exponentsexcept-I. Note that we cannot get P'(x) = Ijx by differentiation of any function of the form P(x) = x n . Nevertheless, there exists a function P whose derivative is P'(x) = Ijx. To exhibit such a function all we need to do is write a suitable indefinite integral; for example,) J x 1 P(x) = - dt 1 t) if) x > o.) This integral exists because the integrand is monotonic. The function so defined is called the logarithm (more specifically, the natural logarithm). Its properties are developed systematically in Chapter 6.) EXAMPLE 2. Integration of the sine and cosine. Since the derivative of the sine is the cosine and the derivative of the cosine is minus the sine, the second fundamental theorem also gives us the following formulas:) I: cas x dx = sin x I:= sin b - sin a ,) e sin x dx = (-cas x) I b = cos a - cos b . .a a) These formulas were also proved in Chapter 2 directly from the definition of the integral. Further examples of integration formulas can be obtained from Examples 1 and 2 by taking finite sums of terms of the form Ax n , B sin x, C cosx, where A, B, C are constants.) 5.4 Propertiesof a function deduced from properties of its derivative) If a function fhas a continuousderivative f' on an open interval I, the second fundamental theorem states that) (5.11)) f(x) = f(c) + f' f'(t) dt) for every choice of points x and c in I. This formula, which expresses f in terms of its derivative f', enables us to deduce properties of a function from properties of its derivative. Although the following properties have already been discussedin Chapter 4, it may be of interest to see how they can also be deduced as simple consequences of Equation (5.11). Supposef' is continuous and nonnegative on I. If x > c,then S\\037f'(t) dt > 0, and hence I(x) > f(c). In other words, if the derivative is continuous and nonnegative on I, the function is increasing on I. In Theorem 2.9 we proved that the indefinite integral of an increasing function is convex. Therefore, iff' is continuous and increasingon I, Equation (5.11) shows thatfis convex on I. Similarly, f is concave on those intervals where f' is continuous and decreasing.))) 208 The relation between integration and differentiation) 5.5 Exercises) In each of Exercises 1 through 10, find a primitive of [; that is, find a function P such that P/(x) = [(x) and use the second fundamental theorem to evaluate J\\037.f(x) dx. 1.

First we discuss some notation introduced by Leibniz. We have defined a primitive P of a functionfto be any function for which P'(x) = f(x). Iff is continuous on an interval, one primitive is given by a formula of the form) P(x) = f' J(t) dt ,) and all other primitives can differ from this one only by a constant. Leibniz used the symbol Sf(x) dx to denote a general primitive off In this notation, an equation like) (5.12)) f J(x) dx = P(x) + C) is considered to be merely an alternative way of writing P'(x) = f(x). For example, since the derivative of the sine is the cosine, we may write) (5.13)) f cos x dx = sin x + c .) Similarly, since the derivative of xn+lJ(n + 1) is x n , we may write) (5.14)) J xn+l x n dx = + c , n + 1))) The Leibniz notation for primitives) 211) for any rational power n \\037 -1. The symbol C represents an arbitrary constant so each of Equations (5.13)and (5.14) is really a statement about a whole set of functions. Despite similarity in appearance, the symbol Sf(x) dx is conceptually distinct from the integration symbol S\\037 f(x) dx. The symbols originate from two entirely different processes-differentiation and integration. Since, however, the two processes are related by the fundamental theorems of calculus, there are correspondingrelationships between the two symbols. The first fundamental theorem states that any indefinite integral of f is also a primitive of f Therefore we may replaceP(x) in Equation (5.12) by S\\037f(t) dt for some lower limit c and write (5.12) as follows:) (5.15)) I f(x) dx= r f(t)dt + C \\302\\267) This means that we can think of the symbol Sf(x) dx as representing some indefinite integral off, plus a constant. The secondfundamental theorem tells us that for any primitive P off and for any constant C, we have) I: f(x) dx = [P(x) + C) I: .) If we replace P(x) + C by Sf(x) dx, this formula may be written in the form) (5.16)) I: f(x) dx = I f(x) dx I:.) The two formulas in (5.15) and (5.16) may be thought of as symbolic expressions of the first and second fundamental theorems of calculus. Becauseof long historical usage, many calculus textbooks refer to the symbol Sf(x) dx as an \\\"indefinite integral\\\" rather than as a primitive or an antiderivative. This is justified, in part, by Equation (5.15), which tells us that the symbol Sf(x) dx is, apart from an additive constant C, an indefinite integral off F or the same reason, many handbooks of mathematical tables contain extensive lists of formulas labeled \\\"tables of indefinite integrals\\\" which, in reality, are tables of primitives. To distinguish the symbol Sf(x) dx from S: f(x) dx, the latter is called a definite integral. Since the second fundamental theorem reducesthe problem of integration to that of finding a primitive, the term \\\"technique of integration\\\" is used to refer to any systematic method for finding primitives. This termi- nology is widely used in the mathematical literature, and it will be adopted also in this book. Thus, for example, when one is asked to \\\"integrate\\\" Sf(x) dx, it is to be understood that what is wanted is the most general primitive off There are three principal techniques that are used to construct tables of indefinite integrals, and they should be learned by anyone who desires a good working knowledge of calculus. They are (1) integration by substitution (to be described in the next section), a method based on the chain rule; (2) integration by parts, a method based on the formula for differentiating a product (to be described in Section 5.9); and (3) integration by partial fractions, an algebraic technique which is discussed at the end of Chapter 6. These techniques not only explain how tables of indefinite integrals are constructed, but also they tell us how certain formulas are converted to the basic forms listed in the tables.))) 212) The relation between integration and differentiation) 5.7 Integration by substitution Let Q be a composition of two functions P and g, say Q(x) = P[g(x)] for all x in some interval I. If we know the derivative of P, say P'(x) = f(x), the chain rule tells us that the derivative of Q is given by the formula Q'(x) = P'[g(x)]g'(x). Since P' = f, this states that Q'(x) = f[g(x)]g'(x). In other words,) ( 5.1 7)) P'(x) = f(x)) implies Q'(x) = f[g(x)]g'(x) .) In Leibniz notation, this statement can be written as follows: If we have the integration formula) (5.18)) I f(x) dx = P(x) + C ,) then we also have the more general formula) (5.19)) I f[g(x)]g'(x) dx = P[g(x)]+ C \\302\\267) For example, if f{x) = cos x, then (5.18) holds with P(x) = sin x, so (5.19)becomes) (5.20)) I cos g(x) \\302\\267 g'(x) dx = sin g(x) + C \\302\\267) In particular, if g(x) = x3 , this gives us) J cos x3 \\302\\2673x 2 dx = sin x3 + C ,) a result that is easily verified directly since the derivative of sin x 3 is 3x 2 cos x 3. Now we notice that the general formula in (5.19) is related to (5.18)by a simple mechanical process. Suppose we replaceg(x)everywhere in (5.19) by a new symbol u and replace g'(x) by dufdx, the Leibniz notation for derivatives. Then (5.19) becomes) f du !(u) - dx = P(u)+ C. dx) At this stage the temptation is strong to replace the combination \\037u dx by du. If we do this, the last formula becomes x) (5.21)) I feu) du = P(u) + C \\302\\267) Notice that this has exactly the same form as (5.18), except that the symbol u appears everywhere instead of x. In other words,every integration formula such as (5.18) can be made to yield a more general integration formula if we simply substitute symbols. We replacex in (5.18) by a new symbol u to obtain (5.21), and then we think ofu as representing))) Integration by substitution) 213) a new function of x, say u = g(x). Then we replace the symbol du by the combination g'(x) dx, and Equation (5.21)reducesto the general formula in (5.19). For example, if we replace x by u in the formula S cosx dx = sin x + C, we obtain) f cos u du = sin u + c .) In this latter formula, u may be replaced by g(x) and du by g'(x) dx, and a correct integration formula, (5.20), results. When this mechanical process is used in reverse, it becomes the method of integration by substitution. The object of the method is to transform an integral with a complicated integrand, such as S 3x 2 cos x 3 dx, into a more familiar integral, such as S cos u duo The method is applicable wheneverthe original integral can be written in the form) ff[g(x)]g/(x) dx,) since the substitution) u = g(x),) du = g'(x) dx ,) transforms this to Sf(u) duo If we succeed in carrying out the integration indicated by Sf(u) du, we obtain a primitive, say P(u), and then the original integral may be evaluated by replacing u by g(x) in the formula for P(u). The reader should realize that we have attached no meanings to the symbolsdx and du by themselves. They are used as purely formal devices to help us perform the mathematical operations in a mechanical way. Each time we use the process, we are really applying the statement (5.17). Successin this method depends on one's ability to determine at the outset which part of the integrand should be replacedby the symbol u, and this ability comes from a lot of experience in working out specific examples. The following examples illustrate how the method is carried out in actual practice.) EXAMPLE 1. Integrate S x3 cos x 4 dx.) Solution. Let us keep in mind that we are trying to write x 3 cos x 4 in the formf[g(x)]g'(x) with a suitable choiceoff and g. Since cos x 4 is a composition, this suggests that we take f(x) = cos x and g(x)= x 4 so that cos x 4 becomesf[g(x)]. This choice of g givesg'(x) = 4x 3 , and hence f[g(x)]g'(x) = (cosx 4 ) (4x 3 ). The extra factor 4 is easily taken care of by multiplying and dividing the integrand by 4. Thus we have) x 3 cos x 4 = l(cos x 4 )(4x 3) = if[g(x)]g'(x) .) Now, we make the substitution u = g(x) = x4, du = g'(x) dx = 4x 3 dx, and obtain) f x3cos x 4 dx = 1 f feu) du = {- f cos u du = ! sin u + c .))) 214) The relation between integration and differentiation) Replacing u by x 4 in the end result, we obtain the formula) J x 3 COSx4 dx = ! sin x4 + C ,) which can be verified directly by differentiation. After a little practice one can perform some of the above steps mentally, and the entire calculation can be given more briefly as follows: Let u = x 4. Then du = 4x 3 dx, and we obtain) J x 3 COSx 4 dx = ! J (cosx 4 )(4x 3 dx) = ! J cosu du = ! sin u + c = ! sin x 4 + C .) Notice that the method works in this example because the factor x3 has an exponent one less than the power of x which appears in cos x 4 .) EXAMPLE 2. Integrate f cos2 x sin x dx.) Solution. Let u = cos x. Then du = -sin x dx, and we get) I I I U3 cos 3 X cos 2 x sin x dx = - (cosX)2( -sin x dx) = - u 2 du = - \\\"3 + c = - 3 + c \\302\\267) Again, the final result is easily verified by differentiation.) I Sin V\\037 EXAMPLE 3. Integrate \\037 dx.) Solution. Let u = V x = X 1/ 2 . Then du = tx- 1/2 dx, or dx/\\037 = 2 duo Hence) I sin \\037 J . ...r vx dx = 2 SIll U du = - 2 cosu + c = - 2 cos'V x + c .) I xdx EXAMPLE 4. Integrate . vi 1 + x 2) Solution. Let u = 1 + x2 . Then du = 2x dx so x dx = t du, and we obtain) I x dx 1 I du 1 I 1/2 d 1/2 vi= - - = - u- u = u + c = 1 + x 2 + C . vi 1 + x2 2 \\037 2) The method of substitution is, ofcourse,also applicable to definite integrals. For example, to evaluate the definite integral f\\037 /2 cos 2 x sin x dx, we first determine the indefinite integral,))) Integration by substitution) 215) as explained in Example 2, and then we use the second fundamental theorem to write) f 1T/2 1 1T/2 1 ( 7T ) 1 cos 2 x sin x dx = - - cos 3 X = - - cos 3 - - cos 3 0 = - . o 3 0 3 2 3) Sometimes it is desirable to apply the second fundamental theorem directly to the integral expressed in terms of u. This may be done by using new limits of integration. We shall illustrate how this is carried out in a particular example, and then we shall justify the process with a general theorem.) 1 3 (x + 1) dx EXAMPLE 5. Evaluate . 2 V x 2 + 2x + 3) Solution. Let u = x 2 + 2x + 3. Then du = (2x + 2) dx, so that) (x + 1) dx _! du V x 2 + 2x + 3 - 2 \\037 .) Now we obtain new limits of integration by noting that u = 11 when x = 2, and that u = 18 when x = 3. Then we write) f 3 (x + 1)dx = 1f I8 U - I/2 du = \\037 2 V x 2 + 2x + 3 2 11) 18 =V18-vTi. 11) The same result is arrived at by expressing everything in terms of x. Thus we have) f 3 (x + 1)dx = Vx 2 + 2x + 3 3 = Y1;8 - vll. 2 V x 2 + 2x + 3 2) Now we prove a general theorem which justifies the process used in Example 5.) THEOREM 5.4. SUBSTITUTIONTHEOREM FOR INTEGRALS. ASSUlne g has a continuous derivative g' on an open interval I. Let J be the set of values taken by g on I and assume that f is continuous on J. Then for each x and c in I, H'e have) (5.22)) r x f g(X) \\037c f [g(t)]g'(t) dt = g(c) f(u) du .) Proof Let a = g(c) and define two new functions P and Q as follows:) P(x) = r f(u) du a) if x E J,) Q(x) = r f[g(t)]g'(t)dt if x E I .))) 216) The relation between integration and differentiation) Since P and Q are indefinite integrals of continuous functions, they have derivatives given by the formulas) P'(x) = f(x),) Q'(x)= f[g(x)]g'(x) .) Now let R denote the composite function, R(x) = P[g(x)]. Using the chain rule, we find) R'(x) = P'[g(x)]g'(x) = f[g(x)]g'(x) = Q'(x).) Applying the second fundamental theorem twice, we obtain) f g(X) f g(X) !(u) du = P'(u) du = P[g(x)] - P[g(c)]= R(x) - R(c), g(c) g(c)) and) r J[g(t)]g'(t) dt = f' Q'(t)dt = r R'(t) dt = R(x) - R(c) .)

When this is translated into the Leibniz notation for primitives, it becomes S f(x)g'(x) dx + Sf'(x)g(x) dx = f(x)g(x) + C, usually written as follows:) (5.23)) f f(x)g'(x) dx = f(x)g(x) - f f'(x)g(x) dx + C \\302\\267))) 218) The relation between integration and differentiation) This equation, known as the formula for integration by parts, provides us with a new integration technique. To evaluate an integral, say S k(x) dx, using (5.23), we try to find two functions f and g such that k(x) can be written in the formf(x)g'(x). If we can do this, then (5.23) tells us that we have) J k(x) dx = f(x)g(x) - I g(x)f'(x) dx + C ,) and the difficulty has been transferred to the evaluation of S g(x)f'(x) dx. If f and g are properly chosen, this last integral may be easier to evaluate than the original one. Some- times two or more applications of (5.23) will lead to an integral that is easily evaluated or that may be found in a table. The examplesworked out below have been chosen to illustrate the advantages of this method. For definite integrals, (5.23) leads to the formula) I: f(x)g'(x) dx = f(b)g(b)- f(a)g(a) - I: f'(x)g(x) dx \\302\\267) If we introduce the substitutions u = f(x), v = g(x), du = f'(x) dx, and dv = g'(x) dx, the formula for integration by parts assumes an abbreviated form that many people find easier to remember, namely) (5.24)) J u dv = uv - J v du + C \\302\\267) EXAMPLE 1. Integrate S x cos x dx.) Solution. We choose f(x) = x and g'(x) = cos x. This means that we have f'(x) = 1 and g(x) = sin x, so (5.23) becomes) (5.25)) J x casx dx= x sin x - J sin x dx + C = x sin x + cas x + C .) Note that in this case the second integral is one we have already calculated. To carry out the same calculation in the abbreviated notation of (5.24), we write) u = x,) dv = cos x dx ,) du = dx,) v = J cas x dx = sin x ,) J x cas x dx = uv - J v du = x sin x - J sin x dx + C = x sin x + casx + C .) Had we chosen u = cos x and dv = x dx, we would have obtained du = -sin x dx, v = !X2, and (5.24) would have given us) J x cas x dx = t X2 cas x - t J x 2 ( -sin x) dx + C = t X2 cas x + t J x 2 sin x dx + C .))) Integration by parts) 219) Since the last integral is one which we have not yet calculated, this choice of u and v is not as useful as the first choice. Notice, however, that we can solve this last equation for S x 2 sin x dx and use (5.25)to obtain) I x 2 sin x dx = 2xsin x + 2 cas x - x 2 cas x + c .) EXAMPLE 2. Integrate S x 2 cos x dx.) Solution. Let u = x 2 and dv = cos x dx. Then du = 2x dx and v = S cos x dx = sin x, so we have) (5.26) I x2 cas x dx = I u dv = uv - I v du + C = x 2 sin x - 2 f x sin x dx + C .) The last integral can be evaluated by applying integration by parts once more. Sinceit is similar to Example 1, we simply state the result:) I x sin x dx = - x cas x + sin x + C .) Substituting in (5.26) and consolidating the two arbitrary constants into one, we obtain) I x 2 cas x dx = x 2 sin x + 2x cas x - 2 sin x + C .) EXAMPLE 3. The method sometimes fails because it leads back to the original integral. For example, let us try to integrate S X-Idx by parts. If we let u = x and dv = x- 2 dx, then S X-I dx = S u dv. For this choice of u and v, we have du = dx and v = -x-I, so (5.24) gives us) (5.27)) I X-I dx = I u dv = uv - I v du + C = -1 + f X-I dx + C ,) and we are back where we started. Moreover, the situation does not improve if we try u = x n and dv = X- 11- 1 dx.) This example is often used to illustrate the importance of paying attention to the arbitrary constant C. If formula (5.27) is written without C, it leads to the equation S X-I dx = -1 + S X-Idx, which is sometimes used to give a fallacious proof that 0 = -1. As an application of the method of integration by parts, we obtain another version of the weighted mean-value theorem for integrals (Theorem 3.16).) THEOREM 5.5. SECOND MEAN-VALUE THEOREM FOR INTEGRALS. Assume g is continuous on [a, b], and assume f has a derivative H'hich is continuous and never changessign in [a, b]. Then, for some c in [a, b], lve have) (5.28)) I: f(x)g(x)dx= f(a)r g(x) dx + f(b) f g(x) dx .))) 220) The relation between integration and differentiation) Proof Let G(x) = S\\037get) dt.

The function concept is so broad and so general that it is not surprising to find an endless variety of functions occurring in nature. What is surprising is that a few rather special functions govern so many totally different kinds of natural phenomena. We shall study some of these functions in this chapter-first of all, the logarithm and its inverse (the exponential function) and secondly, the inverses of the trigonometric functions. Any- one who studies mathematics, either as an abstract discipline or as a tool for some other scientific field, will find that a good working knowledge of these functions and their prop- erties is indispensable. The reader probably has had occasionto work with logarithms to the base 10 in an elementary algebra or trigonometry course. The definition usually given in elementary algebra is this: If x > 0, the logarithm of x to the base 10, denotedby loglo x, is that real number u such that IOu = x. If x = IOu and y = 10v , the law of exponents yields xy = 10 u + v . In terms of logarithms, this becomes) (6.1 )) loglo(xy) = loglox + 10gloY') It is this fundamental property that makes logarithms particularly adaptable to computa- tions involving multiplication. The number 10 is useful as a base because real numbers are commonly written in the decimal system, and certain important numbers like 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10, 100,1000,... have for their logarithms the integers -2, -1,0, 1,2,3,..., respectively. It is not necessary to restrict ourselvesto base 10. Any other positive base b \\037 1 would serve equally well. Thus) ( 6.2)) u = 10gb X) means) x = bu ,) and the fundamental property in (6.1) becomes) (6.3) 226) 10gb (xy) = 10g b x + 10g b Y .))) Motivation for the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral 227) If we examine the definition in (6.2) from a critical point of view, we find that it suffers from several logical gaps. First of all, to understand (6.2) we must know what is meant by bU. This is easy to define when u is an integer or a rational number (the quotient of two integers), but it is not a trivial matter to define bu when u is irrational. For example, how should we define 10\\\\l2? Even if we manage to obtain a satisfactory definition for bU , there are further difficulties to overcome before we can use (6.2)as a good definition of logarithms. I t must be shown that for every x > 0, there actually exists a number u such that x = bU. Also, the law of exponents, bUb v = b U+ v , must be established for all real exponents u and v in order to derive (6.3) from (6.2). It is possible to overcome these difficulties and arrive at a satisfactory definition of logarithms by this method, bur the process is long and tedious. Fortunately, however, the study of logarithms can proceed in an entirely different way which is much simpler and which illustrates the power and elegance of the methods of calculus. The idea is to introduce logarithms first, and then use logarithms to define bU.) 6.2 Motivation for the definition of the natural logarithm as an integral The logarithm is an example of a mathematical concept that can be defined in many different ways. When a mathematician tries to formulate a definition of a concept, such as the logarithm, he usually has in mind a number of properties he wants this concept to have. By examining these properties, he is often led to a simple formula or process that might serve as a definition from which all the desired properties spring forth as logical deductions. We shall illustrate how this procedure may be used to arrive at the definition of the logarithm which is given in the next section. One of the properties we want logarithms to have is that the logarithm of a product should be the sum of the logarithms of the individual factors. Let us consider this property by itself and see where it leads us. If we think of the logarithm as a function f, then we want this function to have the property expressedby the formula) (6.4)) f(xy) = f(x) + fey)) whenever x, y, and xy are in the domain off An equation like (6.4), which expresses a relationship between the values of a function at two or more points, is called a functional equation. Many mathematical problems can be reducedto solving a functional equation, a solution being any function which satisfies the equation. Ordinarily an equation of this sort has many different solutions, and it is usually very difficult to find them all. It is easier to seek only those solutions which have some additional property such as continuity or differentiability. For the most part, these are the only solutions we are interested in anyway. We shall adopt this point of view and determine all differentiablesolutions of (6.4). But first let us try to deduce what information we can from (6.4) alone, without any further restrictions on f One solution of (6.4) is the function that is zero everywhere on the real axis. In fact, this is the only solution of (6.4)that is defined for all real numbers. To prove this, let f be any function that satisfies (6.4). If 0 is in the domain of f, then we may put y = 0 in (6.4) to obtainf(O) = f(x) + f(O), and this implies thatf(x) = 0 for every x in the domain off In other words, if 0 is in the domain off, then f must be identically zero. Therefore, a solution of (6.4) that is not identically zero cannot be defined at O.))) 228 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) If f is a solution of (6.4) and if the domain off includes 1, we may put x = Y = 1 in (6.4) to obtainf(l) = 2f(I), and this implies) f(l) = 0 .) If both 1 and -1 are in the domain of f, we may take x = -1 and y = -1 to deduce thatf(l) = 2f(-I); hencef(-I)= O. If now x, -x, 1, and -1 are in the domain off, we may put y = -1 in (6.4) to deduce f( -x) = f( -1) + f(x) and, since f( -1) = 0, we find) f( -x) = f(x) .) In other words, any solution of (6.4) is necessarily an even function. Suppose, now, we assume thatfhas a derivative f'(x) at each x \\037 O. If we hold y fixed in (6.4) and differentiate with respect to x (using the chain rule on the left), we find) yf'(xy) = f'(x) .) When x = 1, this gives us yf'(y) = f'(I), and hence we have) f' (y) = 1'(1) y) for each) y \\037 O.) From this equation we see that the derivative f' is monotonic and hence integrable on every closed interval not containing the origin. Also,f' is continuous on every such interval, and we may apply the second fundamental theorem of calculus to write) I x I Xl f(x) - f(c) = c f'(t) dt = 1'(1) c t dt .) If x > 0, this equation holds for any positive c, and if x < 0, it holds for any negative c. Since f( 1) = 0, the choice c = 1 gives us) (x 1 f(x) = 1'(1) Jl t dt) if) x > O.) If x is negative then -x is positive and, sincef(x) = f( -x), we find) (-x 1 f(x) = f'(1) J 1 t dt) if) x < o.) These two formulas for f(x) may be combined into one formula that is valid for both positive and negative x, namely,) (6.5)) (Ixllf(x) = f'(1)J1 t dt) if x \\037 0 .) Therefore we have shown that if there is a solution of (6.4)which has a derivative at each))) The definition of the logarithm. Basic properties) 229) point x \\037 0, then this solution must necessarilybe given by the integral formula in (6.5). If f'(I) = 0, then (6.5) implies that f(x) = 0 for all x \\037 0, and this solution agrees with the solution that is identically zero. Therefore, if f is not identically zero, we must have f'(I) \\037 0, in which case we can divide both sides of (6.5) by f'(I) to obtain) (6.6)) f lXI! g(x) = - dt 1 t) if x \\037 0 ,) where g(x) = f(x)/f'(I). The function g is also a solution of (6.4),sincecf is a solution whenever f is. This proves that if (6.4) has a solution that is not identically zero and if this solution has a derivative everywhere except at the origin, then the function g given by (6.6) is also a solution, and all solutions may be obtained from this one by multiplying g by a suitable constant. It should be emphasized that this argument does not prove that the function g in (6.6) actually is a solution, becausewe derived (6.6) on the assumption that there is at least one solution that is not identically zero. Formula (6.6) suggestsa way to construct such a solution. We simply operate in reverse. That is, we use the integral in (6.6) to define a function g, and then we verify directly that this function actually satisfies (6.4). This suggests that we should define the logarithm to be the function g given by (6.6). If we did so, this function would have the property that g( -x) = g(x) or, in other words, distinct numbers would have the same logarithm. For some of the things we want to do later, it is preferable to define the logarithm in such a way that no two distinct numbers have the same logarithm. This latter property may be achieved by defining the logarithm only for positive numbers. Therefore we use the following definition.) 6.3 The definition of the logarithm. Basic properties) DEFINITION. If x is a positivereal number, lre define the natural logarithm of x, denoted temporarily b)J L(x), to be the integral) (6.7)) f x 1 L(x) = 1 t dt .) When x > 1, L(x) may be interpreted geometrically as the area of the shaded region shown in Figure 6.1.) THEOREM 6.1. The logarithm function has the following properties: (a) L(I) = O. , 1 (b) L (x) = - for every x > O. x) (c) L(ab) = L(a) + L(b)) for every a > 0, b > O.) Proof Part (a) follows at once from the definition. To prove (b), we simply note that L is an indefinite integral of a continuous function and apply the first fundamental theorem))) 230 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) of calculus. Property (c) follows from the additive property of the integral. We write) l ab dt l a dt J ab dt J ab dt L(ab) = - = - + - = L(a) + - . 1 tIt a tat) In the last integral we make the substitution u = tja, du = dtja, and we find that the integrG\\\\.1 reduces to L(b), thus proving (c).) y) y) x) x) o) x) FIGURE 6.1 Interpretation of the log- arithm as an area.) FIGURE 6.2 The graph of the natural log- arithm.) 6.4 The graph of the natural logarithm The graph of the logarithm function has the general shape shown in Figure 6.2. Many properties of this curve can be discovered without undue calculation simply by referring to the properties in Theorem 6.1. For example, from (b) we see that L has a positive derivative everywhere so it is strictly increasing on every interval. Since L(I) = 0, the graph lies above the x-axis if x > 1 and below the axis if 0 < x < 1. The curve has slope 1 when x = 1. For x > 1, the slope gradually decreases toward zero as x increases indefinitely. For small values of x, the slope is large and, moreover, it increases without bound as x decreasestoward zero. The second derivative is L\\\"(x) = -ljx 2 which is negative for all x, so L is a concave function.) 6.5 Consequences of the functional equation L(ah) = L(a) + L(h) Sincethe graph of the logarithm tends to level off as x increases indefinitely, it might be suspected that the values of L have an upper bound. Actually, the function is unbounded above; that is, for every positive number M (no matter how large) there exist values of x such that) (6.8)) L(x) > M .))) Consequences of the functional equation L(ab) = L(a) + L(b)) 231) We can deduce this from the functional equation. When a = b, we get L(a 2 ) = 2L(a). Using the functional equation once more with b = a 2 , we obtain L(a 3 ) = 3L(a). By induction we find the general formula) L(a n ) = nL(a)) for every integer n > 1. When a = 2, this becomes L(2 n) = nL(2), and hence we have) (6.9)) L(2 n) > M) M when n > - . L(2)) This proves the assertion in (6.8). Taking b = l/a in the functional equation, we find L(I/a) = -L(a). In particular, when a = 2 n , where n is chosen as in (6.9), we have) L( ;J = -L(2n ) < -M ,) which shows that there is also no lower bound to the function values. Finally we observe that the graph crosses every horizontal line exactly once. That is, given an arbitrary real number b (positive, negative, or zero), there is one and only one a > 0 such that) (6.10)) L(a) = b .) To prove this we can argue as follows: If b > 0, choose any integer n > b/ L(2). Then L(2 n ) > b because of (6.9). Now examine the function L on the closed interval [1, 2 n ]. Its value at the left endpoint is L(I) = 0, and its value at the right endpoint is L(2 n ). Since 0 < b < L(2 n ), the intermediate-value theorem for continuous functions (Theorem 3.8 in Section 3.10) guarantees the existence of at least one a such that L(a) = b. There cannot be another value a' such that L(a') = b because this would mean L(a) = L(a') for a \\302\\245=a', thus contradicting the increasing property of the logarithm. Therefore the assertion in (6.10) has been proved for b > O. The proof for negative b follows from this if we use the equation L(l/a) = -L(a). In other words, we have proved the following.) THEOREM 6.2. For every real number b there is exactly one positivereal number a a'hose logarithm, L(a), is equal to b.) In particular, there is exactly one number whose natural logarithm is equal to 1. This number, like 'TT, occurs repeatedly in so many mathematical formulas that it was inevitable that a special symbol would be adopted for it. Leonard Euler (1707-1783)seems to have been the first to recognize the importance of this number, and he modestly denoted it bye, a notation which soon became standard.) DEFINITION. We denote by e that number for \\037vhich) ( 6. 11) L(e) = 1 .))) 232 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) In Chapter 7 we shall obtain explicit formulas that enable us to calculate the decimal expansion of e to any desired degree of accuracy. Its value, correct to ten decimal places, is 2.7182818285.In Chapter 7 we also prove that e is irrational. Natural logarithms are also called Napierian logarithlns, in honor of their inventor, John Napier (1550-1617). It is common practice to use the symbols In x or log x instead of L(x) to denote the logarithm of x.) 6.6 Logarithms referred to any positive base h \\302\\245=1 The work of Section 6.2 tells us that the most general f which is differentiable on the positive real axis and which satisfies the functional equation f(xy) = f(x) + fey) is given by the formula) ( 6.12)) f(x) = c log x ,) where c is a constant. For each c, we could call this f(x) the logarithm of x associated with c although, of course, its value would not be necessarily the same as the natural logarithm of x. When c = 0,f is identically zero, so this case is uninteresting. If c \\302\\245=0, we may indicate in another way the dependence of f on c by introducing the concept of a base for logarithms. From (6.12) we see that when c \\302\\245=0, there exists a unique real number b > 0 such that i(b) = 1. This b is related to c by the equation clog b = 1; hence b \\302\\245=1, c = l/log b, and (6.12) becomes) f(x) = log x . log b) For this choice of c we say that f(x) is the logarithm of x to the base b and we write 10g b x for f(x).) DEFINITION. If b > 0, b \\302\\245=1, and if x > 0, the logarithm of x to the base b is the number) log x 10g b X = , log b) where the logarithms on the right are natural logarithms.) Note that 10g b b = 1. Also, when b = e, we have logex = log x, so natural logarithms are those with base e. Since logarithms to base e are usedso frequently in mathematics, the word logarithm almost invariably means natural logarithm. Later, in Section 6.15, we shall define b U in such a way that the equation b U = x will mean exactly the same as the equation u = 10g b x. Since logarithms to the base b are obtained from natural logarithms by multiplying by the constant 1/log b, the graph of the equation y = 10gb x may be obtained from that of the equation y = log x by simply multiplying all ordinates by the same factor. When b > 1, this factor is positive, and, when b < 1, it is negative. Examples with b > 1 are))) Differentiation and integration formulas involving logarithms) 233) y) y) x) x) l<b<e) o<b<l e) 1 < b < 1 e) (a) b > 1) (b) 0 < b < 1) FIGURE 6.3 The graph of y = 10gb x for various values of b.) shown in Figure 6.3(a). When b < 1, we note that lib> 1 and log b = -log (lib),so the graph of y = 10gb x may be obtained from that of y = logl/b X by reflection through the x-axis. Examplesare shown in Figure 6.3(b).) 6.7 Differentiation and integration formulas involving logarithms Since the derivative of the logarithm is given by the formula D log x = 11x for x > 0, we have the integration formula) J \\037 dx = log x + c .) More generally, if u = I(x), whereI has a continuous derivative, we have) ( 6.13)) J du --;; = log u + c) or) J f'(x) dx = logf(x) + C . f(x)) Somecare must be exercised when using (6.13) because the logarithm is not defined for negative numbers. Therefore, the integration formulas in (6.13) are valid only if u, or I(x), is positive. Fortunately it is easy to extend the range of validity of these formulas to accommodate functions that are negative or positive (but nonzero). We simply introduce a new function Lo defined for all real x \\037 0 by the equation) (6.14)) f lXI! Lo(x) = log Ixl = - dt , 1 t) a definition suggested by Equation (6.6) of Section6.2. The graph of Lo is symmetric about the y-axis, as shown in Figure 6.4. The portion to the right of the y-axis is exactly the same as the logarithmic curve of Figure 6.2.))) 234 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) Since log Ixyl = log (Ixllyl) = log Ixl + log Iyl, the function Lo also satisfies the basic functional equation in (6.4). That is, we have) Lo(xy) = Lo(x) + Lo(Y)) for all real x and y except O. For x > 0, we have L\\037(x) = 11x since Lo(x)is the same as log x for positive x. This derivative formula also holds for x < 0 because,in this case, Lo(x) = L(-x), and hence L\\037(x) = -L'(-x) = -1/(-x) = llx. Therefore we have) (6.15)) I 1 Lo(x) = - x) for all real x \\037 0 .) y) /Y = Lo(x) = loglxl) x) FIGURE 6.4 The graph of the function Lo.) Hence, if we use Lo instead of L in the foregoing integration formulas, we can extend their scope to include functions which assume negative values as well as positive values. For example, (6.13) can be generalizedas follows:) ( 6.16)) J dU -;; = log lul + c ,) J f'(X) dx = log If(x)1+ c . f(x)) Of course, when we use (6.16) along with the second fundamental theorem of calculus to evaluate a definite integral, we must avoid intervals that include points where u or f(x) might be zero.) EXAMPLE 1. Integrate S tan x dx.) Solution. The integral has the form - S dulu, where u = cos x, du = -sin x dx. There- fore we have) Jtanxdx = - J \\037u = -loglul + C = -loglcosxl + c,) a formula which is valid on any interval in which cos x \\037 O.)))

Then du = dx/x, v = x, and we obtain) I log x dx = I u dv = uv - I v du = x log x - I x \\037 dx = x log x - x + c \\302\\267) EXAMPLE 3. Integrate S sin (log x) dx.) Solution. Let u = sin (log x), v = x. Then du = cos (log x)(I/x) dx, and we find) f sin (log x) dx = f u dv = uv - f v du = x sin (log x) - f cos(log x) dx .) In the last integral we use integration by parts once more to get) f cos (log x) dx = x cos(logx) + f sin (log x) dx \\302\\267) Combining this with the foregoing equation, we find that) f sin (log x) dx = 1xsin (log x) - 1x cos(logx) + c ,) and) f cos (log x) dx = 1xsin (log x) + 1x cos (log x) + c .) 6.8 Logarithmic differentiation We shall describe now a technique known as logarithmic differentiation which is often a great help in computing derivatives. The method was developed in 1697 by Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748), and all it amounts to is a simple application of the chain rule. Suppose we form the composition of Lo with any differentiable function f; say we let) g(x) = Lo[f(x)] = log If(x) I) for those x such that f(x) \\037 O. The chain rule, used in conjunction with (6.15), yields the formula) (6.17)) g'(x) = L\\037[f(x)] \\302\\267 f'(x) --'\\037\\037\\037; .) If the derivative g'(x) can be found in some other way, then we may use (6.17) to obtain f'(x) by simply multiplying g'(x) by f(x). The process is useful in practice because in many cases g'(x) is easierto compute thanf'(x) itself. In particular, this is true whenfis a product or quotient of several simpler functions. The following exampleis typical.))) 236 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) EXAMPLE. Compute f'ex) if f(x) = x2 cas x (1 + X 4 )-7.) Solution. We take the logarithm of the absolute value of f(x) and then we differentiate. Let) g(x) = log If(x)I = log x 2 + log leas xl + log (1 + X 4 )-7 = 2 log Ixl + log leas xl -7 log (1 + x 4 ).)

Compute[(a).) 6.10 Polynomial approximations to the logarithm In this section we will show that the logarithm function can be approximated by certain polynomials which can be used to compute logarithms to any desired degree of accuracy. To simplify the resulting formulas, we first replace x by 1 - x in the integral defining the logarithm to obtain) J I-X dt Jog (1 - x) = - , 1 t) which is valid if x < 1. The change of variable t = 1 - u converts this to the form) i x du -log (1 - x) = , o 1 - u) valid for x < 1.) Now we approximate the integrand 1/(1 - u) by polynomials which we then integrate to obtain corresponding approximations for the logarithm. To illustrate the method, we begin with a simple linear approximation to the integrand. From the algebraic identity 1 - u 2 = (1 - u)(1 + u), we obtain the formula) (6.18)) 1 u 2 =l+u+ , l-u l-u) valid for any real u \\037 1. Integrating this from 0 to x, where x < 1, we have) ( 6.19)) x 2 i x U2 -Jog (1 - x) = x + - + du . 2 ol-u) The graph of the quadratic polynomial P(x) = x + lx 2 which appears on the right of (6.19) is shown in Figure 6.5 along with the curve y = -log (1- x). Note that for x near zero the polynomial P(x) is a good approximation to -log (1 - x). In the next theorem we use a polynomial of degree n - 1 to approximate 1/(1- u), and thereby obtain a polynomial of degree n which approximates log (1 - x).)))

Integrating this from 0 to x, where x < 1, we obtain (6.20). We can rewrite (6.20) in the form) (6.21)) -log (1 - x) = Pn(x) + En(x),) where En(x) is the integral,) f x un En(x) = du . o 1 - u))) 240 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) The quantity En(x) represents the error made when we approximate -log (1 - x) by the polynomial Pn(x). To use (6.21) in computations, we need to know whether the error is positive or negative and how large it can be. The next theorem tells us that for small positive x the error En(x) is positive, but for negative x the erfor has the same sign as ( -1 )n+l, where n is the degree of the approximating polynomial. The theorem also gives useful upper and lower bounds fOf the error.)

In the integral defining En(x) we have 0 < u < x, so 1 - x < 1- u < 1, and hence the integrand satisfiesthe inequalities) un un un < < -l-u-l-x) Integrating these inequalities, we obtain (6.22). To prove (6.23), assume x < 0 and let t = -x = Ixl. Then t > 0 and we have) i - t n i t ( )n i t n En(x) = En(-t) = u du = _ -v dv = (_l)n+l v dv. ol-u ol+v ol+v) This shows that En(x) has the same sign as (_I)n+l.

The next theorem gives a formula which is admirably suited for computations of loga- rithms.)

If we replace x by -x in (6.21), keeping x > -1, we obtain the formula) (6.25)) -log (1 + x) = Pn( -x) + En( -x).) If -1 < x < 1,both (6.21) and (6.25) are valid. Subtracting (6.25)from (6.21), we find) ( 6.26)) I + x log = Pn(x) - P n( -x) + En(x) - En( -x) . I-x) In the difference Pn(x) - Pn( -x), the even powers of x canceland the odd powers double up. Therefore, if n is even, say n = 2m, we have) ( X3 X 2m- 1 ) P 2m (x) - P2m(-x) = 2 x + - + ... + , 3 2m - 1) and Equation (6.26) becomes) 1 + x ( X3 x2m-l ) log = 2 x + - + . .. + + R (x) I - x 3 2m - 1 m . ,) where Rm(x) = E2m(x) - E2m ( - x). This formula is valid if x lies in the open interval -1 < x < 1. Now we restrictxto the interval 0 < x < 1. Then the estimates of Theorem 6.4 give us) X2m+l 1 x2m+l < E (x) < 2m + 1 - 2m - 1 - x 2m + 1) and) X2m+l o < - E 2m ( - x) < . 2m + 1) Adding these, we obtain the inequalities in (6.24), since 1 + 1/(1 - x) = (2 - x)/(1 - x).) EXAMPLE. Taking m = 2 and x = 1, we have (1 + x)/(1 - x) = 2, and we obtain the formula) log 2 = 2(1- + -iy) + R 2 (1),) where) 1_ ( 1 ) 5 < R (1) < 1(1) 5 - _1_ 5 3 2 3 _ 2 3 - 486 .)

Tabulate each entry with as many correct decimal places as you can be certain of from the inequalities in Exercises 1 through 4.) 6.12 The exponential function Theorem 6.2 shows that for every real x there is one and only one y such that L(y) = x. Therefore we can use the process of inversion to define y as a function of x. The resulting inverse function is called the exponential function, or the antilogarithm, and is denoted by E.) DEFINITION. For any real x, we define E(x) to be that number y whose logarithm is x. That is, y = E(x) means that L(y) = x .) The domain of E is the entire real axis; its range is the set of positivereal numbers.The graph of E, which is shown in Figure 6.6, is obtained from the graph of the logarithm by) y) /y = E(x)) ----- .\\\",,----- ,,-' \\\" \\\", \\\", / / (1,0) I I I ,) ---- 'y = L(x)) x) FIGURE 6.6 The graph of the exponential function is obtained from that of the logarithm by reflection through the line y = x.)))

Each property of the logarithm can be translated into a property of the exponential. For example,sincethe logarithm is strictly incre.asing and continuous on the positive real axis, it follows from Theorem 3.10that the exponential is strictly increasing and continuous on the entire real axis. The counterpart of Theorem 6.1 is given by the following theorem.) THEOREM 6.6. The exponential function has the follo\\302\\273'ing properties: (a) E(O) = 1, E(I) = e. (b) E'(x) = E(x) for every x. (c) E(a + b) = E(a)E(b) for all a and b.) Proof Part (a) follows from the equations L(I) = 0 and L(e) = 1. Next we prove (c), the functional equation for the exponential. Assume that a and b are given and let) x = E(a) ,) y = E(b),) c = L(xy) .) Then we have) L(x) = a ,) L(y) = b,) E(c) = xy .) But c = L(xy) = L(x) + L(y) = a + b. That is, c = a + b. Hence, E(c) = E(a + b). On the other hand, E(c) = xy = E(a)E(b), so E(a + b) = E(a)E(b),which proves (c). Now we use the functional equation to help us prove (b). The differencequotient for the derivative E'(x) is) E(x + h) - E(x)= E(x)E(h) - E(x) = E(x) E(h) - 1. h h h) Therefore, to prove (b) we must show that) ( 6.27)) lim E(h) - 1 = 1. h\\037O h) We shall express the quotient in (6.27) in terms of the logarithm. Let k = E(h) - 1. Then k + 1 = E(h) so L(k + 1)= h and the quotient is equal to) ( 6.28)) E(h) - 1 h) k - L(k + 1)) Now as h -+ 0, E(h) -+ 1 becausethe exponential function IS continuous at 1. Since k = E(h) - 1,we have k -+ 0 as h -+ O. But) L(k + 1) = L(k + 1) - L(l) -+ L'(l) = 1 k k) as k -+ 0 .) In view of (6.28), this proves (6.27) which, in turn, proves (b).))) 244 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric .functions) 6.13 Exponentials expressedas powers of e The functional equation E(a + b) = E(a)E(b) has many interesting consequences. For example,we can use it to prove that) ( 6.29)) E(r) = e r) for every rational number r. First we take b = -a in the functional equation to get) E(a)E( -a) = E(O) = 1 ,) and hence E( -a) = I/E(a) for every real a. Taking b = a, b = 2a,. . ., b = na in the functional equation we obtain, successively, E(2a) = E(a)2,E(3a)= E(a)3, and, in general, we have) (6.30)) E(na) = E(a)n) for every positive integer n. In particular, when a = 1, we obtain) E(n) = en ,) whereas for a = l/n, we obtain E(l) = E(I/n)n.Since E(I/n) > 0, this implies) (6.31)) E( \\037) = e1/ n .) Therefore, if we put a = l/m in (6.30) and use (6.31), we find) E( \\037) = E( \\037r= e n / m) for all positive integers m and n. In other words,we have proved (6.29) for every positive rational number r. Since E( -r) = I/E(r) = e- r , it also holds for all negativerational r.) 6.14 The definition of eX for arbitrary real x In the foregoing section we proved that eX = E(x) when x is any rational number. Now we shall define eX for irrational x by writing) ( 6.32)) eX = E(x)) for every real x .) One justification for this definition is that we can use it to prove that the law of exponents) (6.33)) e ae b = e a + b) is valid for all real exponents a and b. When we use the definition in (6.32), the proof of (6.33)is a triviality because (6.33) is nothing but a restatement of the functional equation.))) Differentiation and integration formulas involving exponentials) 245) The notation eX for E(x) is the one that is commonly used for the exponential. Occasion- ally exp(x) is written instead of eX, especially when complicated formulas appear in the exponent. We shall continue to useE(x)from time to time in this chapter, but later we shall switch to eX. We have defined the exponential function so that the two equations) y = eX) and) x = logy) mean exactly the same thing. In the next section we shall define more general powers so that the two equations y = aX and x = loga Y will be equivalent.) 6.15 The definition of aX for a > 0 and x real Now that we have defined eX for arbitrary real x, there is absolutely no difficulty in formulating a definition of aX for every a > O. One way to proceed is to let aX denote that number y such that loga Y = x. But this does not work for a = 1,since logarithms to the base 1 have not been defined. Another way is to define aX by the formula) (6.34)) aX = eX log a .) The second method is preferable because, first of all, it is meaningful for all positive a (including a = 1) and, secondly, it makes it easy to prove the following properties of exponentials:) log aX = x log a .) (ab)X = aXb X .) aXa Y = a X+ Y .) (aX)Y = (aY)X = a XY .) If a :rf 1, then y = aX if and only if x = loga y.) The proofs of these properties are left as exercises for the reader. Just as the graph of the exponential function was obtained from that of the logarithm by reflection through the line y = x, so the graph of y = aX can be obtained from that of y = loga x by reflection through the same line; examplesare shown in Figure 6.7. The curves in Figures 6.7 were obtained by reflection of those in Figures 6.3. The graph corresponding to a = 1 is, of course,the horizontal line y = 1.) 6.16 Differentiation and integration formulas involving exponentials One of the most remarkable properties of the exponential function is the formula) (6.35)) E'(x) = E(x),) which tells us that this function is its own derivative. If we use this along with the chain rule, we can obtain differentiation formulas for exponential functions with any positive base a. Suppose f(x) = aX for x > O. By the definition of aX, we may write) I(x) = eX loga = E(x log a) ;))) 246 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) hence, by the chain rule, we find) (6.36)) f'(x) = E'(x log a) \\302\\267 log a = E(x log a) \\302\\267 log a = aX log a .) In other words, differentiation of aX simply multiplies aX by the constant factor log a, this factor being 1 when a = e.) y) y) l<a<e) 1 < a < 1 e) x) o) x) o) (a) a > 1) (b) 0 < a < 1) FIGURE 6.7 The graph of y = aX for various values of a.) Of course,these differentiation formulas automatically lead to corresponding integration formulas. For example,(6.35)yields the result) (6.37)) J eX dx = eX + C ,) whereas (6.36) gives us the more general formula) ( 6.38)) J aX aX dx = - + c log a) (a > 0, a =fi 1) .) These may be generalized further by the method of substitution. We simply replace x everywhere in (6.37) and (6.38) by u to obtain) (6.39)) J e U du = e U + C ,) J aU aU du = - + c log a) (a > 0, a =fi 1) ,))) Differentiation and integration formulas involving exponentials) 247) where u now represents any function with a continuous derivative. If we write u = f(x), and du = f'(x) dx, the formulas in (6.39) become) f ef(x\\\"j'(x) dx = tI(x) + c ,) f f(x) af(x>.!,(x) dx = a + c , log a) the second of these being valid for a > 0, a =fi 1. EXAMPLE 1. Integrate Sx 2 e x3 dx.) Solution. Let u = x 3. Then du = 3x 2 dx, and we obtain) J x 2e x3 dx = 1 J e X3 (3x 2 dx) = 1 J e U du = leu + c = te X3 + C .) f 2Y; EXAMPLE 2.

Then du = 2 cos x dx, and hence we obtain) J CDS X e2 sin x dx = t J e 2 sin X(2 CDS X dx) = t J e U du = teu + c = te 2 sin x + c .) EXAMPLE 4. Integrate S eX sin x dx.) Solution. Let u = eX, dv = sin x dx. Then du = eX dx, v = -cos x, and we find) (6.40) J eX sin x dx = J u dv = uv - J v du = _ex CDSx + J eX CDS x dx + C . The integral S eX cos x dx is treated in the same way. We let u = eX, dv = cos x dx, du = eX dx, v = sin x, and we obtain) (6.41)) J eX CDS x dx = eX sin x - J eX sin x dx + C .) Substituting this in (6.40), we may solve for S eX sin x dx and consolidate the arbitrary constants to obtain) f eX sin x dx = \\037 (sin x - CDS x) + C .) Notice that we can use this in (6.41) to obtain also) f eX eX CDS x dx = \\\"2 (CDS X + sin x) + C .))) 248 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) f dx EXAMPLE 5. Integrate . 1 + eX) Solution. One way to treat this example is to rewrite the integrand as follows:) 1 e- x) 1 + eX e- x + 1) Now put u = e- X + 1.

For instance,) 1 eX -log (1 + e- X) = log = log 1 + e-x eX + 1) = log (eX) - log (eX + 1) = x - log(1+ eX) .) Another way to treat this same example is to write) - 1- - 1+ eX 1 + eX) 1) eX) Then we have) f dx f eX f du 1 + eX = x-I + eX dx = x - --;; ,) where u = 1 + eX. Thus we find) f dx = x - log(1+ eX) + C., 1 + eX) which is one of the forms obtained above.) 6.17 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 12, find the derivative.f'(x).

The prefix \\\"hyperbolic\\\" is due to the fact that these functions are related geometrically to a hyperbola in much the same way as the trigonometric functions are related to a circle. This relation will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 14 when we study the hyperbola. The graphs of the sinh, cosh, and tanh are shown in Figure 6.8. The hyperbolic functions possess many properties that resemble those of the trigonometric functions.

In the next section, we shall invert the trigonometric functions. It is convenient at this point to discuss a generaltheorem which shows that the process of inversion transmits differentiability from a function to its inverse.) THEOREM 6.7. Assume f is strictly increasing and continuous on an interval [a, b], and let g be the inverse off If the derivative f'(x) exists and is nonzero at a point x in (a, b), then the derivative g'(y) also existsand is nonzero at the corresponding point y, where y = f(x). Moreover, the two derivatives are reciprocals of each other,. that is, we have) ( 6.42)) g'(y) = f';X) \\302\\267) Note: Ifwe use the Leibniz notation and write y for f(x), dyfdx forf'(x), x for g(y), and dxfdy for g'(y), then Equation (6.42)becomes) dx 1 dy = ( : ) ,) which has the appearance of a trivial algebraic identity.) Proof Assume x is a point in (a, b) where f'(x) exists and is nonzero, and let y = f(x). We shall show that the difference quotient) g(y + k) - g(y) k) approaches the limit Iff' (x) as k \\037 O. Let h = g(y + k) - g(y). Since x = g(y), this implies h = g(y + k) - x or x + h = g(y + k). Therefore y + k = f(x + h), and hence k = I(x + h) - I(x). Note that))) Inverses of the trigonometric functions) 253) h :;1= 0 if k :;1= 0 because g is strictly increasing. Therefore, if k :;1= 0, the difference quotient in question is) ( 6.43)) g(y + k) - g(y) k) h - - f(x + h) - f(x)) 1 [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h) As k -+ 0, the difference g(y + k) - g(y) -+ 0 because of the continuity of g at y [property (b) of Theorem 3.10]. This means that h -+ 0 as k -+ O. But we know that the difference quotient in the denominator on the extreme right of (6.43) approaches f'ex) as h -+ 0 [since f'ex) exists]. Therefore, when k -+ 0, the quotient on the extreme left of (6.43) approaches the limit 111 '(x). This proves Theorem 6.7.) 6.21 Inverses of the trigonometric functions The process of inversion may be applied to the trigonometric functions. Suppose we begin with the sine function. To determine a unique inverse, we must consider the sine over some interval where it is monotonic. There are, of course, many such intervals, for) y) y) I 71\\\", --I2: I) x) x) 2) 2) FIGURE 6.9 Y = SIn x.) FIGURE 6.10 Y = arCSIn x.) example [-i1T, i1T], [!1T, .\\0371T], [-!1T, -!1T], etc., and it really does not matter which one of these we choose. It is customary to select [ - !1T,i1T] and define a new function f as follows:) f(x) = sin x) if _ 'TT < X < 'TT . 2 - - 2) The function f so defined is strictly increasing and it assumes every value between -1 and + 1 exactly once on the interval [-i1T, i1T].(SeeFigure 6.9.) Hence there is a uniquely determined function g defined on [-1, 1] which assigns to each number y in [-1, 1] that number x in [- i1T, i1T] for which y = sin x. This function g is called the inverse sine or arc sine, and its value at y is denoted by arcsin y, or by sin- l y. Thus,) u = arCSIn v) means v = sIn u) and) 'TT 'TT --<u<-. 2 - - 2) The graph of the arc sine is shown in Figure 6.1 O. Note that the arc sine is not defined outside the interval [-1, 1].))) 254 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) The derivative of the arc sine can be obtained from formula (6.42) of Section 6.20. In this case we have f'ex) = cos x and this is nonzero in the open interval (-i1T, i1T). Therefore formula (6.42) yields) g' (y) = -L = 1 f'ex) cosX) 1 - V 1 - sin 2 x) 1 V 1 _ y2) if -1 < y < 1 . .) With a change in notation we can write this result as follows:) (6.44)) D . 1 arCSIn x = V 1 - x2) if -1 < x < 1 .) Of course, this now gives us a new integration formula,) (6.45)) i x 1 vi dt = arcsin x , o 1 - t 2) which is valid for -1 < x < 1.) Note: This formula may be used as the starting point for a completely analytic theory of the trigonometric functions, without any reference to geometry. Briefly, the idea is to begin with the arc sine function, defining it by the integral in (6.45), just as we defined the logarithm as an integral. Next, the sine function is defined as the inverse of the arc sine, and the cosine as the derivative of the sine. Many details are required to carry out this program completely and we shall not attempt to describe them here. An alternative method for introducing the trigonometric functions analytically will be mentioned in Chapter 11. In the Leibniz notation for indefinite integrals we may write formula (6.45) in the form) ( 6.46)) f dx . C V = arcsIn x + \\302\\267 1 - x 2) Integration by parts yields the following further integration formula:) f arcsin x dx = x arcsin x - f vi ; \\037 x 2 = x arcsin x + vi 1 - x 2 + C \\302\\267) The cosine and tangent are inverted in a similar fashion. For the cosine it is customary to choose the interval [0, 1T] in which to perform the inversion. (SeeFigure 6.11.) The resulting inverse function, called the arc cosine, is defined as follows:) u = arccos v) means) v = cos u) and) O < U < 1T.) The graph of the arc cosine function is shown in Figure 6.12.)))

The argument used to derive (6.44)can also be applied to the arc cosine and arc tangent functions, and it yields the following differentiation formulas:) ( 6.47)) -1 D arccos x = vi ' 1 - x 2) valid for -1 < x < 1,and) ( 6.48)) 1 D arctan x = 2 ' 1 + x) valid for all real x.) y) y) 2) 7r) 2) x) x) 7r) 7r) 2) 7r) 2) FIGURE 6.13 Y = tan x.)

By comparing (6.49) with (6.45), we deduce the relation i1T - arccos x = arcsin x. (This may also be deduced from the familiar identity sin (!1T - y) = cos Y if we write y = arccos x.) In the Leibniz notation for indefinite integrals, we may write (6.49) as follows:) (6.50)) J dx V = - arccos x + c \\302\\267 1 - x 2) Similarly, from (6.48) we obtain) (6.51)) l x dt 2 = arctan x o 1 + t') or) J dx 2 = arctan x + c . 1+ x) Using integration by parts in conjunction with (6.50) and (6.51), we can derive the following further integration formulas:) J arccosx dx= x arccos x + J V ; \\037 x 2 = x arccos x - V 1- x 2 + C , J arctan x dx = x arctan x - J x dx 2 = x arctan x - t log (1 + x 2 ) + C . l+x) The inverses of the cotangent, secant, and cosecantcan be defined by means of the following formulas:) (6.52) 1T for all real x ,arccot x = - - arctan x 2 (6.53) 1 when Ixl > 1 ,arcsec x = arccos- x (6.54) 1 when Ixl > 1 .arccsc x = arcsIn- x) Differentiation and integration formulas for these functions are listed in the following exerCIses.) 6.22 Exercises) Derivethe differentiation formulas in Exercises 1 through 5. -1 1.

Differenti- ation of a rational function leads to a new rational function which may be obtained by the quotient rule for derivatives. On the other hand, integration of a rational function may lead to functions that are not rational. For exampJe, we have) J dX -; = log Ixl + c) and) J dx 2 = arctan x + c . 1 + x) We shall describe a method for computing the integral of any rational function, and we shall find that the result can always be expressed in terms of polynomials, rational functions, inversetangents, and logarithms. The basic idea of the method is to decompose a given rational function into a sum of simpler fractions (called partial fractions) that can be integrated by the techniques discussed earlier. We shall describe the general procedure by means of a number of simpleexamples that illustrate all the essential features of the method.) EXAMPLE 1. In this example we begin with two simple fractions, I/(x - 1)and I/(x + 3), which we know how to integrate, and see what happens when we form a linear combination of these fractions. For example, if we take twice the first fraction plus three times the second, we obtain) 2 + 3 x-I x+3) 2(x+ 3) + 3(x - 1) _ 5x+ 3 (x - 1)(x + 3) - x 2 + 2x - 3 .))) Integration by partial fractions) 259) If, now, we read this formula from right to left, it tells us that the rational function r given by rex) = (5x + 3)/(x 2 + 2x - 3) has been expressedas a linear combination of I/(x - 1) and 1 I (x + 3). Therefore, we may evaluate the integral of r by writing) f 5x + 3 f dx f dx 2 dx=2 +3 =2Ioglx-ll+3Ioglx+31+C. x + 2x - 3 x-I x + 3) EXAMPLE 2. The foregoing example suggests a procedure for dealing with integrals of the form S(ax+ b)/(x 2 + 2x - 3)dx. For example, to evaluate S(2x + 5)/(x2 + 2x - 3) dx, we try to express the integral as a linear combination of I/(x - 1)and I/(x + 3) by writing) (6.55)) 2x + 5 x 2 + 2x - 3) A + B x-I x+3) with constants A and B to be determined. If we can choose A and B so that Equation (6.55) is an identity, then the integral of the fraction on the left is equal to the sum of the integrals of the simpler fractions on the right. To find A and B, we multiply both sides of (6.55) by (x - 1)(x + 3) to remove the fractions. This gives us) (6.56)) A(x + 3) + B(x - I) = 2x + 5 .) At this stage there are two methods commonly used to find A and B. One method is to equate coefficients of like powers of x in (6.56). This leads to the equations A + B = 2 and 3A - B = 5. Solving this pair of simultaneous equations, we obtain A = t and B =!. The other method involves the substitution of two values of x in (6.56) and leads to another pair of equations for A and B. In this particular case, the presence of the factors x-I and x + 3 suggests that we use the values x = 1 and x = -3. When we put x = I in (6.56), the coefficient of B vanishes, and we find 4A = 7, or A = i. Similarly, we can make the coefficient of A vanish by putting x = -3. This gives us -4B = -1, or B = !. In any event, we have found values of A and B to satisfy (6.55), so we have) f 2x + 5 7 f dx 1f dx 7 1 2 dx = - + - = - log Ix - 11 + - log Ix + 31 + C . x + 2x - 3 4 x-I 4 x + 3 4 4) It is clear that the method described in Example 2 also applies to integrals of the form Sf(x)lg(x) dx in whichfis a linear polynomial and g is a quadratic polynomial that can be factored into distinct linear factors with real coefficients, say g(x) = (x - x 1)(x - x2 ). In this case the quotient f(x)lg(x) can be expressed as a linear combination of l/(x - Xl) and I/(x - x2 ), and integration of f(x)lg(x) leads to a corresponding combination of the logarithmic terms log Ix - xIIand log Ix - x2 1. The foregoing examples involve rational functions fig in which the degree of the numerator is less than that of the denominator. A rational function with this property is said to be a proper rational function. If fig is improper, that is, if the degree off is not less than that of g, then we can expressfig as the sum of a polynomial and a proper rational function. In fact, we simply divide f by g to obtain) lex) = Q(x) + R(x), g(x) g(x)))) 260 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) where Q and R are polynomials (called the quotient and remainder, respectively)such that the remainder has degree less than that of g. For example,) X3 + 3x = + 2 + lOx + 6 2 X 2 . X - 2x - 3 x - 2x - 3) Therefore, in the study of integration technique, there is no loss in generality if we restrict ourselvesto proper rational functions, and from now on we considerSf(x)fg(x)dx, where f has degree less than that of g. A general th,eorem in algebra states that every proper rational function can be expressed as a finite sum of fractions of the forms) A (x + a)k) and) Bx + C (X2 + bx + c)m ') where k and m are positive integers and A, B, C, a, b, c are constants with b 2 - 4c < O. The condition b 2 - 4c < 0 means that the quadratic polynomial x 2 + bx + c cannot be factored into linear factors with real coefficients or, what amounts to the same thing, the quadratic equation x 2 + bx + c = 0 has no real roots. Such a quadratic factor is said to be irreducible. When a rational function has been so expressed, we say that it has been decomposed into partial fractions. Therefore the problem of integrating this rational function reduces to that of integrating its partial fractions. These may be easily dealt with by the techniques describedin the examples which follow. We shall not bother to prove that partial-fraction decompositions always exist. Instead, we shall show (by means of examples) how to obtain the partial fractions in specific problems. In each case that arises the partial-fraction decomposition can be verified directly. It is convenient to separate the discussioninto cases depending on the way in which the denominator of the quotient f(x)fg(x) can be factored.) CASE 1. The denominator is a product of distinct linear factors. Suppose that g(x) splits into n distinct linear factors, say) g(x) = (x - xI)(x- x 2 ) . . . (x - xn ) .) Now notice that a linear combination of the form) Al An +...+x - Xl X - x n) may be expressed as a single fraction with the common denominator g(x), and the numerator of this fraction will be a polynomial of degree< n involving the A's. Therefore, if we can find A's to make this numerator equal to f(x), we shall have the decomposition) !(x) Al An-- +...+ g(x) - X - Xl X - X n '))) Integration by partial fractions) 261) and the integral off(x)/g(x) will be equal to Lf=I Ai log Ix - xii. In the next example, we work out a case with n = 3.) f 2X2 + 5x - 1 EXAMPLE 3. Integrate dx . x 3 + x 2 - 2x) Solution. Since x 3 + x 2 - 2x = x(x - 1)(x + 2), the denominator IS a product of distinct linear factors, and we try to find A l' A 2 , and A3 such that) 2X2 + 5x - 1 = Ai + A 2 + A3 x 3 + x 2 - 2x x x-I x + 2) Clearing the fractions, we obtain) 2X2 + 5x - 1 = AI(x - 1)(x + 2) + A 2x(x + 2) + A3X(X - 1).) When x = 0, we find -2A I = -1, so Al =\\037. When x = 1, we obtain 3A 2 = 6, A 2 = 2, and when x = -2, we find 6A 3 = -3, or A3 = -i. Therefore we have) f 2X2 + 5x - 1dx = 1f dx + 2 f dx - 1 f dx x 3 + x 2 - 2x 2 x x-I 2 x + 2) = \\037log Ixl + 2 log Ix - 11- ! log Ix + 21 + C .) CASE 2. The denominator is a product of linear factors, some of H,hich are repeated. We illustrate this case with an example.) f x2+2x+3 EXAMPLE 4. Integrate dx . (x - 1)(x+ 1)2) Solution. Here we try to find AI' A 2 , A3 so that) (6.57)) x 2 + 2x + 3 (x - l)(x+ 1)2) Al x-I) + A 2 + A3 x + 1 (x + 1)2) We need both A 2/(X + 1) and A 3/(X + 1)2 as well as A I/(X - 1) in order to get a polynomial of degree two in the numerator and to have as many constants as equations when we try to determine the A's. Clearing the fractions, we obtain) (6.58)) X2 + 2x + 3 = AI(x + 1)2 + A 2(x - 1)(x+ 1)+ A3(X - 1) .) Substituting x = 1, we find 4A I = 6, so Al =\\037. When x = -1, we obtain -2A 3 = 2 and A3 = -1. We need one more equation to determine A 2. Since there are no other choices of x that will make any factor vanish, we choose a convenient x that will help to simplify the calculations. For example, the choice x = 0 leads to the equation 3 = Al - A 2 - A3 from which we find A 2 = -l. An alternative method is to differentiate both))) 262 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) sides of (6.58) and then substitute a convenient x. Differentiation of (6.58) leads to the equation) 2x + 2 = 2A 1(x + 1) + A 2 (x - 1) + A 2 (x + 1) + A3 ,) and, if we put x = -1, we find 0 = - 2A 2 + A 3, so A 2 = lA3 = - t, as before. Therefore we have found A's to satisfy (6.57), so we have) f X2 + 2x + 3 dx - \\037 f dx _! f dx - f dx (x - l)(x + 1)2 2 x-I 2 x + 1 (x + 1)2 3 1 1 =-loglx-ll--10glx+ll+ +C. 2 2 x+l If, on the left of (6.57), the factor (x + 1)3 had appeared instead of (x + 1)2,we would have added an extra term A4/(X + 1)3 on the right. More generally, if a linear factor x + a appears p times in the denominator, then for this factor we must allow for a sum of p terms, namely) (6.59)) P Ak L ex + a)k ' k==l) where the A's are constants. A sum of this type is to be used for each repeated linear factor.) CASE 3. The denominator contains irreducible quadratic factors, none of lvhich are repeated. f 3X2 + 2x - 2 EXAMPLE 5. Integrate dx . x 3 - 1) Solution. The denominator can be split as the product x 3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x 2 + x + 1), where x 2 + x + 1 is irreducible, and we try a decomposition of the form) 3x 2 + 2x - 2 x 3 - 1) A + Bx + C x-I x 2 + x + 1) In the fraction with denominator x 2 + x + 1, we have used a linear polynomial Bx + C in the numerator in order to have as many constants as equations when we solve for A, B, C. Clearing the fractions and solving for A, B, and C, we find A = 1, B = 2, and C = 3. Therefore we have) f 3X2 + 2x - 2 dx = f dx + f 2x + 3 dx. x3 - 1 x-I x 2 + x + 1 The first integral on the right is log Ix - 11.To evaluate the second integral, we write) f 2x + 3 dx = f 2x + 1 dx +f 2 dx x 2 + x + 1 x 2 + x + 1 x 2 + x + 1 f dx= log (x 2 + x + 1) + 2 2 ' (x +!) +!)))

The denominator contains irreducible quadratic factors, some of H'hich are repeated. Here the situation is analogous to Case 2. In the partial-fraction decomposition of f(x)fg(x) we allow, first of all, a sum of the form (6.59) for each linear factor, as already described. In addition, if an irreducible quadratic factor x 2 + bx + c is repeated m times, we allow a sum of m terms, namely) m Bkx + C k L (x 2 + bx + C)k ' k=l) where each numerator is linear.) f X 4 - x 3 + 2X2 - x + 2 EXAMPLE 6.

The problem of inte- grating a proper rational function reduces to that of calculating integrals of the forms) I dx (x + a)n ') I x dx (x 2 + bx + c)m') and) I dx (x 2 + bx + c)m .) The first integral is log Ix + al if n = 1 and (x + a)l-nj(1- n) if n > 1. To treat the other two, we express the quadratic as a sum of two squares by writing) x 2 + bx + c = (x + \\037r + (c _ \\0372) = u 2 + (1..2 ,) where u = x + bj2 and \\\\J.. = ! V 4c - b 2 . (This is possible because 4c - b 2 > 0.) The substitution u = x + bj2 reduces the problem to that of computing) (6.60)) j 1l U du (u 2 + \\\\J..2)m) and) I du (u 2 + \\\\J..2)m .) The first of these is \\037log (u 2 + (X2) if m = 1, and !(u 2 + cx2 )I-mj(1 - m) if n1 > 1.

This discussion shows that every rational function may be integrated in terms of polynomials, rational functions, inverse tangents, and logarithms.) 6.24 Integrals which can be transformed into integrals of rational functions A function of two variables defined by an equation of the form) 'P ([ P(x, y) =.2 .2 am,nxmyn m=O n=O) is called a polynomial in tvt'O variables. The quotient of two such polynomials is called a rational function of tH,'O variables. Integrals of the form SR(sin x, cos x) dx, where R is a rational function of two variables, may be reducedby the substitution u = tan!x to integrals of the form Sr(u) du where r is a rational function of one variable. The latter integral may be evaluated by the techniques just described. We illustrate the method with a particular example. EXAMPLE 1. Integrate I . 1 dx .

The method of partial fractions leads to) 5 du - 1 5 ( 1 - 1 ) du (u - a)( u - b) - a - b u - a u - b) and, since a - b = 2V2,we obtain) (6.61 )) 5 dx ,12 u - b V2 tan \\037x - 1 + V2 = - log + C = - log V2 + c . sin x + cosx 2 u - a 2 tan !x - 1 - 2) The final answer may be simplified somewhat by using suitable trigonometric identities. First we note that V2 - 1 = tan \\0377T so the numerator of the last fraction in (6.61) is tan !x + tan 17T. In the denominator we write) tan \\037- 1 - V2 = (V2+ 1) (V2 - t) tan \\037- 1 = (V2 + 1) 1 - tan \\037 tan \\037 . 2 2 2 8) Taking logarithms as indicated in (6.61), we may combine the term - \\037V2 log (V2 + I) with the arbitrary constant and rewrite (6.61) as follows:) 5 dx V2 ( X 71' ) = - log tan - + - sin x + cosx 2 2 8) + c.)

V = arCSIn x 1 - x 2))) 266 The logarithm, the exponential, and the inverse trigonometric functions) as a consequence of the formula for differentiating arcsin x. The presence of arcsin x suggests that we could also evaluate this integral by the trigonometric substitution t = arcsin x.

More generally, any integral of the form S R(x, V a 2 - x 2 ) dx, where R is a rational function of two variables, can be transformed by the substitution) x = a sin t,) dx = a cos t dt ,) into an integral of the form SR(a sin t, a cos t)a cos t dt. This, In turn, can always be integrated by one of the methods described above.) f xdx EXAMPLE 2. Integrate . 4 - x 2 + vi 4 - x 2) Solution. We let x = 2 sin t, dx = 2 cos t dt, vi 4 - x 2 = 2 cos t, and we find that) f x dx f 4 sin t cos t dt f sin t dt 4 - x 2 + V 4 - x 2 - 4 cos2 t + 2 cos t - cos t + ! = -log Ii + costl + C = -log (1 + V4 - x 2 ) + c .) The same method works for integrals of the form) f R(x, , / a2 - (ex + d)2)dx ;) we use the trigonometric substitution ex + d = a sin t. We can deal similarly with integrals of the form) f R(x, , / a2 + (ex + d)2) dx) by the substitution ex + d = a tan t, c dx = a sec 2 t dt. For integrals of the form) f R(x, V (ex + d)2 - a 2 ) dx,) we use the substitution ex + d = a sec t, c dx = a see t tan t dt. In either case, the new integrand becomes a rational function of sin t and cos t.))) Exercises) 267) 6.25 Exercises Evaluate the following integrals: I 2X+3 1. (x _ 2)(x+ 5) dx. 2.

They are pleasant to work with in numerical computations because their values may be found by performing a finite number of multiplications and additions. In Chapter 6 weshowedthat the logarithm function can be approximatedby polynomials that enable us to compute logarithms to any desired degree of accuracy. In this chapter we will show that many other functions, such as the exponentialand trigonometric functions, can also be approximated by polynomials. If the difference between a function and its polynomial approximation is sufficiently small, then we can, for practical purposes, compute with the polynomial in place of the original function. There are many ways to approximate a given function f by polynomials, depending on what use is to be made of the approximation. In this chapter we shall be interested in obtaining a polynomial which agrees with f and some of its derivatives at a given point. We begin our discussion with a simple example. Supposefis the exponential function,f(x) = eX. At the point x = 0, the functionfand all its derivatives have the value 1. The linear polynomial) g(x) = 1 + x alsohasg(O)= 1andg'(O)= 1,soit agrees withfand its first derivative at O.Geometrically, this means the graph of g is the tangent line off at the point (0, 1),asshown in Figure 7.1. If we approximate f by a quadratic polynomial Q which agrees with f and its first two derivatives at 0, we might expect a better approximation to f than the linear function g, at least near the point (0, 1). The polynomial Q(x) = 1 + x + !X2 has Q(O) = Q' (0) = 1 and Q\\\" (0) = f\\\" (0) = 1. Figure 7.1 shows that the graph of Q approximates the curve y = eX more closely than the line y = 1 + x near the point (0, 1). We can improve further the accuracy of the approximation by using polynomials which agree withfin the third and higher derivatives as well. It is easyto verify that the polynomial) (7.1 )) n Xk x 2 X n P(x) = \\037 - = 1 + x + - + ... + - \\037k! 2! n! k=O) 272))) The Taylor polynomials generated by a function) 273) y) y = 1 + x + \\037X2) 2) y = eX) x) o) 2) y=l+x FIGURE 7.1 Polynomial approximations to the curve y = eX near (0, 1).) agrees with the exponential function and its first n derivatives at the point x = O. Of course, before we can use such polynomials to compute approximate values for the exponential function, we need some information about the error made in the approximation. Rather than discuss this particular example in more detail, we turn now to the general theory.) 7.2 The Taylor polynomials generated by a function Suppose f has derivatives up to order n at the point x = 0, where n > 1, and let us try to find a polynomial P which agrees with f and its first 11 derivatives at O. There are n + 1 conditions to be satisfied,namely) (7.2)) P(O) = f(O) ,) P' (0) = f' (0),) . . . ,) p(n>(o) = f(n>(o) ,) so we try a polynomial of degreen, say) (7.3)) P(x) = Co+ C1X + C 2 X 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + cnx n ,) with n + 1 coefficients to be determined.We shall use the conditions in (7.2) to determine these coefficients in succession. First, we put x = 0 in (7.3) and we find P(O) = Co,so Co = f(O). Next, we differentiate both sides of (7.3)and then substitute x = 0 oncemore to find P'(O) = Cl ; hence C 1 = f'(O).))) 274) Polynomial approximations to functions) If we differentiate (7.3) again and put x = 0, we find that p\\\" (0) = 2c2 , so C2 = f\\\" (0)/2. After differentiating k times, we find that P(k)(O) = k! ck , and this gives us the formula) (7.4)) j(k)(O) C k = k!) for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , n. [When k = 0, we interpret 1(0)(0)to mean f(O).] This argument proves that if a polynomial of degree < n exists which satisfies (7.2), then its coefficients are necessarily given by (7.4). (The degree of P will be equal to n if and only if/(n)(o) \\302\\245=0.) Conversely, it is easy to verify that the polynomial P with coefficients given by (7.4) satisfies (7.2), and therefore we have the following theorem.) THEOREM 7.1. Let 1 be a function with derivatives of order n at the point x = O. Then there exists one and only one polynomial P of degree < n 1rvhich satisfies the n + 1 conditions) P(O) = f(O) ,) P' (0) = f' (0),) . . . ,) p(n>(o) = f(n)(o) .) This polynomial is given by the formula) P(x) = \\037 j(k)(O) Xk . L k! k=O) In the same way, we may show that there is one and only one polynomial of degree < n which agrees with f and its first n derivatives at a point x = a. In fact, instead of (7.3), we may write P in powers of x - a and proceed as before. If we evaluate the derivativesat a in place of 0, we are led to the polynomial) (7.5)) n j (k) ( ) P(x) = \\037 a (x _ a)7c . L k! k=O) This is the one and only polynomial of degree < n which satisfies the conditions) Pea) = f(a) ,) P'ea) = .f'(a),) . . . ,) p(n)(a) = f(n>(a) ,) and it is referred to as a Taylor polynomial in honor of the English mathematician Brook Taylor (1685-1731). More precisely, we say that the polynomial in (7.5) is the Taylor polynomial of degree n generated by f at the point a. It is convenient to have a notation that indicates the dependence of the Taylor polynomial P on f and n. We shall indicate this dependence by writing P = Tn! or P = Tn(f). The symbol Tn is called the Taylor operator of degree n. When this operator is applied to a function f, it produces a new function Tnf, the Taylor polynomial of degreen. The value of this function at x is denoted by Tn/(x) or by Tn[f(x)]. If we also wish to indicate the dependence on a, we write Tn/(x; a) instead of Tn/(x).) EXAMPLE 1. When f is the exponential function, f(x) = E(x) = eX, we have E(k)(X) = eX for all k, so E(k>(O)= eO = 1, and the Taylor polynomial of degree n generated by E at 0))) Calculus of Taylor polynomials) 275) is given by the formula) n Xk X 2 X n T E(x) = T (eX ) = \\037 - = 1 + x + - + ... + - .n n L k ' 2' ,. . n . k=O) If we want a polynomial which agrees with E and its derivatives at the point a = 1, we have E(k)(l) = e for all k, so (7.5)gives us) n TnE(x; 1) = \\037 \\037 (x - l)k.

Thus only odd powers of x appear in the Taylor polynomialsgenerated by the sine function at O. The Taylor polynomial of degree 2n + 1 has the form) x 3 x 5 x 7 x2n+l T 2 + (sin x) = x - - + - - - + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + (-l)nn 1 3 ! 5 ! 7 ! (2n + I)!) EXAMPLE 3. Arguing as in Example 2, we find that the Taylor polynomials generated by the cosine function at 0 contain only even powers of x. The polynomial of degree2n is given by) x 2 x 4 x 6 x 2n Tc (cos x) = 1 - \\037 + - - - + ... + (_1)n - .2n 2! 4! 6! (2n)!) Note that each Taylor polynomial T2 n(cos x) is the derivative of the Taylor polynomial T 2n + 1(sin x). This is due to the fact that the cosine itself is the derivative of the sine. In the next section we learn that certain relations which hold between functions are transmitted to their Taylor polynomials.) 7.3 Calculus of Taylor polynomials) If a function f has derivatives of order n at a point G, we can always form its Taylor polynomial Tn! by the formula) n j (k) ( ) Tnf(x) = L k!a (x - a)\\\" \\302\\267 k=O) Sometimes the calculation of the derivatives f(k)(a) may become lengthy, so it is desirable to have alternate methods for determining Taylor polynomials. The next theorem describes properties of the Taylor operator that often enable us to obtain new Taylor polynomials from given ones. In this theorem it is understood that all Taylor polynomials are generated at a common point a.))) 276) Polynomial approximations to functions) THEOREM 7.2. The Taylor operator Tn has the following properties: (a) Linearity property. If C I and C 2 are constants, then) Tn(clf + c2g) = cITn(f) + c2 T n(g) .) (b) Differentiation property. The derivative of a Ta)Jlor polynomial of f is a Taylor polynomial off',' in fact, we have) (Tnf)' = Tn-l(f').) (c) Integration property. An indefinite integral of a Taylor polynomial of f is a Taylor polynomial of an indefinite integral of f More precisely, if g(x) = S\\037f(t) dt, then we have) Tn+lg(X) = I: Tnf(t) dt .) Proof Each statement (a), (b), or (c),is an equation involving two polynomials of the same degree. To prove each statement we simply observe that the polynomial which appears on the left has the same value and the same derivatives at the point a as the one which appears on the right. Then we invoke the uniq ueness property of Theorem 7.1. Note that differentiation of a polynomial lowers its degree, whereas integration increases its degree.) The next theoremtells us what happens when we replace x by cx in a Taylor polynomial.) THEOREM 7.3. SUBSTITUTION PROPERTY. Let g(x) = f(cx), 'where c is a constant. Then- we have) Tng(x; a) = Tnf(cx; ca).) In particular, when a = 0, we have Tng(x) = Tnf(cx).) Proof Since g(x) = f(cx), the chain rule gives us) g'(x) = cf'(cx) ,) g\\\"(X) = C2J\\\"(CX),) . . . ,) g(k)(X) = C'1(k)( cx) .)

Thus, iff has a derivative of ordern at a, we may write) (7.8)) n j (k) ( ) f(x) = 2: k!a (x - a)k + EnCx) . k=O) This is known as Taylor's formula with remainder En(x); it is useful whenever we can estimate the size of En(x). We shall express the error as an integral and then estimate the size of the integral. To illustrate the principal ideas, we consider first the error arising from a linear approximation.) THEOREM 7.5. Assume f has a continuous second derivative.!\\\" in some neighborhood of a. Then, for every x in this neighborhood, we have) f(x) = f(a) + f'(a)(x - a) + E 1(x),) where) E 1(x) = J: (x - t)f\\\"(t) dt \\302\\267))) Taylor's formula with remainder) 279) Proof From the definition of the error we may write) El(X) = f(x) - f(a) - f'(a)(x - a) = I: f'(t) dt - f'(a) I: dt = I: [f'(t)- f'(a)) dt .) The last integral may be written as s\\037 u dv, where u = f'(t) - f'(a), and v = t - x. Now du/dt = f\\\"(t) and dv/dt = 1, so the formula for integration by parts gives us) El(X) = I: u dv = uv I: - I: (t - x)f\\\"(t) dt = I: (x - t)f\\\"(t) dt ,) since u = 0 when t = a, and v = 0 when t = x. This proves the theorem. The corresponding result for a polynomial approximation of degree n is given by the following.) THEOREM 7.6. Assume f has a continuous derivative of order n + 1 in some interval containing a. Then, for every x in this interval, a'e have the Taylor formula) n f(k>(a) f(x) = \\037 (x - a)k + En(x), \\037 k! k=O) 'rrhere) 1 f x En(x) = - (x - t)r1f(n+I)(t) dt . n! a) Proof The theorem is proved by induction on 11. We have already proved it for 11 = 1. Now we assume it is true for some n and prove it for n + 1. We write Taylor's formula (7.8) with n + 1 and with n and subtract to get f(n+1>(a) En+i(x) = En(x) - ( ) , (x - a)nH . n+ 1 . Now we use the integral for En(x) and note that (x - a)n+l/(n + 1)= f\\037(x - t)n dt to obtain) 1 f x f (n+I) ( a )f X En+l(X) = - (x - t)nf(n+1)(t) dt - (x - t)n dt n! a n! a) = .1 f \\\",(X - tt[f<n+l)(t) - f<n+l)(a\\302\\273) dt . n! a) The last integral may be written in the form S\\037 u dv, where u = f(n+1)(t) - f(n+1)(a) and v = -(x - t)r1+1/(n + 1).

If upperand lower bounds for f(n+l) are known, we can deduce corresponding upper and lower bounds for En(x), as described in the next theorem.) THEOREM 7.7. If the (n + 1)st derivative of f satisfies the inequalities) (7.9)) m < f<n+l)(t) < M) for all t in some interval containing a, then for every x in this interval }-ve have the follo}-ving estimates:) (7.10)) (x -- a)n+l (x -- a)n+lm < E (x) < M (n + I)! -- n -- (n + I)!) if x > a ,) and) (7.11 )) ( ) n+l ( )n+l m a--x < (__1)n+lE (x)<M a--x (n + 1)! -- n -- (n + I)!) if x < a .) Proof Assume first that x > a. Then the integral for En(x) is extended over the interval [a, x]. For each t in this interval we have (x -- t)n > 0, so the inequalities in (7.9) give us) m (x -- t)n < (x -- t)n f (n+l) ( t' < M (x -- t)n . , --, ) -- ,n. n. n.)

If x < a, the integration takes place over the interval [x, a]. For each t in this interval we have t > x, so (--I)n(x -- t)n = (t -- x)n > O. Therefore, we may multiply the inequalities (7.9) by the nonnegative factor (--l)n(x -- t)n/n! and integrate from x to a to obtain (7.11).) EXAMPLE 1. If f(x) = eX and a = 0, we have the formula) n k eX = L \\037! + En(x) . k=O))) Estimates for the error in Taylor's formula) 281) Since f(n+l)(x) = eX, the derivative f(n+l) is monotonic increasing on every interval, and therefore satisfies the inequalities e b < f(n+l)(t) < e C on every interval of the form [b,c]. In such an interval, the inequalities for En(x) of Theorem 7.7 are satisfied with m = e b and M = e C. In particular, when b = 0, we have) xn+l xn+l < E (x) < e C (n + I)! - n - (n + I)!) if 0 < x < c .) We can use these estimates to calculate the Euler number e. We take b = 0, c = 1, x = 1,and use the inequality e < 3 to obtain) (7.13)) \\0371e = \\037 - + E n (l) , k=O k!) where) 1 < E (1) 3 (n + I)! - n < (n + I)!) This enables us to compute e to any desired degree of accuracy. For example, if we want the value of e correct to seven decimal places,. we choose an n so that 3/(n + I)! < \\03710- 8 . We shall see presently that n = 12 suffices. A table of values of Iln! may be computed rather quickly because I/n! may be obtained from I/(n - I)! by simply dividing by n. The following table for 3 < n < 12 contains these numbers rounded off to nine decimals. The \\\"round-off error\\\" in each case is indicated by a plus or minus sign which tells whether the correct value exceedsor is lessthan the recorded value. (In any case, this error is less than one-half unit in the last decimal place.)) 1 1 - - n n! n n! 3 0.166 666 667 - 8 0.000 024 802 - 4 0.041 666 667 - 9 0.000002756 - 5 0.008 333 333 + 10 0.000 000 276 - 6 0.001388 889 - 11 0.000 000 025 + 7 0.000198 413 - 12 0.000000 002 +) The terms corresponding to n = 0, 1, 2 have sum \\037. Adding this to the sum of the entries in the table (for n < 12), we obtain a total of 2.718281830.If we take into account the roundoff errors, the actual value of this sum may be less than this by as much as i of a unit in the last decimal place (due to the seven minus signs) or may exceed this by as much as \\037of a unit in the last place (due to the three plus signs). Call the sum s. Then all we can assert by this calculation is the inequality 2.718281826 < s < 2.718281832. Now the estimates for the error \\302\\24312(1)give us 0.000000000 < E 12 (1) < 0.000000001. Since e = s + EI2 (1), this calculation leads to the following inequalities for e:) 2.718281826< e < 2.718281833.) This tells us that the value of e, correctto seven decimals, is e = 2.7182818,or that the value of e, rounded off to eight decinlals, is e = 2.71828183.))) 282) Polynomial approximations to functions) EXAMPLE 2. Irrationality of e. We can use the foregoing estimates for the error En(l) to prove that e is irrational. First we rewrite the inequalities in (7.13) as follows:) 1 <e-\\037l.< 3 . (n+1)!- \\037k! (n+1)! k=O) Multiplying through by n!, we obtain) (7.14)) 1 <n!e_\\037 n! < 3 < 3 n + 1 - L k! n + 1 - 4 k=O) if n > 3. For every n, the sum on k is an integer. If e were rational, we could choose n so large that n! e would also be an integer. But then (7.14) would tell us that the difference of these two integers is a positive number not exceeding1, which is impossible. Therefore e cannot be rational.) Polynomial approximations often enable us to obtain approximate numerical values for integrals that cannot be evaluated directly in terms of elementary functions. A famous example is the integral) I x 2 !(x) = 0 e- t dt) which occurs in probability theory and in many physical problems. It is known that the function f so definedis not an elementary function. That is to say, f cannot be obtained from polynomiaJs, exponentials, logarithms, trigonometric or inverse trigonometric functions in a finite number of steps by using the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, or composition. Other examples which occur rather frequently in both theory and practice are the integrals) I x sin t dt , o t) {\\\"sin (t 2 ) dt,) L\\\\/l - k2 sin 2 t dt .) (In the first of these, it is understood that the quotient (sin t)ft is to be replaced by 1 when t = O. In the third integral, k is a constant, 0 < k < 1.) We conclude this section with an example which illustrates how Taylor's formula may be used to obtain an accurate estimate of the integral S\\037/2e-t2 dt.) EXAMPLE 3. The Taylor formula for e X _ with n = 4 gives us) (7.15)) x 2 x 3 x 4 eX = 1 + x + - + - + - + E (x) . 2! 3! 4! 4) Suppose now that x < 0. In any interval of the form [-c, 0] we have e- C < eX < 1, so we may use the inequalities (7.11) of Theorem 7.7 with m = e- C and M = 1 to write) o < (-1)5Eix) < (\\037\\037)5) if x < 0 .))) Other forms of the remainder in Taylor's formula) 283) In other words, if x < 0, then E4(X) is negative and > x5/5!. Replacing x by - t 2 in (7.15), we have) (7.16)) 2 t 4 t 6 t 8 e- t = 1 - t 2 + - - - + - + E ( _t 2 ) 2! 3! 4! 4 ,) where -t 1 \\302\\260/5!< E 4 ( -t 2 ) < O. If 0 < t < !, we find that t 1 \\302\\260/5!< (!)1\\302\\260/5! < 0.000 009. Thus, if we integrate (7.16) from 0 to !, we obtain) (1/ 2e_t2 dt = .! _ 1 + 1 _ 1 + 1 _ () J \\302\\260 2 3 . 2 3 5 . 2 5 . 2! 7 . 27 . 3! 9 . 29 . 4! ') where 0 < () < 0.000 0045. Rounding off to four decimals, we find S\\037/2e-t2 dt = 0.4613.) *7.7 Other forms of the remainder in Taylor's formula We have expressedthe error in Taylor's formula as an integral,) 1 I x En(x) = - (x - t)rlf(n+1)(t) dt . n! a) It can also be expressed in many other forms. Since the factor (x - tY\\037 in the integrand never changes sign in the interval of integration, and since f(n+1) is continuous on this interval, the weighted mean-value theorem for integrals (Theorem 3.16) gives us) f X(X - t)nf(n+l)(t) dt = f(n+I)(c) f x(X _ t)n dt = f<n+l)(c) (x - at+!, a a n+l) where c lies in the closed interval joining a and x. Therefore, the error can be written as) f (n+1)(C) E (x) = (x - a)n+l .n (n + I)!) This is called Lagrange's form of the remainder. It resembles the earlier terms in Taylor's formula, except that the derivative f(n+l)(c) is evaluated at some unknown point c rather than at a. The point c depends on x and on n, as well as on f Using a different type of argument, we can drop the continuity requirement on f(n+1) and derive Lagrange'sformula and other forms of the remainder under a weakerhypothesis. Suppose that f(n+1) exists in son1e open interval (h, k) containing the point a, and assume that f(n) is continuous in the closed interval [h, k]. Choose any x \\037 a in [h, k ]. For simplicity, say x > a. Keep x fixed and define a new function F on the interval [a, x] as follows:) n f(k)() F(t) =f(t) + \\037 t (x - t)k.L k! k=1) Note that F(x) = f(x) and F(a) = Tnf(x;a), so F(x) - F(a) = En(x). The function F is))) 284) Polynomial approximations to functions) continuous in the closed interval [a, x] and has a derivative in the open interval (a, x). If we compute F'(t), keepingin mind that each term of the sum defining F(t) is a product, we find that all terms cancel except one, and we are left with the equation) F'(t) = (x - t)n f(n+l)(t) . n!) Now let G be any function that is continuous on [a, x] and differentiable on (a, x). Then we can apply Cauchy's mean-value formula (Theorem 4.6) to write) G'(c)[F(x) - F(a)] = F'(c)[G(x)- G(a)] ,) for some c in the open interval (a, x). If G' is nonzero in (a, x), this gives the following formula for the error En(x):) En(x) = F'(c) [G(x)- G(a)] . G'( c)) We can express the error in various forms by different choices of G. For example, taking G(t) = (x - t)n+l, we obtain Lagrange's form,) f <n+l> ( C) E (x) = (x - a)n+ln (n+l)! ') where a < c < x .) Taking G(t) = x - t, we obtain another formula, called Cauchy's form of the remainder,) f <n+l )( c) En(x) = , (x - c)n(x - a) , n.) where a < c < x .) If G(t) = (x - t)P, where p > 1, we obtain the formula) f <n+l> ( c) En(x) = , (x - c)n+l-p(x - a)P, n.p) where a < c < x .) 7.8 Exercises) Examples of Taylor's formula with remainder are given in Exercises 1, 2, and 3.

[It is to be understood that the quotient (sin x)/ x is equal to 1 when x = 0.] 10. This exerciseoutlines a method for computing 7T, using Taylor's formula for arctan x given in Exercise 3. It is based on the fact that 7T is nearly 3.2, so t7T is nearly 0.8 or i, and this is nearly 4 arctan t. Let Lt = arctan t, fJ = 4Lt - !7T. (a) Use the identity tan(A + B) = (tan A + tan B)/(1 - tan A tan B) with A = B = Lt and then again with A = B = 2Lt to get tan 2(:(= lJi2 and tan 4(:( = \\037\\0378 . Then use the identity once more with A = 4Lt, B = -!7T to obtain tan fJ = 2\\0379' This yields the following remarkable identity discovered in 1706 by John Machin (1680-1751):) 7T = 16 arctan t - 4 arctan 2 \\0379 .)

The o-notation Iff has a continuous (n + 1)st derivative in some interval containing a point a, we may write Taylor's formula in the form) (7.17)) n f<k)(a) f(x) = L k! (x - at + En(x) . k=O) Suppose we restrict x to lie in some closed interval [a - c, a + c] about a, in which f(n+l) is continuous. Thenf<n+l)is bounded on this interval and hence satisfies an inequality of the form) If(n+l)(t)1 < M ,) where M > O. Hence, by Theorem 7.7, we have the error estimate) I I n+l IE (x)1 < M x - a n - (n + 1)!) for each x in [a - c, a + c]. If we keep x \\037 a and divide this inequality by Ix - al n , we find that) o < En(x) < M I x - a l . (x - ar\\037 - (n + 1)!) If now we let x -> a, we see that En(x)/(x - a)n \\037 O. We describe this by saying that the error En(x) is of smaller order than (x - a)n as x \\037 a. In other words, under the conditions stated, f(x) may be approximated near a by a polynomial in (x - a) of degree n, and the error in this approximation is of smaller order than (x - a)n as x \\037 a. A special notation, introduced in 1909 by E. Landau,t is particularly appropriate when used in connection with Taylor's formula. This is called the o-notation (the little-oh notation) and it is defined as follows.) DEFINITION. Assume g(x) \\037 0 for all x \\037 a in S01ne interval containing a.

This expresses, in a brief way, the fact that the error term is small compared to (x - a)n when x is near a.

Theycan alsobe used as an aid in the calculation of limits. We illustrate with some examples.) EXAMPLE 1. If a and b are positive numbers, determine the limit) . aX _ b X hm . x-o x) Solution. We cannot solve this problem by computing the limit of the numerator and denominator separately,becausethe denominator tends to 0 and the quotient theorem on limits is not applicable. The numerator in this case also tends to 0 and the quotient is said to assume the \\\"indeterminate form 0/0\\\" as x -+ O. Taylor's formula and the o-notation often enable us to calculate the limit of an indeterminate form like this one very simply. The idea is to approximate the numerator a;x' - bX by a polynomial in x, then divide by x and let x -+ O. We could apply Taylor's formula directly to f(x) = a;x' - bX but, since a;x' = eX log a and b X = eX log b, it is simpler in this case to use the polynomial approximations already derived for the exponential function.

In examples like these, the quotient f(x)/g(x) is said to assume the \\\"indeterminate form 0/0.\\\" One way to attack problems on indeterminate forms is to obtain polynomial approxima- tions to f(x) and g(x) as we did in treating the above examp1es. Sometimesthe work can be shortened by use of a differentiation technique known as L' H6pital's rule.t The basic idea of the method is to study the quotient of derivatives f'(x)/g'(x) and thereby to try to deduce information about f(x)fg(x). Beforestating L'H6pital's rule, we show why the quotient of derivatives f'(x)/g'(x) bears a relation to the quotient f(x)/g(x). Suppose fand g are two functions with f(a) = g(a) = O. Then, for x '\\302\\245=a, we have) f(x) = f(x) - f(a) = f(x) - f(a) / g(x) - g(a) . g(x) g(x)- g(a) x - a x - a) If the derivatives f'(a) and g'(a) exist, and if g'(a) \\037 0, then as x -+ a the quotient on the right approaches f'(a)/g'(a) and hence f(x)/g(x) -+ f'(a)jg'(a).) 1 - e 2x EXAMPLE. Compute 1imx-.o . x) Solution. Here f(x) = 1 - e 2x and g(x) = x, so f'(x) = -2e 2X , g'(x) = 1. Hence we have f'(O)/g'(O)= -2, so the limit in question is -2.) In L'H6pital's rule, no assumptions are made about.t: g or their derivatives at the point x = a. Instead, we assume that f(x) and g(x) approach 0 as x -+a and that the quotient f'(x)/g'(x) tends to a finite limit as x -+ a. L'H6pital's ru1e then tells us thatf(x)jg(x) tends to the same limit. More precisely, we have the following.) THEOREM 7.9. L'HOPITAL'S RULE FOR 010. Assume f and g have derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) at each point x of an open interval (a, b), and suppose that) (7.20)) Jimf(x) = 0 x-'a+) and) Jim g(x) = 0 . x-.a+) t In 1696, Guillaume Fran90is Antoine de L'Hopital (1661-1704)wrote the first textbook on differential calculus. This work appeared in many editions and played a significant role in the popularization of the subject. Much of the content of the book, including the method known as \\\"L'Hopital's rule,\\\" was based on the earlier work of Johann Bernoulli, one of L'Hopital's teachers.))) L' Hopital's rule for the indeterminate form 0/0) 293) Assume also that g'(x) '\\302\\245=0 for each x in (a, b). If the limit) (7.21 )) ) . f'(x) 1m x-a+ g'(x)) exists and has the value L, say, then the limit) (7.22 )) 1 . f(x) 1m - x-a+ g(x)) also exists and has the value L.) Note that the limits in (7.20), (7.21), and (7.22) are \\\"right-handed.\\\" There is, of course, a similar theorem in which the hypotheses are satisfied in some open interval of the form (b, a) and all the limits are \\\"left-handed.\\\" Also, by combining the two \\\"one-sided\\\" theorems, there follows a \\\"two-sided\\\" result of the same kind in which x \\037 a in an unrestricted fashion. Before we discuss the proof of Theorem 7.9, we shall illustrate the use of this theorem in a number of examples.) EXAMPLE 1. We shall use L'H6pital's rule to obtain the familiar formula) (7.23)) I . SIn x 11m - = . x-o X) Here f(x) = sin x and g(x) = x. The quotient of derivatives is f'(x)/g'(x) = (cosx)/1and this tends to 1 as x \\037 O. By Theorem 7.9 the limit in (7.23) also exists and equals 1.) EXAMPLE 2. To determine the limit) I . x - tan x 1m x-o X - sIn x) by L'H6pital's rule, we let f(x) = x - tan x, g(x) = x - sin x, and we find that) (7.24)) f'(x) = 1 - sec 2 x g'(x) 1 - cos x Although this, too, assumes the form % as x \\037 0, we may remove the indeterminacy at this stage by algebraic means. If .we write) 1 1 - sec 2 x = 1 - cos 2 X) cos 2 x-I cos 2 X) _ _ ( 1 + cos x)(1 - cosx) cos 2 X) the quotient in (7.24) becomes) f'(x) = _ 1+ cosx g'(x) cos 2 x and this approaches -2 as x \\037 O. Notice that the indeterminacy disappeared when we))) 294) Polynomial approximations to functions) canceled the common factor 1 - cosx. Canceling common factors usually tends to simplify the work in problems of this kind. When the quotient of derivativesf'(x)/g'(x) also assumes the indeterminate form 0/0, we may try L'H6pital's rule again. In the next example, the indeterminacy is removed after two applications of the rule.) EXAMPLE 3. For any real number c, we have) c + 1 c-I ( 1) c-2 ) . x - cx e - ) . ex - e 1 . e e - x 1m = 1m = 1m x-I (x - 1)2 x-I 2(x - 1) x-I 2) e( e - 1) 2) In this sequence of equations it is understood that the existence of each limit implies that of the preceding and also their equality. The next example shows that L'H6pital's rule is not infallible.) EXAMPLE 4. Letf(x) = e- I/x if x '\\302\\245=0, and let g(x) = x. The quotientf(x)/g(x) assumes the indeterminate form % as x -+ 0+, and one application of L'H6pital's rule leads to the quotient) f'(x) = (1/x 2 )e- 1/x e- I / x =\\037. g'(x) 1 x) This, too, is indeterminate as x-> 0+, and if we differentiate numerator and denominator we obtain (l/x2)e-I/x /(2x) = e- I /x /(2x 3 ). After n steps we are led to the quotient e-1/X/(n! xn+I), so the indeterminacy never disappearsby this method.) EXAMPLE 5. When using L'H6pital's rule repeatedly, some care is neededto make certain that the quotient under considerationactually assumes an indeterminate form. A common type of error is illustrated by the following calculation: 1 . 3X2 - 2x - 1 I . 6x - 2 I \\\" 6 31m = 1m = 1m - = . x-I x 2 - X x-I2x - 1 x-I2) The first step is correct but the second is not. The quotient (6x - 2)/(2x - 1) is not indeterminate as x -+ 1. The correct limit, 4, is obtained by substituting 1 for x in (6x - 2)/(2x- 1).) EXAMPLE 6. Sometimes the work can be shortened by a change of variable. For example, we could apply L'H6pital's rule directly to calculate the limit) 1. \\037 1m 2A /- , x-o+ 1 - e v x) but we may avoid differentiation of square roots by writing t = \\037 and noting that) 1. vX 1 . t 1 . 1m - = 1m = 1m x-O+ 1 - e2yx t-O+ 1 - e 2t t-O+ _2e 2t) 1) 1 = -- 2) We turn now to the proof of Theorem 7.9.))) Exercises) 295) Proof We make use of Cauchy's mean-value formula (Theorem 4.6 of Section 4.14) applied to a closed interval having a as its left endpoint. Since the functions f and g may not be defined at a, we introduce two new functions that are defined there. Let) F(x) = f(x) G(x) = g(x)) if x '\\302\\245=a ,) F(a) = 0 ,) if x '\\302\\245=a ,) G(a) = 0 .) Both F and G are continuous at a. In fact, if a < x < b, both functions F and G are continuous on the closed interval [a, x] and have derivatives everywhere in the open interval (a, x). Therefore Cauchy's formula is applicable to the interval [a, x] and we obtain) [F(x) - F(a)]G'(e) = [G(x)- G(a)]F'(e) ,) where e is some point satisfying a < e < x. SinceF(a) = G(a) = 0, this becomes) f(x)g'(e) = g(x)f'(e) .) Now g'(e) '\\302\\245=0 [since, by hypothesis, g' is never zero in (a, b)] and also g(x) '\\302\\245=O. In fact, if we had g(x) = 0 then we would have G(x) = G(a) = 0 and, by Rolle's theorem, there would be a point Xl between a and x where G'(xl) = 0, contradicting the hypothesis that g' is never zero in (a, b). Therefore we may divide by g'(e) and g(x) to obtain) f(x) = f'(e) g(x) g'(e)) As x -+ a, the point e -+ a (sincea < e < x) and the quotient on the right approaches L [by (7.21)]. Hence,f(x)/g(x) also approaches L and the theorem is proved.) 7.13 Exercises) Evaluate the limits in Exercises 1 through 12. 3x 2 + 2x - 16 1. lim 2 2 ' x-2 X - X -) x 2 - 4x + 3 2. lim 2 2 _ 13 21 . x-3 x x + sinh x - sin x 3. lim 3 x) \\037-\\037+ V x-a 7. lim . x-a+ V X2 - a 2 XX - X) 8. lim x-l+ 1 - x + log x . arcsin 2x - 2 arcsin x 9. lim) x-o) x-o) x 3) (2 - x)e X - x - 2 4. lim 3 \\302\\267 x-o X) x cot x-I 10. lim) x-o) x 2) . log (cos ax) 5. 11m . x-o log (cos bx) x - sin x 6. lim ( . )3/2 . x-o+ X sin x) \\037n Xk - n 11 I . \\037k=l . 1m 1 . x-I x- 1 ( \\037 \\037 ) 12. lim \\037c a arctan - - b arctan b . x-o+x'v x a))) 296) Polynomial approximations to functions) 13.

First of all, we may wish to consider the quotient f(x)/g(x) as x increases without bound. It is convenient to have a short))) The symbols + 00 and - 00. Extension of L' Hopital's rule) 297) descriptive symbolism to express the fact that we are allowing x to increase indefinitely. For this purpose, mathematicians use the special symbol + 00, called \\\"plus infinity.\\\" Although we shall not attach any meaning to the symbol + 00 by itself, we shall give precise definitions of various statements involving this symbol. One of these statements is written as' follows:) lim f(x) = A , x-++ 00) and is read \\\"The limit of f(x), as x tends to plus infinity, is A.\\\" The idea we are trying to express here is that the function values f(x) can be made arbitrarily close to the real number A by taking x large enough. To make this statement mathematically precise, we must explain what is meant by \\\"arbitrarily close\\\" and by \\\"large enough.\\\" This is done by means of the following definition:) DEFINITION. The symbolism) Jim f(x) = A x-++oo) means that for every number \\342\\202\\254> 0, there is another number M > 0 (\\037fhich may depend on \\342\\202\\254) such that) If(x) - A I < \\342\\202\\254)H'henever x > M .) Calculations involving limits as x \\037 + 00 may be reduced to a more familiar case. We simply replace x by lit (that is, let t = l/x) and note that t \\037 0 through positive values as x \\037 + 00. More precisely, we introduce a new function F, where) (7.25)) F(t) =fG)) if t \\302\\245=0 ,) and simply observe that the two statements) lim f(x) = A) and) Jim F(t) = A t-O+)x-+oo) mean exactly the same thing. The proof of this equivalence requires only the definitions of the two limit symbols and is left as an exercise. When we are interested in the behavior of f(x) for large negative x, we introduce the symbol - 00 (\\\"minus infinity\\\") and write) Jim f(x) = A) x-+-oo) to mean: For every \\342\\202\\254> 0, there is aB M > 0 such that) If(x) - A I < \\342\\202\\254)whenever x < -M.))) 298) Polynomial approximations to functions) If F is defined by (7.25), it is easy to verify that the two statements) lim f(x) = A) and) lim F(t) = A t-+Q-)x-+-oo) are equivalent. In view of the above remarks, it is not surprising to find that all the usual rules for calculating with limits (as stated in Theorem 3.1 of Section 3.4) also apply to limits as x \\037 ::I: 00. The same is true of L'H6pital's rule which may be extended as follows:) THEOREM 7.10. Assume that f and g have derivatives f'(x) and g'(x) for all x greater than a certain fixed M > O. Suppose that) lim f(x) = 0 x-++oo) and) lim g(x) = 0 , x-++oo) and that g'(x) '\\302\\245=0 for x > M. If f'(x)/g'(x) tends to a limit as x \\037 + 00, then f(x)/g(x) also tends to a limit and the t\\\\VO limits are equal. In other words,) (7.26)) Jim f'(x) = L x-+oog'(x)) implies) lim f(x) = L . x-++oo g(x)) Proof Let F(t) = f(l/t) and G(t) = g(l/t). Thenf(x)/g(x) = F(t)/G(t) if t = l/x, and t \\037 0+ as x \\037 + 00. Since F(t)/G(t) assumes the indeterminate form % as t \\037 0+, we examine the quotient of derivativesF'(t)/G'(t). By the chain rule, we have) F'(t) = - 1 f' ( ! )t 2 t) and) G' (t) = - 1 g'(! ) . t 2 t) Also, G'(t) '\\302\\245=0 if 0 < t < I/M. When x = l/t and x > M, we have F'(t)/G'(t) = f'(x)/g'(x) since the common factor -1/t 2 cancels. Therefore, if f'(x)/g'(x) \\037 L as x \\037 + 00, then F'(t)/G'(t) \\037 L as t \\037 0+ and hence, by Theorem 7.9, F(t)/G(t) \\037 L. Since F(t)/G(t) = f(x)/g(x) this proves (7.26). There is, of course, a result analogous to Theorem 7.10 in which we consider limits as x \\037 - 00.) 7.15 Infinite limits In the foregoing section we used the notation x \\037 + 00 to convey the idea that x takes on arbitrarily large positive values.

If f(x) > M a'henever 0 < x - a < \\037,we write) limf(x) = + co , x\\037a+) and we say that I(x) tends to plus infinity as x approaches a from the right.

Therefore, we may also write lim x_ o + log x = - 00.

For example, we may have a quotientf(x)/g(x) where bothf(x)-+ +00 and g(x)-+ +00 as x-+a (or as x-+:f: 00). In this case, we say that the quotientf(x)/g(x) assumesthe indeterminate form 00/00. There are various extensionsof L'H6pital's rule that often help to determine the behavior of a quotient when it assumes the indeterminate form 00/00. However, we shall not discuss these extensionsbecausemost examples that occur in practice can be treated by use of the))) The behavior of log x and eX for large x) 301) following theorem which describes the behavior of the logarithm and the exponential for large values of x.)

A simple proof of (7.31) may be given directly from the definition of the logarithm as an integral. If c > 0 and I > 1, we have 1-1< I C- 1. Hence, if x > I, we may write) I x 1 I x XC - 1 XC o < log x = - dt < t c- 1 dt = < - . 1 tIC C) Therefore, we have) o < (log X)b < x bc - a x a c b) for every c > 0 .) Ifwe choose C = \\037a/b, then x bc - a = x- aj2 which tends to 0 as x \\037 + co. This proves (7.31). To prove (7.32), we make the change of variable I = eX. Then x = log f, and hence xb/e ax = (logt)b/l a. But I\\037 +00 as x\\037 +00, so (7.32) follows from (7.31).) With a natural extension of the o-notation, we can write the limit relations just proved in the form) (log X)b = o(x a)) as x \\037 + 00 ,) and) x b = o( eax )) as x \\037 + 00 .) In other words, no matter how large b may be and no matter how small a may be (as long as both are positive), (log X)b tends to infinity more slowly than x a . Also, x b tends to infinity more slowly than ea.J'.) EXAMPLE 1. In Example 4 of Section 7.12we showed that the behavior of e-1j.J'/x for x near 0 could not be decided by any number of applications of L'Hopital's rule for 0/0. However, if we write t = I/x, this quotient becomes tje l and it assumes the indeterminate form co/oo as t \\037 + 00.

For example, we could try to compute the position of a moving particle from a knowledge of its velocity or acceleration. Or a radioactive substance may be disintegrating at a known rate and we may be required to determine the amount of material present after a given time. In examples like these, we are trying to determine an unknO\\037fn function from prescribed information expressed in the form of an equation involving at least one of the derivatives of the unknown function. These equations are called differential equations, and their study forms one of the most challenging branches of mathematics. Differential equations are classified under two main headings: ordinar}' and partial, depending on whether the unknown is a function of just one variable or of two or n10re variables. A simple example of an ordinary differential equation is the relation) (8.1)) f'ex) = f(x)) which is satisfied, in particular, by the exponential function, f(x) = eX. We shall see presently that every solution of (8.1) must be of the form I(x) = Ce x , where C may be any constant. On the other hand, an equation like) a2j(x, y) + a2j(x, y) = 0 ox 2 0 y2) is an example of a partial differential eq uation. This particular one, called Laplace's equation, appears in the theory of electricity and magnetism, fluid mechanics, and else- where. It has many different kinds of solutions, among which are f(x, \\037y)= x + 2y, f(x, y) = eX cos y, and f(x, y) = log (x 2 + y2). The study of differential equations is one part of mathematics that, perhaps more than any other, has been directly inspired by mechanics, astronomy, and mathematical physics. Its history began in the 17th century when Newton, Leibniz, and the Bernoullis solved some simple differential equations arising from problems in geometry and mechanics. 305))) 306) Introduction to differential equations) These early discoveries, beginning about 1690,gradually led to the development of a now- classic \\\"bag of tricks\\\" for solving certain special kinds of differential equations. Although these specialtricks are applicable in relatively few cases, they do enable us to solve many differential equations that arise in mechanics and geometry, so their study is of practical importance. Some of these special methods and some of the problems which they help us solve are discussednear the end of this chapter. Experience has shown that it is difficult to obtain mathematical theories of much generality about solutions of differential equations, except for a few types. Among these are the so-called linear differential equations which occur in a great variety of scientific problems. The simplest types of linear differential equations and some of their applications are also discussedin this introductory chapter. A more thorough study of linear equations is carried out in Volume II.) 8.2 Terminology and notation When we work with a differential equation such as (8.1), it is customary to write y in place of f(x) and y' in place of f'ex), the higher derivatives being denoted by y\\\", yl!!, etc. Of course, other letters such as u, v, z, etc. are also used instead of y. By the order of an equation is meant the order of the highest derivative which appears. For example, (8.1) is a first-order equation which may be written as }\\\" = y. The differential equation y' = x 3 y + sin (xy\\\") is one of secondorder. In this chapter we shall begin our study with first-order equations which can be solved for y' and written as follows:) (8.2)) y' = f(x, y) ,) where the expression f(x, y) on the right has various special forms. A differentiable function y = Y(x) will be called a solution of (8.2)on an interval] if the function Yand its derivative Y ' satisfy the relation) yI(X) = f[x, Y(x)]) for every x in I. The simplestcaseoccurswhen f(x, y) is independent of y. In this case, (8.2) becomes) (8.3)) y' = Q(x),) say, where Q is assumed to be a given function defined on some interval I. To solve the differential equation (8.3) means to find a primitive of Q. The second fundamental theorem of calculus tells us how to do it when Q is continuous on an open interval I. We simply integrate Q and add any constant. Thus, every solution of (8.3)is included in the formula) (8.4)) y = f Q(x)dx + C ,) where C is any constant (usually called an arbitrary constant of integration). The differential equation (8.3)has infinitely many solutions, one for each value of C. If it is not possible to evaluate the integral in (8.4) in terms of familiar functions, such))) A first-order differential equation for the exponential function) 307) as polynomials, rational functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric functions, logarithms, and exponentials, still we consider the differential equation as having been solved if the solution can be expressed in terms of integrals of known functions. In actual practice, there are various methods for obtaining approximate evaluations of integrals which lead to useful information about the solution. Automatic high-speed computing machines are often designed with this kind of problem in mind.) EXAMPLE. Linear motion determined from the velocity. Suppose a particle moves along a straight line in such a way that its velocity at time t is 2 sin t. Determine its position at time t.) Solution. If yet) denotes the position at time t measured from some starting point, then the derivative Y'(t) represents the velocity at time t. We are given that) Y'(t) = 2 sin t .) Integrating, we find that yet) = 2 I sin t dt + C = -2 cos t + C .) This is aU we can deduce about yet) from a knowledge of the velocity alone; some other piece of information is needed to fix the position function. We can determineC if we know the value of Y at some particular instant. For example, if Y(O) = 0, then C = 2 and the position function is yet) = 2 - 2cost. But if Y(O) = 2, then C = 4 and the position function is yet) = 4 - 2 cost.) In some respects the example just solved is typical of what happens in general. Some- where in the process of solving a first-order differential equation, an integration is required to remove the derivative y' and in this step an arbitrary constant C appears. The way in which the arbitrary constant C enters into the solution will depend on the nature of the given differential equation. It may appear as an additive constant, as in Equation (8.4), but it is more likely to appear in some other way. For example, when we solve the equation y' = y in Section 8.3, we shall find that every solution has the form y = Ce x . In many problems it is necessary to select from the collection of all solutions one having a prescribed value at some point. The prescribed value is called an initial condition, and the problem of determining such a solution is called an initial-value problem. This terminology originated in mechanics where, as in the above example, the prescribed value represents the displacement at some initial time. We shall begin our study of differential equations with an important specialcase.) 8.3 A first-order differential equation for the exponential function The exponential function is equal to its own derivative, and the same is true of any constant multiple of the exponential. It is easy to show that these are the only functions that satisfy this property on the whole real axis.) THEOREM 8.1. If C is a given real number, there is one and only one function f which satisfies the differential equation) f'(x) = f(x)))) 308) Introduction to differential equations) for all real x and which also satisfies the initial condition f(O) = C. This function is given by the formula) f(x) = Ce x .) Proof It is easy to verify that the function f(x) = Ce x satisfies both the given differential equation and the given initial condition. Now we must show that this is the only solution. Let y = g(x) be any solution of this initial-value problem:) g'(x) = g(x)) for all x,) g(O) = C .) We wish to show that g(x) = Ce X or that g(x)e- X = C. We consider the function hex) = g(x)e- X and show that its derivative is always zero. The derivative of h is given by) h'(x) = g'(x)e- X - g(x)e- X = e-X[g'(x) - g(x)]= 0 .) Hence, by the zero-derivative theorem, h is constant. But g(O) = C so h(O) = g(O)eO = C. Hence, we have hex) = C for all x which means that g(x) = Ce x , as required.) Theorem 8.1 is an example of an existence-uniqueness theorem. It tells us that the given initial-value problem has a solution (existence) and that it has only one solution (uniqueness). The object of much of the research in the theory of differential equations is to discover existence and uniqueness theorems for wide classes of equations. We discuss next an important type which includes both the differential equation y' = Q(x) and the equation y' = y as special cases.) 8.4 First-order linear differential equations A differential equation of the form) (8.5)) y' + P(x)y = Q(x),) where P and Q are given functions, is called afirst-order linear differential equation. The terms involving the unknown function}' and its derivative y' appear as a linear combination of y and y'. The functions P and Q are assumed to be continuous on some open intervall. We seek all solutionsy defined on I. First we consider the specialcase in which the right member, Q(x), is identically zero. The equation) (8.6)) y' + P(x)y = 0) is called the homogeneous or reducedequation corresponding to (8.5). We will show how to solve the homogeneous equation and then use the result to help us solve the non- homogeneous equation (8.5). If Y is nonzero on I, Equation (8.6) is equivalent to the equation) (8.7)) y'- = -P(x) . y))) First-order linear differential equations) 309) That is, every nonzero y which satisfies (8.6) also satisfies (8.7) and vice versa. Now suppose y is a positive function satisfying (8.7). Since the quotient y' fy is the derivative of log y, Equation (8.7) becomes D logy = -P(x), from which we find logy = - SP(x)dx + C, so we have) (8.8)) y = e-A(x) ,) where A(x) = I P(x) dx - C .) In other words, if there is a positive solution of (8.6), it must necessarily have the form (8.8) for some C. But now it is easy to verify that every function in (8.8) is a solution of the homogeneous equation (8.6). In fact, we have) y' = -e-A(x)A'(x) = -P(x)e-A(x) = -P(x)y .) Thus, we have found all positive solutions of (8.6). But now it is easy to describe all solutions. We state the result as an existence-uniqueness theorem.) THEOREM 8.2. Assume P is continuous on an open interval I. Choose any point a in I and let b be any real number. Then there is one and only one function y = f(x) u'hich satisfies the initial-value problem) (8.9)) y' + P(x)y = 0,) \\0371'ith) f(a) = b ,) on the interval I. This function is given by the formula) (8.10)) f(x) = be-A(x) ,) where A(x) = I: P(t) dt .) Proof Let f be defined by (8.10). Then A(a) = 0 so f(a) = beG = b. Differentiation shows that f satisfies the differential equation in (8.9), so f is a solution of the initial-value problem. Now we must show that it is the only solution. Letg be an arbitrary solution. We wish to show that g(x) = be-A(X) or that g(x)e A (x) = b. Therefore it is natural to introduce hex) = g(x)e..t(X).The derivative of h is given by) (8.11 )) h'(x) = g'(x)eA(x) + g(x)eA(x)A'(x)= eA(x)[g'(x) + P(x)g(x)] .) Now since g satisfies the differential equation in (8.9), we have g'(x) + P(x)g(x)= 0 everywhere on I, so h'(x) = 0 for all x in I. This means that h is constant on I. Hence, we have hex) = h(a) = g(a)eA(a) = g(a) = b. In other words,g(x)e..t(X) = b, so g(x) = be-A(X), which shows that g = f This completes the proof.) The last part of the foregoingproof suggestsa method for solving the nonhomogeneous differential equation in (8.5). Suppose that g is any function satisfying (8.5), and let hex) = g(x)eA(X) where, as above, A(x) = S\\037pet) dt. Then Equation (8.11) is again valid, but since g satisfies (8.5), the formula for h'(x) gives us) h'(x) = eA(x)Q(x) .))) 310) Introduction to differential equations) Now we may invoke the second fundamental theorem to write) hex) = h(a) + f' eAWQ(t) dt .) Hence, since h(a) = g(a), every solution g of (8.5) has the form) (8.12)) g(x) = e-Ar.')h(x) = g(a)e- ACx ) + e- ACx ) r Q(t)eACt>dt .) Conversely, by direct differentiation of (8.12), it is easy to verify that each such g is a solution of (8.5), so we have found all solutions.We state the result as follows.) THEOREM 8.3. Assume P and Q are continuous on an open interval 1. Choose any point a in I and let b be any real number. Then there is one and only one function y = f(x) which satisfies the initial-value problem) y' + P(x)y= Q(x),) with f(a) = b ,) on the interval I. This function is given by the formula) f(x) = be- ACx ) + e- ACx ) r Q(t)eACt)dt ,) where A(x) = S\\037pet) dt.) Up to now the word \\\"interval\\\" has meant a bounded interval of the form (a, b), [a, b], [a, b), or (a, b], with a < b. It is convenient to consider also unbounded intervals. They are denoted by the symbols (a, + 00), (- 00, a), [a, + 00) and (- 00, a], and they are defined as follows:) (a, +00) = {x I x > a},) (- 00,a) = {xI x < a} ,) [a, +00) = {x I x > a},) (- 00,a] = {xI x < a} .) In addition, it is convenient to refer to the collection of all real numbers as the interval ( - 00,+ 00). Thus, when we discuss a differential equation or its solution over an interval I, it will be understood that I is one of the nine types just described.) EXAMPLE. Find all solutions of the first-order differential equation xy' + (1 - x}y = e 2x on the interval (0, + 00).) Solution. First we transform the equation to the form y' + P(x)y = Q(x) by dividing through by x. This gives us) ( 1 ) e2x y' + x -I y = \\037 '))) Exercises) 311) so P(x) = l/x - 1 and Q(x) = e 2X /x. Since P and Q are continuous on the interval (0, + (0), there is a unique solution y = f(x) satisfying any given initial condition of the formf(a) = b. We shall express all solutions in terms of the initial value at the point a = 1. In other words, given any real number b, we will determine all solutions for whichf(l) = b. First we compute) A(x) = IX P(t) dt = IX (\\037 - 1) dt = log x - (x - 1).) Hence we have e-A(X) = eX-1-logx= e X- 1 /x, and eA(t) = te 1- t , so Theorem 8.3 tells us that the solution is given by the formula) ex- 1 e X- 1 j X e2t e x- 1 eX j X f(x) = b - + - - te 1- t dt = b - + - e t dt x Xl t x Xl) ex- 1 eX e x- 1 e2 .x eX ;-1 = b - + - (eX - e) = b - + - - - . x x x x x) We can also write this in the form) e2X + Ce x f(x) = x ') where C = be- 1 - e. This gives all solutions on the interval (0, + (0). It may be of interest to study the behavior of the solutions as x \\037 O. If we approximate the exponential by its linear Taylor polynomial, we find that e 2X = 1 + 2x + o(x) and eX = 1 + x + o(x) as x \\037 0, so we have) f(x) = (1 + C) + (2 + C)x + o(x) = 1 + C+ (2 + C) + 0(1) . x x) Therefore, only the solution with C = -1 tends to a finite limit as x \\037 0, this limit being 1.) 8.5 Exercises) In each of Exercises 1 through 5, solve the initial-value problem on the specifiedinterval. 1. y' - 3y = e 2x on ( - 00, + 00),with Y = 0 when x = O. 2. xy' - 2Y = x 5 on (0, + 00), wi th Y = 1 when x = 1. 3. y' + Y tan x = sin 2x on (-!7T, \\0377T), with Y = 2 when x = O. 4. y' + x Y = x 3 on ( - 00, + 00),with Y = 0 when x = O. dx 5. dt + x = e 2 t on ( - 00, + 00),with x = 1 when t = O. 6.

Find all functions with these two properties. The Bernoulli equation. A differential equation of the form y' + P(x)y = Q(x)yn, where n is not 0 or 1, is calleda Bernoulli equation. This equation is nonlinear because of the presence of yn. The next exercise shows that it can always be transformed into a linear first-order equation for a new unknown function v, where v = yk, k = 1 - n. 13.Let k be a nonzero constant. Assume P and Q are continuous on an interval I. If a E I and if b is any real number, let v = g(x) be the unique solution of the initital-value problem v' + kP(x)v = kQ(x) on I, with g(a) = b.

Prove that if u is a known solution of this equation, then there are further solutions of the form y = u + 1Iv, where v satisfies a first-order linear equation.))) Some physical problems leading to first-order linear differential equations 313) 20. The Riccati equation y' + Y + y2 = 2 has two constant solutions. Start with each of these and use Exercise 19 to find further solutions as follows: (a) If - 2 < b < 1, find a solution on ( - 00, + 00) for which y = b when x = O.(b) If b > 1 or b < - 2,find a solution on the interval ( - 00, + 00) for which y = b when x = O.) 8.6 Some physical problems leading to first-order linear differential equations In this section we will discuss various physical problems that can be formulated mathe- matically as differential eq uations. In each case, the differential eq uation represents an idealized simplification of the physical problem and is called a mathematical model of the problem. The differential equation occurs as a translation of some physical law, such as Newton's second law of motion, a \\\"conservation\\\" law, etc. Our purpose here is not to justify the choice of the mathematical model but rather to deduce logical consequences from it. Each model is only an approximation to reality, and its justification properly belongs to the science from which the problem emanates. If intuition or experimental evidence agrees with the results deduced mathematically, then we feel that the model is a useful one. If not, we try to find a more suitable model.) EXAMPLE 1. Radioactive decay. Although various radioactive elements show marked differences in their rates of decay, they all seem to share a common property-the rate at which a given substance decomposesat any instant is proportional to the amount present at that instant. If we denote by y = f(t) the amount present at time t, the derivative y' = J'(t) represents the rate of change of y at time t, and the \\\"law of decay\\\" states that) y' = -ky ,) where k is a positive constant (called the decay constant) whose actual value depends on the particular element that is decomposing. The minus sign comes in because y decreases as t increases, and hence y' is always negative. The differential equation y' = -ky is the mathematical model used for problems concerning radioactive decay. Every solution y = J(t) of this differential equation has the form) (8.13)) J(t) = J(O)e- kt .) Therefore, to determine the amount present at time f, we need to know the initial amount f(O) and the value of the decay constant k. It is interesting to see what information can be deduced from (8.13),without knowing the exact value off(O) or of k. First we observe that there is no finite time t at which J(t) will be zero because the exponential e- kt never vanishes. Therefore, it is not useful to study the \\\"total lifetime\\\" of a radioactive substance. However, it is possible to determine the time required for any particular fraction of a sample to decay. The fraction \\037is usually chosen for convenience and the time T at which f( T)I.f(O)= \\037is called the half-life of the substance. This can be determined by solving the equation e- k l' = \\037for T. Taking logarithms, we get -kT = -log 2 or T = (log 2)/k. This equation relates the half-life to the decay constant.

Figure 8.1 illustrates the general shape of a radioactive decay curve.) EXAMPLE 2. Palling body in a resisting medium. A body of mass m is dropped from rest from a great height in the earth's atmosphere. Assume that it falls in a straight line and that the only forces acting on it are the earth's gravitational attraction (mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity, assumed to be constant) and a resisting force (due to air resistance) which is proportional to its velocity. It is required to discuss the resulting motion. Let s = f(t) denote the distance the body has fallen at time t and let v = s' = f' (t) denote its velocity. The assumption that it falls from rest means that f'(O) = O. There are two forces acting on the body, a downward force mg (due to its weight) and an upward force -kv (due to air resistance), wherek is some positive constant. Newton's second law states that the net sum of the forces acting on the body at any instant is equal to the product of its mass m and its acceleration. If we denote the acceleration at time t by a, then a = v' = s\\\" and Newton's law gives us the equation) ma = mg - kv . This can be considered as a second-order differential equation for the displacement s or as a first-order equation for the velocity v. As a first-order equation for v, it is linear and can be written in the form) , k v +-v=g. m) This equation is the mathematical model of the problem. Since v = 0 when t = 0, the))) Some physical problems leading to first-order linear differential equations 315) unique solution of the differential equation is given by the formula) (8.14)) v = e- kt / m itgeku/m du = \\037g (1 _ e- kt / m) .) Note that v \\037 mg/k as t \\037 + 00. If we differentiate Equation (8.14),we find that the acceleration at every instant is a = ge- ktjm . Note that a --+0 as t \\037 + 00. Interpreted physically, this means that the air resistance tends to balance out the force of gravity. Since v = s', Equation (8.14)is itself a differential equation for the displacement s, and it may be integrated directly to give) m g g m2 s = - t + - e -kt/m + c . k k 2) Since s = 0 when t = 0, we find that C = - gm 2 /k 2 and the equation of motion becomes) 2 S = mg t + gm (e-kt / m - 1) . k k 2) If the initial velocity is V o when t = 0, formula (8.14) for the velocity at time t must be replaced by) mg (1 -kt/m ) + -kt/m V = \\037 - e voe.) It is interesting to note that for every initial velocity (positive, negative,or zero),the limiting velocity, as t increases without bound, is mg/k, a number independent of V o . The reader should convince himself, on physical grounds, that this seems reasonable.) EXAMPLE 3. A cooling problem. The rate at which a body changes temperature is pro- portional to the difference between its temperature and that of the surrounding medium. (This is called Ne\\037rton's laB' of cooling.) If y = f(t) is the (unknown) temperature of the body at time t and if M(t) denotes the (known) temperature of the surrounding medium, Newton's law leads to the differential equation) (8.15)) y' = -k[y - M(t)]) or) y' + ky = kM(t) ,) where k is a positive constant. This first-order linear equation is the mathematical model we use for cooling problems. The unique solution of the equation satisfying the initial condition f(a) = b is given by the formula) (8.16)) J(t) = be-kt + e- kl J: kM(u)e kU du .) Consider now a specific problem in which a body cools from 200\\302\\260to 100\\302\\260in 40 minutes while immersed in a medium whose temperature is kept constant, say M(t) = 10\\302\\260.If we))) 316) Introduction to differential equations) measure t in minutes and f(t) in degrees, we have J(O) = 200 and Equation (8.16) gives us) (8.17)) l(t) = 200e- kl + lOke- kl J; e ku du = 200e- kt + 10(1 - e- kt ) = 10 + 190e-kt .) We can compute k from the information thatJ(40) = 100. Putting t = 40 in (8.17), we find 90 = 190e- 40 \\\\ so -40k = log (90/190), k = -lo(log 19 - log9). Next, let us compute the time required for this same material to cool from 200\\302\\260to 100\\302\\260if the temperature of the medium is kept at 5\\302\\260.Then Equation (8.16) is valid with the same constant k but with M(u) = 5. Instead of (8.17),we get the formula) J(t) = 5 + 195e- kt .) To find the time t for which J(t) = 100, we get 95 = 195e- kt , so -kt = log (95/195)= log(19/39),and hence) t = ! (log 39 - log 19)= 40 log 39 - log 19. k log 19 - log 9) From a four-place table of natural logarithms, we find log 39 = 3.6636,log 19= 2.9444, and log 9 = 2.1972 so, with slide-rule accuracy, we get t = 40(0.719)/(0.747) = 38.5 minutes. The differential equation in (8.15) tells us that the rate of cooling decreases considerably as the temperature of the body begins to approach the temperature of the medium. To illustrate, let us find the time required to cool the same substance from 100\\302\\260to 10\\302\\260with the medium kept at 5\\302\\260.The calculation leads to log (5/95)= -kt, or) t = ! log 19= 40 Jog 19 = 40(2.944) = 158minutes. k log 19 - log 9 0.747) Note that the temperature drop from 100\\302\\260to 10\\302\\260takes more than four times as long as the change from 200\\302\\260to 100\\302\\260.) EXAMPLE 4. A dilution problem. A tank contains 100 gallons of brine whoseconcentration is 2.5 pounds of salt per gallon. Brine containing 2 pounds of salt per gallon runs into the tank at a rate of 5 gallons per minute and the mixture (kept uniform by stirring) runs out at the same rate. Find the amount of salt in the tank at every instant. Let y = J(t) denote the number of pounds of salt in the tank at time t minutes after mixing begins. There are two factors which cause y to change, the incoming brine which brings salt in at a rate of 10 pounds per minute and the outgoing mixture which removes salt at a rate of 5(y/l00)pounds per minute. (The fraction y/l00 represents the concentration at time t.) Hence the differential eq uation is) y' = 10 - -loY) or) y' + -l-oY = 10.) This linear equation is the mathematical model for our problem. Since y = 250 when))) Son1e physical problems leading to first-order linear differential equations 317) t = 0, the unique solution is given by the formula) (8.18)) y = 250e- t / 20 + e- t / 20 J: lOe\\\"/ 20 du = 200 + 50e- f/ 20 .) This equation shows that y > 200 for all t and that y \\037 200 as t increases without bound. Hence, the minimum salt content is 200pounds. (This could also have been guessed from the statement of the problem.) Equation (8.18) can be solved for t in terms of y to yield) t = 20 log ( 50 ) . y - 200) This enablesus to find the time at which the salt content will be a given amount y, provided that 200 < y < 250.) EXAMPLE 5. Electric circuits. Figure 8.2(a), page 318,shows an electric circuit which has an electromotiveforce, a resistor, and an inductor connected in series. The electro- motive force produces a voltage which causes an electric current to flow in the circuit. If the reader is not familiar with electric circuits, he should not be concerned.For our purposes, all we need to know about the circuit is that the voltage, denoted by V(t), and the current, denoted by let), are functions of time t related by a differential equation of the form) (8.19)) LI'(t) + RI(t) = V(t).) Here Land R are assumed to be positive constants. They are called, respectively, the inductance and resistanceof the circuit. The differential equation is a mathematical form- ulation of a conservation law known as Kirchhoff's voltage laH', and it serves as a mathe- matical nl0del for the circuit. Those readers unfamiliar with circuits may find it helpful to think of the current as being analogous to water flowing in a pipe. The electromotive force (usually a battery or a generator) is analogous to a pump which causes the water to flow; the resistor is analogous to friction in the pipe, which tends to oppose the flow; and the inductance is a stabilizing influence which tends to oppose sudden changes in the current due to sudden changes in the voltage. The usual type of question concerning such circuits is this: If a given voltage V(t) is impressed on the circuit, what is the resulting current l(t)? Since we are dealing with a first-order linear differential equation, the solution is a routine matter. If 1(0)denotes the initial current at time t = 0, the equation has the solution) J(t) = J(O)e- Rt / L + e-RtlLi t Vi x ) e Rx/ L dx .) An important special case occurs when the impressed voltage is constant, say Vet) = E for all t. In this case, the integration is easy to perform and we are led to the formula) J(t) = \\037 + (J(O) - \\037)e-Rt/L.))) 318) Introduction to differential equations) 1(0)) E / Current when I (0) > Ii) Inductor) E R) E Current when 1(0) = - R \\037) Electromotive force) E Current when 1(0) < - R) 1(0)) t) Resistor) (a)) (b)) FIGURE 8.2 (a) Diagram for a simple seriescircuit. (b) The current resulting from a constant impressed voltage E.) This shows that the nature of the solution depends on the relation between the initial current 1(0) and the quotient E/ R. If 1(0)= E/R, the exponential term is not present and the current is constant, l(t) = E/ R. If 1(0) > E/R, the coefficientof the exponential term is positive and the current decreasesto the limiting value E/ R as t \\037 + 00. If 1(0) < E/R, the current increases to the limiting value E/ R. The constant E/R is called the steady-state current, and the exponential term [/(0) - E/ R]e- Rt / L is called the transient current. Exam- ples are illustrated in Figure 8.2(b).) The foregoing examples illustrate the unifying power and practical utility of differential equations. They show how several different types of physical problems may lead to exactly the same type of differential equation. The differential equation in (8.19) is of special interest because it suggests the possibility of attacking a wide variety of physical problems by electrical means. For example, suppose a physical problem leads to a differential equation of the form) y' + ay = Q ,) where a is a positive constant and Q is a known function. We can try to construct an electric circuit with inductance L and resistance R in the ratio R/ L = a and then try to impress a voltageLQ on the circuit. We would then have an electric circuit with exactly the same mathematical model as the physical problem. Thus, we can hope to get numerical data about the solution of the physical problem by making measurements of current in the electric circuit. This idea has been usedin practice and has led to the development of the analog computer.)))

R) Make a sketch indicating the nature of the graph of 1.) Population growth. In a study of the growth of a population (whether human, animal, or bac- terial), the function which counts the number x of individuals present at time t is necessarily a step function taking on only integer values. Thereforethe true rate of growth dx/dt is zero (when t lies in an open interval where x is constant), or else the derivative dxjdt does not exist (when x jumps from one integer to another). Nevertheless, useful information can often be obtained if we assume that the population x is a continuous function of t with a continuous derivative dxjdt at each instant. We then postulate various \\\"laws of growth\\\" for the population, depending on the factors in the environment which may stimulate or hinder growth. For example, if environment has little or no effect, it seems reasonable to assume that the rate of growth is proportional to the amount present. The simplest kind of growth law takes the form) (8.20)) dx- =kx dt '))) Exercises) 321) where k is a constant that depends on the particular kind of population. Conditions may develop which cause the factor k to change with time, and the growth law (8.20) can be generalized as follows:) (8.21)) dx dt = k(t)x \\302\\267) If, for some reason, the population cannot exceed a certain maximum M (for example,because the food supply may be exhausted), we may reasonably suppose that the rate of growth is jointly proportional to both x and M - x. Thus we have a second type of growth law:) (8.22)) dx- = kx ( M - X ) dt ') where, as in (8.21), k may be constant or, more generally, k may change with time. Technological improvements may tend to increase or decrease the value of M slowly, and hence we can generalize (8.22)even further by allowing M to change with time.) 13. Express x as a function of t for each of the \\\"growth laws\\\" in (8.20) and (8.22) (with k and M both constant).

Derive a formula that generalizes (8.23) of Exercise 13 for the growth law (8.22) when k is not necessarily constant. Express the result in terms of the time to for which X = M/2. 16. The Census Bureau reported the following population figures (in millions) for the United States at ten-year intervals from 1790 to 1950: 3.9, 5.3,7.2,9.6,12.9,17, 23, 31, 39, 50, 63, 76, 92, 108,122,135,150.

State your choice and explain your reasonIng.) 8.8 Linear equations of second order with constant coefficients A differential equation of the form) y\\\" + Pl(X)Y' + P2 (x)y = R(x)) is said to be a linear equation of second order. The functions PI and P 2 which multiply the unknown function Y and its derivative y' are called the coefficients of the equation. For first-order linear equations, we proved an existence-uniqueness theorem and deter- mined all solutions by an explicit formula. Although there is a correspondingexistence- uniqueness theorem for the general second-order linear equation, there is no explicit formula which gives all solutions, except in some special cases. A study of the general linear equation of secondorder is undertaken in Volume II. Here we treat only the case in which the coefficients PI and P 2 are constants. When the right-hand member R(x) is identically zero, the equation is said to be homogeneous. The homogeneous linear equation with constant coefficients was the first differential equation of a general type to be completely solved. A solution was first published by Euler in 1743. Apart from its historical interest, this equation arises in a great variety of applied problems, so its study is of practical importance. Moreover, we can give explicit formulas for all the solutions. Consider a homogeneous linear equation with constant coefficients which we write as follows:) y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 .))) Existence of solutions of the equation y\\\" + b.y = 0) 323) We seek solutions on the entire real axis (- 00, + (0). One solution is the constant function y = O. This is called the trivial solution. We are interested in finding nontrivial solutions, and we begin our study with some special cases for which nontrivial solutions can be found by inspection. I n all these cases, the coefficientof y' is zero, and the equation has the form y\\\" + by = O. We shall find that solving this special equation is tantamount to solving the general case.) 8.9 Existence of solutions of the equation y\\\" + by = 0 EXAMPLE 1. The equation y\\\" = O. Here both coefficients a and b are zero, and we can easily determine all solutions. Assume y is any function satisfying y\\\" = 0 on (- 00, + (0). Then its derivative y' is constant, say y' = C1 . Integrating this relation, we find that y necessarily has the form) y' = CIX + C 2 ,) where CI and C2 are constants. Conversely, for any choice of constants C1 and C2 , the linear polynomial y = CIX + C2 satisfies J'\\\" = 0, so we have found all solutions in this case.) Next we assume that b \\037 0 and treat separately the cases b < 0 and b > O.) EXAMPLE 2. The equation y\\\" + by = 0, u'here b < O. Sinceb < 0, we can write b = -k 2 , where k > 0, and the differential equation takes the form) y\\\" = k 2 ), .) One obvious solution is y = e kX , and another is y = e- kx . From these we can obtain further solutions by constructing linear combinations of the form) y = c1ekX + C2e - kX ,) where CI and C2 are arbitrary constants. It will be shown presently, in Theorem 8.6, that all solutions are included in this formula.) EXAMPLE 3. The equation y\\\" + by = 0, \\037rhere b > O. Here we can write b = k 2 , where k > 0, and the differential equation takes the form) y\\\" = -k 2 y .) Again we obtain some solutions by inspection. One solution is y' = cos kx, and another is y = sin kx. From these we get further solutions by forming linear combinations,) y = CI cos kx + C 2 sin kx ,) where C1 and C 2 are arbitrary constants. Theorem 8.6 will show that this formula includes all solutions.))) 324) Introduction to differential equations) 8.10 Reduction of the general equation to the special case y\\\" + by = 0 The problem of solving a second-order linear equation with constant coefficients can be reduced to that of solving the special cases just discussed. There is a method for doing this that also applies to more general equations. The idea is to consider three functions y, u, and v such that y = uv. Differentiation gives us y' = uv' + u'v, and y\\\" = uv\\\" + 2u'v' + u\\\"v. Now we express the combination y\\\" + ay' + by in terms of u and v. We have) (8.25)) y\\\" + ay' + by = uv\\\" + 2u'v' + u\\\"v + a(uv' + u'v) + buv = (v\\\" + av' + bv)u + (2v' + av)u' + vu\\\".) Next we choose v to make the coefficient of u' zero. This requires that v' = -av/2, so we may choose v = e- ax / 2. For this v we have v\\\" = -av' /2 = a2 v/4, and the coefficient of u in (8.25) becomes) 2 2 4b 2 \\\" + ' +b av aV + b -a v av v = - - - v = v . 424) Thus, Equation (8.25) reduces to) ( 4b - a2 ) y\\\" + ay' + by = u\\\" + 4 u v.) Since v = e- aX / 2, the function v is never zero, so y satisfies the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 if and only if u satisfies u\\\" + !( 4b - a 2 )u = O. Thus, we have proved the following theorem.) THEOREM 8.4. Let y and u be two functions such that y = ue- ax / 2 . Then, on the interval (- 00, + (0), y satisfies the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 if and only if u satisfies the differential equation) \\\" + 4b - a 2 0u u = . 4) This theorem reduces the study of the equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 to the special case y\\\" + by = O. We have exhibited nontrivial solutions of this equation but, except for the case b = 0, we have not yet shown that we have found all solutions.) 8.11 Uniqueness theorem for the equation y\\\" + by = 0 The problem of determining all solutions of the equation y\\\" + by = 0 can be solved with the help of the following uniqueness theorem.) THEOREM 8.5. Assume tH'O functions f and g satisfy the differential equation y\\\" + by = 0 on (- 00, + (0). Assume also that f and g satisfy the initial conditions) f(O) = g(O) ,) f'(O) = g'(O) .) Then f(x) = g(x) for all x.))) Uniqueness theorem for the equation y\\\" + by = 0) 325) Proof Let hex) = f(x) - g(x). We wish to prove that hex) = 0 for all x. We shaH do this by expressing h in terms of its Taylor polynomialapproximations. First we note that h is also a solution of the differential equation y\\\" + by = 0 and satisfies the initial conditions h(O) = 0, h' (0) = O. Now every function y satisfying the differential equation has derivatives of every order on (- 00, + (0) and they can be computed by repeated differentiation of the differential equation. For example, since y\\\" = -by, we have .y'\\\" = -by', and y(4) = -by\\\" = b 2 y. By induction we find that the derivatives of even order are given by) y<2 n ) = (-1 )nbny ,) while those of odd order are y<2n-l) = (- 1)n-1bn-1y'. Since h(O) and h' (0) are both 0, it follows that all derivatives h<n)(o) are zero. Therefore, each Taylor polynomial generated by h at 0 has all its coefficients zero. Now we apply Taylor's formula with remainder (Theorem 7.6), using a polynomial approximation of odd degree 2n - 1,and we find that) hex) = E2n - 1(x) ,) where E 2n - 1(X) is the error term in Taylor's formula. To complete the proof, we show that the error can be made arbitrarily small by taking n large enough. We use Theorem 7.7 to estimate the size of the error term. For this we need estimates for the size of the derivative h<2n). Consider any finite closed interval [- c, c], where c > O. Since h is continuous on this interval, it is bounded there, say Ih(x)1 < M on [-c, c]. Sinceh<2n)(x) = (-1 )nbnh(x), we have the estimate Ih<2 n )(x)1 < M Ibl n on [ -c, c]. Theorem 7.7gives us IE 2n - 1(X)1 < M Ibl n x 2nj(2n)! so, on the interval [-c, c], we have the estimate) (8.26)) M Ibl n x 2n M Ibl n c 2n MA 2n o < I h ex ) I < < =- - (2n)! - (2n)! (2n)! ') where A = Ib1 1/ 2 c. Now we show that Amjln! tends to 0 as 111 \\037 + 00. This is obvious if O < A < l.IfA>l,wemaywrite) \\037\\037 - \\037 . \\037 . . . \\037 . k \\037 1 . . . \\037 <\\037: c \\037 1 r- k) where k < 111. If we choose k to be the greatest integer < A, then A < k + 1 and the last factor tends to 0 as 111 \\037 + 00. Hence A mjl11! tends to 0 as /11 \\037 00, so inequality (8.26) shows that hex) = 0 for every x in [-c, c]. But, since c is arbitrary, it follows that hex) = 0 for all real x. This completes the proof.) Note: Theorem 8.5 tells us that two solutions of the differential equation y\\\" + by = 0 which have the same value and the same derivative at 0 must agree everywhere. The choice of the point 0 is not essential. The same argument shows that the theorem is also true if 0 is replaced by an arbitrary point c. In the foregoing proof, we simply use Taylor poly- nomial approximations at c instead of at O.))) 326) Introduction to differential equations) 8.12 Complete solution of the equation y\\\" + by = 0 The uniqueness theorem enables us to characterize all solutions of the differential equation y\\\" + by = O.) THEOREM 8.6. Given a real number b, define two functions U 1 and U2 on (- 00, + (0) as follows: (a) If b = 0, let ul(x) = 1, u 2 (x) = X. (b) If b < 0, 'ri'rite b = -k 2 and define u 1(x) = e kX , u 2 (x) = e- kx . (c) If b > 0, 'ri'fite b = k 2 and define Ul(X) = cos kx, u 2 (x) = sin kx. Then every solution of the differential equation y\\\" + by = 0 on (- 00, + (0) has the form) (8.27)) y = C1Ul(X) + C 2 U2(X) ,) 'riJhere Cl and C2 are constants.) Proof We proved in Section 8.9 that for each choice of constants Cl and C2 the function y given in (8.27) is a solution of the equation y\\\" + by = O. Now we show that all solutions have this form. The caseb = 0 was settled in Section 8.9, so we may assume that b :;t. O. The idea of the proof is this: Let y = f(x) be any solution of y\\\" + by = O. If we can show that constants C1 and C2 exist satisfying the pair of equations) (8.28)) C1Ul(0) + C2 U 2 (0) = f(O) ,) C l u\\037(0) + C2U\\037(0) = f' (0) ,) then both f and CIU 1 + C 2 U2 are solutions of the differential equation y\\\" + by = 0 having the same value and the same derivative at O. By the uniqueness theorem, it follows that f= C1U I + C 2 U2 . In case (b), we have ul(x) = e kX , u 2 (x) = e- kX , so ul(O) = u 2 (0) = 1 and u\\037(O) = k, u\\037(O) = -k. Thus the equations in (8.28) become C 1 + C 2 = f(O), and C1 - C2 = f'(O)jk. They have the solution C l = tf(O) + If'(O)jk, C 2 = If(O) - !f'(O)jk. In case(c),we have ul(x) = COSkx, u 2 (x) = sin kx, so u 1(0) = 1, U2(0) = 0, u\\037(O) = 0, u\\037(O) = k, and the solutions are C 1 = f(O), and C2 = f'(O)jk. Since Cl and C2 always exist to satisfy (8.28), the proof is complete.) 8.13 Complete solution of the equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 Theorem 8.4 tells us that y satisfies the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 if and only if U satisfies u\\\" + !(4b - a2 )u = 0, where y = e- ax / 2u. From Theorem 8.6 we know that the nature of each solution U depends on the algebraic sign of the coefficientof u, that is, on the algebraic sign of 4b - a2 or, alternatively, of a 2 - 4b. We call the number a 2 - 4b the discriminant of the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 and denote it by d. When we combine the results of Theorem 8.4 and 8.6 we obtain the following.) THEOREM 8.7. Let d = a2 - 4b be the discriminant of the linear differential equation y\\\" + a)/ + by = O. Then every solution of this equation Oil ( - 00, + (0) has the form) (8.29)) y = e-ax/2[C1Ul(X)+ C 2 U2(X)] ,))) Complete solution oj'the equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0) 327) where C 1 and C 2 are constants, and the functions U 1 and U2 are determined according to the algebraic sign of the discriminant as folloH's: (a) If d = 0, then u 1(x) = 1 and u 2 (x) = x. (b) If d > 0, then u 1(x) = ekx and u 2 (x) = e- kx , H'here k = tVd. (c) If d < 0, then u 1(x) = cos kx and u 2 (x) = sin kx, 'ri'here k = -\\037-V - d. Note: In case (b), where the discriminant d is positive, the solution y in (8.29) is a linear combination of two exponential functions,) y = e-aX/2(clel-.X + c 2e- kX ) = ClerlX + c2e r2X ,) where) a -a + W r1 = - 2 + k = 2 ') a -a - W r2 = - 2 - k = 2 .) The two numbers r1 and r2 have sum r 1 + r2 = -a and product r1r2 = !(a 2 - d) = b. Therefore,they are the roots of the quadratic equation) r 2 + ar + b = 0 .) This is called the characteristic equation associated with the differential equation) yll + ayl + by = 0 .) The number d = a2 - 4b is also called the discriminant of this quadratic equation; its algebraic sign determines the nature of the roots. If d > 0, the quadratic equation has real roots given by ( -a :f: W)/2. If d < 0, the quadratic equation has no real roots but it does have complex roots r1 and r 2 . The definition of the exponential function can be ex- tended so that erl X and e r 2x are meaningful when r1and r 2 are complex numbers. This ex- tension, described in Chapter 9, is made in such a way that the linear combination in (8.29) can also be written as a linear combination of er1x and e r2x , when r 1 and r2 are complex. We conclude this section with some miscellaneous remarks. Since all the solutions of the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 are contained in formula (8.29), the linear combination on the right is often called the general solution of the differential equation. Any solution obtained by specializing the constants C 1 and C2 is called a particular solution. For example,taking C 1 = 1, C2 = 0, and then C 1 = 0, C2 = 1, we obtain the two particular solutions) VI = e-aXj2ul(X) ,) V 2 = e-aXj2u2(X) .) These two solutions are of special importance because linear combinations of them give us all solutions. Any pair of solutions with this property is called a basisfor the set of all solutions. A differential equation always has more than one basis. For example, the equation y\\\" = 9y has the basis VI = e 3X , V 2 = e- 3x. But it also has the basis \\037Vl= cosh 3x, H'2 = sinh 3x. In fact, sincee 3x = \\037Vl+ 'ri'2 and e- 3x = H'1 - H/ 2 , every linear combination of e 3x and e- 3.r is also a linear combination of H'1 and \\037f2' Hence, the pair \\037Vl, W2 is another basis. It can be shown that any pair of solutions VI and V 2 of a differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 will be a basis if the ratio V2/Vl is not constant. Although we shall not need))) 328) Introduction to differential equations) this fact, we mention it here because it is important in the theory of second-order linear equations with nonconstant coefficients.

Given two functions U I and U 2 , the function W defined by W (x) = u 1(x)u\\037(x) - U2(X)U\\037(x) is called their Wronskian, after J. M. H. Wronski (1778-1853). The following exercises are concerned with properties of the Wronskian. 21. (a) If the Wronskian W(x) of UI and U 2 is zero for all x in an open interval I, prove that the quotient U 2 !UI is constant on I. In other words, if U 2 !UI is not constant on I, then Wee) '# 0 for at least one e in I. (b) Prove that the derivative of the Wronskian is W' = u1u; - u 2 u; .)))

(b) Assume Ul is not identically zero. Prove that W(O) = 0 if and only if u2/ ul is constant. 23.

Use properties of the Wronskian to prove that constants Cl and C 2 exist such that) ClVl(O) +c 2v t (0) = f(O) ,) ClV\\037(O) + C2V\\037(0) =.('(0) .) (b) Prove that every solution has the form y = ClVl + C2V2' In other words, VI and V2 form a basis for the set of all solutions.) 8.15 Nonhomogeneouslinear equations of second order with constant coefficients We turn now to a discussionof nonhomogeneous equations of the form) (8.30)) y\\\" + ay' + by = R ,) where the coefficients a and b are constants but the right-hand member R is any function continuous on (- 00, + (0). The discussion may be simplified by the use of operator notation. For any function f with derivatives f' and f\\\", we may define an operator L which transforms finto another function L(f) definedby the equation) L(f) = f\\\" + af' + bf .) In operator notation, the differential equation (8.30) is written in the simpler form) L(y) = R .) It is easy to verify that L(YI + )'2) = L(Yl) + L(Y2), and that L(cy) = cL(y) for every constant c. Therefore, for every pair of constants C l and C 2 , we have) L(ClYl + C 2Y2) = clL(Yl) + c2 L(Y2) .) This is called the linearity property of the operator L. Now suppose}'l and Y2 are any two solutions of the equation L(y) = R. Since L(Yl) = L(Y2) = R, linearity gives us) L(Y2 - Yl) = L(Y2) - L(Yl) = R - R = 0 ,) so Y2 - Yl is a solution of the homogeneous equation L(y) = O. Therefore, we must have Y2 - Yl = ClVl + C2 V 2 , where ClVl + C2 V 2 is the general solution of the homogeneous equation, or) Y2 = ClVl + C2 V 2 + }'l .))) 330) Introduction to differential equations) This equation must be satisfied by every pair of solutions Yl and Y2 of the nonhomogeneous equation L(y) = R. Therefore, if we can determine one particular solution Yl of the non- homogeneous equation, all solutions are contained in the formula) (8.31 )) Y = ClVl + C2 V 2 + Yl ,) where Cl and C2 are arbitrary constants. Each such y is clearly a solution of L(y) = R because L(ClV l + C 2 V 2 + Yl) = L(ClV l + C 2 V 2 ) + L(Yl) = 0 + R = R. Since all solutions of L(y) = R are found in (8.31), the linear combinationClV l + C 2 V 2 + Yl is called the general solution of (8.30). Thus, we have proved the following theorem.) THEOREM 8.8. If Yl is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation L(y) = R, the general solution is obtained by adding to Yl the general solution of the corresponding homogeneous equation L(y) = O.) Theorem 8.7 tells us how to find the general solution of the homogeneous equation L(y) = O. It has the form y = ClV l + C2V2 , where) (8.32)) Vl(X) = e\\037aXj2ul(X) ,) V 2 (X) = e-aXj2u2(X) ,) the functions Ul and U 2 being determined by the discriminant of the equation, as described in Theorem 8.7. Now we show that VI and V 2 can be used to construct a particular solution Yl of the nonhomogeneous equation L(y) = R. The construction involves a function W defined by the equation) W(x) = Vl(X)V\\037(x) - V2(X)V\\037(x) .) This is called the Wronskian of VI and V 2 ; some of its properties are described in Exercises 21 and 22 of Section8.14. We shall need the property that W(x) is never zero. This can be proved by the methods outlined in the exercises or it can be verified directly for the particular functions VI and V 2 given in (8.32).) THEOREM 8.9. Let VI and V 2 be the solutions of the equation L(y) = 0 given by (8.32), where L(y) = y\\\" + ay' + by. Let W denote the Wronskian of VI and v 2 . Then the non- homogeneous equation L(y) = R has a particular solution Yl given by the formula) Yl(X) = tl(X)Vl(x) + t 2 (X)V 2(x) ,) where) (8.33)) f R(x) tl(x) = - v 2 (x) - dx , W(x)) f R(x) t 2 (x) = vl(x) dx . W(x)) Proof Let us try to find functions t l and t 2 such that the combination Yl = tlv l + t 2 V 2 will satisfy the equation L(Yl) = R. We have) I I I ( , I )Y = tlv l + t2 v 2 + tlv l + t 2 v 2 ') y\\037 = tlV\\037 + t2V\\037 + (t\\037v\\037+ t\\037v\\037)+ (t\\037Vl + t\\037V2)' .))) Nonhomogeneous linear equations of second order with constant coefficients 331) When we form the linear combination L(Yl) = Y\\037 + ay\\037 + bYI , the terms involving t 1 and t 2 drop out because of the relations L(v 1) = L(v 2 ) = O. The remaining terms give us the relation) L(Yl) = (t\\037v\\037+ t\\037v\\037)+ (t\\037Vl + t\\037V2)' + a(t\\037vl + t\\037V2) .) We want to choose t 1 and t2 so that L(Yl) = R. We can satisfy this equation if we choose t 1 and t2 so that) t;Vl + t\\037V2 = 0) and) t ' , + \\\" RI V I t 2 v 2 = .) This is a pair of algebraic equations for t\\037and t\\037. The determinant of the system is the Wronskian of VI and v 2 . Since this is never zero, the system has a solution given by) t\\037= -v 2R/W) and) t\\037= v I R/W.) Integrating these relations, we obtain Equation (8.33), thus completing the proof.) The method by which we obtained the solution Yl is sometimes called variation ofparam- eters. It was first used by Johann Bernoulli in 1697 to solve linear equations of first order, and then by Lagrange in 1774 to solve linear equations of secondorder.) Note: Since the functions t 1 and t2 in Theorem 8.9 are expressed as indefinite integrals, each of them is determined only to within an additive constant. If we add a constant Cl to t 1 and a constant C 2 to t 2 we change the function Yl to a new function Y2 = Yl + C1V1 + C 2 V2 . By linearity, we have) L(Y2) = L(Yl) + L(C1V2 + C2V2) = L(Yl) ,) so the new function Y2 is also a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation.) EXAMPLE 1. Find the general solution of the equation y\\\" + Y = tan x on (-77'/2, 77'/2).) Solution. The functions VI and V 2 of Equation (8.32) are given by) v 1(x) = cos X ,) v 2(x) = sin x .) Their Wronskian is W(x) = Vl(X)V\\037(x) - V2(X)V\\037(x) = cos 2 x + sin2 x = 1. Therefore Equa- tion (8.33)gives us) t 1(x) = - f sin x tan x dx = sin x - logIseex + tan xl ,) and) t 2 (x) = J eos x tan x dx = f sin x dx = -cos x .) Thus, a particular solution of the nonhomogeneousequation is) Yl = t 1(X)V 1(x) + t 2(X)V 2 (x) = sin x cos x - cosx log Isec x + tan xl - sin x cos x = -cas x log Isecx + tan xl .))) 332) Introduction to differential equations) By Theorem 8.8, its general solution is) Y = C l cos x + C2 sin x - cos x logIsecx + tan xl.) Although Theorem 8.9 provides a general method for determining a particular solution of L(y) = R, special methods are available that are often easier to apply when the function R has certain specialforms. In the next section we describe a method that works when R is a polynomial or a polynomial times an exponential.) 8.16 Special methods for determining a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous equation y\\\" + ay' + by = R CASE 1. The right-hand member R is a polynomial of degreen. If b =fi. 0, we can always find a polynomial of degree n that satisfies the equation. We try a polynomial of the form) n Yl(X) = L akx k k=O) with undetermined coefficients. Substituting in the differential equation L(y) = Rand equating coefficients of like powers of x, we may determine an, a n - l , . . . , al ,ao in succession. The method is illustrated by the following example.) EXAMPLE 1. Find the general solution of the equation y\\\" + Y = x 3 .) Solution. The general solution of the homogeneous equation y\\\" + Y = 0 is given by y = C l COS x + C2sin x. To this we must add one particular solutionof the nonhomogeneous equation. Since the right member is a cubic polynomial and since the coefficient of y is nonzero, we try to find a particular solution of the form Yl(X) = Ax 3 + BX2 + Cx + D. Differentiating twice, we find that y\\\"(x) = 6Ax + 2B. The differential equation leads to the relation) (6Ax + 2B) + (Ax3 + BX2 + Cx + D) = x 3 .) Equating coefficients of like powers of x, we obtain A = 1, B = 0, C = - 6,and D = 0, so a particular solution is Yl(X) = x 3 - 6x. Thus, the general solution is) y = C I COS x + C2 sin x + x 3 - 6x .) It may be of interest to compare this method with variation of parameters. Equation (8.33)gives us tl(X) = - f x 3 sin x dx = -(3x 3 - 6) sin x + (x 3 - 6x) cos x) and) tlx) = f x3cos x dx = (3x 2 - 6) cos x + (x 3 - 6x) sin x .) When we form the combination tlv l + t 2V 2 , we find the particular solution Yl(X) = x 3 - 6x, as before. In this case, the use of variation of parameters required the evaluation of the))) Exercises) 333) integrals fx 3 sin x dx and fx 3 cos x dx. With the method of undetermined coefficients, no integration is required.) If the coefficient b is zero, the equation y\\\" + ay' = R cannot be satisfied by a polynomial of degree 11, but it can be satisfied by a polynomial of degree 11 + I if a -:F= O. I f both a and b are zero, the equation becomes y\\\" = R; its general solution is a polynomial of degree n + 2 obtained by two successive integrations.) CASE 2. The right-hand menlber has the form R(x) = p(x)e mx , lrhere p is a polynolnial of degreen, and m is constant. In this case the change of variable y = u(x)emJ' transforms the differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = R to a new equation, u\\\" + (2m + a)u' + (In 2 + am + b)u = p .) This is the type discussed in Case I so it always has a polynomial solution u 1 . Hence, the original equation has a particular solution of the form Y1 = u 1(x)e rnx , where U1 is a poly- nomial. If m 2 + anl + b -:F= 0, the degree of U 1 is the same as the degree of p. If In 2 + aln + b = 0 but 2nl + a -:F= 0, the degree of U 1 is one greater than that of p. If both m 2 + am + b = 0 and 2nl + a = 0, the degree of U1 is two greater than the degree of p.) EXAMPLE 2. Find a particular solution of the equation y\\\" + Y = xe 3x .) Solution. The change of variable y = ue 3x leads to the new equation u\\\" + 6u' + IOu = x. Trying u 1(x) = Ax + B, we find the particular solution u 1(x) = (5x - 3)/50, so a particular solution of the original equation is Y1 = e3 J'(5x - 3)/50.

Simple harmonic motion. Suppose a particle is constrained to move in a straight line with its acceleration directed toward a fixed point of the line and proportional to the displacement from that point. If we take the origin as the fixed point and let y be the displacementat time x, then the acceleration y\\\" must be negative when y is positive, and positive when y is negative. Therefore we can write y\\\" = -k 2 y, or) y\\\" + k 2 y = 0 ,) where k 2 is a positive constant. This is called the differential equation of simple harmonic motion. It is often used as the mathematical model for the motion of a point on a vibrating mechanism such as a plucked string or a vibrating tuning fork. The same equation arises in electric circuit theory where it is called the equation of the harmonic oscillator. Theorem 8.6 tells us that all solutions have the form) (8.34)) y = A sin kx + Bcoskx ,) where A and B are arbitrary constants. We can express the solutions in terms of the sine or cosine alone. For example, we can introduce new constants C and If..., where) c = vi A 2 + B 2'\\\" and) B If... = arctan - A') then we have (see Figure 8.4) A = C COS If..., B = C sin If..., and Equation (8.34) becomes) y = C cos If... sin kx + C sin If... cos kx = C sin (kx + If...) .) When the solution is written in this way, the constants C and If... have a simple geometric interpretation (see Figure 8.5). The extreme values of y, which occur when sin (kx + If...) = :f: 1, are :f:C. When x = 0, the initial displacement is C sin If.... As x increases, the particle oscillatesbetween the extreme values + C and - C with period 21T/k.

EXAMPLE 2. Damped vibrations. If a particle undergoing simple harmonic motion is suddenly subjected to an external force proportional to its velocity, the new motion satisfies a differential equation of the form) y\\\" + 2cy' + k 2 y = 0 ,) where c and k 2 are constants, c =fi. 0, k > O. If c > 0, we will show that all solutions tend to zero as x ---+ + 00. In this case, the differential equation is said to be stable. The external force causes damping of the motion. If c < 0, we will show that some solutions have arbitrarily large absolute values as x ---+ + 00. In this case, the equation is said to be unstable. Since the discriminant of the equation is d = (2C)2 - 4k 2 = 4(c 2 - k2 ), the nature of the solutions is determined by the relative sizes of c2 and k 2 . The three cases d = 0, d > 0, and d < 0 may be analyzed as follows: (a) Zero discriminant: c 2 = k 2. In this case, all solutions have the form) y = e-CX(A + Bx).) If c > 0, all solutions tend to 0 as x ---+ + 00. This case is referred to as critical damping. If B =fi. 0, each solution will change sign exactly once because of the linear factor A + Ex. An example is shown in Figure 8. 6(a). If c < 0, eachnontrivial solution tends to + 00 or to - 00 as x ---+ + 00. (b) Positive discriminant: c 2 > k 2. By Theorem 8.7 all solutions have the form) y = e-CX(Ae hX + Be- hX ) = Ae(h-c)X + Be-(h+c)x,) where h = !Vd = V c 2 - k 2 . Since h 2 = c2 - k 2 , we have h 2 - c 2 < 0 so (h - c)(h+ c) < O. Therefore, the numbers h - c and h + c have opposite signs. If c > 0, then h + c is positive so h - c is negative, and hence both exponentials e(h-c)X and e-(h+c)x tend to zero as x ---+ + 00. In this case, referred to as overcritical damping, all solutions tend to 0 for large x. An example is shown in Figure 8.6(a). Each solution can change sign at most once. If c < 0, then h - c is positive but h + c is negative. Thus, both exponentials e(h-c)X))) 336) Introduction to differential equations) and e-(h+c)X tend to + 00 for large x, so again there are solutions with arbitrarily large absolute values. (c) Negative discriminant: c 2 < k 2 . In this case, all solutions have the form) y = Ce- CX sin (hx + If..) ,) where h = t v=d = Vk 2 - c 2 . If c > 0, every nontrivial solution oscillates, but the amplitude of the oscillation decreases to 0 as x \\037 + 00. This case is called undercritical damping and is illustrated in Figure 8.6(b).

EXAMPLE 3. Electric circuits. If we insert a capacitor in the electric circuit of Example 5 in Section 8.6, the differential equation which serves as a model for this circuit is given by) Ll'(t) + RI(t) + \\037 f l(t) dt = V(t),) where C is a positive constant called the capacitance.

The current is said to be critically damped when the discriminant is zero (CR2 = 4L), overcritically damped when the discriminant is positive (CR2> 4L), and undercritically damped when the discriminant is negative (CR2 < 4L).) EXAMPLE 4. Motion of a rocket \\\\rith rariable 111ass. A rocket is propelled by burning fuel in a combustion chamber, allowing the products of combustion to be expelledbackward. Assume the rocket starts from rest and moves vertically upward along a straight line. Designatethe altitude of the rocket at time t by r(t), the mass of the rocket (including fuel) by 111(t), and the velocity of the exhaust matter, relative to the rocket, by e(t). In the absence of external forces, the equation) (8.35)) m(t)r\\\"(t) = m'(t)e(t)) is used as a mathematical model for discussing the motion. The left member, 111(t)r\\\"(t), is the product of the mass of the rocket and its acceleration. The right member, In'(t)e(t), is the acceleratingforce on the rocket caused by the thrust developed by the rocket engine. In the examples to be considered here, In(t) and e(t) are known or can be prescribed in terms of r(t) or its derivative r'(t) (the velocity of the rocket). Equation (8.35) then becomes a second-order differential equation for the position function r. If external forces are also present, such as gravitational attraction, then, instead of (8.35), we use the equation) (8.36)) In(t)r\\\"(t) = 111'(t)e(t)+ F(t) ,) where F(t) represents the sum of all external forces acting on the rocket at time t. Before we consider a specific example, we will give an argument which may serve to motivate the Equation (8.35). For this purpose we consider first a rocket that fires its exhaust matter intermittently, like bullets from a gun, Specifically, we consider a time interval [I, t + h], where h is a small positive number; we assume that some exhaust matter is expelled at time t, and that no further exhaust matter is expelled in the half-open interval (t, t + h]. On the basis of this assumption, we obtain a formula whose limit, as h --+ 0, is Equation (8.35). Just before the exhaust material is expelled at time t, the rocket has mass met) and velocity vet). At the end of the time interval [t, t + h], the rocket has mass met + h) and velocity vet + h). The mass of the expelled matter is met) - In(t + h), and its velocity during the interval is vet) + e(t), since e(t) is the velocity of the exhaust relative to the rocket. Just before the exhaust material is expelled at time t, the rocket is a system with momentum 111(t)r(t). At time t + h, this system consists of two parts, a rocket with momentum met + h)v(t + h) and exhaust matter with momentum [met) - met + h)][v(t) + e(t)]. The law of conservation of momentum states that the momentum of the new system must be equal to that of the old. Therefore, we have) m(t)v(t) = met + h)v(t + h) + [met) - met + h)][v(t) + c(t)] ,) from which we obtain) met + h)[v(t + h) - vet)] = [met + h) - m(t)]c(t).))) 338) Introduction to differential equations) Dividing by h and letting h \\037 0, we find that) m(t)v'(t) = m'(t)c(t) ,) which is equivalent to Equation (8.35). Considera special case in which the rocket starts from rest with an initial weight of w pounds (including b pounds of fuel) and moves vertically upward along a straight line. Assume the fuel is consumedat a constant rate of k pounds per secondand that the products of combustion are dischargeddirectly backward with a constant speed of c feet per second relative to the rocket. Assume the only external force acting on the rocket is the earth's gravitational attraction. We want to know how high the rocket will travel before all its fuel is consumed. Sinceall the fuel is consumed when kt = b, we restrict t to the interval 0 < t < bjk. The only external force acting on the rocket is -m(t)g, the velocity c(t) = -c, soEquation (8.36) becomes) m(t)r\\\"(t) = -m'(t)c - m(t)g .) The weight of the rocket at time tis w - kt, and its mass met) is (w - kt)jg; hence we have m'(t) = -kjg and the foregoingequation becomes) m' ( t) kc r\\\"(t) = - - c - g = - g. met) w - kt) Integrating, and using the initial condition r'(O) = 0, we find) w - kt r'(t) = -c log - gt . w) Integrating again and using the initial condition reO) = 0, we obtain the relation) ( ) c( w - kt) I w - kt 1 2 +r t = og - - gt ct . k w 2) All the fuel is consumed when t = bjk. At that instant the altitude is) (8.37)) r ( \\037 ) = c(w - b) log w - b _ ! gb 2 + cb . k k w 2 k 2 k) This formula is valid if b < W. For some rockets, the weight of the carrier is negligible compared to the weight of the fuel, and it is of interest to consider the limiting case b = W. We cannot put b = win (8.37) because of the presence of the term log (w - b)jw. However, if we let b \\037 w, the first term in (8.37) is an indeterminate form with limit O. Therefore, when b \\037 w, the limiting value of the right member of (8.37) is) . ( b ) 1 gw 2 ClV 1 2 hm r - = - - 2 + - = - - gT + cT, b-+w k 2 k k 2) where T = wjk is the time required for the entire weight w to be consumed.))) Remarks concerning nonlinear differential equations) 339) 8.19 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 5, a particle is assumed to be moving in simple harmonic motion, accord- ing to the equation y = C sin (kx + rx). The velocity of the particle is defined to be the derivative y'. The frequency of the motion is the reciprocal of the period. (Period = 27Tlk; frequency = kI27T.) The frequency represents the number of cycles completed in unit time, provided k > O. 1.

Assume that the only external force acting on it is the action of gravity, and that it falls along a straight line toward the center of the earth. The effect of gravity is partly overcome by firing a rocket directly downward. The rocket fuel is consumed at a constant rate of k pounds per secondand the exhaust material has a constant speed of c feet per secondrelative to the rocket.

Find the distance traveled at time t. 12. Solve Exercise 11if the initial speed of the rocket is Vo and if the products of combustion are fired at such a speed that the discharged material remains at rest in space.) 8.20 Remarks concerning nonlinear differential equations Since second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients occur in such a wide variety of scientificproblems, it is indeed fortunate that we have systematicmethods))) 340) Introduction to differential equations) for solving these equations. Many nonlinear equations also arise naturally from both physical and geometrical problems, but there is no comprehensive theory comparable to that for linear equations. In the introduction to this chapter we mentioned a classic \\\"bag of tricks\\\" that has been developed for treating many special cases of nonlinear equations. We conclude this chapter with a discussion of some of these tricks and some of the problems they help to solve. We shall consider only first-order equations which can be solved for the derivative y' and expressed in the form) (8.38)) y' = f(x, y) .) We recall that a solution of (8.38)on an interval I is any function, say y = Y(x), which is differentiable on I and satisfies the relation Y'(x)= f[x, Y(x)] for all x in I. In the linear case, we proved an existence-uniqueness theorem which tells us that one and only one solution exists satisfying a prescribed initial condition. Moreover, we have an explicit formula for determining this solution. This is not typical of the general case. A nonlinear equation may have no solution satisfying a given initial condition, or it may have more than one. For example, the equation (y')2 - xy' + y + 1 = 0 has no solution with y = 0 when x = 0, since this would require that (y')2 = -1 when x = O. On the other hand, the equationy' = 3 y 2/3 has two distinct solutions, Y 1(x) = 0 and Y 2 (x) = x 3 , satisfying the initial condition y = 0 when x = O. Thus, the study of nonlinear equations is more difficult because of the possible non- existenceor nonuniqueness of solutions. Also, even when solutions exist, it may not be possible to determine them explicitly in terms of familiar functions. Sometimes we can eliminate the derivative y' from the differential equation and arrive at a relation of the form) F(x,y) = 0) satisfied by some, or perhaps all, solutions. If this equation can be solved for y in terms of x, we get an explicit formula for the solution. More often than not, however, the equation is too complicated to solve for y. For example, in a later section we shall study the differential equation) , y-x y = , y+x) and we shall find that every solution necessarily satisfies the relation) (8.39)) ! log (x 2 + y2) + arctan \\037+ C = 0 2 x) for some constant C. It would be hopelessto try to solve this equation for y in terms of x. In a caselike this, we say that the relation (8.39)is an implicit formula for the solutions. It is commonpractice to say that the differential equation has been \\\"solved\\\" or \\\"integrated\\\" when we arrive at an implicit formula such as F(x, y) = 0 in which no derivatives of the unknown function appear. Sometimes this formula reveals useful information about the solutions. On the other hand, the reader should realize that such an implicit relation may be less helpful than the differential equation itself for studying properties of the solutions.))) Integral curvesand direction fields) 341) In the next section we show how qualitative information about the solutions can often be obtained directly from the differential equation without a knowledge of explicit or implicit formulas for the solutions.) 8.21 Integral curves and direction fields Consider a differential equation of first order, say y' = f(x, y), and suppose some of the solutions satisfy an implicit relation of the form) (8.40)) F(x, y, C) = 0 ,) where C denotes a constant. If we introduce a rectangular coordinate system and plot all the points (x, y) whose coordinates satisfy (8.40) for a particular C, we obtain a curve called an integral curve of the differential equation. Different values of C usually give different integral curves, but all of them share a common geometric property. The differential equation y' = f(x, y) relates the slope y' at each point (x, y) of the curve to the coordinates x and y. As C takes on all i\\037s values, the collection of integral curves obtained is called a one-parameter family of curves. For example, when the differential equation is y' = 3, integration gives us y = 3x + C, and the integral curves form \\037family of straight lines, all having slope 3. The arbitrary constant C represents the y-intercept of these lines. If the differential equation is y' = x, integration yieldsy = ix2 + C, and the integral curves form a family of parabolas as shown in Figure 8.7. Again, the constant C tells us where the various curves cross the y-axis. Figure 8.8 illustrates the family of exponential) y) FIGURE 8.7 Integral curves of the differ- ential equation y' = x.) y) x) FIGURE 8.8 Integral curves of the differential equation y' = y.))) 342) Introduction to differential equations) curves, y = Ce x , which are integral curves of the differential equation y' = y. Once more, C represents the y-intercept. In this case, C is also equal to the slope of the curve at the point where it crosses the y-axis. A family of nonparallel straight lines is shown in Figure 8.9. These are integral curves of the differential equation) (8.41)) y = x d y _ !

This family is one which possesses an envelope, that is, a curve having the property that at each of its points it is tangent to one of the members of the family.t The envelopehere is y = x 2 and its graph is indicated by the dotted curve in Figure 8.9. The envelope of a family of integral curves is itself an integral curve because the slope and coordinates at a point of the envelope are the same as those of one of the integral curves of the family. In this example, it is easy to verify directly that y = x 2 is a solution of (8.41). Note that this particular solution is not a member of the family in (8.42). Further solutions, not members of the family, may be obtained by piecing together members of the family with portions of the envelope. An example is shown in Figure 8.10. The tangent line at A comes from taking C = -2 in (8.42) and the tangent at B comes from C =!. The resulting solution, y = f(x), is given as follows:) { -2X - 1 I(x) = \\037X 2 __L 2 16) if x < - 1- , if - 1 < x < t , if x > ! .) t And conversely, each member of the family is tangent to the envelope.))) Integral curves and direction fields) 343) This function has a derivative and satisfies the differential equation in (8.41) for every real x. It is clear that an infinite number of similar examplescould be constructed in the same way. This example shows that it may not be easy to exhibit all possible solutions of a differential equation. Sometimes it is possible to find a first-order differential equation satisfied by all members of a one-parameter family of curves. We illustrate with two examples.) EXAMPLE 1. Find a first-order differential equation satisfied by all circles with center at the origin.) Solution. A circle with center at the ongIn and radius C satisfies the equation x 2 + y2 = C2. As C varies over all positive numbers, we obtain every circle with center at the origin. To find a first-order differential equation having these circles as integral curves, we simply differentiate the Cartesian equation to obtain 2x + 2yy' = O. Thus, each circle satisfiesthe differential equation y' = -x/yo) EXAMPLE 2. Find a first-order differential equation for the family of all circles passing through the origin and having their centers on the x-axis.) Solution. If the center of a circle is at (C, 0) and if it passes through the origin, the theorem of Pythagoras tells us that each point (x, y) on the circle satisfies the Cartesian equation (x - C)2 + y2 = C2, which can be written as) (8.43)) x2 + y2 - 2Cx= 0 .) To find a differential equation having these circles as integral curves, we differentiate (8.43) to obtain 2x + 2yy' - 2C = 0, or) (8.44)) x + yy' = C .) Since this equation contains C, it is satisfied only by that circle in (8.43) corresponding to the same C. To obtain one differential equation satisfied by all the curves in (8.43), we must eliminate C. We could differentiate (8.44) to obtain 1 + yy\\\" + (y')2 = O. This is a second-orderdifferential equation satisfied by all the curves in (8.43). We can obtain a first-order equation by eliminating C algebraically from (8.43) and (8.44). Substituting x + yy' for C in (8.43), we obtain x 2 + y2 - 2x(x+ yy'), a first-order equation which can be solved for y' and written as y' = (y2 - x 2 )/(2xy).) Figure 8.11 illustrates what is called a direction field of a differential equation. This is simply a collection of short line segments drawn tangent to the various integral curves. The particular example shown in Figure 8.11 is a direction field of the equation y' = y. A direction field can be constructed without solving the differential equation. Choose a point, say (a, b),and compute the numberf(a, b) obtained by substituting in the righthand side of the differential equation y' = f(x, y). If there is an integral curve through this point, its slope there must be equal to f(a, b). Therefore, if we draw a short line segment through (a, b) having this slope, it will be part of a direction field of the differential equation. By drawing several of these line segments, we can get a fair idea of the general behavior of the))) 344) Introduction to differential equations) y) / / / / / // / / / //' \\\"'\\\"/' ./ \\\"\\\" ,.\\\"\\\". ---- ---- ---) / /) :::: -- - ---....... --- -- ..............---...

With the aid of the isoclines, construct a direction field for the equation and try to determine the shape of the integral curve passing through the origin. 14. Show that the isoclinesof the differential equation y' = x + y form a one-parameter family of straight lines. Plot the isoclines corresponding to the constant slopes 0, :!:l, :!:1, :!:i, :!:2. With the aid of the isoclines,construct a direction field and sketch the integral curve passing through the origin. One of the integral curves is also an isocline; find this curve.)))

Plot a number of isoclines and construct a direction field for the equation) dy ( dy ) 2 Y = x- + - dx dx) If you draw the direction field carefully, you should be able to determine a one-parameter family of solutions of this equation from the appearance of the direction field.) 8.23 First-order separable equations A first-order differential equation of the form y' = f(x, y) in which the right member f(x,y) splits into a product of two factors, onedependingonx alone and the other depending on y alone, is said to be a separable equation. Examples arey' = x 3 , y' = y, y' = siny log x, y' = xltan y, etc. Thus each separable equation can be expressed in the form) y' = Q(x)R(y) ,) where Q and R are given functions. When R(y) \\037 0, we can divide by R(y) and rewrite this differential equation in the form) A(y)y' = Q(x) ,) where A(y) = 11R(y). The next theorem tells us how to find an implicit formula satisfied by every solution of such an equation.) THEOREM 8.10. Let y = Y(x) be any solution of the separable differential equation) (8.45)) A(y)y' = Q(x)) such that Y' is continuous on an open in terra I I. Assume that both Q and the composite function A 0 Yare continuous on I. Let G be any priJnitire of A, that is, any function such that G' = A. Then the solution Y satisfies the iJnplicit forl11ula) (8.46)) G(y) = J Q(x)dx + C) for some constant C. Conversel}',if}' satisfies(8.46)then y is a solution of (8.45).) Proof SinceY is a solution of (8.45), we must have) (8.47)) A [Y(x)] Y'(x) = Q(x)) for each x in I. Since G' = A, this equation becomes) G'[ Y(x)]Y'(x) = Q(x).) But, by the chain rule, the left member is the derivative of the composite function GoY.))) 346) Introduction to differential equations) Therefore GoY is a primitive of Q, which means that) (8.48)) G[Y(x)] = J Q(x) dx + C) for some constant C. This is the relation (8.46). Conversely, if y = Y(x) satisfies (8.46), differentiation gives us (8.47), which shows that Y is a solution of the differential equation (8.45).) Note: The implicit formula (8.46) can also be expressed in terms of A. From (8.47) we have) J A[ Y(x)] Y'(x)dx = J Q(x) dx + C \\302\\267) If we make the substitution y = Y(x), dy = YI(X) dx in the integral on the left, the equation becomes) (8.49)) J A(y) dy = J Q(x) dx + C.) Since the indefinite integral S A(y) dy represents any primitive of A, Equation (8.49) is an alternative way of writing (8.46). In practice, formula (8.49) is obtained directly from (8.45) by a mechanical process. In the differential equation (8.45) we write dyjdx for the derivative yl and then treat dyjdx as a fraction to obtain the relation A(y) dy = Q(x) dx. Now we simply attach integral signs to both sides of this equation and add the constant C to obtain (8.49). The justification for this mechanical process is provided by Theorem 8.10. This process is another example illustrating the effectiveness of the Leibniz notation.) EXAMPLE. The nonlinear equation xy' + y = y2 is separable since it can be written in the form) (8.50)) y' 1) y(y - 1) x) provided that y(y - 1) \\037 0 and x \\037 O. Now the two constant functions y = 0 and y = 1 are clearly solutions of xy' + Y = y2. The remaining solutions, if any exist, satisfy (8.50) and, hence, by Theorem 8.10 they also satisfy) J dy - J dx + K y(y - 1) x) for some constant K. Since the integrand on the left is l/(y - 1) - lly, when we integrate, we find that) log Iy - 11- log Iyl = log Ixl + K .) This gives us I(y - 1)lyl= Ixl e K or (y - 1)ly = Cx for some constant C. Solving for y, we obtain the explicit formula) (8.51)) 1 y= . 1- Cx))) Homogeneous first-order equations) 347) Theorem 8.10tellsus that for any choice of C this Y is a solution; therefore, in this example we have determined all solutions: the constant functions y = 0 and y = 1 and all the functions defined by (8.51 ). Note that the choice C = 0 gives the constant solution y = 1.) 8.24 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 12, assume solutions exist and find an implicit formula satisfied by the solutions. 1. y' = x3 fy2. 2. tan x cosy = - y' tan y. 3.

This means that) (8.53)) f(tx, ty) = f(x, y)) for all x, y, and all t \\037 O. In other words, replacement of x by tx and y by ty has no effect on the value off(x, y). Equations of the form (8.52) which have this property are called homogeneous(sometimescalled homogeneous of degree zero). Examples are the following:) , y-x y = , y+x) , _ ( x2 + y2) 3 y - , xy) x . x 2 + y2 y' = - sIn 2 2 ' Y x - Y) y' = log x - logy .) If we use (8.53) with t = I/x, the differential equation in (8.52) becomes) (8.54)) Y'=f(l, \\037).))) 348) Introduction to differential equations) The appearance of the quotient yfx on the right suggests that we introduce a new unknown function v where v = yfx. Then y = vx, y' = v' x + v, and this substitution transforms (8.54) into) v'x + v = f(1, v)) or) dv x-=f(l,v)-v. dx) This last equation is a first-order separableequation for v. We may use Theorem 8.10to obtain an implicit formula for v and then replace v by yfx to obtain an implicit formula for y.) EXAMPLE. Solve the differential equation y' = (y - x)f(y + x).) Solution. We rewrite the equation as follows:) , y/x - 1 y = . y/x + 1) The substitution v = yfx transforms this into) dv v - 1 x-= dx v + 1) 1 + v 2 -v= - v + 1) Applying Theorem 8.10, we get) f v f 1 f dx dv + dv = - - + c . 1 + v 2 1 + v 2 x) Integration yields) ! log (1 + v 2 ) + arctan v = -log Ixl + c .) Replacing v by yfx, we have) ! log (x 2 + y2) - ! log x 2 + arctan y = -log Ixl + c , x) and since log x 2 = 2 log lxi, this simplifies to) t log (x 2 + y2) + arctan y = C . x) There are some interesting geometric properties possessedby the solutions of a homo- geneousequation y' = I(x, y). First of all, it is easy to show that straight lines through the origin are isoclines of the equation. We recall that an isocline of y' = f(x, y) is a curve along which the slope y' is constant. This property is illustrated in Figure 8.12 which shows a direction field of the differential equation y' = - 2yfx. The isocline corresponding))) Homogeneous first-order equations) 349) to slope e has the equation -2y/x = e,ory = -lex and is therefore a line of slope -!e through the origin. To prove the property in general, consider a line of slope m through the origin. Then y = mx for all (x, y) on this line; in particular, the point (1, m) is on the line. Suppose now, for the sake of simplicity, that there is an integral curve through each point of the line y = mx. The slope of the integral curve through a point (a, b) on this line is I(a, b) = I(a, ma). If a \\037 0, we may use the homogeneity property in (8.53) to) y) -'\\ x) .\\\"\\\",-.) .........) ...............) FIGURE 8.12 A direction field for the differential equation y' = - 2 y/x. The isoclines are straight lines through the origin.) write f(a, ma) = I( 1, m). In other words, if (a, b) \\037 (0, 0), the integral curve through (a, b) has the same slope.as the integral curve through (1, m). Therefore the line y = mx is an isocline, as asserted. (It can also be shown that these are the only isoclines of a homogeneous equation.) This property of the isoclines suggests a property of the integral curves known as invariance under similarity transformations. We recall that a similarity transformation carries a set S into a new set kS obtained by multiplying the coordinates of each point of S by a constant factor k > O. Every line through the origin remains fixed under a similarity transformation. Therefore, the isoclines of a homogeneous equation do not change under a similarity transformation; hence the appearance of the direction field does not change either. This suggeststhat similarity transformations carry integral curves))) 350) Introduction to differential equations) into integral curves. To prove this analytically, let us assume that S is an integral curve describedby an explicit formula of the form) (8.55)) y = F(x) .) To say that S is an integral curve of y' = f(x,y) means that we have) (8.56)) F'(x) = f(x, F(x))) for all x under consideration. Now choose any point (x, y) on kS. Then the point (x/k, y/k) lies on S and hence its coordinates satisfy (8.55), so we have y/k = F(x/k) or y = kF(x/k). In other words, the curve kS is described by the equation y = G(x), whereG(x)= kF(x/k). Note that the derivative of G is given by) G'(x) = kF' ( \\037) \\302\\267 \\037 = F' (\\037) .) To prove that kS is an integral curve of y' = f(x,y) it will suffice to show that G'(x) = f(x, G(x)) or, what is the same thing, that) (8.57)) F'( \\037) = f( x, kF(\\037) ) .) But if we replace x by x/k in Equation (8.56) and then use the homogeneity property with t = k, we obtain) F'(\\037) =f(\\037,F(\\037)) =f(x,kF(\\037)),) and this proves (8.57). In other words, we have shown that kS is an integral curve whenever Sis. A simple example in which this geometric property is quite obvious is the homogeneous equation y' = -x/y whose integral curves form a one-parameter family of concentric circles given by the equation x 2 + y2 = C. It can also be shown that if the integral curves of a first-order equation y' = f(x, y) are invariant under similarity transformations, then the differential equation is necessarily homogeneous.) 8.26 Exercises) 1. Show that the substitution y = x/v transforms a homogeneous' equation y' = I(x, y) into a first-order equation for v which is separable. Sometimes this substitution leads to integrals that are easier to evaluate than those obtained by the substitution y = xv discussed in the text.

Orthogonaltrajectories. Two curves are said to intersect orthogonally at a point if their tangent lines are perpendicular at that point. A curve which intersects every member of a family of curves orthogonally is called an orthogonal trajectory for the family. Figure 8.13 shows someexamples. Problems involving orthogonal trajectories are of importance in both pure and applied mathematics. For example, in the theory of fluid flow, two orthogonal families of curvesare called the equipotentiallines and the stream lines, respectively. In the theory of heat, they are known as isothermal lines and lines offlow. Suppose a given family of curves satisfies a first-order differential equation, say) (8.58)) y' = f(x,y).) The number f(x, y) is the slope of an integral curve passing through (x, y). The slope of each orthogonal trajectory through this point is the negative reciprocal -II.f(x, y), so the orthogonal trajectories satisfy the differential equation) (8.59)) , 1 y=- . f(x, y)) If (8.58) is separable, then (8.59) is also separable. If (8.58)is homogeneous, then (8.59) is also homogeneous.) EXAMPLE 1. Find the orthogonal trajectories of the family of all circles through the origin with their centers on the x-axis.) Solution. In Example 2 of Section 8.21 we found that this family is given by the Cartesian equation x 2 + y2 - 2Cx= 0 and that it satisfies the differential equation y' = (y2 - x 2 )j(2xy). Replacing the right member by its negative reciprocal, we find that the orthogonal trajectories satisfy the differential equation) , 2xy y = x2 _ y2) This homogeneous equation may be integrated by the substitution y = vx, and it leads to the family of integral curves) x 2 + y2 - 2Cy = 0 .))) 352) Introduction to differential equations) This is a family of circles passing through the origin and having their centers on the y-axis.

In a typical problem of pursuit we seek to determine the curve C2 when the curve C1 is known and some additional piece of information is given concerning P and Q, for example,a relation between their positions or their velocities. When we say that the direction of motion of P is always toward Q, we mean that the tangent line of C2 through P passes through Q. Therefore, if we denote by (x, y) the rectangular coordinates of P at a given instant, and by (X, Y) those of Q at the same instant, we must have) (8.60 )) Y- y Y ' -- . X-x) The additional piece of information usually enables us to consider X and Y as known functions of x and y, in which case Equation (8.60) becomes a first-order differential equation for y. Now we consider a specific example in which this equation is separable.))) Some geometrical and physical problems leading to first-order equations 353) EXAMPLE 2. A point Q moves on a straight line C 1 , and a point P pursues Q in such a way that the distance from P to Q has a constant value k > O. If P is initially not on C 1 , find the curve of pursuit.) Solution. We take C 1 to be the y-axis and place P initially at the point (k, 0). Since the distance from P to Q is k, we must have (X - X)2 + (Y - y)2 = k 2. But X = 0 on C 1 , so we have Y - Y = Vk 2 - x 2 , and the differential equation (8.60) becomes) vi k 2 _ x 2 , Y = . -x) Integrating this equation with the help of the substitution x = k cos t and using the fact that y = 0 when x = k, we obtain the relation) k + Y k 2 - x 2 Y 2 2 Y = k log - k - x \\302\\267 x) The curve of pursuit in this example is called a tractrix; it is shown in Figure 8.14.) Flo'J;v of fluid through an orifice. Suppose we are given a tank (not necessarilycylindrical) containing a fluid. The fluid flows from the tank through a sharp-edged orifice. If there were no friction (and hence no loss of energy) the speed of the jet would be equal to V2gy feet per second, where y denotes the height (in feet) of the surface above the orifice.t (See Figure 8.15.) If Ao denotes the area (in square feet) of the orifice, then A oV 2gy represents the number of cubic feet per second of fluid flowing from the orifice. Becauseof friction, the jet stream contracts somewhatand the actual rate of discharge is more nearly cA oV 2gy , where c is an experimentally determined number called the discharge coefficient. For ordinary sharp-edged orifices, the approximate value of c is 0.60. Using this and taking g = 32, we find that the speed of the jet is 4.8Vyfeet per second, and therefore the rate of discharge of volume is 4.8A ovY cubic feet per second. Let V(y) denote the volume of the fluid in the tank when the height of the fluid is y. If the cross-sectional area of the tank at the height u is A(u), then we have V(y) = f6 A(u) du, from which we obtain dV/dy = A(y). The argument in the foregoing paragraph tells us that the rate of change of volume with respect to time is dV/dt = -4.8A ovy cubic feet per second,the minus sign coming in because the volume is decreasing. By the chain rule we have) dV = dVdY =A ( ) dy dt dy dt Y dt' Combining this with the equation dV/dt = -4.8A o VY, we obtain the differential equation) dy A 1- A(y) dt = -4. 8A o'v y .) t If a particle of mass m falls freely through a distance y and reaches a speed v, its kinetic energy \\037mv2 must be equal to the potential energy mgy (the work done in lifting it up a distance y). Solving for v, we get v = y 2gy.))) 354) Introduction to differential equations) This separable differential equation is used as the mathematical model for problems concerning fluid flow through an orifice.

New types of numbers,calledcomplex numbers, have been introduced to provide solutions to such equations. In this brief chapter we discuss complex numbers and show that they are important in solving algebraic equations and that they have an impact on differential and integral calculus. As early as the 16th century, a symbol vi - 1 was introduced to provide solutions of the quadratic equation x 2 + 1 = O. This symbol, later denoted by the letter i, was regarded as a fictitious or imaginary number which could be manipulated algebraically like an ordinary real number, except that its square was -1. Thus, for example, the quadratic polynomial x 2 + 1 was factored by writing x 2 + 1 = x 2 - i 2 = (x - i)(x+ i), and the solutions of the equation x2 + 1 = 0 were exhibited as x = :1:;,without any concern regarding the meaning or validity of such formulas. Expressions such as 2 + 3i were called complex numbers, and they were used in a purely formal way for nearly 300 years before they were described in a manner that would be considered satisfactory by present-day standards. Early in the 19th century, Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855)and William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) independently and almost simultaneously proposed the idea of defining complex numbers as ordered pairs (a, b) of real numbers endowed with certain special properties. This idea is widely accepted today and is described in the next section.) 9.2 Definitions and field properties) DEFINITION. If a and b are real numbers, the pair (a, b) is called a con-zp/ex number, provided that equality, addition, and multiplication of pairs is definedas follows: (a) Equality: (a, b) = (c, d) means a = c and b = d. (b) Sum: (a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d). (c) Product: (a, b)(c,d) = (ac- bd, ad + bc).) The definition of equality tells us that the pair (a, b) is to be regarded as an ordered pair. Thus, the complex number (2, 3) is not equal to the complex number (3, 2). The numbers 358))) Definitions and field properties) 359) a and b are called components of (a, b). The first component, a, is also called the real part of the complex number; the second component, b, is called the imaginary part. Note that the symbol i = vi - 1 doesnot appear anywhere in this definition. Presently we shall introduce i as a particular complex number which has all the algebraic properties ascribedto the fictitious symbol V - 1 by the early mathematicians. However, before we do this, we will discuss the basic properties of the operations just defined.) THEOREM 9.1. The operations of addition and multiplication of complex numbers satisfy the commutative, associative and distributive la\\037rs. That is, if x, y, and z are arbitrary complex numbers, \\037re have the follo\\037ring. Commutative faa's: x + y = y + x, xy = yx . Associative faa's: x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z, x(}'z)= (xy)z. Distributive la\\037t': x(y + z) = xy + xz .) Proof All these laws are easilyverified directly from the definition of sum and product. For example, to prove the associative law for multiplication, we write x = (Xl' x2 ), y = (YJ , Y2), z = (Zl , Z2) and note that) x(yZ) = (Xl' X 2 )(Y l Zl - )'2 Z 2 , Y l Z2 + Y2Zl) = (Xl(YlZl - Y2 Z 2) - X 2 (Y l Z2 + Y2Zl), X l (Y l Z2 + Y2Zl) + X 2 (Y l Zl - Y2 Z 2)) = \\302\\253XlYl- X2)'2)Zl- (X l Y2 + X 2Yl)Z2, (X l Y2 + X2Yl)Zl + (XlYl - X 2Y2)Z2) = (XlYl - X 2Y2, Xl Y2 + X2Yl)(Zl , Z2) = (xy)z.) The commutative and distributive laws may be similarly proved.) Theorem 9.1 shows that the set of all complex numbers satisfies the first three field axioms for the real number system, as given in Section I 3.2. Now we will show that Axioms 4, 5, and 6 are also satisfied. Since (0, 0) + (a, b) = (a, b) for all complex numbers (a, b), the complex number (0, 0) is an identity element for addition. It is called the zero complex number. Similarly, the complex number (1, 0) is an identity for multiplication because) (a, b)(I, 0) = (a, b)) for all (a, b). Thus, Axiom 4 is satisfied with (0, 0) as the identity for addition and (1, 0) as the identity for multiplication. To verify Axiom 5, we simply note that (-a, -b) + (a, b) = (0, 0), so (-a, -b) is the negative of (a, b). We write -(a, b) for (-a, -b). Finally, we show that each nonzero complex number has a reciprocal relative to the identity element (1, 0). That is, if (a, b) \\037 (0, 0), there is a complexnumber (c, d) such that) (a, b)(c, d) = (1,0).) In fact, this equation is equivalent to the pair of equations) ac - bd = 1,) ad + be = 0 ,))) 360) Complex numbers) which has the unique solution) (9.1 )) a c = , a 2 + b 2) -b d= . a 2 + b 2) The condition (a, b) \\037 (0, 0) ensures that a 2 + b 2 \\037 0, so the reciprocal is well defined. We write (a, b)-lor I/(a, b) for the reciprocal of (a, b). Thus, we have) (9.2)) 1 ( a -b )(a, b) = a 2 + b 2 ' a 2 + b 2 The foregoing discussion shows that the set of all complex numbers satisfies the six field axioms for the real-number system. Therefore, all the laws of algebra deducible from the field axioms also hold for complexnumbers. In particular, Theorems 1.1 through 1.15 of Section I 3.2are all valid for complex numbers as well as for real numbers. Theorem 1.8 tells us that quotients of complex numbers exist. That is, if (a, b) and (c, d) are two complex numbers with (a, b) \\037 (0, 0), then there is exactly one complex number (x, y) such that (a, b)(x,y) = (c,d). In fact, we have (x, y) = (c,d)(a,b)-I.) if (a, b) \\037 (0,0).) 9.3 The complex numbers as an extension of the real numbers Let C denote the set of all complex numbers. Consider the subset Co of C consisting of all complex numbers of the form (a, 0), that is, all complex numbers with zero imaginary part. The sum or product of two members of Co is again in Co. In fact, we have) (9.3)) (a, 0) + (b, 0) = (a + b, 0)) and) (a, O)(b, 0) = (ab, 0) .) This shows that we can add or multiply two numbers in Co by adding or multiplying the real parts alone. Or, in other words, with respect to addition and multiplication, the numbers in Co act exactly as though they were real numbers. The same is true for subtraction and division, since -(a, 0) = (-a, 0) and (b, 0)-1 = (b- 1, 0) if b =;t:. O. For this reason, we ordinarily make no distinction between the real number x and the complex number (x, 0) whose real part is x; we agree to identify x and (x, 0), and we write x = (x, 0). In particular, we write 0 = (0, 0), 1 = (1, 0), -1 = (-1, 0),and so on. Thus, we can think of the complex number system as an extension of the real number system. The relation between Co and the real-number system can be described in a slightly different way. Let R denote the set of all real numbers, and letf denote the function which maps each real number x onto the complex number (x, 0). That is, if x E R, let) f(x) = (x, 0) .) The function f so defined has domain R and range Co, and it maps distinct elements of R onto distinct elements of Co. Because of theseproperties,I is said to establish a one-to-one correspondence between R and Co. The operations of addition and multiplication are preserved under this correspondence. That is, we have) I(a + b) = f(a) + f(b)) and) f(ab) = f(a)/(b) ,) these equations being merely a restatement of (9.3). Since R satisfies the six field axioms,))) The imaginary unit i) 361) the same is true of Co' The two fields R and Co are said to be isomorphic; the function f which relates them as described above is called an isomorphism. As far as the algebraic operations of addition and multiplication are concerned, we make no distinction between isomorphic fields. That is why we identify the real number x with the complex number (x, 0). The complex-number system C is called an extension of the real-number system R because it co\\037tains a subset Co which is isomorphic to R. The field Cocan also be ordered in such a way that the three order axioms of Section I 3.4 are satisfied. In fact, we simply define (x, 0) to be positive if and only if x > O. It is trivial to verify that Axioms 7, 8, and 9 are satisfied, so Co is an ordered field. The isomorphism f described above also preservesorder sinceit maps the positive elements of R onto the positive elements of Co .) 9.4 The imaginary unit i Complex numbers have some algebraic properties not possessed by real numbers. For example, the quadratic equation x 2 + 1 = 0, which has no solution among the real numbers, can now be solved with the use of complex numbers. In fact, the complex number (0, 1)is a solution, since we have) (0, 1)2 = (0, 1)(0, 1) = (0. 0 - 1. 1,0 . 1 + 1 . 0) = (- 1,0) = - 1.) The complex number (0, 1) is denoted by i and is called the imaginary unit. It has the property that its square is - 1, i 2 = -1. The reader can easily verify that (- i)2 = -1, so x = - i is another solution of the equation x2 + 1 = O. Now we can relate the ordered-pair idea with the notation used by the early mathe- maticians. First we note that the definition of multiplication of complex numbers gives us (b, 0)(0, 1) = (0, b), and hence we have) (a, b) = (a, 0) + (0,b) = (a, 0) + (b,O)(O,1).) Therefore, if we write a = (a, 0), b = (b,O), and i = (0, 1), we get (a, b) = a + hi. In other words,we have proved the following.) THEOREM 9.2. Every complex number (a, b) can be expressedin the form (a, b) = a + bi.) The advantage of this notation is that it aids us in algebraic manipulations of formulas involving addition and multiplication. For example, if we multiply a + hi by c + di, using the distributive and associative laws, and replace i2 by -1, we find that) (a + bi)(c + di) = ac - bd + (ad + bc)i,) which, of course, is in agreement with the definition of multiplication. Similarly, to compute the reciprocal of a nonzero complex number a + bi, we may write) 1 a + bi) a - bi) a - bi a 2 + b 2) a a 2 + b 2) bi a 2 + b 2 .) (a + bi)(a - bi)) This formula is in agreement with that given in (9.2).))) 362) Complex numbers) By the introduction of complex numbers, we have gained much more than the ability to solve the simple quadratic equation x 2 + 1 = O. Consider, for example, the quadratic equation ax 2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, c are real and a \\037 O. By completing the square, we may write this equation in the form) ( b ) 2 4ac - b 2 x+- + =0. 2a 4a2) If 4ac - b2 < 0, the equation has the real roots (-b ::I::vi b2 - 4ac)j(2a). If 4ac - b 2 > 0, the left member is positivefor every real x and the equation has no real roots. In this case, however, there are two complex roots, given by the formulas) (9.4)) b . vi 4ac - b 2 r 1 = - - + 1 2a 2a) and) b . vi 4ac - b 2 r 2 = - - - 1 2a 2a) In 1799, Gauss proved that every polynomial equation of the form) a o + a 1x + a2 x 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + anx n = 0 ,) where ao, a 1 , . . . , an are arbitrary real numbers, with an \\037 0, has a solution among the complex numbers if n > 1. Moreover, even if the coefficients ao, a 1 , . . . , an are complex, a solution exists in the complex-number system. This fact is known as the fundamental theorem of algebra.t It shows that there is no need to construct numbers more general than complex numbers to solve polynomialequations with complex coefficients.) 9.5 Geometric interpretation. Modulus and argument Since a complex number (x, y) is an ordered pair of real numbers, it may be represented geometrically by a point in the plane, or by an arrow or geometric vector from the origin to the point (x,y), as shown in Figure 9.1. In this context, the xy-plane is often referred to as the complex plane. The x-axis is called the real axis; the y-axis is the imaginary axis. It is customary to use the words complex number and point interchangeably. Thus, we refer to the point z rather than the point corresponding to the complex number z. The operations of addition and subtraction of complexnumbers have a simple geometric interpretation. If two complex numbers Zl and Z2 are represented by arrows from the origin to Zl and Z2 , respectively, then the sum Zl + Z2 is determined by the parallelogram law. The arrow from the origin to Zl + Z2 is a diagonal of the parallelogram determined by 0, Zl , and Z2 , as illustrated by the example in Figure 9.2. The other diagonal is related to the difference of Zl and Z2' The arrow from Zl to Z2 is parallel to and equal in length to the arrow from 0 to Z2 - Zl ; the arrow in the opposite direction, from Z2 to Zl , is related in the same way to Zl - Z2 .) t A proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra can be found in almost any book on the theory of functions of a complex variable. For example, see K. Knopp, Theory of Functions, Dover Publications, New York, 1945, or E. Hille, Analytic Function Theory, Vol. I, Blaisdell Publishing Co., 1959. A more elementary proof is given in O. Schreier and E. Sperner, Introduction to Modern Algebra and Matrix Theory, Chelsea Publishing Company, New York, 1951.))) Geometric interpretation. Modulus and argument) 363) If (x, y) \\037 (0, 0), we can express x and y in polar coordinates,) x = r cose,) and we obtain) (9.5)) y = r sin e ,) x + iy = r (cos e + i sin e) .) The positive number r, which represents the distance of (x, y) from the origin, is called the modulus or absolutevalue of x + iy and is denoted by Ix + iyl. Thus, we have) Ix + iyl = vi x 2 + y2 .) y) I (x,y) = x + iy I I I I I . lJ..

The polar angle () is called an argument of x + iy. We sayan argument rather than the argument because for a given point (x, y) the angle e is determined only up to multiples of 27T. Sometimes it is desirable to assign a unique argument to a complex number. This may be done by restricting e to lie in a half-open interval of length 27T. The intervals [0, 27T) and (-7T, 7T] are commonly used for this purpose. We shall use the interval (-7T, 7T] and refer to the corresponding e as the principal argument of x + iy; we denote this e by arg (x + iy). Thus, if x + iy \\037 0 and r = Ix + iyl, we define arg (x + iy) to be the unique real e satisfying the conditions) x = r cos e,) y = r sin e,) -7T < e < 7T .) For the zero complex number, we assign the modulus 0 and agree that any real e may be used as an argument. Since the absolute value of a complexnumber z is simply the length of a line segment, it is not surprising to find that it has the usual properties of absolute values of real numbers. For example, we have) Izi > 0) if z \\037 0,) and) IZ I - z21 = IZ 2 - zll \\302\\267))) 364) Complex numbers) Geometrically, the absolute value IZ1 - z21 represents the distance between the points Z1 and Z2 in the complex plane. The triangle inequality) IZ 1 + z21 < IZ 11 + I Z 21) is also valid. In addition, we have the following formulas for absolute values of products and quotients of complexnumbers:) (9.6)) IZ 1 z21 = IZ 111z 21) and) Zl = I Z 1 1 Z2 I Z 21) if Z2 \\037 0 .) If we write Zl = a + bi and Z2 = C + di, we obtain (9.6) at once from the identity) (ac - bd)2 + (bc + ad)2 = (a 2 + b 2 )(c 2 + d 2 ) .) The formula for IZ1/z21 follows from (9.6) if we write Zl as a product,) 21 z] = Z2 - . Z2) If z = x + iy, the complex conjugate of z is the complexnumber z = x - iy. Geometri- cal1y, z represents the reflection of z through the real axis. The definition of conjugate implies that) Zl + Z2 = Zl + Z2 ,) Zl Z 2 = Zl Z 2 ,) Zl/Z2 = Zl/Z2 ,) ZZ = Izl 2 .) The verification of these properties is left as an exercise for the reader. If a quadratic equation with real coefficients has no real roots, its complex roots, given by (9.4), are conjugates. Conversely, if r 1 and r 2 are complex conjugates, say r 1 = rJ.. + if3 and r 2 = rJ.. - if3, where rJ.. and f3 are real, then r1 and r 2 are roots of a quadratic equation with real coefficients. In fact, we have) r1 + r 2 = 2rJ..) and) r 1r 2 = rJ..2 + f32 ,) so) (x - r1)(x - r2 ) = x 2 - (r1 + r2 )x + r 1'2 ,) and the quadratic equation in question is) x 2 - 2rJ..x + rJ..2 + f32 = 0 .)))

We wish this extension to be such that the law of exponents, eae b = e a + b , will be valid for all complex a and b. And, of course, we want e Z to agree with the usual exponential when z is real. There are several equivalent ways to carry out this extension. Before we state the definition of e Z that we have chosen, we shall give a heuristic discussion which will serve as motivation for this definition. If we write z = x + iy, then, if the law of exponentsis to be valid for complex numbers, we must have) e Z = ex+ iy = eXe iy .) Since eX has already been defined when x is real, our task is to arrive at a reasonable definition for e iy when y is real. Now, if e iY is to be a complex number, we may write) (9.7)) e iY = A(y) + iB(y) ,) where A and B are real-valuedfunctions to be determined. Let us differentiate both sides of Equation (9.7), assuming A and B are differentiable, and treating the complex number i as though it were a real number. Then we get) (9.8)) ie iy = A'(y) + iB'(y) .) Differentiating once more, we find that) iy A \\\"( ) + . B\\\"( )-e = y 1 y.) Comparison of this equation with (9.7) shows that A and B must satisfy the equations) A\\\"(y) = -A(y)) and) B\\\"(y) = -B(y) .) In other words, each of the functions A and B is a solution of the differential equation f\\\" + / = O. From the work of Chapter 8, we know that this equation has exactly one solution with specified initial values f(O) and /'(0). If we put y = 0 in (9.7) and (9.8) and use the fact that eO = 1, we find that A and B have the initial values) A(O) = 1,) A'(O) = 0,) and) B(O) = 0,) B' (0) = 1 .) By the uniqueness theorem for second-order differential equations with constant coefficients, we must have) A(y) = cos Y) and) B(y) = siny.) In other words, if e iY is to be a complex number with the properties just described, then we must have eiY = cos y + i sin y. This discussionserves to motivate the following definition.))) Complex exponentials) 367) DEFINITION. If Z = x + iy, }1'e define e Z to be the complex number given by the equation) (9.9) eZ = eX(cos y + i sin y) .) Note that e Z = eX when y = 0; hence this exponential agrees with the usual exponential when z is real. Now we shall use this definition to deduce the law of exponents.) THEOREM 9.3. If a and b are complexnumbers, \\037vehave) (9.10)) eae b = e a + b .) Proof Writing a = x + iy and b = u + iv, we have) e a = eX(cosy + i siny),) e b = eU(cos v + isin v),) so) eae b = eXeU[cos y cos v - sin y sin v + i(cos y sin v + sin y cos v)] .) Now we use the addition formulas for cos (y + v) and sin (y + v) and the law of exponents for real exponentials, and we see that the foregoing equation becomes) (9.11)) eae b = eX+U[cos (y + v) + i sin (y + v)] .) Since a + b = (x + u) + iCy + v), the right member of (9.11) is ea + b . This proves (9.10).) THEOREM 9.4. Every complex number z \\037 0 can be expressed in the form) (9.12) z=re i8 .) }1'here r = Izi and () = arg (z) + 2n1T, n being any integer. This representation is calledthe polar form of z.) Proof If z = x + iy, the polar-coordinate representation (9.5) gives us) z = r( cos () + i sin ()) ,) where r = Izl and () = arg (z) + 2n1T, n being any integer. But if we take x = 0 and)' = 0 in (9.9), we obtain the formula) e i8 = cos () + i sin 0,) which proves (9.12).) The representation of complex numbers in the polar form (9.12) is especiallyuseful in connection with multiplication and division of complexnumbers. For example, if Zl = r 1e i8 and Z2 = r2eieJ>, we have) (9.13 )) Z l Z2 = rlei8r2eieJ> = rlr 2 e i <8+eJ\\302\\273 .))) 368) Complex numbers) Therefore the product of the moduli, r 1'2 , is the modulus of the product Z1Z2 , in agreement with Equation (9.6), and the sum of the arguments, () + 1>, is an admissible argument for the product Z1Z2 . When z = re i8 , repeated application of (9.13) gives us the formula) zn = rne inO = rn(cos nO + i sin nO) ,) valid for any nonnegative integer n. This formula is also valid for negative integers n if we define z-m to be (z-1)mwhen m is a positive integer. Similarly, we have) i8 Z 1 = rle = rl e i (8-cp) , ieJ> Z2 r 2 e r2) so the modulus of Z1/Z2 is r1/r2 and the difference () - 1> is an admissible argument for Z1/Z2 .) 9.8 Complex-valued functions A function f whose values are complex numbers is called a complex-valued function. If the domain off is a set of real numbers, f is called a complex-valued function of a real variable. If the domain is a set of complex numbers, f is called a complex-valued function of a complex variable, or more simply, a function of a complex variable. An example is the exponential function, defined by the equation) fez) = e Z) for all complex z. Most of the familiar elementary functions of calculus, such as the exponential, the logarithm, and the trigonometric functions, can be extended to become functions of a complex variable. (SeeExercises 9 and lOin Section 9.10.) In this more general framework many new properties and interrelationships are often revealed. For example, the complex exponential function is periodic. In fact, if z = x + iy and if n is any integer, we have) eZ+2n1Ti = eX[cos (y + 2n7T) + i sin (y + 2n7T)] = e X( cos y + i sin y) = e Z .) Thus we see that fez + 2n7Ti) = fez), so f has the period 27Ti. This property of the expo- nential function is revealed only when we study the exponential as a function of a complex variable. The first systematic treatment of the differential and integral calculus of functions of a complexvariable was given by Cauchy early in the 19th century. Since then the theory has developed into one of the most important and interesting branches of mathematics. It has become an indispensable tool for physicists and engineers and has connections in nearly every branch of pure mathematics. A discussion of this theory will not be given here. We shall discussonly the rudiments of the calculus of complex-valued functions of a real variable.))) Examples of differentiation and integration formulas) 369) Suppose fis a complex-valued function defined on some interval I of real numbers. For each x in I, the function value f(x) is a complex number, so we can write) f(x) = u(x) + iv(x) ,) where u(x) and vex) are real. This equation determines two real-valued functions u and v called, respectively, the real and imaginary parts off; we write the equation more briefly as f = u + iv. Concepts such as continuity, differentiation, and integration of f may be defined in terms of the correspondingconcepts for u and v, as described in the following definition.) DEFINITION. If f = u + iv, a'e say f is continuous at a point if both u and v are con- tinuous at that point. The derivative off is defined by the equation) f'(x) = u'(x) + iv'(x)) whenever both derivatives u'(x) and v'(x) exist.Similarly, we define the integral of f by the equation) J: f(x) dx = J: u(x)dx + i t vex) dx) \\037fhenever both integrals on the right exist.) In view of this definition, it is not surprising to find that many of the theorems of differ- ential and integral calculus are also valid for complex-valued functions. For example, the rules for differentiating sums, products, and quotients (Theorem4.1)are valid for complex functions. The first and second fundamental theorems of calculus(Theorems5.1and 5.3) as well as the zero-derivative theorem (Theorem 5.2) also hold for complex functions. To illustrate the ease with which these theoremscan be proved, we consider the zero-derivative theorem: Iff'(x) = 0for allx on an open interval I, then f is constant on I.) Proof Write f= u + iv. Since f' = u' + iv', the statement f' = 0 on I means that both u' and v' are zero on I. Hence, by Theorem 5.2, both u and v are constant on I. Thereforef is constant on I.) 9.9 Examples of differentiation and integration formulas In this section we discuss an important example of a complex-valued function of a real variable, namely the function f defined for all real x by the equation) f(x) = etx ,) where t is a fixed complex number. When t is real, the derivative of this function is given by the formulaf'(x) = te tx . Now we prove that this formula is also valid for complex t.))) 370) Complex numbers) THEOREM 9.5. If f(x) = etx for all real x and a fixed complex t, then f'(x) = te tx .) Proof Write t = rx + if3, where rx and f3 are real. From the definition of the complex exponential, we have) f(x) = e tx = ea.X+i/lx = ea.x cos f3x + iea.x sin f3x .) Therefore, the real and imaginary parts off are given by) (9.14)) u(x) = ea.x cos f3x) and) vex) = ea.x sin f3x .) These functions are differentiable for all x and their derivatives are given by the formulas) u'(x) = rxea.x cos j3x - fJea.x sin (3x ,) v'(x) = rxea.x sin f3x + f3 e a.x cos (3x .) Since f'(x) = u'(x) + iv'(x), we have) f'(x) = rxea.X(cosf3x + i sin f3x) + if3ea.X(cos f3x + i sin f3x) = (rx + i(3)e(a.+i/nX = te tx .) This completes the proof.) Theorem 9.5 has some interesting consequences. For example, if we adopt the Leibniz notation for indefinite integrals, we can restate Theorem 9.5 in the form) (9. t 5)) f etx etx dx = t) when t \\037 O. If we let t = rx + i(3 and equate the real and imaginary parts of Equation (9.15), we obtain the integration formulas) f a.x ,':I. d _ ea.X(rx cos \\037x + f3 sin (3x) e cos px x - 2 2 rx + (3) and) f a.x . f3 d - ea.X(rx sin (3x - (3 cos (3x ) e SIn x x - 2 2 ' rx + (3) which are valid if rx and f3 are not both zero. Another consequence of Theorem 9.5 is the connection between complex exponentials and second-order linear differential equations with constant coefficients.) THEOREM 9.6. Consider the differential equation) (9.16) y\\\" + ay' + by = 0 ,) where a and b are real constants. The real and imaginary parts of the function f defined on))) Exercises) 371) (- 00, + (0) by the equation f(x) = etx are solutions of the differential equation (9.16) if and only if t is a root of the characteristic equation) t 2 + at + b = 0 .) Proof Let L(y) = y\\\" + ay' + by. Since f'ex) = te tx , we also have f\\\"(x) = t 2 e tx, so L(f) = e tX (t 2 + at + b). But e tx is never zero since etxe- tx = eO = I. Hence, L(f) = 0 if and only if t 2 + at + b = O. But if we write f = u + iv, we find L(f) = L(u) + iL(v), and henceL(f) = 0 if and only if both L(u) = 0 and L(v) = O. This completes the proof.) Note: If t = ex + ifJ, the real and imaginary parts of f are given by (9.14). If the characteristic equation has two distinct roots, real or complex, the linear combination) y = c1u(x)+ c2 v(x)) is the general solution of the differential equation. This agrees with the results proved in Theorem 8.7.) Further examples of complex functions are discussed in the next set of exercises.) 9.10 Exercises 1.

That is to say, having covered the first half he still has the second half before him. When half of this is covered, one-fourth yet remains. When half of this one-fourth is covered, there remains one-eighth, and so on, ad infinitum. Zeno was referring, of course, to an idealized situation in which the runner is to be thought of as a particle or point moving from one end of a line segment to the other. We can formulate the paradox in another way. Assume that the runner starts at the point marked 1 in Figure 10.1 and runs toward the goal marked O. The positions labeled \\037, i-, i, etc., indicate the fraction of the course yet to be covered when these points are reached. These fractions,each of which is half the previous one, subdivide the whole course into an endless number of smaller portions. A positive amount of time is required to cover each portion separately, and the time required for the whole course is the sum total of all these amounts. To say that the runner can never reach the goal is to say that he never arrives there in a finite length of time; or, in other words, that the sum of an endless number of positive time intervals cannot possibly be finite. This assertion was rejected 2000 years after Zeno's time when the theory of infinite series was created. In the 17th and 18th centuries, mathematicians began to realize that it is possible to extend the ideas of ordinary addition from finite collections of numbers to infinite collections so that sometimes infinitely many positive numbers have a finite \\\"sum.\\\" To see how this extension might come about and to get an idea of someof the difficulties that might be encounteredin making the extension, let us analyze Zeno's paradox in more detail. Suppose the aforementioned runner travels at a constant speed and suppose it takes him T minutes to cover the first half of the course. The next quarter of the course will take 374))) Zeno's paradox) 375) T/2 minutes, the next eighth will take T/4 minutes, and, in general, the portion from 1/2n to 1/2n+l will take T/2 n minutes. The \\\"sum\\\" of all these time intervals may be indi- cated symbolically by writing the following expression:) (lO.l)) T T T T+-+-+...+-+....2 4 2 n) This is an example of what is known as an infinite series, and the problem here is to decide whether there is some reasonable way to assign a number which may be called the sum of this series. Our physical experience tells us that a runner who travels at a constant speedshould reach his goal in twice the time it takes for him to reach the halfway point. Since it takes) o \\037) A) 1 4) 1 2) FIGURE 10.1 The racecourse paradox.) T minutes to cover half the course, it should require 2T minutes for the whole course. This line of reasoning strongly suggests that we should assign the \\\"sum\\\" 2T to the series in (10.1), and it leads us to expect that the equation) (10.2)) T T T T + - + - + . . . + - + . . . = 2T2 4 2 n) should be \\\"true\\\" in some sense. The theory of infinite series tells us exactly how to interpret this eq uation. The idea is this: First we add a finite number of the terms, say the first n, and denote their sum by Sn' Thus we have) (10.3)) T T T s =T+-+-+\\\"'+-.n 2 4 2 n - 1) This is called the nth partial sum of the series. Now we study the behavior of sn as n takes larger and larger values. In particular, we try to determine whether the partial sums sn approach a finite limit as n increases without bound. In this example it is easy to see that 2T is the limiting value of the partial sums. In fact, if we calculate a few of these partial sums, we find that) Sl = T,) T 3 S =T + -=-T2 2 2 ') T T 7 S3 = T + \\\"2 + \\\"4 = 4. T,) T T T 15 S4 = T + \\\"2 + \\\"4 + 8\\\" = 8 T .))) 376) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) Now, observe that these results may be expressed as follows:) SI = (2 - l)T,) S2 = (2 - !)T,) S3 = (2 - i)T,) s4=(2-i)T.) This leads us to conjecture the following general formula:) ( 10.4)) s = (2 - -.L ) Tn 2 n- I) for all positive integers n .) Formula (10.4) is easily verified by induction. Since 1/2n-I -+ 0 as n increases indefinitely, this shows that Sn -+ 2T. Therefore, Equation (10.2) is \\\"true\\\" if we interpret it to mean that 2T is the limit of the partial sums Sw This limit process seems to invalidate the assertion that the sum of an infinite number of time intervals can never be finite. Now we shall give an argument which lends considerable support to Zeno's point of view. Suppose we make a small but important change in the foregoing analysis of the racecourse paradox. Instead of assuming that the speed of the runner is constant, let us suppose that his speed gradually decreases in such a way that he requires T minutes to go from 1 to 1/2, T/2 minutes to go from 1/2 to 1/4, T/3 minutes to go from 1/4 to 1/8, and, in general, T/n minutes to go from 1/2 n - I to 1/2 n . The \\\"total time\\\" for the course may now be represented by the following infinite series:) (10.5)) 7,T T T +2+3+...+;+....) In this case, our physical experience does not suggest any natural or obvious \\\"sum\\\" to assign to this series, and hence we must rely entirely on mathematical analysis to deal with this example. Let us proceed as before and introduce the partial sums sn' That is, let) (10.6)) T T T Sn = T + 2 + 3 + . . . + -;; .) Our object is to decide what happens to Sn for larger and larger valuesof n. These partial sums are not as easy to study as those in (10.3) because there is no simple formula analogous to (10.4) for sinlplifying the expression on the right of (10.6). Nevertheless, it is easy to obtain an estimate for the size of Sn if we compare the partial sum with an appropriate integral. Figure 10.2showsthe graph of the functionf(x) = l/x for x > O. (The scale is distorted along the y-axis.) The rectangles shown there have a total area equal to the sum) (10.7)) 1111+ 2 + 3+\\\"'+ n ,) The area of the shaded region is f\\037+1 X-I dx = log (n + I). Sincethis area cannot exceed the sum of the areas of the rectangles, we have the inequality) (10.8)) 1111 + - + - + . . . + - > log (n + 1) . 2 3 n-))) Zeno's paradox) 377) Multiplying both sides by T, we obtain Sn > T log (n + 1). In other words, if the runner's speed decreases in the manner described above, the time required to reach the point 1/2 n is at least T log (n + 1) minutes. Since log (n + 1) increases without bound as n increases, we must agree with Zeno and conclude that the runner cannot reach his goal in any finite time. The general theory of infinite series makes a distinction between serieslike (10.1)whose partial sums tend to a finite limit, and those like (10.5) whose partial sums have no finite y) \\037 , I y=- x .\\037 Sum of areas of rectangles is I +! + l + . , . + ! 2 3 n i' ;'; j( 1\\\"+1 Area of shaded region is 1 x -I dx = log (n + I \\\\..1 I I I I \\037, ,'!,t,''!11,i; tJ \\\" ,1 :Pin> \\037 1;' '\\\"'i''' ,,,cc\\\" - ;l',\\\"\\037l\\\",J\\037;\\037 - .... 0 I 2 3 . . 0 n n + 1) )) x) FIGURE 10.2 Geometric meaning of the inequality 1 + 1/2 + . . . + l/n > log (n + 1).) limit. The former are called convergent, the latter divergent. Early investigators in the field paid little or no attention to questions of convergence or divergence. They treated infinite series as though they were ordinary finite sums, subject to the usual laws of algebra, not realizing that these laws cannot be universally extended to infinite series. Therefore, it is not surprising that some of the results they obtained were later shown to be incorrect. Fortunately, many of the early pioneers possessed unusual intuition and skill which prevented them from arriving at too many false conclusions,even though they could not justify all their methods. Foremost among these men was Leonard Euler who discovered one beautiful formula after another and at the same time used infinite series as a unifying idea to bring together many branches of mathematics, hitherto unrelated. The great quantity of Euler's work that has survived the test of history is a tribute to his remarkable instinct for what is mathematically correct. The widespread use of infinite series began late in the 17th century, nearly fifty years before Euler was born, and coincided with the early development of the integral calculus. Nicholas Mercator (1620-1687)and William Brouncker (1620-1684) discovered an infinite series for the logarithm in 1668 while attempting to calculate the area of a hyperbolic segment. Shortly thereafter, Newton discovered the binomial series. This discovery proved))) 378) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) to be a landmark in the history of mathematics. A special case of the binomial series is the now-familiar binomial theorem which states that) n (1 + x)n = L (\\037)Xk , k=O) where x is an arbitrary real number, n is a nonnegative integer, and (;:) is the binomial coefficient. Newton found that this formula could be extended from integer values of the exponent n to arbitrary real values of n by replacing the finite sum on the right by a suitable infinite series, although he gave no proof of this fact. Actually, a careful treatment of the binomial series raises some rather delicate questions of convergence that could not have been answered in Newton's time. Shortly after Euler's death in 1783, the flood of new discoveriesbegan to recede and the formal period in the history of series came to a close. A new and more critical period began in 1812 when Gauss published a celebrated memoir which contained, for the first time in history, a thorough and rigorous treatment of the convergence of a particular infinite series. A few years later Cauchy introduced an analytic definition of the limit concept in his treatise Cours d' analyse algebrique (published in 1821) and laid the founda- tions of the modern theory of convergence and divergence. The rudiments of that theory are discussed in the sections that follow.) 10.2 Sequences In everyday usage of the English language, the words \\\"sequence\\\" and \\\"series\\\" are synonyms, and they are used to suggest a successionof things or events arranged in some order. In mathematics these words have special technical meanings. The word \\\"sequence\\\" is employedas in the comn10n use of the term to conveythe idea of a set of things arranged in order, but the word \\\"series\\\" is used in a somewhat different sense. The concept of a sequence will be discussed in this section, and series will be defined in Section 10.5. If for every positive integer n there is associated a real or complex number an, then the ordered set) a l , a 2 , a 3 , . . . , an , . . .) is said to define an infinite sequence. The important thing here is that each member of the set has beenlabeled with an integer so that we may speak of the first term at , the second term a 2 , and, in general, the nth term an. Each term an has a successor a n + l and hence there is no \\\"last\\\" term. The most common examples of sequencescan be constructed if we give some rule or formula for describing the nth term. Thus, for example, the formula an = Ifn defines a sequence whose first five terms are) I II 1 1 , \\\"2, 3' 4' \\\"5 \\302\\267) Sometimes two or more formulas may be employed as, for example,) a2n-l = 1,) a2n = 2n 2 ,))) Sequences) 379) the first few terms in this case being) 1, 2, 1, 8, 1, 18, 1,32,1 .) Another common way to define a sequence is by a set of instructions which explains how to carryon after a given start. Thus we may have) a 1 = a 2 = 1,) a n+ 1 = an + a n - 1) for n > 2 .) This particular rule is known as a recursion formula, and it defines a famous sequence whose terms are called the Fibonaccit numbers. The first few terms are) 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,21,34 .) In any sequence the essential thing is that there be some function f defined on the positive integers such that fen) is the nth term of the sequence for each n = 1, 2, 3, . . .. In fact, this is probably the most convenientway to state a technical definition of sequence.) DEFINITION. A function f \\037rhose domain is the set of all positive integers 1, 2, 3, . . . is called an infinite sequence. The function value fen) is called the nth term of the sequence.) The range of the function (that is, the set of function values) is usually displayed by writing the terms in order, thus:) f(I),f(2),f(3), . . . ,fen), . .. .) For brevity, the notation {fen)} is used to denote the sequence whose nth term is fen). Very often the dependence on n is denoted by using subscripts, and we write an , Sn , Xn , Un , or something similar instead of fen). Unless otherwise specified, all sequences in this chapter are assumed to have real or complexterms. The main question we are concerned with here is to decide whether or not the terms fen) tend to a finite limit as n increases indefinitely. To treat this problem, we must extend the limit concept to sequences. This is done as follows.) DEFINITION. A sequence {fen)} is said to have a Unlit L if, for every positive number \\342\\202\\254, there is another positive number N ('ri'hich may depend on E) such that) If(n) - LI < \\342\\202\\254)for all n > N .) In this case, 'ri'e say the sequence {fen)} converges to L and we write) limf(n) = L,) or) f( n) \\037 L) as n \\037 00 .) n\\037oo) A sequence which does not converge is called divergent.) In this definition the function valuesf(n) and the limit L may be real or complex numbers. Iff and L are complex, we may decompose them into their real and imaginary parts, say f = u + iv and L = a + lb. Then we have fen) - L = u(n) - a + i[v(n) - b]. The) t Fibonacci, also known as Leonardo of Pisa (circa1175-1250),encountered this sequence in a problem concerning the offspring of rabbits.))) 380) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) inequalities) lu(n) - al < If(n) - LI) and) Iv(n) - bl < If(n) - LI) show that the relationf(n) \\037 L implies u(n) \\037 a and v(n) \\037 b as n -+ 00. Conversely, the inequality) If(n) - LI < lu(n) - al + Iv(n) - bl) shows that the two relations u(n) -+ a and v(n) \\037 b imply f(n) \\037 L as n \\037 00. In other words, a complex-valuedsequencef converges if and only if both the real part u and the imaginary part v converge separately, in which case we have) lim f(n) = lim u(n) + i lim v(n) .) n\\037oo) n\\037oo) n\\037oo) It is clear that any function defined for all positive real x may be used to construct a sequence by restricting x to take only integer values. This explains the strong analogy between the definition just given and the one in Section 7.14 for more general functions. The analogy carries over to infinite limits as well, and we leave it for the reader to define the symbols) limf(n) = + 00) and) limf(n) = - 00) n\\037oo) n\\037oo) as was done in Section 7.15 when f is real-valued. If f is complex, we write f(n) -+ 00 as n -+ 00 if If(n)1 \\037 + 00. The phrase \\\"convergent sequence\\\"is used only for a sequence whose limit is finite. A sequence with an infinite limit is said to diverge. There are, of course, divergent sequences that do not have infinite limits. Examples are defined by the following formulas:) f(n) = (-l)n ,) f(n) = sin \\037'TT ,) f(n) = (_l)n( 1 + \\037) ,) f(n) = e1Tin / 2 .) The basic rules for dealing with limits of sums, products, etc., also hold for limits of convergent sequences. The reader should have no difficulty in formulating these theorems for himself. Their proofs are somewhat similar to those given in Section 3.5. The convergence or divergence of many sequences may be determinedby using properties of familiar functions that are defined for all positive x. We mention a few important examples of real-valued sequences whose limits may be found directly or by using some of the results derived in Chapter 7.) (10.9) Jim 1. = 0 if a > O. n\\03700 na.

Monotonic sequences of real numbers) 381) 10.3 Monotonic sequences of real numbers) A sequence {fen)} is said to be increasing if) fen) < fen + 1)) for all n > 1 .) We indicate this briefly by writingf(n),?1. If, on the other hand, we have) fen) > fen + 1)) for all n > 1 ,) we call the sequence decreasing and write f(n)\\037. A sequence is called monotonic if it is increasing or if it is decreasing. Monotonic sequencesare pleasant to work with because their convergence or divergence is particularly easy to determine. In fact, we have the following simple criterion.) THEOREM 10.1. A monotonic sequence converges if and only if it is bounded.) Note: A sequence {f(n)} is called bounded if there exists a positive number M such that If(n)1 < M for all n. A sequence that is not bounded is called unbounded.) Proof It is clear that an unbounded sequence cannot converge. Therefore, all we need to prove is that a bounded monotonic sequence must converge. Assume f(nt?f and let L denote the least upper bound of the set of function values. (Sincethe sequence is bounded, it has a least upperbound by Axiom 10 of the real-number) L - f) L) f( 1) f(2)) f(3) f(4)) f(N) f(n)) FIGURE 10.3 A bounded increasing sequenceconverges to its least upper bound.) system.) Thenfen) < L for all n, and we shall prove that the sequence converges to L. Choose any positive number E. Since L - E cannot be an upper bound for all numbers fen), we must have L - E < feN) for some N. (This N may depend on E.) If n > N, we have feN) < fen) sincef(n)?,. Hence, we have L - E < fen) < L for all n > N, as' illustrated in Figure 10.3. From these inequalities we find that) o < L - fen) < E) for all n > N) and this means that the sequence convergesto L, as asserted. If f(n)\\037 , the proof is similar, the limit in this case being the greatest lower bound of the set of function values.))) 382) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) 10.4 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 22, a sequence {f(n)} is defined by the formula given.

Thus, if the given sequence has the terms) a1, a2 , . . . , an , . . . ,) we may form, in succession, the \\\"partial sums\\ SI = a 1 ,) S2 = a 1 + a 2 ,) S3 = a 1 + a 2 + a 3 ,) and so on, the partial sum Sn of the first n terms being definedas follows:) (10.14)) n Sn = al + a 2 + . . . + an = \\037 ak \\302\\267 k=l))) 384) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) The sequence {sn} of partial sums is called an infinite series, or simply a series, and is also denoted by the following symbols:) (10.15)) a1 + a2 + a 3 + . . . ,) a1 + a 2 + . . . + an + \\302\\267. . ,) 00 \\037ak . k=1) For example, the series \\037\\0371 Ilk represents the sequence {sn} for which) n 1 Sn = L k . k=1) The symbols in (10.15) are intended to remind us that the sequence of partial sums {sn} is obtained from the sequence {an} by addition of successive terms. If there is a real or complex number S such that) Iim Sn = S , n\\037oo) we say that the series \\037\\0371 a k is convergent and has the sum S, in which case we write) 00 \\037 a k = S . k=l) If {sn} diverges, we say that the series \\037\\0371 a k diverges and has no sum.) EXAMPLE 1. THE HARMONIC SERIES.In the discussion of Zeno's paradox, we showed that the partial sums Sn of the series \\037\\0371 1 Ik satisfy the inequality) n 1 Sn = L k > log (n + 1) . k=l) Since log (n + 1) \\037 00 as n \\037 00, the same is true of Sn, and hence the series \\037;:1 1 Ik diverges. This seriesis called the harmonic series.) EXAMPLE 2. In the discussion of Zeno's paradox, we also encountered the partial sums of the series 1 + -! + ! + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 , given by the formula) n 1 1 \\037--2 - \\037 2 k- 1 - - 2 n - 1 ' k=1) which is easily proved by induction. As n \\037 00, these partial sums approach the limit 2, and hence the series converges and has sum 2. We may indicate this by writing) (10.16)) 1 +t+!+\\\"'==-2.) The reader should realize that the word \\\"sum\\\" is used here in a very special sense. The sum of a convergent series is not obtained by ordinary addition but rather as the limit))) The linearity property of convergent series) 385) of the sequence of partial sums. Also, the reader should note that for a convergent series, the symbol \\037::1ak is used to denote both the series and its sum, even though the two are conceptually distinct. The sum represents a number and it is not capable of being con- vergent or divergent. Once the distinction between a seriesand its sum has been realized, the use of one symbol to represent both should cause no confusion. As in the case of finite summation notation, the letter k used in the symbol L::l a k is a \\\"dummy index\\\" and may be replacedby any other convenient symbol. The letters n, m, and r are commonly used for this purpose. Sometimes it is desirable to start the summation from k = 0 or from k = 2 or from some other value of k. Thus, for example, the series in (10.16) could be written as L::o 1/2 k. In general, if p > 0, we define the sym bol L::p ak to mean the same as L::l bk , where b k = a p + k- 1 ' Thus b1 = a p , b 2 = a p+ 1 , etc. When there is no danger of confusion or when the starting point is unimportant, we write \\037 a k instead of L::p ak \\302\\267 I t is easy to prove that the two series L::l ak and L::p a k both converge or both diverge. Suppose we let Sn = al + . . . + an and t n = a p + a p+ 1 + . . . + a p + n- 1 ' If p = 0, we have t n+ 1 = a o + Sn , so if Sn \\037 S as n \\037 00, then t n \\037 a o + S and, conversely, if t n \\037 T as n \\037 00, then Sn \\037 T - a o . Therefore, both series converge or both diverge when p = O. The same holds true if p > 1. For p = 1, we have Sn = t n , and for p > 1, we have t n = sn+p-l - Sp-l, and again it follows that the sequences {sn} and {tn } both converge or both diverge. This is often described by saying that a finite number of terms may be omitted or addedat the beginning of a series without affecting its convergence or divergence.) 10.6 The linearity property of convergent series) Ordinary finite sums have the following important properties:) (10.17)) n n n \\037(ak + b k) = \\037ak + \\037bk k=l k=l k=l) (additive property)) and) (10.18)) n n L(cak)=cLa k k=l k=l) (homogeneous property) .) The next theorem provides a natural extension of these properties to convergent infinite series and thereby justifies many algebraic manipulations in which convergent series are treated as though they were finite sums. Both additivity and homogeneity may be com- bined into one property called linearity which may be described as follows:) THEOREM 10.2. Let \\037 an and \\037 b n be convergent infinite series of complex terms and let rJ. and f3 be complex constants. Then the series \\037 (rJ.a n + f3b n ) also converges, and its sum is given by the equation) (10.19)) 00 00 00 \\037 (exa n + f3brJ = ex \\037 an + f3 \\037 b n . n=l n=l n=l))) 386) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) Proof Using (10.17) and (10.18), we may write) (10.20)) n n n \\037(exak + f3b k) = (X\\037ak + f3\\037bk' k=l k=l k=1) When n \\037 00, the first term on the right of (10.20) tends to ex L:I a k and the second term tends to f3 L::I b k. Therefore the left-hand side tends to their sum, and this proves that the series \\037 (exa k + {3b,J converges to the sum indicated by (10.19).) Theorem 10.2 has an interesting corollary which is often used to establish the divergence of a series.) THEOREM 10.3. If\\037 an converges and if\\037 b n diverges, then L (an + b n ) diverges.) Proof Since bn = (an + b n ) - an , and since \\037 an converges, Theorem 10.2 tells us that convergence of L (an + bn ) implies convergence of \\037 b n . Therefore, \\037 (an + b n) cannot converge if \\037 b n diverges.) EXAMPLE. The series \\037 (Ilk + 1/2k) diverges because \\037 Ilk diverges and \\037 1/2k converges.) If L an and \\037 b n are both divergent, the seriesL (an + b n) mayor may not converge. For example, when an = b n = 1 for all n, then L (an + b n ) diverges. But when an = 1 and b n = -1 for all n, then L (an + b n ) converges.) 10.7 Telescoping series Another important property of finite sums is the telescoping property which states that) (10.21)) n \\037(bk - bk + 1) = bi - b n + 1 . k=1) When we try to extend this property to infinite series we are led to consider those series L an for which each term an may be expressed as a differenceof the form) (10.22)) an = b n - b n + 1 .) These series are known as telescopingseries and their behavior is characterized by the following theorem.) THEOREM 10.4. Let {an} and {bn } be t}1'O sequences of complex numbers such that) (10.23)) an = b n - b n + 1) for) n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .) Then the series L an converges if and only if the sequence {b n } converges, in which case we have) (10.24)) 00 L an = bi - L , n=l) where L = lim b n . n -to 00))) Telescoping series) 387) Proof Let Sn denote the nth partial sum of L an' Then we have) n n Sn = \\037ak = \\037(bk - bk + l ) = bl - b n + l , k=1 k=l) because of (10.21). Therefore, both sequences {sn} and {bn } converge or both diverge. Moreover, if b n \\037 L as n \\037 00, then Sn \\037 b l - L, and this proves (10.24).) Note: Every series is telescoping because we can always satisfy (10.22) if we first choose b1 to be arbitrary and then choose bn + 1 = b l - Sn for n > 1, where Sn = a l + . . . + an .) EXAMPLE 1. Let an = I/(n 2 + n). Then we have) 1 1 1 an = = - - , n(n + 1) n n + 1) and hence (10.23) holds with b n = I/n. Since b1 = 1 and L = 0, we obtain) 00 1 L n(n + 1) = 1 . n=1) EXAMPLE 2. If x is not a negative integer, we have the decomposition) 1 1 ( 1 1 ) (n + x)(n + x + l)(n + x + 2) = 2 (n + x)(n + x + 1) - (n + x + 1)(n + x + 2)) for each integer n > 1. Therefore, by the telescoping property, the following series conver- gesand has the sum indicated:) 00 1 1 L (n + x)(n + x + 1)(n+ x + 2) = 2(x + 1)(x+ 2) \\302\\267 n=l) EXAMPLE 3. Since log [nl(n + 1)] = log n - log (n + 1),and since log n \\037 00 as n \\037 00, the series \\037 log [nl(n + 1)] diverges.) Note: Telescoping series illustrate an important difference between finite sums and infinite series. If we write (10.21)in extended form, it becomes) (bl - b 2) + (b 2 - b 3) + . . \\302\\267 + (b n - bn + l ) = bl - bn + 1) which can be verified by merely removing parentheses and canceling. Suppose now we per- form the same operations on the infinite series) (bl - b2 ) + (b 2 - b 3) + (b3 - b 4 ) + \\302\\267. . \\302\\267) We leave b l , cancelb2 , cancel b 3 , and so on. For each n > 1, at some stage wecancelbn . Thus every bn cancels with the exception of bl . This leads us to the conclusionthat the sum))) 388) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) of the series is bl . Becauseof Theorem 10.4, this conclusion is falseunless lim n __ oo b n = O. This shows that parentheses cannot always be removed in an infinite series as they can in a finite sum. (SeealsoExercise24 in Section 10.9.)) 10.8 The geometric series The telescoping property of finite sums may be usedto study a very important example known as the geometric series. This seriesis generated by successive addition of the terms in a geometric progression and has the form! x n , where the nth term x n is the nth power of a fixed real or complex number x. It is convenient to start this series with n = 0, with the understanding that the initial term, xo, is equal to 1. Let Sn denote the nth partial sum of this series, so that Sn = 1 + x + x 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + x n - I .) If x = 1, each term on the right is 1 and Sn = n. In this case, the series diverges since Sn -+ 00 as n -+ 00. If x =/= 1, we may simplify the sum for Sn by writing) n-I n-I (1 - x)sn = (1 - x)L Xk = 2 (xk - Xk+l) = 1 - x n , lc=O k=O) since the last sum telescopes. Dividing by 1 - x, we obtain the formula) 1 - x n 1 x n s = = - n I-x I-x I-x) if x =/= 1 .) This shows that the behavior of Sn for large n depends entirely on the behavior of x n . When Ixl < 1, then x n -+ 0 as n -+ 00, and the series converges to the sum 1/(1 - x). Since sn+1 - sn = x n , convergence of {sn} implies xn -+ 0 as n -+ 00. Therefore, if Ixl > 1 the sequence {sn} diverges sincexn does not tend to 0 in this case. Thus we have proved the following theorem.) THEOREM 10.5. If x is complex, with Ixl < 1, the geometric series !\\037o x n converges and has sum 1/(1 - x). That is to say, \\037vehave) (10.25) 1 + x + x 2 + . . . + x n + . . . = 1 1 - x If Ixl > 1, the series diverges.) if Ixl < 1 .) The geometric series, with Ixl < 1, is one of those rare examples whose sum we are able to determine by finding first a simple formula for its partial sums. (A special case with x = t was encountered in Section 10.1 in connection with Zeno's paradox.) The real importance of this series lies in the fact that it may be used as a starting point for determining the sums of a large number of other interesting series. For example, if we assume Ixl < 1 and replace x by x 2 in (10.25), we obtain the formula) (10.26)) 1 2 4 2 1 +x +x +\\\"'+xn+...= 1 - x 2) if Ix I < 1 .))) The geonletric series) 389) Notice that this series contains those terms of (10.25)with even exponents. To find the sum of the odd powers alone, we need only multiply both sides of (10.26) by x to obtain) (10.27)) x x + x 3 + x 5 + . . . + x2n+l + . \\302\\267\\302\\267= 1 - x 2) if Ixl < 1 .) If we replace x by - x in (10.25), we find that) (10.28)) 1 - x + x 2 _ x 3 + . . . + (_1)nx n + . . . = 1 1 + x) if Ixl < 1 .) Replacing x by x 2 in (10.28), we find that) (10.29)) 1 - x 2 + x 4 _ x 6 + . . . + (- 1)n x 2n + . . . = 1 1 + x 2) if Ixl < 1 .) Multiplying both sides of (10.29) by x, we obtain) x (10.30) x - x 3 + x 5 - x7 +... + (_I)nx2n+l +... = 1+ x 2) if Ixl < 1 .) If we replace x by 2x in (10.26), we find that) 1 1 + 4x 2 + 16x 4 + . . . + 4 n x 2n + . . . = 1 - 4x 2 ') which is valid if 12xl < lor, what is the same thing, if Ixl <!. It is clear that many other examples may be constructed by similar means. All these series have the special form) 00 I a ,/x n n=O) and are known as po\\037rer series. The numbers a o , a l , a 2 , . . . , which may be real or complex, are called coefficients of the power series. The geometric series is an example with all coefficients equal to 1. If x and all the coefficients are real, the seriesis called a real power series. We shall find later, when we discuss the general theory of real power series,that it is permissible to differentiate and to integrate both sides of each of the Equations (10.25) through (10.30), treating the left-hand members as though they were ordinary finite sums. These operations lead to many remarkable new formulas. For example, differentiation of (10.25) gives us) (10.31)) 1 + 2x + 3x 2 + . . . + nx n - l + . . . = 1 (1- X)2) if Ixl < 1 ,))) 390) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) whereas integration of (10.28) yields the interesting formula) (10.32)) x 2 X 3 X 4 ( _1)nXn+lx - - + - - - + . . \\302\\267 + + \\302\\267\\302\\267. = log (1 + x) 2 3 4 n+l) which expresses the logarithm as a power series. This is the discovery of Mercator and Brouncker (1668) that we mentioned earlier. Although each of the Equations (10.25) through (10.31) is valid for x in the open interval -1 < x < + 1,it turns out that the logarithmic series in (10.32) is valid at the endpoint x = + 1 as well. Another important example, which may be obtained by integration of (10.29),is the following power-series expansion for the inverse tangent, discovered in 1671 by James Gregory (1638-1675):) (10.33)) x3 x 5 x 7 ( _1)nx2n+l x - - + - - - + . . . + + . . . = arctan x . 3 5 7 2n + 1) Gregory's series converges for each complexx with Ixl < 1 and also for x = :l:1. When x is real, the series agrees with the inverse tangent function introduced in Chapter 6. The series can be usedto extend the definition of the arctangent function from real values of x to complexx with Ixl < 1. Many of the other elementary functions of calculus, such as the sine, cosine,and expo- nential, may also be represented by power series. This is not too surprising, in view of Taylor's formula which tells us that any function may be approximated by a Taylor poly- nomial in x of degree < n if it has derivatives of order n + 1 in some neighborhood of the origin. In the examples given above, the partial sums of the power series are precisely the Taylor polynomials. When a function f has derivatives of every order in a neighborhood of the origin, then for every positive integer n Taylor's formula leads to an equation of the form) (10.34)) n f(x) = Iakx k + En(x), k=O) where the finite sum I\\037=o akx k is a Taylor polynomial of degree < nand En(x) is the error for this approximation. If, now, we keep x fixed and let n increase without bound in (10.34) the Taylor polynomialsgive rise to a power series, namely I\\037o akx\\\\ where each coefficient ak is determined as follows:) f(k)(O)ak = . k!) If, for some x, the error En(x) tends to 0 as n -+ 00, then for this x we may let n -+ 00 in (10.34) to obtain) n 00 f(x) = lim Iakx k + lim En(x) = Iakx k . n--' 00 k=O n--' 00 lc=O) In other words, the power series in question converges to f(x). If x is a point for which En(x) does not tend to 0 as n -+ 00, then the partial sums will not approachf(x). Conditions on f for guaranteeing that En(x) -+ 0 will be discussed later in Section 11.10.)))

Exercises on decimal expansions) 393) *10.10 Exercises on decimal expansions Decimal representations of real numbers were introduced in Section 13.15. It was shown there that every positive real x has a decimal representation of the form) x = aO . a la2 a3 . . . ,) where 0 < ak < 9 for each k > 1.

If we let Sn = !;=o ak/ 10 k, and if we subtract Sn from each member of (10.35),we obtain) o < x - Sn < 10- n .)

If a number has a decimal expansion which ends in zeros, such as i = 0.1250000..., then this number can also be written as a decimal which ends in nines if we decrease the last nonzero digit by one unit.

The decimal representation in (10.36) may be generalized by replacing the integer 10 by any other integer b > 1.

In some specialcases,such as the geometric series, the sums defining Sn may be simplified to the point where it becomes a simple matter to determine their behavior for large n. However, in the majority of cases there is no nice formula for simplifying Sn and the convergence or divergence may be rather difficult to establish in a straightforward manner. Early investigators in the subject, notably Cauchy and his contemporaries, realized this difficulty and they developed a number of \\\"convergence tests\\\" that by-passed the need for an explicit knowledge of the partial sums. A few of the simplest and most useful of these tests will be discussed in this chapter, but first we want to make somegeneral remarks about the nature of these tests. Convergence tests may be broadly classified into three categories: (i) sufficient conditions; (ii) necessaryconditions; (iii)necessary and sufficient conditions. A test of type (i) may be expressed symbolically as follows: \\\"If C is satisfied, then! an converges,\\\" where C stands for the condition in question. Tests of type (ii) have the form \\\"If! an converges, then C is satisfied,\\\" whereas those of type (iii) may be written thus: \\\"I an converges if and only if C is satisfied.\\\" We shall see presently that there are tests of type (ii) that are not of type (i) (and vice versa). Beginners often use such tests incorrectly by failing to realize the difference between a necessary condition and a sufficient condition. Therefore the reader should make an effort to keep this distinction in mind when using a particular test in practice. The simplest of all convergence tests gives a necessary condition for convergence and may be stated as follows.) THEOREM 10.6. If the series 2 an converges, then its nth term tends to 0; that is,) (10.37) lim an = 0 .) n-+oo) Proof Let Sn = al + a2 + . . . + an' Then an = Sn - Sn-l' As n -+ 00, both Sn and Sn-l tend to the same limit and hence an -+ O. This proves the theorem.) This is an example of a test of type (ii) which is not of type (i). Condition (10.37) is not sufficient for convergence. For example, when an = l/n, the condition an -+ 0 is satisfied but the series! l/n diverges. The real usefulness of this test is that it gives us a sufficient condition for divergence. That is, if the terms an of a series! an do not tend to zero, then the series must diverge. This staten1ent is logically equivalent to Theorem 10.6.) 10.12 Comparison tests for series of nonnegative terms In this section we shall be concerned with series having nonnegative terms, that is, series of the form! an, where each an > O. Since the partial sums of such series are monotonic))) Comparison tests for series of nonnegative terms) 395) increasing, we may use Theorem 10.1 to obtain the following necessary and sufficient condition for convergence.) THEOREM 10.7. Assume that an > 0 for each n > I. Then the series I an converges if and only if the sequence of its partial sums is bounded above.) If the partial sums are bounded above by a number M, say, then the sum of the series cannot exceedM.) EXAMPLE 1. Theorem 10.7 may be usedto establish the convergence of the series I:=I Iln!. We estimate the partial sums from above by using the inequality) l..<\\037 k! - 2 k - 1 ') which is obviously true for all k > I sincek! consists of k - I factors, each > 2. Therefore we have) n 1 \\037 1 n-I ( l ) k 00 ( l ) k -< -- -< --2Lk!- 22 k - 1 - L 2 - L 2 - , k=l k=l k=O k=O) the last series being a geometric series. The series I:=I Iln! is therefore convergent and has a sum < 2. We shall see later that the sum of this series is e - I, where e is the Euler number.) The convergence of the foregoing example was established by comparing the terms of the given series with those of a series known to converge. This idea may be pursued further to yield a number of tests known as comparison tests.) THEOREM 10.8. COMPARISON TEST. Assume an > 0 and b n > 0 for all n > I. If there exists a positive constant c such that) (10.38) an < cb n) for all n, then convergence of I b n implies convergence of I an \\302\\267) Note: The conclusion may also be formulated as follows: \\\"DivergenceofI an implies divergence of I bn .\\\" This statement is logically equivalent to Theorem 10.8. When the inequality (10.38) is satisfied, we say that the series I bn dominates the series I an .) Proof Let Sn = a i + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + an , t n = b i + \\302\\267\\302\\267. + b n . Then (10.38) implies Sn < ct n . If I b n converges, its partial sums are bounded, say by M. Then Sn < cM, and henceI an is also convergent since its partial sums are bounded by cM. This completes the proof.))) 396) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) Omitting a finite number of terms at the beginning of a seriesdoes not affect its con- vergence or divergence. Therefore Theorem 10.8 still holds true if the inequality (10.38) is valid only for all n > N for some N.) THEOREM 10.9. LIMIT COMPARISON TEST. Assume that a'n > 0 and b n > 0 for all n > 1, and suppose that) (10.39)) 1 . an 11m - = . n-+oo b n) Then! an converges if and only if! b n converges.) Proof There exists an N such that n > N implies t < an/b n < -I. Therefore b n < 2a n and an < !b n for all n > N, and the theorem follows by applying Theorem 10.8 twice.) Note that Theorem 10.9 also holds if limn-+oooan/b n = c, provided that c > 0, because we then have lin1 n -+ooo a n/(cb n ) = 1 and we may compare! an with! (cb n ). However, if limn-+oooan/b n = 0, we conclude only that convergence of! b n implies convergence of! an .) DEFINITION. Two sequences {an} and {bn } of complex numbers are said to be asymptotically equal if) 1 . an 11m - = . n-+ 00 b n) This relation is often indicated symbolically by writing) (10.40)) an \\\"\\\"\\\" b n) as n -+ 00 .) The notation an \\\"\\\"\\\" b n is read \\\"an is asymptotically equal to b n ,\\\" and it is intended to suggest that an and b n behave in essentially the same way for large n. Using this terminology, we may state the limit comparison test in the following manner.) THEOREM 10.10. Two series! an and! b n with terms that are positive and asymptotically equal converge together or they diverge together.) EXAMPLE 2. THE RIEMANN ZETA-FUNCTION. In Example 1 of Section 10.7, we proved that L 1/(n 2 + n) is a convergenttelescopingseries.If we use this as a comparison series, it follows that ! Ijn 2 is convergent, since l/n2\\\"\\\"\\\" 1/(n 2 + n) as n -+ 00. Also,! 1/n2 dominates L l/n s for s > 2, and therefore! l/n s converges for every real s > 2.

Its sum, denoted by \\037(s) (\\037 is the Greek letter zeta), definesan important function in analysis known as the Riemann zetajunction:) 00 1 \\037(s) = \\037 - \\037ns n=l) if s > 1 .) Euler discovered many beautiful formulas involving \\037(s). In particular, he found that \\037(2) = 1T 2 j6, a result which is not easy to derive at this stage.))) The integral test) 397) EXAMPLE 3. Since ! 1 In diverges, every series having positive terms asymptotically equal to Iin must also diverge.

The geometricseriesand the zeta-function are useful for this purpose. New examples can be obtained very simply by applying the integral test, first proved by Cauchy in 1837.) y) y) t f(k) < jnf(x)dx k=2 I) n - I If(x) dx < L f(k) k=1) o) f(n) x x 2 n 0 2 n FIGURE 10.4 Proof of the integral test.)

Therefore, both sequences convergeor both diverge, as asserted.))) 398) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) EXAMPLE 1.

When s > 1 the term n 1- s --+ 0 as n --+ 00 and hence {tn} converges. By the integral test, this implies convergence of the series for s > 1. When s < 1, then t n --+ 00 and the series diverges. The special case s = 1 (the harmonic series)wasdiscussedearlierin Section 10.5. Its divergence was known to Leibniz.) EXAMPLE 2. The same method may be usedto prove that) 00 1 2: n(log n)' n=2) converges if and only if s > 1 .) (We start the sum with n = 2 to avoid n for which log n may be zero.) The corresponding in tegral in this case is) { (lOg n )1-S - (log2)1-S i n 1 t = dx = 1 - sn 2 x(log x)S log (log n) - log(Jog 2)) if s;j6. 1 ,) if s = 1 .) Thus {t n } converges if and only if s > 1, and hence, by the integral test, the same holds true for the series in question.) 10.14 Exercises) Test the following series for convergenceor divergence.

If 2 an is a series whose terms (from some point on) satisfy an inequality of the form) (10.42)) o < an < x n ,) where) O<x<l,) a direct application of the comparison test (Theorem 10.8) tells us that 2 an converges. The inequalitiesin (10.42) are equivalent to) (10.43)) o < a1!n< x .- n - ,) hence the name root test.))) 400) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) If the sequence {a\\037n} is convergent, the test may be restated in a somewhat more useful form that makes no reference to the number x.) THEOREM 10.12. ROOT TEST. Let 2 an be a series of nonnegative terms such that) a 1/ n -+ Rn) as n -+ 00 .) (a) If R < 1, the series converges. (b) If R > 1, the series diverges. (c) If R = 1, the test is inconclusive.) Proof Assume R < 1 and choose x so that R < x < 1. Then (10.43) must be satisfied for all n > N for some N. Hence,2 an converges by the comparison test. This proves (a). To prove (b), we observe that R > 1 implies an > 1 for infinitely many values of n and hence an cannot tend to O. Therefore, by Theorem 10.6, 2 an diverges. This proves (b). To prove (c), consider the two examples in which an = l/n and an = l/n 2. In both cases R = 1 since n 1jn -+ 1 as n -+ 00 [see Equation (10.12) of Section10.2],but 2 l/n diverges whereas 2 l/n2 converges.) EXAMPLE 1. The root test makes it easy to determine the convergence of the serIes 2:=3 (log n)-n since) a1/ n = -L -+ 0n log n EXAMPLE 2. Applying the root test to 2 [n/(n + 1)]n 2, we find that) as n -+ 00 .) a 1/ n - ( n ) n_ 1 -+1 n - n + 1 - (1+ 1/n)n e) as) n -+ 00,) by Equation (10.13) of Section 10.2. Since l/e < 1,the series converges.) A slightly different use of the comparison test yields the ratio test.) THEOREM 10.13. RATIO TEST. Let 2 an be a series of positive terms such that) a n+1 --+L an) as n -+ 00 .) ( a) If L < 1, the series converges. (b) If L > 1, the series diverges. (c) If L = 1, the test is inconclusive.) Proof Assume L < 1 and choose x so that L < x < 1. Then there must be an N such that an+1/a n < x for all n > N. This implies) an+l an-<- X n+ 1 X n) for all n > N .))) The root test and the ratio test for series of nonnegative terms) 401) In other words, the sequence{an/xn} is decreasing for n > N. In particular, when n > N, we must have an/x n < a\\037v/xN, or, in other words,) an < cx n ,) where) aN c = N. x) Therefore L an is dominated by the convergent series L x n . This proves (a). To prove (b),we simply observe that L > I impliesan + 1 > an for all n > N for some N, and hence an cannot approach O. Finally, (c) is proved by using the same examples as in Theorem 10.12.) Warning. If the test ratio a n + 1/a n is always less than I, it does not necessarily follow that the limit L will be less than 1. For example, the harmonic series, which diverges, has test ratio n/(n + 1) which is always less than 1 but the limit L equals 1. On the other hand, for divergence it is sufficient that the test ratio be greaterthan 1 for all sufficiently large n because for such n we have a n + 1 > an and an cannot approach O.) EXAMPLE 3. We may establish the convergence of the series L n !/nn by the ratio test. The ratio of consecutive terms is) a n+ 1 (n + I)! n n ( n ) n 1 1 -;: = (n + 1) n+ 1 . n! = n + 1 = (1 + 1/n ) n -+ \\037) as n -+ 00 ,) by formula (10.13) of Section 10.2. Sincel/e < 1,the series converges. In particular, this implies that the general term of the series tends to 0; that is,) ( 10.44 )) n! 0--+ nn) as n -+ 00 .) This is often described by saying that nn \\\"grows faster\\\" than n! for large n. Also, with a natural extension of the o-notation, we can write (10.44) as follows: n! = o(nn) as Il -+ 00. Note: The relation (10.44) may also be proved directly by writing) n! 1 2) k k + 1) n) nn n n) n) n) n) where k = nl2 if n is even, and k = (n - 1 )/2 if n is odd. If n > 2, the product of the first k factors on the right does not exceed (i)k, and each of the remaining factors does not exceed 1. Since (i)k \\037 0 as n -+ 00, this proves (10.44). Relation (10.44) also follows from (10.41). The reader should realize that both the root test and the ratio test are, in reality, special cases of the comparison test. In both tests when we have case (a), convergence is deduced from the fact that the series in question can be dominated by a suitable geometric series L x n . The usefulness of these tests in practice is that a knowledge of a particular com parison series L x n is not explicitly required. Further convergence tests may be deduced by using the comparison test in other ways. Two important examples known as Raabe's test and Gauss' test are describedin Exercises 16 and 17 of Section 10.16.Theseare often helpful when the ratio test fails.))) 402) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) 10.16 Exercises) Test the following series for convergence or divergenceand give a reason for your decision in each case.) \\037 (n !)2 1.

For this example the ratio test fails.) 10.17 Alternating series) Up to now we have been concerned largely with series of nonnegative terms. We wish to turn our attention next to serieswhose terms may be positive or negative. The simplest examplesoccurwhen the terms alternate in sign. These are called alternating series and they have the form) (10.45)) 00 .2 (-1)n- l a n = a l - a 2 + a 3 - a4 +... + (-l)n- la n +..., n=l) where each an > O. Examples of alternating series were known to many early investigators. We have already mentioned the logarithmic series) x 2 x 3 x 4 x n log (1 + x) = x - 2:+ 3 - \\\"4 + . . . + (_1)n-l -; + . . . .) As we shall prove later on, this series converges and has the sum log (I + x) whenever -1 < x < 1. For positive x, it is an alternating series. In particular, when x = 1 we obtain the formula) (10.46)) 1 1 1 (_1)n-l log 2 = 1 - - + - - - + . . . + + . . . 2 3 4 n ') which tells us that the alternating harmonic series has the sum log 2. This result is of special interest in view of the fact that the harmonic series .2 1In diverges. Closely related to (10.46) is the interesting formula) (10.47)) 7r 1 1 1 ( _1)n-l -=1--+---+\\\"'+ +... 4 3 5 7 2n - 1) discovered by James Gregory in 1671. Leibniz rediscovered this result in 1673 while computing the area of a unit circular disk. Both series in (10.46) and in (10.47) are alternating seriesof the form (10.45) in which the sequence {an}decreasesmonotonically to zero. Leibniz noticed, in 1705, that this simple property of the an implies the convergence of any alternating series.))) 404) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) THEOREM 10.14. LEIBNIZ'S RULE. If {an} is a monotonic decreasing sequence with limit 0, then the alternating series .L:=l (-I)n-1a n converges. If S denotes its sum and Sn its nth partial sum, lve also have the inequalities) (10.48)) o < (-1 )n(s - sn) < an+l) for each n > 1 .) The inequalities in (10.48) provide a useful way to estimate the error in approximating the sum S by any partial sum Sn' The first inequality tells us that the error, S - Sn , has the sign (-I)n, which is the same as the sign of the first neglected term, ( -1 )nan+l' The second inequality states that the absolute value of this error is less than that of the first neglected term.) 5n, n even 5n, n odd . \\037 52 54 56 5z n 5z n - I 55 53 51 . . . . . . . . \\037 a 2n --1) FIGURE 10.5 Proof of Leibniz's rule for alternating series.) Proof The idea of the proof of Leibniz's rule is quite simple and is illustrated in Figure 10.5. The partial sums S2n (consisting of an even number of terms) form an increasing sequence because s2n+2 - S2n = a 2n + 1 - a 2n + 2 > O. Similarly, the partial sums S2n-lform a decreasing sequence. Both sequences are boundedbelow by S2 and above by Sl' There- fore, each sequence{S2n} and {S2n-l}, being monotonic and bounded, converges to a limit, say S2n ---+ S', and S2n-l ---+ S\\\". But S' = S\\\" because) S' - S\\\" = lim S2n - lim S2n-l = lim (S2n - S2n-l) = lim (-a2n) = 0 .) n-+ 00) n-+ 00) n-+ 00) n-+ 00) If we denote this common limit by S, it is clear that the series converges and has sum S. To derive the inequalities in (10.48) we argue as follows: SinceS2n)1 and S2n-l\\037' we have) S2n < s2n+2 < S) and) S < s2n+l < S2n-l) for all n > 1 .) Therefore we have the inequalities) o < S - S2n < s2n+l - S2n = a 2n + 1) and) o < S2n-l - S < S2n-l - S2n = a2n ,) which, taken together, yield (10.48). This completes the proof.) EXAMPLE 1. Since Iln \\037 and Iln ---+ 0 as n ---+ 00, the convergence of the alternating harmonic series1 - ! + ! - ! + .. \\302\\267is an immediate consequence of Leibniz'srule. The sum of this series is computed below in Example 4.) EXAMPLE 2. The alternating series .L (-I)n (log n)ln converges. To prove this using Leibniz's rule, we must show that (log n)ln ---+ 0 as n ---+ 00 and that (log n)ln\\037. The first))) Alternating series) 405) statement follows from Equation (10.11)of Section 10.2. To prove the second statement, we note that the functionffor which) f(x) = log x x) when x > 0) has the derivativef'(x) = (1 - log x)/x 2 . When x > e, this is negative andfis monotonic decreasing. In particular,fen + 1)< fen) for n > 3.) EXAMPLE 3. An important limit relation may be derived as a consequence of Leibniz's rule. Let) a 1 = 1 ,) a = f2 dx 2 Jl X ') a _I 3 - \\\"2,) a 4 = (3 dx , J2 X) . .. ,) where, in general,) 1 a 2n -l = - n) and) a = I n+l dx 2n Xn) for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . .) It is easy to verify that an -----* 0 as n -----* 00 and that an \\037. Hence the series 2 (-I)n- 1a n converges. Denote its sum by C and its nth partial sum by Sn' The (2n - l)st partial sum may be expressed as follows:) S2n-l= 1 _ (2 dx + ! _ (3 dx + . . . + 1 _ I n dx + ! Jl x 2 J2 x n - 1 n-l X n) 1 1 i n dx 1 1 = 1 + - + . . . + - - - = 1 + - + . . . + - - log n . 2 nix 2 n) Since S2n-l -----* C as n -----* 00, we obtain the following limit formula:) (10.49)) lim ( 1 + ! + . . . + ! - log n ) = C . n-+oo 2 n) The number C defined by this limit is called Euler's constant (sometimesdenoted by y). Like 1T and e, this number appears in many analytic formulas. Its value, correct to ten decimals, is 0.5772156649. An interesting problem, unsolved to this time, is to decide whether Euler's constant is rational or irrational. Relation (10.49)can alsobe expressed as follows:) (10.50)) n 1 2: k = log n + C + 0(1) k=1) as n -----* 00 .) From this it follows that the ratio (1 + l + . \\302\\267. + l/n)/log n -----* 1 as n -----* 00, so the partial sums of the harmonic series are asymptotically equal to log n. That is, we have) n 1 2: k ,......,log n k=1) as n -----* 00 .))) 406) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) The relation (10.50) not only explains why the harmonic series diverges,but it also gives us some concreteidea of the rate of growth of its partial sums. In the next example we use this relation to prove that the alternating harmonic series has the sum log 2.) EXAMPLE 4. Let Srn = I\\037=l (-I)k-l/k. We know that Sm tends to a limit as m -+ 00, and we shall prove now that this limit is log 2. When m is even, say m = 2n, we may separate the positive and negative terms to obtain) n 1 n 1 ( 2n 1 n 1 ) n 1 2n t n 1 S2n = 6 2k - 1- \\037 2k = \\037 k - \\037 2k - \\037 2k = 6 k - 6 k \\302\\267) Applying (10.50) to each sum on the extreme right, we obtain) S2n = (log 2n + C + 0(1))- (log n + C + 0(1)) = log 2 + 0(1),) so S2n -+ log 2 as n -+ 00. This proves that the sum of the alternating harmonic series is log 2.) 10.18 Conditionaland absolute convergence Although the alternating harmonic series I (-1 )n-l/n is convergent, the series obtained by replacing each term by its absolute value is divergent. This shows that, in general, convergence of I an does not imply convergence of I lanl. In the other direction, we have the following theorem.) THEOREM 10.15. Assume I lanl converges. Then I an also converges, and we have) 00 00 (10.51) I an < I lanl . n=l n=l) Proof Assume first that the terms an are real. Let b n = an + lanl. We shall prove that I bn converges. It then follows (by Theorem 10.2)that I an converges because an = b n - Ian I. Since b n is either 0 or 2 lanl, we have 0 < b n < 2la n l, and hence I lanl don1inates I b n . Therefore I b n converges and, as already mentioned, this implies convergence of I an . Now suppose the terms an are complex, sayan = Un + iVn , where Un and V n are real. Since lunl < Ian I, convergence of I Ian I implies convergence of I lunl and this, in turn, implies convergenceof I Un , since the Un are real. Similarly, I V n converges. By linearity, the series L (un + iv n ) converges. TQ prove (10.51), we note that II\\037=l akl < I\\037=l lakl, and then we let n -+ 00.) DEFINITION. A series I an is called absolutely convergent if I lanl converges. It is called conditionally convergent if I an converges but I lanl diverges.) If I an and I b n are absolutely convergent, then so is the seriesL (rxa n + (3b n ) for every))) The convergence tests of Dirichlet and Abel) 407) choice of a and fJ. This follows at once from the inequalities) M M M 00 00 !Ioca n + fJbnl < lal!lanl + IPI!lbnl < locl!lanl + IPlllbnl, n=l n=l n=l n=l n=l) which show that the partial sums of !Iocan + Pbnl are bounded.) 10.19 The convergence tests of Dirichlet and Abel The convergencetests of the earlier sections that were developedfor series of nonnegative ternlS may also be used to test absolute convergence of a serieswith arbitrary complex terms. In this section we discuss two tests that are often useful for determining convergence when the series might not converge absolutely. Both tests make use of an algebraic identity known as the Abel partial summation formula, named in honor of the Norwegian mathe- matician Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829). Abel's formula is analogous to the formula for integration by parts and may be describedas follows.) THEOREM 10.16. ABEL'S PARTIAL SUMMATION FORMULA. Let {an} and {bn } be t\\037'o sequences of complex numbers, and let) n An = !a k . k=l) Then H'e have the identity) n n (10.52) ! alcb k = An b n+l + ! Ak(b k - bk + 1) . k=l k=l) Proof If we define Ao = 0, then ak = Ak - A k- 1 for each k = 1,2, . . . , n, so we have) n n n n \\037 akb k = ! (A k - A k- 1)b k = 1 Akbk - ! Ak b k+l + An b n+l , k=l k=l k=l k=l) which gives us (10.52).) If we let n -----* 00 in (10.52), we see that the series L akbk converges if both the series ! Ak(b k - bk + 1) and the sequence {A nbn+l} converge. The next two tests give sufficient conditions for these to converge.) THEOREM 10.17. DIRICHLET'S TEST. Let L an be a series of complex terms whose partial sums form a bounded sequence. Let {b n } be a decreasing sequence which converges to O. Then the series! anb n converges.) Proof Using the notation of Theorem 10.16, there is an M > 0 such that IAnl < M for all n. Therefore Anbn+l -----* 0 as n -----* 00. To establish convergence of ! anb n , we need only show that the series! Ak(b k - bk + 1) is convergent. Since bn \\037, we have the inequality) IAk(b k - bk + 1) I < M(b k - bk + 1) .))) 408) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) But the series 2 (bk - bk + 1) is a convergent telescopingserieswhich dominates) 2 Ak(bk - bk + 1) \\302\\267) This implies absolute convergence and hence convergence of 2 Ak(b k - bk + 1).) THEOREM 10.18. ABEL'S TEST. Let 2 an be a convergent series of complex terms and let {bn } be a monotonic convergent sequenceof real terms. Then the series 2 anb n converges.) Proof Again we use the notation of Theorem 10.16. Convergence of 2 an implies convergence of the sequence {An} and hence of the sequence {Anbn+l}' Also, {An} is a bounded sequence. The rest of the proof is similar to that of Dirichlet's test.) To use Dirichlet's test effectively, we need some examples of series having bounded partial sums. Of course, every convergent serieshas this property. An important example of a divergent series with bounded partial sums is the geometric series2 x n , where x is a complex number with Ixl = 1 but x \\037 1. The next theorem gives an upper bound for the partial sums of this series. When Ixl = 1, we may write x = e2iO , where () is real, and we have the following.) THEOREM 10.19.) For every real 0 not an integer nzultiple of 1T, we have the identity) (10.53)) 2: n 2ikO sin n() i(n+l)Oe = e sin () , k=l) from \\\",'hich we obtain the estimate) (10.54)) \\037 e 2ikO < 1 L - Isin 01 k=l) Proof) If x \\037 1, the partial sums of the geometricseriesare given by) n x n - 1 \\037 Xk = X .

Exercises) 409) EXAMPLES. Assume {bn } is any decreasing sequence of real numbers with limit O. Taking an = x n in Dirichlet's test, where x is complex, Ixl = 1, x \\037 1, we find that the series) (10.55)) 00 2 bnx n n=l) converges. Note that Leibniz's rule for alternating series is merely the special case in which x = -1. If we write x = e i8 , where () is real but not an integer multiple of 21T, and consider the real and imaginary parts of (10.55),we deduce that the two trigonometric series) 00 2 b n cos n() n=l) and) 00 2 b n sin n() n=l) converge.

In 1833Cauchy made the surprising discovery that this is not always true for infinite series. For example, consider the alternating harmonic series) (10.56)) 1 - 1+ 1 - .1 + 1.- .1+ - \\302\\267. . - log 2 f2 3 4 5 6 -.) The convergence of this series to the sum log 2 was shown in Section 10.17. If we rearrange the terms of this series, taking alternately two positive terms followed by one negative term, we get a new series which can be designated as follows:) (10.57)) 1 + l - ! + ! + \\037- ! + i + -t1.f - t + + - . . .) Each term which occurs in the alternating harmonic series occurs exactly once in this rearrangement, and vice versa. But we can easily prove that this new series has a sum greater than log 2. We proceed as follows: Let t n denote the nth partial sum of (10.57).If n is a multiple of 3, say n = 3m, the partial sum t 3m contains 2m positive terms and m negative terms and is given by) t 3m = ?; 2k \\037 1 - \\037 2 1 k = ( 2: i - \\037 2\\037 ) - \\037 \\037 \\037 = \\037 \\037- \\037 \\037 \\037- \\037 \\037 i \\302\\267) In each of the last three sums, we use the asymptotic relation) n 1 2 k = log n + C + 0(1) k=l) as n \\037 00 ,) to obtain) 13m = (log 4nl + C + 0(1)) - !(log 2m + C + 0(1)) - !(log m + C + 0(1)) = ! log 2 + 0(1) .))) 412) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) Thus t 3rn \\037! log 2 as m \\037 00. But t 3m + 1 = t 3m + Ij(4m + 1) and t 3m - 1 = t 3m - Ij(2m), so t 3rn + 1 and t 3m - 1 have the same limit as t 3m when m \\037 00. Therefore, every partial sum t n has the limit! log 2 as n \\037 00, so the sum of the series in (10.57) is ! log 2. The foregoing example shows that rearrangement of the terms of a convergent series may alter its sum. We shall prove next that this can happen only if the given series is conditionally convergent. That is, rearrangement of an absolutely convergent series does not alter its sum. Before we prove this, we will explain more precisely what is meant by a rearrangement.) DEFINITION. Let P = {I, 2, 3, . . .}denote the set of positive integers. Letf be a function whose domain is P and whose range is P, and assumef has the following property:) m \\037n) implies f(m) \\037fen) .) Such a function f is calleda permutation of P, or a one-to-one mapping of P onto itself. If 2 an and 2 b n are two series such that for every n > 1 we have) b n = af(n)) for some permutation f, then the series 2 b n is said to be a rearrangementof 2 an \\302\\267) EXAMPLE. If L an denotes the alternating harmonic series in (10.56) and if 2 bn denotes the series in (10.57), we have bn = af(n) , wherefis the permutation defined by the formulas) f(3n + 1) = 4n + 1 ,) f(3n + 2) = 4n + 3 ,) f(3n + 3) = 2n + 2 .) THEOREM 10.20. Let L an be an absolutely convergent series having sum S. Then every rearrangement oj'2 an also converges absolutely and has sum S.) Proof Let L b n be a rearrangement, say b n = af(n)' F'irst we note that 2 b n converges absolutely because 21b n l is a series of nonnegative terms whose partial sums are bounded above by 2 lanl. To prove that 2 b n also has sum S, we introduce) n En = L bk , k=l) n An = 2 ak , k=l) n A:=2I akl, k=l) and) 00 S* = 2la kl. k=l) Now An \\037 S and A\\037 \\037 S* as n \\037 00. Therefore, given any E > 0, there is an N such that) E IAN - 51 < - 2) and) IA\\037 - 5*1 < \\037. 2) For this N we can choose M so that) { 1, 2, . . . , N} c {f (1),f (2), \\302\\267\\302\\267. , f ( M)} .))) Rearrangements of series) 413) This is possiblebecausethe range of fincludes all the positive integers. If n > M, we have) \\342\\202\\254 (10.58) IBn - SI = IBn - AN + AN - SI < IBn - ANI + IAN - SI < IBn - ANI + 2 \\302\\267) But we also have) n N IBn - ANI = '2b k - '2a k k=l k=l) n N - '2a f (k) - '2 a k k=l k=l) The terms a 1 , . . . , a1v cancel in the subtraction, so we have) * \\342\\202\\254 IBn - ANI < I aN+1 I + laN+21 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= IAN - S*I< 2 .) Combining this with (10.58), we see that IBn - SI < \\342\\202\\254for all n > M, which means that En \\037 S as n \\037 00. This proves that the rearranged series'2 b n has sum S.) The hypothesis of absolute convergence in Theorem 10.20 is essential. Riemann dis- covered that a conditionally convergentseriesofrealterms can always be rearranged to give a serieswhich converges to any preassigned sum. Riemann's argun1ent is based on a special property of conditionally convergent series of real terms. Such a series'2 an has infinitely many positive terms and infinitely many negative terms. Consider the two new series '2 a\\037 and '2 a\\037 obtained by taking the positive terms alone and the negative terms alone. More specifically, definea\\037 and a\\037 as follows:) (10.59)) + an + lanl an = , 2) an - lanl a =n 2) If an is positive, then a\\037 = an and a\\037 = 0; if an is negative, then a\\037 = an and a\\037 = O. The two new series '2 a\\037 and L a-;; are related to the given series '2 an as follows.) THEOREM 10.21. Given a series Lan of real terms, define a\\037 and a\\037 by (10.59). (a) IfL an is conditional(y convergent, both '2 a\\037 and '2 a-;; diverge. (b) If '2 an is absolutely convergent, both '2 a\\037 and '2 a-;; converge, and M,'e have) ( 10.60)) 00 00 00 Lan = '2 a\\037 + '2 a-;; . n=l n=l n=l) Proof To prove part (a), we note that '2 lan converges and '2 !Ianldiverges. Therefore, by the linearity property (Theorem 10.3)'2 a\\037 diverges and '2 a\\037 diverges. To prove part (b), we note that both L lan and L !Ianl converge, so by the linearity property (Theorem 10.2)both '2 a\\037 and L a-;; converge. Since an = a\\037 + a-;; , we also obtain (10.60).) Now we can easily prove Riemann's rearrangement theorem.) THEOREM 10.22. Let '2 an be a conditionally convergent series of real terms, and let S be a given real number. Then there is a rearrangement '2 b n of '2 an which converges to the sum S.))) 414) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) Proof Define a\\037 and a; as indicated in (10.59). Both series ! a\\037 and! a; diverge since! an is conditionally convergent. We rearrange! an as follows: Take, in order, just enough positive terms a\\037 so that their sum exceeds S. If PI positive terms are reg uired, we have) PI ! an > S n=l) but) q ! an < S n=l) if q < PI .) This is always possible since the partial sums of ! a\\037 tend to + 00. To this sum we add just enough negative terms a; , say n l negative terms, so that the resulting sum is less than S. This is possible since the partial sums of a-;; tend to - 00. Thus, we have) PI nl ! a\\037 + ! a;;< S n=l n=l) but) PI m ! a-;; + L a-;; > S n=l n=l) if m < n l .) Now we repeat the process, addingjust enough new positive terms to make the sum exceed S, and then just enough new negative terms to make the sum less than S. Continuing in this way, we obtain a rearrangement! bn . Each partial sum of ! b n differs from S by at most one term a\\037 or a-;;. But an -+ 0 as n -+ 00 since! an converges, so the partial sums of ! b n tend to S. This proves that the rearranged series! b n converges and has sum S, as asserted.) 10.22 Miscellaneo us re view exercises 1. (a) Let an = V n + 1 - V;;. Compute limn__oo an .

The scope of integration theory may be extended by relaxing these restrictions. To begin with, we may study the behavior of S\\037f(x) dx as b ----+ + 00. This leads to the notion of an infinite integral (also called an improper integral of the first kind) denoted by the symbol S: f(x) dx. Another extension is obtained if we keep the interval [a, b] finite and allow f to become unbounded at one or more points. The new integrals so obtained (by a suitable limit process) are called improper integrals of the second kind. To distinguish the integrals of Chapter 1 from improper integrals, the former are often called \\\"proper\\\" integrals. Many important functions in analysis appear as improper integrals of one kind or another, and a detailed study of such functions is ordinarily undertaken in courses in advanced calculus. We shall be concernedhere only with the most elementary aspects of the theory. In fact, we shall merely state some definitions and theorems and give some examples. It will be evident presently that the definitions pertaining to improper integrals bear a strong resemblance to those for infinite series. Therefore it is not surprising that many of the elementary theorems on series have direct analogs for improper integrals. If the proper integral S\\037f(x) dx exists for every b > a, we may define a new function I as follows:) I(b) = f f(x) dx) for each b > a .) The function I defined in this way is called an infinite integral, or an improper integral of the first kind, and it is denoted by the symbol S: f(x) dx. The integral is said to converge if the limit) (10.61)) lim I(b) = Iim J b f(x) dx b-++oo b-++oo a) exists and is finite. Otherwise, the integral S: f(x) dx is said to diverge. If the limit in (10.61) exists and equals A, the number A is called the value of the integral, and we write) f' f(x) dx = A \\302\\267) These definitions are similar to those given for infinite series. The function values I(b) play the role of the \\\"partial sums\\\" and may be referred to as \\\"partial integrals.\\\" Note that the symbol S: f(x) dx is used both for the integral and for the value of the integral when the integral converges. (Compare with the remarks near the end of Section 10.5.)))) Improper integrals) 417) EXAMPLE 1. The improper integral S\\037 x- S dx converges if s > 1 and diverges if s < 1. To prove this, we note that) { b1- S - 1 I(b) = J: x-s dx = 1 - s log b) if s \\302\\245=1 ,) if s = 1 .) Therefore I(b) tends to a finite limit if and only if s > 1, in which case the linlit is) 1 00 1 x- s dx = - . 1 S - 1) The behavior of this integral IS analogous to that of the serIes for the zeta-function, '(s) = 2\\0371n- S .) EXAMPLE 2. The integral S: sin x dx diverges because) I(b) = JOb sin x dx = 1 - cosb ,) and this does not tend to a limit as b ----+ + 00.) Infinite integrals of the form S\\037oo f(x) dx are similarly defined. Also, if S\\037oo f(x) dx and S: f(x) dx are both convergent for some c, we say that the integral S\\037oo f{x) dx is convergent, and its value is defined to be the sum) (10.62)) L:f(x) dx = t:J(x) dx + f') f(x) dx .) (It is easy to show that the choice of c is unimportant.) The integral S\\037oo f(x) dx is said to diverge if at least one of the integrals on the right of (10.62) is divergent.) EXAMPLE 3. The integral S\\037oo e- a1xl dx converges if a > 0, for if b > 0, we have) f b f b e- ab - 1 1 e- a / x / dx = e- ax dx = ----+ - o 0 -a a) as b ----+ 00 .) Hence S: e- a1xl dx converges and has the value 1ja. Also, if b > 0, we have) f o e-alx/ dx = f o eax dx = - fO e- at dt = f b e-at dt . -b -b .. b 0) Therefore S\\037oo e- a1xl dx also converges and has the value Ija. Hence we have S\\037oo e- a1xl dx = 2ja. Note, however, that the integral S\\037oo e- ax dx diverges because S\\037oo e- ax dx diverges.) As in the case of series, we have various convergence tests for improper integrals. The simplest of these refers to a positive integrand.))) 418) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) THEOREM 10.23. Assume that the proper integral S\\037f(x) dx exists for each b > a and supposethat f(x) > 0 for all x > a. Then S: f(x) dx converges if and only if there is a constant M > 0 such that) t f(x) dx < M) Jor every b > a .) This theorem forms the basis for the following comparison tests.) THEOREM 10.24. Assume the proper integral S\\037f(x) dx exists for each b > a and suppose that 0 < f(x) < g(x)for all x > a, where S: g(x) dx converges. Then S: f(x) dx also converges and) f' f(x) dx < Loo g(x) dx .) Note: The integral S: g(x)dx is said to dominate the integral S: I(x) dx.) THEOREM 10.25. LIMIT COMPARISON TEST. Assume both proper integrals S\\037f(x) dx and S\\037g(x) dx exist for each b > a, \\037'here f(x) > 0 and g(x) > 0for all x > a. If) (10.63)) Jim J(x) = c , x-++oo g(x) then both integrals S: f(x) dx and S: g(x) dx converge or both diverge.) where c \\037 0 ,) Note: If the limit in (10.63) is 0, we can conclude only that convergence of S: g(x)dx implies convergence of S: I(x) dx. The proofs of Theorem 10.23 through 10.25 are similar to the corresponding results for series and are left as exercises.) EXAMPLE 4. For each real s, the integral S\\037 e-Xx S dx converges. This is seen by com- parison with S\\037 x- 2 dx since e- X x S/x- 2 \\037 0 as x \\037 + 00.) Improper integrals of the second kind may be introduced as follows: Supposef is defined on the half-open interval (a, b], and assume that the integral S\\037f(t) dt exists for each x satisfying a < x < b. Definea new function I as follows:) l(x) = 1:f(t) dt) if a < x < b .) The function I so defined is called an improper integral of the second kind and is denoted by the symbol S\\037+f(t) dt. The integral is said to converge if the limit) (10.64)) lim lex) = lim J b J(t) dt x-+a+ x-+a+ x) exists and is finite. Otherwise, the integral S\\037+f(t) dt is said to diverge. If the limit in (10.64) exists and equals A, the number A is called the value of the integral, and we write) J b J(t) dt = A . a+))) Improper integrals) 419) EXAMPLE 5. Letf(t) = t- S if t > O. If b > 0 and x > 0, we have) (b 1-S l-s-x l(x) = I: t- S dt = 1 - s log b - log x) if s \\302\\245=1 ,) if s = 1 .) When x \\037 0+, I(x) tends to a finite limit if and only if s < 1. Hencethe integral S\\037+ t- S dt converges if s < 1 and divergesif s > 1. This example may be dealt with in another way. If we introduce the substitution t = l/u, dt = -u- 2 du, we obtain) J b J 1/X t- S dt = u s- 2 du . x l/b) When x \\037 0+, l/x \\037 + 00 and hence Sg+ t- S dt = S\\037b US- 2 du, provided the last integral converges. By Example 1, this converges if and only if s - 2 < -1, which means s < 1.) The foregoing exan1ple illustrates a remarkable geometric fact. Consider the function I defined by the equation I(x) = X- 3/4 if 0 < x < 1. The integral S\\037+/(x) dx converges, but the integral f\\037+ TTf'2(X) dx diverges. Geometrically, this means that the ordinate set of f has a finite area, but the solid obtained by rotating this ordinate set about the x-axis has an infinite volunle. Improper integrals of the form f\\037- f(t) dt are defined in a similar fashion. If the two integrals S\\037+f(t) dt and S\\037-f(t) dt both converge, we write) J b- J(t) dt = J c J(t) dt + J b-J(t) dt . a+ a+ c) Note: Some authors write S\\037where we have written S\\037+ . The definition can be extended(in an obvious way) to cover the case of any finite number of summands. For example, if f is undefined at two points c < d interior to an interval [a, b], we say the improper integral S\\037/(t) dt converges and has the value S\\037-f(t) dt + S\\037\\037f(t) dt + S\\037+f(t) dt, provided that each of these integrals converges. Furthermore, we can consider \\\"mixed\\\" combinations such as S:+f(t) dt + S: I(t) dt which we write as S\\037f(t) dt, or mixed combinations of the form S\\037-f(t) dt + Sg+f(t) dt + se; f(t) dt which we write simply as f: f(t) dt.) EXAMPLE 6. The gamma function. If s > 0 the integral S: e- t t S- 1 dt converges. This must be interpreted as a sum, say) (10.65)) I;+ e-ftS- 1 dt + I100 e-ft s- 1 dt .) The second integral converges for all real s, by Example 4. To test the first integral we put t = l/u and note that) I 1 I 1/X -l t s-1 dt - -l/u -s-l d x e - 1 e u u.))) 420) Sequences, infinite series, improper integrals) But f\\037 e- 1!uu-S-1 du converges for s > 0 by comparison with S\\037 u- S- 1 duo Therefore the integral S\\037+ e- t t S- 1 dt converges for s > O. When s > 0, the sum in (10.65) is denoted by r(s). The function r so defined is called the gamma function, first introduced by Euler in 1729. It has the interesting property that r(n + 1) = n! when n is any integer > 0. (See Exercise 19 of Section 10.24 for an outline of the proof.)) The convergence tests given in Theorems 10.23 through 10.25 have straightforward analogs for improper integrals of the second kind.

Now we wish to consider sequences {fn} whose terms are real- or complex-valued functions having a common domain on the real line or in the complex plane. For each x in the domain, we can form another sequence{fn(x)} of numbers whose terms are the corre- sponding function values. Let S denote the set of pointsx for which this sequence converges. The functionf defined on S by the equation) lex) = Iim !n(x)) if XES,) n-+ 00) is called the limit function of the sequence{fn},and we say that the sequence {fn} converges pointwise to f on the set S. The study of such sequences is concerned primarily with the following type of question: If each term of a sequence {fn} has a certain property, such as continuity, differentiability, or integrability, to what extent is this property transferred to the limit function? For example, if each function fn is continuous at a point x, is the limit function f also continuous at x? The following example shows that, in general, it is not.) EXAMPLE 1. A sequence of continuous functions 1y1'ith a discontinuous limit function. Let fn(x) = x n if 0 < x < 1. The graphs of a few terms are shown in Figure 11.1. The sequence {fn} convergespointwise on the closed interval [0, 1], and its limit function f is given by the formula) !(X) = lim xn = { o n-+ 00 1) if 0 < x < 1 , if x = 1 .) Note that the limit function f is discontinuous at 1, although each term of the sequenceis continuous in the entire interval [0, 1].) EXAMPLE 2. A sequence for which lim n -+ oo S:fn(x) dx \\302\\245=S\\037limn-+oofn(x) dx. Letfn(x) = nx(1 - x2)n for 0 < x < 1. In this example, the sequence {fn} converges pointwise to a limit function f which is 0 everywhere in the closed interval [0, 1]. A few terms of the 422))) Uniform convergence of sequences of functions) 423) sequence are shown in Figure 11.2. The integral of fn over the interval [0, 1] is given by) 1 1 1 1 n (1 x2)n+1 1 n !n(X) dx = n X(! - X2)n dx = - - - = . o 0 2 n + 1 0 2( n + 1)) Therefore we have limn\\037oo S5fn(x) dx = I, but S5 lim n--+oo fn(x) dx = O. In other words, the limit of the integrals is not equal to the integral of the limit. This example shows that) x) x) (1,1)) o) o) FIGURE 11.1 A sequence of continuous func- tions with a discontinuous limit function.)

(Seealso Exercises 17 and 18 in Section 11.7.) George G. Stokes (1819-1903), Phillip L. v. Seidel (1821-1896),and Karl Weierstrass were the first to realize that some extra condition is neededto justify interchanging these operations. In 1848, Stokes and Seidel (independently and almost simultaneously) intro- duced a concept now known as uniform convergence and showed that for a uniformly convergent sequence the operations of limit and integration could be interchanged. Weierstrass later showed that the concept is of great importance in advanced analysis. We shall introduce the concept in the next section and show its relation to continuity and to integration.) 11.2 Uniform convergence of sequences of functions Let {fn} be a sequence which converges pointwise on a set S to a limit function! By the definition of limit, this means that for each x in S and for each \\342\\202\\254> 0 there is an integer N, which depends on both x and \\342\\202\\254,such that Ifn(x) - f(x) I < \\342\\202\\254whenever n > N. If the same N servesequally well for all points x in S, then the convergence is said to be uniform on S. That is, we have the following.))) 424) Sequences and series of functions) DEFINITION. A sequence of functions {fn} is said to convergeuniformly to.f on a set S iffor every \\342\\202\\254> 0 there is an N (dependingonly on \\342\\202\\254)such that n > N implies) Ifn(X) - f(x) I < \\342\\202\\254)for all x in S .) We denote this symbolically by writing) fn \\037 f uniformly on S \\302\\267) f-E) FIGURE 11.3 Geometric meaning of uniform convergence. If n > N, the entire graph of eachIn lieswithin a distance E from the graph of the limit function f) When the functions fn are real-valued, there is a simple geometric interpretation of uniform convergence. The inequality Ifn(x) - f(X) I < \\342\\202\\254is equivalent to the pair of inequalities) f(x) - \\342\\202\\254<fn(x) <f(x) + \\342\\202\\254.) If these hold for all n > N and every x in S, then the entire graph of fn above S lies within a band of height 2\\342\\202\\254situated symmetrically about the graph off, as indicated in Figure 11.3.) 11.3 Uniform convergence and continuity Now we prove that uniform convergence transmits continuity from the individual terms of the sequence {fn} to the limit function f) THEOREM 11.1 Assu/ne fn \\037 f uniformly on an interval S. If each function fn is con- tinuous at a point p in S, then the limit function f is also continuous at p.)

Since each term on the right is < Ej3, we find If(x) - f(p) I < E, which completes the proof.) The foregoing theorem has an important application to infinite series of functions. If the function values fn(x) are partial sums of other func;tions, say) n fn(x) = ! uk(x) , k=l) and if fn \\037 f pointwise on S, then we have) 00 j'(x) = lim fn(x) = L uk(x) n-+ 00 k=l) for each x in S. In this case, the series! Uk is said to converge pointwise to the sum function f If fn \\037 f uniformly on S, we say the series! Uk converges uniformly to f If each term Uk is continuous at a point P in S, then each partial sum fn is also continuous at P so, from Theoren1 11.1, we obtain the following corollary.) THEOREM 11.2. If a series of functions! Uk converges uniforn1ly to a sum function f on a set S, and if each term Uk is continuous at a point p in S, then the sUln f is a/so continuous at p.) Note: We can also express this result symbolically by writing) 00 00 lim L Uk(X) = ! lim Uk(X), x-pk=l k=lX-P) We describe this by saying that for a uniformly convergent series we may irlterchange the limit symbol with the summation symbol, or that we can pass to the limit term by term.) 11.4 Uniform convergence and integration) The next theorem shows that uniform convergence allows us to interchange the integration symbol with the limit symbol.) THEOREM 11.3. Assulne fn \\037 f unifornlly on an interval [a, b], and assulne that each function fn is continuous on [a, b].

Given E > 0, there is an integer N such that n > N implies) E Ifn(t) - f(t)1 < b _ a) for all t in [a, b].)

A sufficient condition for uniform convergence) 427) Theorem 11.4 is often described by saying that a uniformly convergent series may be integrated term by term.) 11.5 A sufficient condition for uniform convergence Weierstrassdeveloped a useful test for showing that certain series are uniformly con- vergent. The test is applicable wheneverthe given series can be dominated by a convergent series of positive constants.) THEOREM 11.5. THE WEIERSTRASS M-TEST. Given a series o.ffunctions I Un H'hich con- verges pointwise to a function f on a set S. If there is a convergent series of positiveconstants I M n such that) o < lun(x)1 < M n) for every 11 > 1 and every x in S ,) then the series I Un converges uniforn1ly on S.) Proof The comparisontest shows that the series I un(x) converges absolutely for each x in S. For each x in S, we have) n f(x) - I Ulc(X) - k=1) 00 OC; 00 I Uk(X) < I luk(x)1 < I M k . k=n+1 k=n+1 k=n+1) Since the series I Mlc converges, for every \\342\\202\\254> 0 there is an integer N such that n > N implies) 00 I M k < \\342\\202\\254. k=n+1) This shows that) n f(x) - Z Uk(X) < \\342\\202\\254 11=1) for all n > N and every x in S. Therefore, the series I Un converges uniformly to f on S.) Term-by-term differentiation of an arbitrary series of functions is even less promising than term-by-term integration. For example, the series I:=1 (sin nx)/n 2 converges for all real x because it is dominated by I l/n 2 . Moreover, the convergence is uniform on the wholereal axis. However, the series obtained by differentiating term by term is \\037 (cos nx)/n, and this diverges when x = O. This example shows that tern1-by-term differentiation may destroy convergence, even though the original series is uniformly convergent. Therefore, the problem of justifying the interchange of the operations of differentiation and summation is, in general, more serious than in the case of integration. We mention this example so the reader may realize that familiar manipulations with finite sums do not always carryover to infinite series, even if the series involved are uniformly convergent. We turn next to special series of functions, known as power series, which can be manipulated in many respects as though they were finite sums.))) 428) Sequences and seriesof functions) 11.6 Power series.

The numbers z, a, and the coefficients an are complex. With each power series there is associated a circle, called the circle of convergence, such that the series converges absolutelyfor every z interior to this circle, and diverges for every z outside this circle. The center of the circle is at a and its radius r is called the radius of) Region of divergence) \\\" Iz - a 1 = r) FIGURE 11.4 The circle of convergence of a power series.) convergence. (See Figure 11.4.) In extreme cases, the circle may shrink to the single point a, in which case r = 0, or it may consist of the entire complexplane, in which case we say that r = + 00. The existence of the circle of convergence is shown in Theorem 11.7. The behavior of the series at the boundary points of the circle cannot be predicted in advance. Examples show that there may be convergence at none, some,or all the boundary points. For many power seriesthat occur in practice, the radius of convergence can be determined by using either the ratio test or the root test, as in the following examples.) EXAMPLE 1. To find the radius of convergence of the power series .L zn In!, we apply the ratio test. If z \\302\\245=0, the ratio of consecutive terms has absolute value) zn+l n! Izi- (n + 1)!zn n + 1) Since this ratio tends to 0 as n \\037 00, we conclude that the series convergesabsolutely for all complex z \\302\\245:-O. It also converges for z = 0, so the radius of convergence is + 00.) Since the general term of a convergent series must tend to 0, the result of the foregoing example proves that) zn lim - = 0 n\\03700 n!))) Po\\037,ver series.

Therefore, the series converges absolutely if Izl < .\\037and diverges if Izi > 1. The radius of convergence is -1. This particular power series diverges at every boundary point because, if Izl = \\037,the general term has absolute value n 2 .) EXAMPLE 3. For each of the series! znfn and! znfn 2 , the ratio test tells us that the radius of convergence is 1. The first series diverges at the boundary point z = 1 but converges at all other boundary points (see Section10.19).The second series converges at every boundary point since it is dominated by ! Ifn 2 .) We conclude this section with a proof that every power serieshas a circleof convergence. The proof is based on the following theorem.) THEOREM 11.6. Assume the pou'er series ! anz n converges for a particular z =;C 0, say for z = ZI' Then \\\\re have: (a) The series convergesabsolutely for every z \\\\rith Izi < IZll. (b) The series converges uniformly on every circular disk u,ith center at 0 and radius R < IZll.) Proof Since! anz\\037 converges, its general term tends to 0 as n ---+ 00. In particular, lanz\\037 1 < I from some point on, say for n > N. Let S be a circular diskof radius R, where o < R < IZll. If z E Sand n > N, we have Izi < Rand) 2 n Z n R n la n2 n l = lan2\\0371 - < - < - = t n 2 1 2 1 2 1) R where t = - . 2 1) Since 0 < t < 1, the series .2 an z ll is dominated by the convergent geometricseries! 1 n . By Weierstrass' M-test, the series! a n z ll converges uniformly on S. This proves (b). The argument also shows that the series! anzH converges absolutely for each z in S. But since each z with 121 < IZll lies in some circular disk S with radius R < IZ11, this also proves part (a).) THEOREM 11.7. EXISTENCE OF A CIRCLE OF CONVERGENCE. Assun1e that the pOH'er series ! anz n converges for at least one z =;C 0, say jor z = ZI , and that it diverges jor at least one z, say for z = Z2' Then there exists a positive real number r such that the series converges absolutely if Izl < r and diverges if Izi > r.) Proof Let A denote the set of all positive numbers Izi for which the power series ! anz'tt converges. The set A is not empty since, by hypothesis, it contains IZll. Also, no))) 430) Sequences and series of functions) number in A can exceed IZ21 (because of Theorem 11.6). Hence, IZ21 is an upper bound for A. Since A is a nonempty set of positive numbers that is bounded above, it has a least upper bound which we denote by r. It is clear that r > 0 since r > IZll. By the definition of r, no number in A can exceed r. Therefore, the series diverges if Izl > r. But it is easy to prove that the series converges absolutely if Izl < r. If Izi < r, there is a positive number x in A such that Izl < x < r. By Theorem 11.6, the series! anz n converges absolutely. This completes the proof.) There is, of course, a corresponding theorem for power seriesin z - a which may be deduced from the case just treated by introducing the change of variable Z = z - a. The circle of convergence has its center at a, as shown in Figure 11.4.) 11.7 Exercises) In Exercises1 through 16, determine the radius of convergencer of the given power series.

We also write x in place of z. The interior of the circle of convergence intersectsthe real axis along an interval (a - r, a + r) symmetrically located about a; we refer to this as the interval of convergence of the real power series I an(x - a)n. The number r is called the radius of convergence. (SeeFigure 11.5.)) Divergence) Absolute convergence) Divergence) :%) a - r) a) a+r) FIGURE 11.5 The interval of convergence of a real power series.) Each real power series defines a sum function whose value at each x in the interval of convergence is given by) 00 f(x) = I an(x - a)n . n=O) The series is said to represent the function f in the interval of convergence, and it is called the po 'rver-series expansion off about a. There are two basic problems about power-series expansions that concern us here: (1) Given the series, to find properties of the sum function! (2) Given a function.t: to find whether or not it may be represented by a power series. It turns out that only rather special functions possesspower-seriesexpansions.Nevertheless, the class of such functions includes most examples that arise in practice, and hence their study is of great importance. We turn now to a discussion of question (1).))) 432) Sequences and series of functions) Theorem 11.6 tells us that the power series converges absolutely for each x in the open interval (a - r, a + r), and that it converges uniformly on every closed subinterval [a - R, a + R], where 0 < R < r. Since each term of the power series is continuous on the whole real axis, it follows from Theorem 11.2 that the sum function f is continuous on every closedsubinterval [a - R, a + R], and hence on the open interval (a - r, a + r). Also, Theorem 11.4 tells us that we can integrate the pqwer series term by term on every closed subinterval [a - R, a + R]. These propertiesof functions represented by power series are stated formally in the following theorem.) THEOREM 11.8. Assume a function f is representedby the power series) (11.1)) 00 f(x) = ! an(x - a)n n=O) in an open interval (a - r, a + r). Then f is continuous on this interval, and its integral over any closed subinterval may be computed by integrating the series term by term. In particular, for every x in (a - r, a + r), we have) J x 00 J x 00 f(t) dt = \\037 an (t - a)n dt = \\037 an (x - a)n+l a L a Ln+1 n=O n=O) Theorem 11.8 also shows that the radius of convergence of the integrated seriesis at least as large as that of the original series. We will prove presently that both series have exactly the same radius of convergence. First we show that a power series may be differentiated term by term within its interval of convergence.) THEOREM 11.9. Let f be represented by the pO\\0371'er series (11.1) in the interval of con- vergence (a - r, a + r). Then H'e have: (a) The differentiated series L1%1nan(x - a)n-l also has radius of convergence r. (b) The derivative f'ex) exists for each x in the interval of convergence and is given by) 00 f'ex) = ! nan(x - a)n-l . n=l) Proof For simplicity, in the proof we assume that a = O. First we prove that the differentiated series converges absolutely in the interval (-r, r). Choose any positive x such that 0 < x < r, and let h be a small positive number such that 0 < x < x + h < r. Then the series for f(x) and for f(x + h) are each absolutely convergent. Hence, we may write) ( 11.2)) 00 f(x + h) - f(x) = \\037 a (x + h)n - xn . h \\037 n h n=O) The series on the right is absolutely convergent since it is a linear combination of absolutely convergent series. Now we apply the mean-value theorem to write) (x + h)n - xn = hnc\\037-l ,))) Properties of functions represented by real power series) 433) where x < C n < x + h. Hence, the series in (11.2) is identical to the series) (11.3)) 00 '\\\" na c n - 1 k n n n=l) which must be absolutely convergent, since that in Equation (11.2) is. The series (11.3) is no longer a powerseries,but it dominates the power series! na n x n- 1 , so this latter series must be absolutely convergent for this x. This proves that the radius of convergence of the differentiatedseries! na nxn-1 is at least as large as r. On the other hand, the radius of convergence of the differentiated series cannot exceed r becausethe differentiated series dominates the original series! anx n . This proves part (a). To prove part (b), let g be the sum function of the differentiated series,) 00 g(x) = ! na n x n- 1 . n=l) Applying Theorem 11.8 to g, we may integrate term by term in the interval of convergence to obtain) l x 00 o g(t) dt = X:lanxn = f(x) - ao .) Since g is continuous, the first fundamental theorem of calcul us tells us that f'ex) exists and equals g(x) for each x in the interval of convergence. This proves (b).) Note: Since every power series! an(x - a)n can be obtained by differentiating its integrated series, ! an(x - a)n+l/(n + 1), Theorem 11.9tells us that both these series have the same radius of convergence.) Theorems 11.8and 11.9 justify the formal manipulations of Section 10.8where we obtained various power-series expansions using term-by-term differentiation and integration of the geometricseries.In particular, these theorems establish the validity of the expansions) 00 (_l)nxn+l log (1 + x) = \\037 \\037 n+1 n=O) and) 00 (_ 1 )nx2n+l arctan x = \\037 , \\037 2n + 1 n=O) whenever x is in the open interval -1 < x < 1. As a further consequence of Theorem 11.9,we conclude that the sum function of a power series has derivativesof every order and they may be obtained by repeated term-by-term differentiation of the power series. If f(x) = ! ar/x - a)n and if we differentiate this formula k times and then put x = a in the result, we find that f(k)(a) = k !ak , so the kth coefficient ak is given by the formula) j(k)(a)ak = k!) for k = 1,2, 3, . . . .))) 434) Sequences and series of functions) (11.4)) This formula also holds for k = 0 if we interpret f<O)(a)to mean f(a). Thus, the power- series expansion off has the form f(x) = \\037 fCk)(a) (x _ a)k . L k! k=O) This property can be formulated as a uniqueness theorem for power-series expansions.) THEOREM 11.10. If two po};ver series! an(x - a)n and! bn(x - a)n have the same sum function f in some neighborhood of the point a, then the t\\037vo series are equal term by term; in fact, }}'ehave an = b n = f<n)(a)fn! for each n > O.) Equation (11.4) also shows that the partial sums of a power seriesare simply the Taylor polynomials of the sum function at a. In other words, if a function f is representable by a power series in an interval (a - r, a + r), then the sequence of Taylor polynomials {Tnf(x;a)}generated by f at a converges pointwise in this interval to the sum function f Moreover, the convergence is uniform in every closed subinterval of the interval of convergence.) 11.9 The Taylor's series generated by a function We turn now to the second problem raised at the beginning of the foregoing section. That is, given a function f, to find whether or not it has a power series expansion in some open interval about a point a. We know from what was just proved that such a function must necessarily have derivatives of every order in some open interval about a and that the coefficients of its power-series expansion are given by Equation (11.4). Suppose, then, that we start with a function f having derivatives of every order in an open interval about a. We call such a function infinitely differentiable in this interval. Then we can certainly form the power series) (11.5)) 00 f (k) ( a ) \\037 (x - a)k.L k! k=O) This is called the Taylor's seriesgeneratedb\\037yf at a. We now ask two questions: Does this series converge for any x other than x = a? If so, is its sum equal to f(x)? Surprisingly enough, the answer to both questions is, in general, \\\"no.\\\" The series mayor may not converge for x =;C a and, if it does converge, its sum mayor may not be f(x). An example where the series converges to a sum different from f(x) is given in Exercise 24 in Section 11.13. A necessary and sufficient condition for answering both questions in the affirmative can be given by using Taylor's formula with remainder, which provides a finite expansion of the form) (11.6)) n f(k)(a) f(x) = 2: k! (x - a)k + Eix) . k=O))) PO\\037fer-series expansions for the exponential and trigonometric functions 435) The finite sum is the Taylor polynomial of degree n generated by f at a, and En(x) is the error made in approximating f by its Taylor polynomial. If we let n \\037 00 in (11.6), we see that the power series (11.5) will converge to f(x) if and only if the error term tends to O. In the next section we discuss a useful sufficient condition for the error term to tend to O.) 11.10 A sufficient condition for convergence of a Taylor'sseries In Theorem 7.6 we proved that the error term in Taylor's formula could be expressed as an integral,) (11.7)) 1 I x En(x) = - (x - t)nf(n+I)(t) dt n! a) in any interval about a in which f(n+l) is continuous. Therefore, iffis infinitely differentiable, we always have this representation of the error so the Taylor's series converges to f(x) if and only if this integral tends to 0 as n \\037 00. The integral can be put into a slightly more useful form by a change of variable. We write) t = x + (a - x)u ,) dt = -(x - a) du ,) and note that u varies from 1 to 0 as t varies from a to x. Therefore, the integral in (11. 7) becomes) (11.8)) ( X - a ) n+l i 1 En(x) = \\\" u\\037(n+I)[x + (a - x)u] du . n! 0) This form of the error enablesus to give the following sufficient condition for convergence of a Taylor's series.) THEOREM 11.11. Assun1e f is infinitely differentiable in an open interval I = (a - r, a + r), and assume that there is a positive constant A such that) (11.9)) If(lI)(x)1 < An) for n = 1, 2, 3, . . . ,) and every x in I. Then the Taylor's series generatedby fat a converges to f(x)for eachx in I.) Proof Using the inequality (11.9) in the integral formula (11.8),we obtain the estimate) I I n+l i l I I n+l A n+l B n+l o < IE (x)1 < x - a An+l un du = x - a = ,- n - n! 0 (n + I)! (n + I)!) where B = A Ix - al. But for every B, Bn /n! tends to 0 as n \\037 00, so En(x) \\037 0 for each x in I.) 11.11 Power-series expansions for the exponential and trigonometric functions The sine and cosine functions and all their derivatives are bounded by lover the entire real axis.

The foregoing power-series expansions for the sine and cosine can be used as the starting point for a completely analytic treatment of the trigonometric functions. If we use these seriesas definitions of the sine and cosine, it is possible to derive all the familiar algebraic and analytic properties of the trigonometric functions from theseseriesalone.For example, the series immediately give us the formulas) sin 0 = 0 ,) cos 0 = 1 ,) sin (-x) = -sin x ,) cos (-x) = cos x ,) D sin x = cos x ,) D cos x = - sin x .)

Then it is easy to verify that u'(x) = vex) and v'(x) = -u(x), and so f'ex) = 0 for all X. Therefore,fis a constant and, sincef(O) = 0, we must have f(x) = 0 for all X. This implies u(x) = vex) = 0 for all x or, in other words,) sin (x + a) = sin x cos a + cos x sin a ,) cos (x + a) = cos x cosa - sin x sin a .) The number 1T may be introduced as the smallest positivex such that sin x = 0 (such an x can be shown to exist) and then it can be shown that the sine and cosine are periodic with period 21T, that sin (!1T)= 1, and that cos (!1T) = O. The details,which we shall not present here, may be found in the book Theory and Application of Infinite Series by K. Knopp (New York: Hafner, 1951).))) Bernstein's theorem) 437) *11.12 Bernstein's theorem) Theorem 11.11 shows that the Taylor's seriesof a function f converges if the nth derivative fen) grows no faster than the nth power of some positive number. Another sufficient condition for convergence was formulated by the Russian mathematician Sergei N. Bernstein(1880- ).) THEOREM 11.12. BERNSTEIN'S THEOREM. Assume f and all its derivatives are nonnegative on a closed interval [0, r]. That is, assume that) f(x) > 0) and f(n)(x) > 0) for each x in [0, r] and each n = 1,2,3, . . .. Then, if 0 < x < r, the Taylor's series) 00 f (k)(O) \\037 Xk \\037 k! k=O) converges to f(x).) Proof The result holds trivially for x = 0, so we assume that 0 < x < r. We use Taylor's formula with remainder to write) (11.10)) n f (k) 0) f(x) = 2: k\\037 Xk + Eix) \\302\\267 k=O) We will prove that the error term satisfies the inequalities) (11.11)) ( X ) rl+ 1 o < En(x) < r fer) .) This, in turn, shows that En(x) ---+ 0 as n ---+ 00 since the quotient (xlr )11+1 ---+ 0 when o < x < r. To prove (11.11), we use the integral form of the error as given in Equation (11.8) with a = 0:) X n+ 1 i 1 En(x) = - UJ(n-l-l)(x - xu) du . n! 0) This formula is valid for each x in the closed interval [0, r]. If x =;C 0, let) E (x ) 1 i 1 Fn(X) = n = - U n f(n+l)(X - xu) du . Xn+l n! 0) The function \\037f(n+l) is monotonic increasing in the interval [0, r] since its derivative is nonnegative. Therefore, we have) f(n+l)(X - xu) = f(n+l)[x(1- u)] < f(n+l) [r(1 - u)]))) 438) Sequences and series of functions) if 0 < u < 1, which implies that Fn(x) < Fn(r) if 0 < x < r. In other words, we have En(x)fxn + 1 < En(r)fr n + 1 or) (11.12)) ( x ) n+l En(x) < r En(r) .) Setting x = r in Equation (11.10), we see that En(r) < fer) because each term in the sum is nonnegative. Using this in (11.12), we obtain (11.11) which, in turn, completes the proof.) 11.13 Exercises) For each of the power series in Exercises 1 through 10 determine the set of all real x for which the series converges and compute the sum of the series.

(Ixl < 1).) 11.14 Power series and differential equations Power series sometillles enable us to obtain solutions of differential equations when other methods fail. A systematic discussion of the use of power seriesin the theory of linear second-order differential equations is given in Volume II. Here we illustrate with an example some of the ideas and techniques involved. Consider the second-orderdifferential equation) (11.13)) (1 - x 2 )y\\\" = -2y.) Assume there exists a solution, say y = f(x), which may be represented by a power-series expansion in some neighborhood of the origin, say) (11.14)) 00 y = ! anx n . n=O) The first thing we do is determine the coefficients a o , a l , a 2 , . .. . One way to proceed is this: Differentiating (11.14) twice, we obtain) 00 y\\\" = ! n( n - 1)a n x n- 2 . n=2))) 440) Sequences and series of functions) Multiplying by 1 - x2 , we find that) (11.15)) 00 00 (1 - x 2)y\\\" = ! n(n - l)a n x n- 2 - ! n(n - l)a n x n n=2 n=2) 00 00 = ! (n + 2)(n + l)a n + 2x n - ! n(n - l)a n x n n=O n=O) 00 = ! [en + 2)(n + l)a n + 2 - n(n - l)a n ]x n . n=O) Substituting each of the series (11.14)and (11.15) in the differential equation, we obtain an equation involving two power series, valid in some neighborhood of the origin. By the uniqueness theorem, these power series must be equal term by term. Therefore we may equate coefficients of x n and obtain the relation) (n + 2)(n + l)an + 2 - n(n - l)a n = -2a n) or, what amounts to the same thing,) n 2 - n - 2 n - 2 a = a = a n+ 2 (n + 2)( n + 1) n n + 2 n.) This relation enablesus to determine a 2 , a 4 , a 6 , . . . successively in terms of ao . Similarly, we can compute a3, a5 , a 7 , . . . in terms of a1. For the coefficients with even subscripts, we find that) a 2 =-a O ') a 4 = 0 . a 2 = 0 ,) a 6 = as = a 10 = \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= 0 .) The odd coefficients are) 1 - 2 -1 a 3 = 1 + 2 al = 3 al ,) 3-2 1 (-1)a- a--'-a5- 3 + 2 2- 5 3 1,) 5-2 31(-1) -1 a - a --'-'-a --a7- 5 + 2 5- 75 3 1- 7 '5 1) and, in general,) 2n - 3 2n - 3 2n - 5 2n - 7 a 2n + l = a2n-l = . . . 2n + 1 2n + 1 2n - 1 2n - 3) 3 1 (-1)'-'-'-a 7 5 3 1 .) When the common factors are canceled,this simplifies to) -1 a - a2n+l - (2n + 1)(2n_ 1) 1.) Therefore, the series for y can be written as follows:) 00 1 Y = a ( 1 - x 2 ) - a \\037 x2n+l OIL (2n + 1)(2n - 1) . n=O))) The binomial series) 441) The ratio test may be used to verify the convergence of this series for Ixl < 1. The work just carried out shows that the series actually satisfies the differential equation in (11.13), where ao and a l may be thought of as arbitrary constants. The reader should note that in this particular example the polynomial which multiplies a o is itself a solution of (11.13), and the series which multiplies al is another solution. The procedure just described is called the method oj' undetermined coefficients. Another way to find these coefficients is to use the formula) f(n)(o) a = n ,n.) if y = f(x) .) Sometimes the higher derivatives of y at the origin can be computed directly from the differential equation. For example, setting x = 0 in (11.13), we immediately obtain) f\\\"(O) = -2f(0) = -2a o ,) and hence we have) j\\\"(O)a 2 = - = -a o . 2!) To find the higher derivatives, we differentiate the differential equation to obtain) (11.16)) (I - X2)},'\\\" - 2xy\\\" = -2y' .) Putting x = 0, we see that f/l/(O) = -2f'(0) = -2a l , and hence a3 = f\\\"'(0)/3! = -a I/3. Differentiation of (11.16) leads to the equation) (1 - X 2 )y(4) - 4xy'\\\" = 0 .) When x = 0, this yields 1(4)(0) = 0, and hence a4 = O. Repeating the process once more, we find) f(5)(0) = 4f\\\"'(0) = - 8al ,) (1 - X 2 )y(5) - 6xy(4) - 4y'\\\" = 0, j(5)(0)a 5 = 5!) a l- --) 15) It is clear that the process may be continued as long as desired.) 11.15 The binomial series) We can also use our knowledge of differential equations to determine the sums of certain power series. For example, we shall use the existence-uniqueness theorem for first-order linear differential equations to prove that the binomial series expansion) (11.17)) (1 + xy = i (:)x n n=O))) 442) Sequences and series of functions) is valid in the interval Ixl < 1. Here the exponent lJ.. is an arbitrary real number and (\\037) denotes the binomial coefficient defined by) (11.18)) ( lJ.. ) = \\037(lJ..- 1) . . . (lJ.. - n + 1) . n n!) When lJ.. is a nonnegative integer, all but a finite number of the coefficients (\\037) are zero, and the series reduces to a polynomial of degree lJ.., giving us the familiar binomial theorem. To prove ( 11.17) for an arbitrary real lJ.., we first use the ratio test to find that the series converges absolutely in the open interval -1 < x < 1. Then we define a function f by means of the equation) (11.19)) f(x) = i (\\037)xn) if Ix I < 1 .) n=O) We then show that f is a solution of the linear differential equation) (11.20)) lJ.. y' - Y = 0 x + 1) and satisfies the initial condition f(O) = 1. Theorem 8.3 tells us that in any interval not containing the point x = -1 there is only one solution of this differential equation with y = 1 when x = O. Since y = (1 + x):X is such a solution, it follows that f(x) = (1 + x)a if -1 < x < 1. Therefore, to prove (11.17) we need only show that f satisfies the differential equation ( 11.20). For this purpose, we require the following property of the binomial coefficients:) (n + l)C : 1) = (\\037 - n)(\\037) \\302\\267) This property, which is an immediate consequenceof the definition in (11.18), holds for every reallJ..and every integer n > O. It can alsobe expressed in the form) (11.21)) (n + l)C : 1) + n(\\037) = \\037(\\037) \\302\\267) Differentiation of (11.19) gives us) f'(x) = i n(\\037)xn-l = i (n + 1)C: Jxn, n=l n=O) from which we find that) (1 + x)f'(x) = i {(n + I)C : J + n(\\037) }xn = \\037 i (\\037)xn = \\037f(x) , n=O n=O))) Exercises) 443) because of (11.21). This shows that f satisfies the differential eq uation (11.20) and this, in turn, proves (11.17).) 11.16 Exercises) 1.

Further applications of the calculus require a deeperknowledge of analytic geometry than has been presentedso far, and therefore we turn our attention to a more detailed investigation of some fundamental geometric ideas. As we have pointed out earlier in this book, calculus and analytic geometry were intimately related throughout their historical development. Every new discovery in one subject led to an improvement in the other. The problem of drawing tangents to curves resulted in the discovery of the derivative; that of area led to the integral; and partial derivatives were introduced to investigate curved surfaces in space. Along with these accomplishments came other parallel developments in mechanics and mathematical physics. In 1788 Lagrange published his masterpiece M ecanique analytique (Analytical Mechanics) which showed the great flexibility and tremendous power attained by using analytical methods in the study of mechanics. Later on, in the 19th century, the Irish mathematician William Rowan Hamilton (1805-1865) introduced his Theor)Jof Quaternions, a new method and a new point of view that contributed much to the understanding of both algebra and physics. The best features of quaternion analysis and Cartesian geometry were later united, largely through the efforts of J. W. Gibbs (1839-1903)and O. Heaviside (1850-1925), and a new subjectcalled vector algebra sprang into being. It was soon realized that vectors are the ideal tools for the exposition and simplification of many important ideas in geometry and physics. In this chapter we propose to discuss the elementsof vector algebra. Applications to analytic geometry are given in Chapter 13. In Chapter 14 vector algebra is combined with the methods of calculus, and applications are given to both geometry and mechanics. There are essentially three different ways to introduce vector algebra: geometrically, analytically, and axiomatically. In the geometric approach, vectors are represented by directed line segments, or arrows. Algebraic operations on vectors, such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication by real numbers, are defined and studied by geometric methods. In the analytic approach, vectors and vector operations are described entirely in terms of numbers, called components.Properties of the vector operations are then deduced from) 445))) 446) Vector algebra) corresponding properties of numbers. The analytic description of vectors arises naturally from the geometric description as soon as a coordinate system is introduced. In the axiomatic approach, no attempt is made to describe the nature of a vector or of the algebraic operations on vectors. Instead,vectors and vector operations are thought of as undefined concepts of which we know nothing except that they satisfy a certain set of axioms. Such an algebraic system, with appropriate axioms, is called a linear space or a linear vector space. Examples of linear spaces occur in all branches of mathematics, and we will study many of them in Chapter 15. The algebra of directed line segments and the algebra of vectors described by components are merely two examples of linear spaces. The study of vector algebra from the axiomatic point of view is perhaps the most mathematically satisfactory approach to use since it furnishes a description of vectors that is free of coordinate systems and free of any particular geometric representation. This study is carried out in detail in Chapter 15. In this chapter we base our treatment on the analytic approach, and we also use directed line segments to interpret many of the results geometrically. When possible, we give proofs by coordinate-free methods. Thus, this chapter serves to provide familiarity with important concrete examples of vector spaces, and it also motivates the more abstract approach in Chapter 15.) 12.2 The vector space of n-tuples of real numbers The idea of using a number to locate a point on a line was known to the ancient Greeks. In 1637 Descartesextended this idea, using a pair of numbers (aI' a2 ) to locate a point in the plane, and a triple of numbers (aI' a 2 , a 3) to locate a point in space. The 19th century mathematicians A. Cayley (1821-1895)and H. G. Grassmann (1809-1877) realized that there is no need to stop with three numbers. One can just as well consider a quadruple of numbers (aI' a 2 , a 3 , a 4) or, more generally, an n-tuple of real numbers) (aI' a2 , . . . , an)) for any integer n > 1. Such an n-tuple is called an n-dimensional point or an n-dimensional vector, the individual numbers a1, a2 , . . . , an being referred to as coordinatesor components of the vector. The collection of all n-din1ensional vectors is called the vector space of n-tuples, or simply n-space. We -denote this space by V n . The reader may well ask at this stage why we are interested in spaces of dimension greater than three. One answer is that many problems which involve a large number of simultaneous equations are more easily analyzed by introducing vectors in a suitable n-space and replacing all these equations by a single vector equation. Another advantage is that we are able to deal in one stroke with many properties common to I-space, 2-space, 3-space, etc., that is, properties independent of the dimensionality of the space. This is in keeping with the spirit of modern mathematics which favors the development of comprehensive methods for attacking problems on a wide front. Unfortunately, the geometric pictures which are a great help in motivating and illustrating vector concepts when n = 1, 2, and 3 are not available when n > 3; therefore, the study of vector algebra in higher-dimensional spaces must proceed entirely by analytic means. In this chapter we shall usually denote vectors by capital letters A, B, C,..., and components by the corresponding small letters a, b, c, . . .. Thus, we write) A = (aI' a2 , \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267, an) .))) The vector space of n-tuples of real numbers) 447) To convert Vn into an algebraic system, we introduce equality of vectors and two vector operations called addition and n1ultiplication by scalars. The word \\\"scalar\\\" is used here as a synonym for \\\"real number.\\ DEFINITION. Two vectors A and B in V n are called equal );fhenever they agree in their respective components. That is, if A = (aI' a2 , . . . , an) and B = (bl , b2 , . . . , b n ), the vector equation A = B means exactly the same as the n scalar equations) a l = bl ,) a 2 = b 2 , ..., an = b n .) The sum A + B is defined to be the vector obtained by adding corresponding components:) A + B = (al + b l , a 2 + b 2 , . . . , an + b n ) .) If c is a scalar, we define cA or Ac to be the vector obtained by multiplying each component of A by c:) cA = (cal , ca2 , . . . , can) .) From this definition it is easy to verify the following properties of these operations.) THEOREM 12.1. Vector addition is commutative,) A+B=B+A,) and associative,) A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C .) Multiplication by scalars is associative,) c(dA) = (cd)A) and satisfies the two distributive laws) c(A + B) = cA + cB ,) and) (c + d)A = cA + dA .) Proofs of these properties follow quickly from the definition and are left as exercises for the reader. The vector with all components 0 is called the zero vector and is denoted by O. It has the property that A + 0 = A for every vector A; in other words, 0 is an identity element for vector addition. The vector (-1)A is also denoted by - A and is called the negative of A. We also write A - B for A + (- B) and call this the difference of A and B. The equation (A + B) - B = A shows that subtraction is the inverse of addition. Note that OA = 0 and that lA = A. The reader may have noticed the similarity between vectors in 2-space and complex numbers. Both are defined as ordered pairs of real numbers and both are addedin exactly))) 448) Vector algebra) the same way. Thus, as far as addition is concerned, complex numbers and two-dimensional vectors are algebraically indistinguishable. They differ only when we introduce multiplica- ti on. Multiplication of complex numbers gives the complex-numbersystem the field properties also possessed by the real numbers. It can be shown (although the proof is difficult) that except for n = 1 and 2, it is not possible to introduce multiplication in V n so as to satisfy all the field properties. However,specialproducts can be introduced in Vn which do not satisfy all the field properties. For example, in Section 12.5 we shall discuss the dot product of two vectors in Vn . The result of this multiplication is a scalar, not a vector. Another product, called the cross product, is discussed in Section 13.9. This multiplication is applicable only in the space V3 . The result is always a vector, but the cross product is not commutative.) 12.3 Geometric interpretation for n < 3 Although the foregoing definitions are completely divorced from geometry, vectors and vector operations have an interesting geometric interpretation for spaces of dimension three or less. We shall draw pictures in 2-space to illustrate these concepts and ask the reader to produce the corresponding visualizations for himself in 3-space and in I-space.)

A pair of points A and B is calleda geometric vector if one of the points, say A, is called the initial point and the other, B, the terminal point, or tip. We visualizea geometric vector as an arrow from A to B, as shown in Figure 12.1, and denote it by the symbol AR. Geometric vectors are especially convenient for representing certain physical quantities such as force, displacement, velocity, and acceleration, which possess both magnitude and direction. The length of the arrow is a measure of the magnitude and the arrowhead indicatesthe required direction.))) Geometric interpretation for n < 3) 449) Suppose we introduce a coordinate system with origin O. Figure 12.2 shows two geo--+ -+ metric vectors AB and CD with B - A = D - C. In terms of components, this means that we have) b i - al = dl - C I) and) b 2 - a 2 = d 2 - C 2 .) By comparison of the congruent triangles in Figure 12.2, we see that the two arrows -+ -+ representingAB and CD have equal lengths, are parallel, and point in the same direction.-+ -+ We call such geometric vectors equivalent. That is, we say AB is equivalent to CD whenever) (12.1 )) B-A=D-C.) Note that the four points A, B, C, D are vertices of a parallelogram. (See Figure 12.3.) Equation (12.1) can also be written in the form A + D = B + C which tells us that opposite vertices of the parallelogram have the same sum. In particular, if one of the vertices, say A, is the origin 0, as in Figure 12.4, the geometric vector from 0 to the opposite vertex D corresponds to the vector sum D = B + C. This is described by saying that vector addition corresponds geometrically to addition of geometric vectors by the parallelogram law. The importance of vec!ors in physics stems from the remarkable fact that many physical quantities (such as force, velocity, and acceleration) combine by the parallelogram law.)

For simplicity in notation, we shall use the same symbol to denote a point in V n (when n < 3) and the geometricvector from the origin to this point. Thus, we write A instead of QA, B instead of DB, and so on. Sometimes we also write A in place of any geometric -+ vector equivalent to OA. For example, Figure 12.5 illustrates the geometric meaning of vector subtraction. Two geometric vectors are labeledas B - A, but these geometric vectors are equivalent. They have the same length and the same direction. Figure 12.6 illustrates the geometric meaning of multiplication by scalars. If B = cA, the geometric vector B has length Icl times the length of A; it points in the same direction as A if c is positive, and in the op\\037osite direction if c is negative.))) 450 Vector algebra) B - A 3A) A/// I I / / I / I I I) A - B) FIGURE 12.5 Geometric meaning of subtraction of vectors.) FIGURE 12.6 Multiplication of vectors by scalars.) The geometric interpretation of vectors In V n for n < 3 suggests a way to define parallelism in a general n-space.) DEFINITION. Two vectors A and B in V n are said to have the same direction if B = cA for some positive scalar c, and the opposite direction if B = cAfor somenegative c. They are called parallel if B = cA for some nonzero c.) Note that this definition makes every vector have the same direction as itself-a property which we surely want. Note also that this definition ascribes the following properties to the zero vector: The zero vector is the only vector having the same direction as its negative and therefore the only vector having the opposite direction to itself. The zero vector is the only vector parallel to the zero vector.) 12.4 Exercises 1. Let A = (1, 3, 6), B = (4, - 3, 3),and C = (2, 1, 5) be three vectors in V3.

What geometrical theorem about parallelograms can you deduce from this equation?) 12.5 The dot product We introduce now a new kind of multiplication called the dot product or scalar product of two vectors in V n .) DEFINITION. If A = (aI' . . . , an) and B = (b I , . . . , b n ) are tl-fO vectors in Vn , their dot product is denoted by A \\302\\267B and is defined by the equation) n A . B = ! akb k . k=I) Thus, to compute A \\302\\267B we multiply corresponding components of A and B and then add all the products. This multiplication has the following algebraic properties.) THEOREM 12.2. For all vectors A, B, properties: (a) A . B = B \\302\\267A (b) A \\302\\267 (B + C) = A \\302\\267B + A . C (c) c(A' B) = (cA) . B = A .

C in Vn and all scalars c, \\302\\273'ehave the following) (commutative la\\302\\273'), (distributive laa'), (homogeneity), (positivity),))) 452) Vector algebra) Proof The first three properties are easy consequences of the definition and are left as exercises. To prove the last two, we use the relation A \\302\\267A = \\037 a\\037. Since each term is nonnegative, the sum is nonnegative. Moreover, the sum is zero if and only if each term in the sum is zero and this can happen only if A = O. The dot product has an interesting geometric interpretation which will be described in Section 12.9. Before we discuss this, however, we mention an important inequality con- cerning dot products that is fundamental in vector algebra.) THEOREM 12.3. THE CAUCHY-SCHWARZ INEQUALITY. If A and B are vectors in V n , we have) (12.2) (A \\302\\267 B)2 < (A . A)(B \\302\\267 B) .) Moreover, the equality sign holds if and only if one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other.) Proof Expressing each member of (12.2) in terms of components, we obtain) Ct akb k ) < (\\037l a: ) (il b:) .) which is the inequality proved earlier in Theorem 1.41. We shall present another proof of (12.2) that makes no use of components. Such a proof is of interest because it shows that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is a consequence of the five properties of the dot product listed in Theorem 12.2 and does not depend on the particular definition that was used to deduce these properties. To carry out this proof, we notice first that (12.2) holds trivially if either A or B is the zero vector. Therefore, we may assume that both A and B are nonzero. Let C be the vector) C = xA - yB ,) where x = B . B) and y = A \\302\\267B .) Properties (d) and (e) imply that C' C > O. When we translate this in terms of x and y, it will yield (12.2). To expressC' C in terms of x and y, we use properties(a),(b) and (c) to obtain) C . C = (xA - yB) . (xA - yB) = x2 (A . A) - 2xy(A \\302\\267 B) + y2(B \\302\\267 B) .) Using the definitions of x and y and the inequality C \\302\\267C > 0, we get) (B . B)2(A \\302\\267 A) - 2(A . B)2(B. B) + (A \\302\\267 B)2(B \\302\\267 B) > 0 .) Property (d) implies B . B > 0 since B 7\\\"= 0, so we may divide by (B . B) to obtain) (B \\302\\267 B)(A \\302\\267 A) - (A \\302\\267 B)2 > 0,) which is (12.2). This proof also shows that the equality sign holds in (12.2) if and only if C = O. But C = 0 if and only if xA = yB. This equation holds,in turn, if and only if one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other.))) Length or norm of a vector) 453) The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality has important applications to the properties of the length or norm of a vector, a concept which we discuss next.) 12.6 Length or norm of a vector Figure 12.7 shows the geometric vector from the origin to a point A = (a l , a 2) in the plane.

FIGURE 12.8 In V 3 , the length of A is V ai + a\\037 + a\\037 .) A corresponding picture in 3-space is shown in Figure 12.8. Applying the theorem of Pythagoras twice, we find that the length of a geometric vector A in 3-space is given by) length of A = V a\\037 + a\\037 + a\\037 . Note that in either case the length of A is given by (A \\302\\267 A)1/2, the square root of the dot product of A with itself. This formula suggestsa way to introduce the concept of length In n-space.) DEFINITION. If A is a vector in V n , its length or norm is denoted by IIA II and is defined by the equation) IIA II = (A \\302\\267 A)l/2.) The fundamental properties of the dot product lead to corresponding properties of norms.) THEOREM 12.4. If A is a vectorin V n and if c is a scalar,}-,ve have the folloa'ing properties: (a) IIA II > 0 if A 7\\\"= 0 (positivity), (b) II A II = 0 if A = 0, (c) IlcA II = IclllA II (homogeneity).))) 454) Vector algebra) Proof Properties (a) and (b) follow at once from properties (d) and (e) of Theorem 12.2. To prove (c),we use the homogeneity property of dot productsto obtain) IlcA II = (cA \\302\\267 CA)1/2 = (c 2A \\302\\267 A)1/2 = (C 2)1/2(A \\302\\267 A)1/2 = Icl IIA II .) The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality can also be expressed in terms of norms. It states that) (12.3)) (A \\302\\267 B)2 < IIA 11 2 IIBI12.) Taking the positive square root of each member, we can also write the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the equivalent form) (12.4)) IA \\302\\267 BI < IIA II IIBII \\302\\267) Now we shall use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to deduce the triangle inequality.) THEOREM 12.5. TRIANGLE INEQUALITY. If A and B are vectorsin V n , we have) IIA + BII < IIA II + IIBII \\302\\267) Moreover, the equality sign holds if and only if A = 0, or B = 0, or B = cA for some c > o.) Proof To avoid square roots, we write the triangle inequality in the equivalent form) (12.5)) IIA + BI12 < \\\"( IIA II + IIBII)2.) The left member of (12.5) is) IIA + BI12 = (A + B)' (A + B) = A \\302\\267A + 2A \\302\\267B + B. B = IIA 11 2 + 2A \\302\\267B + IIBI12,) whereas the right member is) (IIAII + IIBII)2 = IIAI12 + 211AIIIIBII + IIBI12.) Comparing these two formulas, we see that (12.5) holds if and only if we have) (12.6)) A. B < IIAIIIIBII.) But A \\302\\267B < IA \\302\\267 BI so (12.6) follows from the Cauchy-Schwarzinequality, as expressed in (12.4). This proves that the triangle inequality is a consequenceof the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. The converse statement is also true. That is, if the triangle inequality holds then (12.6) also holds for A and for -A, from which we obtain (12.3). If equality holds in (12.5), then A.B= IIAIIIIBII,soB=cAforsomescalarc. HenceA'B=cIIAI1 2 and IIAI/IIB\\\" = Icl IIA 11 2 . If A \\037 0 this implies c = Icl > O. If B \\037 0 then B = cA with c > o.)))

It states that the length of one side of a triangle does not exceed the sum of the lengths of the other two sides.) 12.7 Orthogonality of vectors In the course of the proof of the triangle inequality (Theorem 12.5), we obtained the formula) (12.7)) IIA + BI12 = IIA 11 2 + IIBI12 + 2A \\302\\267B) B) A+B) A+B) \\037\\037 x \\037\\037) , I I I I I , I ,'IIBII I , I , , I I A) II BII) -- ---------) IIAII) FIG URE 12.9 Geometric meaning of the triangle inequality: IIA + BII < IIA II + IIBII .)

Figure 12.11(a)shows two nonzero geometric vectors A and B making an angle () with each other. In this example, we have 0 < () < !1T. Figure 12.11(b) shows the same vector A and two perpendicular vectorswhose sum is A. One of these, tB, is a scalar multiple of B which we call the projectionof A along B.

In other words, the dot product of two nonzero vectors A and B in V 2 is equal to the prod- uct of three numbers: the length of A, the length of B, and the cosine of the angle between A and B. Equation (12.9)suggestsa way to define the concept of angle in V n . The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, as expressed in (12.4), shows that the quotient on the right of (12.9) has absolute value < 1 for any two nonzero vectors in V n . In other words, we have) -1< A.B <1. -IIAIIIIBII-) Therefore, there is exactly one real () in the interval 0 < (} < 7T such that (12.9) holds. We definethe angle between A and B to be this ().

It is understood that the kth component of Ek is 1 and all other components are O.) The name \\\"unit vector\\\" comes from the fact that each vector Elc has length 1. Note that these vectors are mutually orthogonal, that is, the dot product of any two distinct vectors IS zero,) Ek . Ej = 0) if k \\037 j .) THEOREM 12.6. Every vector X = (Xl' . . . , X n) in Vn can be expressed in the form) n X = x 1E 1 + . . . + xnEn = 2 XlcEk . k=l) Moreover, this representation is unique. That is, if) n X = 2 XkEk k=l) and) n X = 2 YkEk' k=l) then Xk = Yk for each k = 1, 2, . . . , n.) Proof The first statement follows immediately from the definition of addition and multiplication by scalars. The uniqueness property follows from the definition of vector eq uality.) A sum of the type 2 ciA i is called a linear combination of the vectors AI, . . . , An . Theorem 12.6tells us that every vector in V n can be expressed as a linear combination of the unit coordinate vectors. We describe this by saying that the unit coordinate vectors E1, . . . , En span the space V n . We also say they span V n uniquely because each representa- tion of a vector as a linear combination of E 1 , . . . , En is unique. Some collections of vectors other than E 1, . . . , En also span Vn uniq uely, and in Section 12.12 we turn to the study of such collections. In V 2 the unit coordinate vectors E1 and E2 are often denoted, respectively, by the symbols i andj in bold-face italic type. In V 3 the symbols i, j, and k are also usedin place of \\302\\2431'E 2 , E3' Sometimes a bar or arrow is placed over the symbol, for example, I or 1. The geometric meaning of Theorem 12.6 is illustrated in Figure 12.12 for n = 3. When vectors are expressed as linear combinations of the unit coordinate vectors, algebraic manipulations involving vectors can be performed by treating the sums 2 xkEk according to the usual rules of algebra. The various components can be recognized at any stage in the calculation by collecting the coefficients of the unit coordinate vectors. For example, to add two vectors, say A = (aI' . . . , an) and B = (b 1 , . . . , b n ), we write) n A = ! akE k , k=1) n B = 2 bkEk , k=1))) 460) Vector algebra) A = ad + a'l.j+ a3 k) FIGURE 12.12 A vector A in Va expressed as a linear combination of ;, j, k.) and apply the linearity property of finite sums to obtain) n n n A + B = ! alcE k + ! bkEk = !

If a vector X in Vn can be represented as a linear combination of Al , . . . , Ak , say) k X = , c.A. \\302\\243..,1. 1.' ;=1) then the set S is said to span the vector X.) DEFINITION. The set of all vectors spanned by S is called the linear span of S and is denoted by L(S).) In other words, the linear span of S is simply the set of all possible linear combinations of vectors in S. Note that linear combinations of vectors in L(S) are again in L(S). We say that S spans the \\302\\273'holespace V n if L(S) = V n .) EXAMPLE 1. Let S = {AI}' Then L(S) consists of all scalar multiples of Al .) EXAMPLE 2. Every set S = {AI'. .., A k } spans the zero vector since0 = OA I + . . . + OAk' This representation, in which all the coefficients CI , . . . , C k are zero, is called the trivial representation of the zero vector. However, there may be nontrivial linear combinations that represent O. For example, suppose one of the vectors in S is a scalar multiple of another, say A 2 = 2A 1 . Then we have many nontrivial representations of 0, for example) o = 2tA I - tA 2 + OA3 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + OAk') where t is any nonzero scalar. We are especially interested in sets S that span vectors in exactly one way.) DEFINITION. A set S = {AI' . . . , A k } of vectors in V n is said to span X uniquely if S spans X and if) (12.10)) k X =' c.A. \\302\\243..,1. 1. i=I) and) k X = , d.A.k 1. 1. i=I) implies ci = d i for all i .))) Linear independence) 463) In the two sums appearing in (12.10), it is understood that the vectors Al , . . . , Ak are written in the same order. It is also understood that the implication (12.10) is to hold for a fixed but arbitrary ordering of the vectors Al , . . . , Ak .) THEOREM 12.7. A set S spans every vector in L(S) uniquely if and only if S spans the zero vector uniquely.) Proof If S spans every vector in L(S) uniquely, then it certainly spans 0 uniquely. To prove the converse, assume S spans0 uniquely and choose any vector X in L(S). Suppose S spans X in two ways, say) k X = 'c.A. \\302\\243.z z i=1) and) k X = 2 diA i . i=1) By subtraction, we find that 0 = 27=1 (ci - di)A i . But since S spans 0 uniquely, we must have Ci - d i = 0 for all i, so S spansX uniquely.) 12.13 Linear independence Theorem 12.7demonstrates the importance of sets that span the zero vector uniquely. Such sets are distinguished with a special name.) DEFINITION. A set S = {AI' . . . , A k } lrhich spans the zero vector uniquely is said to be a linearly independent set of vectors. Otheru'ise, S is called linearly dependent.) In other words, independence means that S spans 0 with only the trivial representation:) k , c.A.= 0 \\302\\243.z z i=l) implies all Ci = 0 .) Dependence means that S spans 0 in some nontrivial way. That is, for some choice of scalars C1 , . . . , Ck , we have) k 'c.A. = 0 \\037 \\037 z i=1) but not all Ci are zero.) Although dependence and independence are properties of sets of vectors, it is common practice to also apply these terms to the vectors themselves. For example, the vectors in a linearly independent set are often called linearly independent vectors. We also agree to call the empty set linearly independent. The following examples may serveto give further insight into the meaning of dependence and independence.) EXAMPLE 1. If a subset T of a set S is dependent, then S itself is dependent, because if T spans 0 nontrivially, then so does S. This is logically equivalent to the statement that every subset of an independent set is independent.))) 464) Vector algebra) EXAMPLE 2. The n unit coordinate vectors EI , . . ., En in V n span 0 uniquely so they are linearly independent.) EXAMPLE 3. Any set containing the zero vector is dependent.For example, if Al = 0, we have the nontrivial representation 0 = 1Al + OA 2 + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + OAk') EXAMPLE 4. The set S = {i,j, i + j} of vectors in V2 is linearly dependent because we have the nontrivial representation of the zero vector) o = i + j + (-I)(i+ j).) In this example the subset T = {i,j}is linearly independent. The third vector, i + j, is in the linear span of T. The next theorem shows that if we adjoin to i andj any vector in the linear span of T, we get a dependent set.) THEOREM 12.8. Let S = {AI' . . . , A k } be a linearly independent set of k vectors in V n , and let L(S) be the linear span of S. Then, every set of k + 1 vectors in L(S) is linearly dependent.) Proof The proof is by induction on k, the number of vectors in S. First suppose k = 1. Then, by hypothesis, S consists of one vector, say Al , where Al \\037 0 since S is independent. Now take any two distinct vectors BI and B2 in L(S). Then each is a scalar multiple of Al , say BI = clA I and B 2 = c2 A I , where C1 and C2 are not both zero. Multiplying Bl by C2 and B 2 by CI and subtracting, we find that) c 2 B l - clB2 = 0 .) This is a nontrivial representation of 0 so Bl and B 2 are dependent. This proves the theorem when k = 1. Now we assume that the theorem is true for k - 1 and prove that it is also true for k. Take any set of k + 1 vectors in L(S), say T = {Bl , B2 , . . . , B k+ l }. We wish to prove that T is linearly dependent. Since each B i is in L(S), we may write) (12.11)) k B. = , a..A. 1, \\302\\243..,1,J J j=l) for each i = 1,2, . . . , k + 1. We examine all the scalars ail that multiply Al and split the proof into two cases according to whether all these scalars are 0 or not.) CASE 1. ail = 0for every i = 1,2, . . . , k + 1. In this case the sum in (12.11) does not involve Al so each B i in T is in the linear span of the set S' = {A 2 , . . . , A k}. But S' is linearly independent and consists of k - 1 vectors. By the induction hypothesis, the theorem is true for k - 1 so the set T is dependent. This proves the theorem in Case 1.) CASE 2. Not all the scalars ail are zero. Let us assume that all \\037 O. (If necessary, we can renumber the B's to achieve this.) Taking i = 1 in Equation (12.11) and multiplying))) Linear independence) 465) both members by C i , where C i = ail/all' we get) k ciB l = ailAl + ! Cia1jA j . j=2) From this we subtract Equation (12.11)to get) k c.B I - B. = , ( c.a l ' - a..)A.1, 1, \\302\\243..,1,:J 'l:J:J , j=2) for i = 2, . . . , k + 1. This equation expresseseach of the k vectors ciB I - Bi as a linear combination of k - 1 linearly independent vectors A 2 , . . . , Ak' By the induction hy- pothesis, the k vectors CzBl- Bi must be dependent. Hence, for some choice of scalars t 2 , . . . , t k+l , not all zero, we have) k+l L ti(ciB l - Bi ) = 0 , i=2) from which we find) ( k+l ) k+I i\\0372tic i B 1 -i\\037 tiB i = 0 .) But this is a nontrivial linear combination of Bl , . . . , Bk+l which represents the zero vector, so the vectors B I , . . . , Bk+l must be dependent. This completes the proof.) We show next that the concept of orthogonality is intimately related to linear inde- pendence.) DEFINITION. A set S = {AI' . . . , A k } of vectors in V n is called an orthogonal set if Ai' A j = 0 \\0371'henever i =;t:. j. In other \\0371'ords, any tH'O distinct vectors in an orthogonal set are perpendicular.) THEOREM 12.9. Any orthogonal set S = {AI'. . ., A k } of nonzero vectors in V n is linearly independent. Moreover, if S spans a vector X, say) (12.12)) k X =' c.A. \\302\\243..,z 1,' i=l) then the scalar multipliers C l , . . . , c k are given by the formulas) (12.13)) X' A, J C. = J A.' A. J J) .f 0 r j = 1, 2, . . . , k .) Proof First we prove that S is linearly independent. Assume that L\\037=l ciA i = O. Taking the dot product of each member with Al and using the fact that Al \\302\\267 Ai = 0 for each i =;t:. 1, we find cl(A l . AI) = O. But (AI' AI) =;t:. 0 since Al =;t:. 0, so CI = O. Repeating))) 466) Vector algebra) this argument with Al replaced by A J , we find that each cj = O. Therefore S spans 0 uniquely so S is linearly independent. Now suppose that S spans X as in Equation (12.12). Taking the dot product of X with Ai as above, we find that cj(A j . A j) = X' Aj from which we obtain (12.13).) If all the vectors Al , . . . , Ak in Theorem 12.9 have norm 1,the formula for the multipliers simplifies to) c,=X'A,. J :J) An orthogonal set of vectors {A 1 , . . . , Ak}' each of which has norm 1, is called an ortho- normal set. The unit coordinate vectors EI , . . . , En are an example of an orthonormal set.) 12.14 Bases) It is natural to study sets of vectors that span every vector in V n uniquely. Such sets are called basesfor V n .) DEFINITION. A set S = {AI' . . . , Ale} of vectors in V n is called a basis for V n if S spans every vector in V n uniquely. If, in addition, S is orthogonal, then S is called an orthogonal basis.) Thus, a basis is a linearly independent set which spans the whole space V n . The set of unit coordinate vectors is an example of a basis. This particular basis is also an orthogonal basis. Now we prove that every basis contains the same number of elements.) THEOREM 12.10. In a given vector space V n , bases have the follo1rfing properties: (a) Every basis contains exactly n vectors. (b) Any set of linearly independent vectors is a subset of somebasis. (c) Any set of n linearly independent vectors is a basis.) Proof The unit coordinate vectors E I , . . . , En form one basis for V n . If we prove that any two bases contain the same number of vectors we obtain (a). Let Sand T be two bases, where S has k vectors and T has r vectors. If r > k, then T contains at least k + 1 vectors in L(S), since L(S) = V n . Therefore, because of Theorem 12.8, T must be linearly dependent, contradicting the assumption that T is a basis. This means we cannot have r > k, so we must have r < k. Applying the same argument with Sand T interchanged,we find that k < r. Hence, k = r so part (a) is proved. To prove (b), let S = {AI, . . . , A k } be any linearly independent set of vectors in Vn . If L(S) = V n , then S is a basis. If not, then there is some vector X in V n which is not in L(S). Adjoin this vector to S and consider the new set S' = {AI, . . . , Ak , X}. If this set weredependent, there would be scalars CI , . . . , C k+ 1 , not all zero, such that) k ! ciA i + Ck+lX = 0 . i=I) But Ck+ I \\037 0 since Al , . . . , Ak are independent. Hence, we could solve this equation for))) Exercises) 467) X and find that X E L(S), contradicting the fact that X is not in L(S). Therefore, the set S' is linearly independent but contains k + 1 vectors. If L(S') = V n' then S' is a basis and, sinceS is a subset of S', part (b) is proved. If S' is not a basis, we may argue with S' as we did with S, getting a new set S\\\" which contains k + 2 vectors and is linearly inde- pendent. If S\\\" is a basis, then part (b) is proved. If not, we repeat the process. We must arrive at a basis in a finite number of steps, otherwisewe would eventually obtain an inde- pendent set with n + I vectors, contradicting Theorem 12.8. Therefore part (b) is proved. Finally, we use (a) and (b) to prove (c). Let S be any linearly independent set consisting of n vectors. By part (b), S is a subset of some basis, say B. But by (a) the basis B has exactly n elements, so S = B.) 12.15 Exercises) 1. Let; andj denotethe unit coordinate vectors in V 2 .

Equality, vector addition, and multiplication by scalars were defined in terms of the componentsas follows: If A = (aI' . . . , an) and B = (b I , . . . , b n), then) A=B) means a. = b.\\037 \\037) for each i = I, 2, . . . , n ,) A + B = (al + bI , . . . , an + b n) ,) cA = (ca l , . . . , can) .) If all the scalars a i , b i and c in these relations are replaced by complex numbers, the new algebraic system so obtained is called complex vector space and is denoted by Vn(C). Here C is used to remind us that the scalars are complex. Since complex numbers satisfy the same field properties as real numbers, all theorems about real vector space V n that use only the field properties of the real numbers are also valid for Vn(C), provided all the scalars are allowed to be complex. In particular, those theorems in this chapter that involve only vector addition and multiplication by scalars are also valid for Vn(C). This extension is not made simply for the sake of generalization. Complex vector spaces arise naturally in the theory of linear differential equations and in modern quantum mechanics, so their study is of considerable importance. Fortunately, many of the theorems about real vector spaceV n carryover without change to Vn(C). Some small changes have))) The vector space Vn(C) of n-tuples of complex numbers) 469) to be made, however, in those theorems that involve dot products. In proving that the dot product A \\302\\267A of a nonzero vector with itself is positive, we used the fact that a sum of squares of real numbers is positive. Since a sum of squaresof complex numbers can be negative, we must modify the definition of A . B if we wish to retain the positivity property. For Vn(C), we use the following definition of dot product.) DEFINITION. If A = (aI' . . . , an) and B = (bi , . . . , b n ) are t\\302\\273'ovectors in Vn(C), we define their dot product A . B by the formula) n A . B = L Okhk , k=l) where b k is the complex conjugateof bk .) Note that this definition agrees with the one given earlier for V n because b k = bk when b k is real. The fundamental properties of the dot product, corresponding to those in Theorem 12.2, now take the following form.) THEOREM 12.11. For all vectors A, B, C in Vn(C) and all complexscalarsc, we have (a) A \\302\\267B = B \\302\\267 A, (b) A \\302\\267 (B + C) = A . B + A \\302\\267 C, (c) c(A \\302\\267 B) = (cA) \\302\\267B = A \\302\\267 (cB), (d) A . A > 0 if A \\037 0, (e) A \\302\\267A = 0 if A = O.) All these properties are easy consequences of the definition and their proofs are left as exercises. The reader should note that conjugation takes place in property (a) when the order of the factors is reversed. Also, conjugation of the scalar multiplier occurs in prop- erty (c) when the scalar c is moved from one side of the dot to the other. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality now takes the form) (12.14)) IA . B/2 < (A \\302\\267 A)(B \\302\\267 B) .) The proof is similar to that given for Theorem 12.3. We consider the vector C = xA - yB, where x = B . Band y = A . B, and compute C' C. The inequality C' C > 0 leads to (12.14). Details are left as an exercise for the reader. Since the dot product of a vector with itself is nonnegative, we can introduce the norm of a vector in Vn(C) by the usual formula,) IIA II = (A \\302\\267 A)I/2 .) The fundamental properties of norms, as stated in Theorem 12.4, are also valid without change for Vn(C). The triangle inequality, II A + BII < IIA II + IIBII, also holds in Vn(C). Orthogonality of vectors in Vn(C) is defined by the relation A . B = O. As in the real case, two vectors A and B in Vn(C) are orthogonal whenever they satisfy the Pythagorean identity, IIA + BI12 = IIA 11 2 + IIB112.))) 470) Vector algebra) The concepts of linear span, linear independence, linear dependence, and basis,are defined for Vn(C) exactly as in the real case. Theorems 12.7 through 12.10 and their proofs are all valid without change for Vn(C).) 12.17 Exercises) 1. Let A = (1, i), B = (i, -i), and C = (2f, 1) be three vectors in V 2(C).

The study of geometry as a deductive system, as conceived by Euclid around 300 B.C., begins with a set of axioms or postulates which describe properties of points and lines. The concepts\\\"point\\\" and \\\"line\\\" are taken as primitive notions and remain undefined. Other concepts are defined in terms of points and lines, and theorems are systematically deduced from the axioms. Euclid listed ten axioms from which he attempted to deduce all his theorems. It has since been shown that these axioms are not adequate for the theory. For example,in the proof of his very first theorem Euclid made a tacit assumption concern- ing the intersection of two circles that is not covered by his axioms. Since then other lists of axioms have been formulated that do give all of Euclid's theorems. The most famous of these is a list given by the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862-1943)in his now classic Grundlagen der Geometrie, published in 1899. (An English translation exists: The Foundations of Geometry, Open Court Publishing Co., 1947.) This work, which went through seven German editions in Hilbert's lifetime, is said to have inaugurated the abstract mathematics of the twentieth century. Hilbert starts his treatment of plane geometry with five undefined concepts: point, line, on (a relation holding between a point and a line), betH'een (a relation between a point and a pair of points), and congruence (a relation betweenpairs of points). He then gives fifteen axioms from which he develops all of plane Euclidean geometry. His treatment of solid geometryis basedon twenty-one axioms involving six undefined concepts. The approach in analytic geometry is somewhat different. We defineconcepts such as point, line, on, between, etc., but we do so in terms of real numbers, which are left un- defined. The resulting mathematical structure is called an analytic model of Euclidean geometry. In this model, properties of real numbers are used to deduce Hilbert's axioms. We shall not attempt to describe all of Hilbert'saxioms. Instead, we shall merely indicate how the primitive concepts may be defined in terms of numbers and give a few proofs to illustrate the methods of analytic geometry.) 471))) 472) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) 13.2 Lines in n-space In this section we use real numbers to define the concepts of point, line, and on. The definitions are formulated to fit our intuitive ideas about three-dimensional Euclidean geometry, but they are meaningful in n-space for any n > 1. A point is simply a vector in V n , that is, an ordered n-tuple of real numbers; we shall use the words \\\"point\\\" and \\\"vector\\\" interchangeably. The vector space V n is called an analytic model of n-dimensional Euclidean space or simply Euclideann-space.To define \\\"line,\\\" we employ the algebraic operations of addition and multiplication by scalars in V n . DEFINITION. Let P be a given point and A a given nonzero vector. The set of all points of the form P + tA, where t runs through all real numbers, is calleda line through P parallel to A. We denote this line by L(P; A) and write) L(P; A) = {P + tA I t real} or, more briefly, L(P; A) = {P + tA} .) A point Q is said to be on the line L(P; A) if Q E L(P; A).) In the symbol L(P; A), the point P which is written first is on the line since it corresponds to t = O. The second point, A, is called a direction vector for the line. The line L(0; A) through the origin 0 is the linear span of A; it consists of all scalar multiples of A. The line through P parallel to A is obtained by adding P to each vector in the linear span of A. Figure 13.1showsthe geometric interpretation of this definition in V 3 . Each point P + tA can be visualized as the tip of a geometric vector drawn from the origin. As t varies over all the real numbers, the corresponding point P + tA traces out a line through P parallel to the vector A. Figure 13.1 shows points corresponding to a few values of t on both lines L(P; A) and L(O; A).) L (P; A )) L( 0; A)) FIGURE 13.1 The line L(P; A) through P parallel to A and its geometric relation to the line L( 0; A) through 0 parallel to A.))) Some simple properties of straight lines) 473) 13.3 Some simple properties of straight lines First we show that the direction vector A which occurs in the definition of L(P; A) can be replaced by any vector parallel to A. (We recall that two vectors A and B are called parallel if A = cB for some nonzero scalar c.)) THEOREM 13.1. TH'O lines L(P; A) and L(P; B) through the same point P are equal if and only if the direction vectors A and B are parallel.) Proof Assume first that L(P; A) = L(P; B). Take a point on L(P; A) other than P, for example, P + A. This point is also on L(P; B) soP + A = P + cB for somescalar c. Hence,we have A = cB and c -:;i; 0 since A -:;i;O. Therefore, A and B are parallel. Now we prove the converse. Assume A and B are parallel, say A = cB for some c -:;i; O. If Q is on L(P; A), then we have Q = P + fA = P + t(cB) = P + (ct)B, so Q is on L(P; B).Therefore L(P; A) c L(P; B). Similarly, L(P; B) c L(P; A), so L(P; A) = L(P; B).) Next we show that the point P which occurs in the definition of L(P; A) can be replaced by any other point Q on the same line.) THEOREM 13.2. TH'O lines L(P; A) and L( Q; A) H,ith the same direction vector A are equal if and only if Q is on L(P; A).) Proof Assume L(P; A) = L(Q; A). Since Q is on L(Q; A), Q is also on L(P; A). To prove the converse, assume that Q is on L(P; A), say Q = P + cA. We wish to prove that L(P; A) = L(Q; A). If X E L(P; A), then X = P + tA for some t. But P = Q - cA, so X = Q - cA + tA = Q + (t - c)A, and hence X is also on L(Q; A). Therefore L(P; A) c L(Q; A). Similarly, we find L( Q; A) c L(P; A), so the two lines are equal.) One of Euclid's famous postulates is the parallel postulate which is logically equivalent to the statement that \\\"through a given point there existsone and only one line parallel to a given line.\\\" We shall deduce this property as an easy consequence of Theorem 13.1. First we need to define parallelismof lines.) DEFINITION. Tv..'o lines L(P; A) and L( Q; B) are called parallel if their direction vectors A and B are parallel.) THEOREM 13.3. Given a line L and a point Q not on L, then there is one and only one line L' containing Q and parallel to L.) Proof Suppose the given line has direction vector A. Consider the line L' = L(Q; A). This line contains Q and is parallel to L. Theorem 13.1 tells us that this is the only line with these two properties. Note: For a long time mathematicians suspected that the parallel postulate could be deduced from the other Euclidean postulates, but all attempts to prove this resulted in failure. Then in the early 19th century the mathematicians Karl F. Gauss (1777-1855),))) 474) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) J. Bolyai (1802-1860), and N. I. Lobatchevski (1793-1856)became convinced that the parallel postulate could not be derived from the others and proceeded to develop non- Euclidean geometries, that is to say, geometries in which the parallel postulate does not hold. The work of these men inspired other mathematicians and scientists to enlarge their points of view about \\\"accepted truths\\\" and to challenge other axioms that had been considered sacred for centuries.) It is also easy to deduce the following property of lines which Euclid stated as an axiom.) THEOREM 13.4. Two distinct points determine a line. That is, if P -:;i;Q, there is one and only one line containing both P and Q. It can be described as the set {P + t(Q - P)}.) Proof Let L be the line through P parallel to Q - P, that is, let) L = L(P; Q - P) = {P + t(Q - P)}.) This line contains both P and Q (take t = 0 to get P and t = 1 to get Q). Now let L' be any line containing both P and Q. We shall prove that L' = L. SinceL' contains P, we have L' = L(P; A) for some A -:;i;O. But L' also contains Q so P + cA = Q for some c. Hence we have Q - P = cA, where c -:;i; 0 since Q \\037 P. Therefore Q - P is parallel to A so, by Theorem 13.2, we have L' = L(P; A) = L(P; Q - P) = L.) EXAMPLE. Theorem 13.4 gives us an easy way to test if a point Q is on a given line L(P; A). It tells us that Q is on L(P; A) if and only if Q - P is parallel to A. For example, consider the line L(P; A), where P = (1, 2, 3) and A = (2, -1, 5). To test if the point Q = (1, 1,4) is on this line, we examine Q - P = (0,-1, 1).Since Q - P is not a scalar multiple of A, the point (1, 1,4) is not on this line. On the other hand, if Q = (5,0, 13), we find that Q - P = (4, -2, 10) = 2A, so this Q is on the line.) Linear dependence of two vectors in V n can be expressed in geometric language.) THEOREM 13.5. Two vectors A and B in Vn are linearly dependent if and only if they lie on the same line through the origin.) Proof If either A or B is zero, the result holds trivially. If both are nonzero, then A and B are dependent if and only if B = tA for some scalar t. But B = tA if and only if B lies on the line through the origin parallel to A.) 13.4 Lines and vector-valued functions The concept of a line can be related to the function concept. The correspondencewhich associates to each real t the vector P + tA on the line L(P; A) is an example of a function whose domain is the set of real numbers and whose range is the line L(P; A). If we denote the function by the symbol X, then the function value X(t) at t is given by the equation) (13.1)) X(t) = P + tA .) We call this a vector-valued function of a real variable.))) Lines and vector-valuedfunctions) 475) The function point of view is important because, as we shall see in Chapter I4, it provides a natural method for describing more general space curves as well. The scalar t in Equation (13.1) is often called a parameter, and Equation (13.1) is called a vector parametric equation or, si mply a vector equation of the line. Occasionallyit is con- venient to think of the line as the track of a moving particle, in which case the parameter t is referred to as time and the vector X(t) is called the position vector. Note that two points X(a) and X(b) on a given line L(P; A) are equal if and only if we have P + aA = P + bA, or (a - b)A = O. Since A \\037 0, this last relation holds if and only if a = b. Thus, distinct values of the parameter t lead to distinct points on the line. Now consider three distinct points on a given line, say X(a), X(b), and X(c), wherea > b. We say that X(c) is betu'een X(a) and X(b)if c is between a and b, that is, if a < c < b. Congruence can be defined in terms of norms. A pair of points P, Q is called congruent to another pair P', Q' if liP - QII = liP' - Q'II. The norm liP - QII is also called the distance between P and Q. This completesthe definitions of the concepts of point, line, on, betu'een,and congruence in our analytic model of Euclidean n-space. We conclude this section with some further remarks concerning parametric equations for lines in 3-space. If a line passes through two distinct points P and Q, we can use Q - P for the direction vector A in Equation (13.1); the vector equation of the line then becomes) X(t) = P + t(Q - P)) or) X( t) = tQ + (1 - t)P .) Vector equations can also be expressed in terms of components. For example, if we write P = (p,q,r), A = (a, b, c), and X(t) = (x,)', z), Equation (I3.I) is equivalent to the three scalar equations) ( 13.2)) x = p + ta ,) y = q + tb,) z = r + tc.) These are called scalar parametric equations or simply parametric equations for the line; they are useful in computations involving components. The vector eq uation is simpler and more natural for studying general properties of lines. If all the vectors are in 2-space, only the first two parametric equations in (13.2) are needed. In this case, we can eliminate t from the two parametric equations to obtain the relation) ( 13.3)) b(x - p) - a(y - q) = 0 ,) which is called a Cartesian equation for the line. If a \\037 0, this can be written in the point- slope form) b y - q = - (x - p) . a) The point (p, q) is on the line; the number bla is the slope of the line. The Cartesian equation (13.3) can also be written in terms of dot products. If we let N = (b, -a), X = (x,y), and P = (p, q), Equation (13.3)becomes) (X - P) . N = 0) or) X \\302\\267N = P . N.))) 476) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) The vector N is perpendicular to the direction vector A since N. A = ba - ab = 0; the vector N is called a normal vector to the line. The line consists of all points X satisfying the relation (X - P) \\302\\267N = O. The geometric meaning of this relation is shown in Figure 13.2. The points P and X are on the line and the normal vectorN is orthogonal to X - P. The figure suggests that among all points X on the line, the smallestlength II XII occurs when X is the projection of P along N. We now give an algebraic proof of this fact.) y) N Normal vector) A) x) FIGURE 13.2 A line in the xy-plane through P with normal vector N. Each point X on the line satisfies (X - P) . N = O.) THEOREM 13.6. Let L be the line in V2 consisting of all points X satisfying) X.N=P.N ,) where P is on the line and N is a nonzerovector normal to the line. Let) d = IP . NI .

By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have) /p. NI = IX. NI < II XII IINII,) which implies II XII > IP' NI/IINII = d. The equality sign holds if and only if X = tN for some scalar t, in which case P . N = X' N = tN, N, so t = p. NIN' N. This com- pletes the proof.))) Exercises) 477) In the same way we can prove that if Q is a given point in V2 not on the line L, then for all X on L the smallest value of II X - Q II is I(P - Q) \\302\\267 Nil IINil, and this occurs when X - Q is the projection of P - Q along the normal vector N. The number) I(P - Q) . NI II Nil) is called the distance from the point Q to the line L. The reader should illustrate these con- cepts on a figure similar to that in Figure 13.2.) 13.5 Exercises 1.

A plane is defined in a similar fashion except that we add to P all vectors in the linear span of two linearly inde- pendent vectors A and B. To make certain that V n contains two linearly independent vectors, we assume at the outset that n > 2. Most of our applications will be concerned with the case n = 3.) +tB) FIGURE 13.3 The plane through P spanned by A and B, and its geometric relation to the plane through 0 spanned by A and B.) DEFINITION. A set M of points in V n is called a plane if there is a point P and tJ1'O linearly independent vectors A and B such that) M = {P + sA + tB I s, t real} .) We shall denote the set more briefly by writing M = {P + sA + tB}. Each point of M is said to be on the plane. In particular, taking s = t = 0, we see that P is on the plane. The set {P+ sA + tB} is also called the plane through P spanned by A and B. When P is the origin, the plane is simply the linear span of A and B. Figure 13.3 shows a plane in V 3 through the origin spanned by A and B and also a plane through a nonzero point P spanned by the same two vectors. Now we shall deduce someproperties of planes analogous to the properties of lines given in Theorems 13.1 through 13.4. The first of these shows that the vectors A and B in the definition of the plane {P + sA + tB} can be replaced by any other pair which has the same linear span.) THEOREM 13.7. T1,1'Oplanes M = {P+ sA + tB} and M' = {P+ sC+ tD} through the same point P are equal if and only if the linear span of A and B is equal to the linear span o.f C and D.))) Planes in Euclidean n-space) 479) Proof If the linear span of A and B is equal to that of C and D, then it is clear that M = M'. Conversely, assume that M = M'. Plane M contains both P + A and P + B. Sinceboth these points are also on M', each of A and B must be in the linear span of C and D. Similarly, each of C and D is in the linear span of A and B. Therefore the linear span of A and B is equal to that of C and D.) The next theorem shows that the point P which occurs in the definition of the plane {P + sA + tB} can be replaced by any other point Q on the same plane.) THEOREM 13.8. TlVO planes M = {P + sA + tB} and M' = {Q+ sA + tB} spanned by the same vectors A and B are equal if and only if Q is on M.) Proof If M = M', then Q is certainly on M. To prove the converse, assume Q is on M, say Q = P + aA + bB. Take any point X in M. Then X = P + sA + tB for some scalars sand t. But P = Q - aA - bB, so X = Q + (s - a)A + (t - b)B. Therefore X is in M', so M e M'. Similarly, we find that M' c M, so the two planes are equal.) Euclid's parallel postulate (Theorem 13.3) has an analog for planes. Before we state this theorem we need to define parallelism of two planes. The definition is suggested by the geometric representation in Figure 13.3.) DEFINITION. TH'O planes M = {P+ sA + tB} and M' = {Q+ sC+ t D} are said to be parallel if the linear span of A and B is equal to the linear span of C and D. We also say that a vector X isparallel to the plane M if X is in the linear span of A and B.) THEOREM 13.9. Given a plane M and a point Q not on M, there is one and only one plane M' \\037t'hich contains Q and is parallel to M.) Proof Let M = {P + sA + tB} and consider the plane M' = {Q+ sA + tB}. This plane contains Q and is spanned by the same vectors A and B which span M. Therefore M' is parallel to M. If Mil is another plane through Q parallel to M, then) M\\\" = {Q + sC + tD}) where the linear span of C and D is equal to that of A and B. By Theorem 13.7,we must have Mil = M'. Therefore M' is the only plane through Q which is parallel to M.) Theorem 13.4tells us that two distinct points determinea line. The next theorem shows that three distinct points determine a plane, provided that the three points are not collinear.) THEOREM 13.10. If P, Q, and R are three points not on the same line, then there is one and only one plane M containing these three points. It can be described as the set) ( 13.4)) M = {P+ s(Q - P) + t(R - P)}.))) 480) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) Proof. We assume first that one of the points, say P, is the origin. Then Q and Rare not on the same line through the origin so they are linearly independent. Therefore, they span a plane through the origin, say the plane) M' = {sQ+ tR} .) This plane contains all three points 0, Q, and R. Now we prove that M' is the only plane which contains all three points 0, Q, and R. Any other plane through the origin has the form) Mil = {sA + tB} ,) where A and B are linearly independent. If Mil contains Q and R, we have) ( 13.5)) Q = aA + bB ,) R = cA + dB ,) for some scalars a, b, c, d. Hence,every linear combination of Q and R is also a linear combination of A and B, so M' C Mil. To prove that M\\\" e M', it suffices to prove that each of A and B is a linear combination of Q and R. Multiplying the first equation in (13.5) by d and the second by b and sub- tracting, we eliminate B and get) (ad - bc)A = dQ - bR .) Now ad - bc cannot be zero, otherwise Q and R would be dependent. Therefore we can divide by ad - bc and express A as a linear combination of Q and R. Similarly, we can expressB as a linear combination of Q and R, so we have M\\\" e M'. This proves the theorem when one of the three points P, Q, R is the origin. To prove the theorem in the general case, let M be the set in (13.4), and let C = Q - P, D = R - P. First we show that C and D are linearly independent. If not we would have D = tC for some scalar t, giving us R - P = t(Q - P), or R = P + t(Q - P), contra- dicting the fact that P, Q, R are not on the same line. Therefore the set M is a plane through P spanned by the linearly independent pair C and D. This plane contains all three points P, Q, and R (take s = 1,t = 0 to get Q, and s = 0, t = 1 to get R). Now we must prove that this is the only plane containing P, Q, and R. Let M' be any plane containing P, Q, and R. SinceM' is a plane containing P, we have) M' = {P + sA + tB}) for some linearly independent pair A and B. Let M\\037 = {sA + tB} be the plane through the origin spanned by the same pair A and B. Clearly, M' contains a vector X if and only if M\\037 contains X - P. SinceM' contains Q and R, the plane M\\037 contains C = Q - P and D = R - P. But we have just shown that there is one and only one plane containing 0, C, and D since C and D are linearly independent. Therefore M\\037 = {sC + tD}, so M' = {P+ sC + tD} = M. This completes the proof.) In Theorem 13.5 we proved that two vectors in V n are linearly dependent if and only if))) Planes and vector-valued functions) 481) they lie on a line through the origin. The next theorem is the correspondingresult for three vectors.) THEOREM 13.11. Three vectors A, B, C in V n are linearly dependent if and only if they lie on the same plane through the origin.) Proof Assume A, B, C are dependent. Then we can express one of the vectors as a linear combination of the other two, say C = sA + tB. If A and B are independent, they span a plane through the origin and C is on this plane. If A and B are dependent, then A, B, and C lie on a line through the origin, and hence they lie on any plane through the origin which contains all three points A, B, and C.) To prove the converse, assume that A, B, C lie on the same plane through the origin, say the plane M. If A and B are dependent, then A, B, and C are dependent, and there is nothing more to prove. If A and B are independent, they span a plane M' through the origin. By Theorem 13.10, there is one and only one plane through 0 containing A and B. Therefore M' = M. SinceC is on this plane, we must have C = sA + tB, so A, B, and C are dependent.) 13.7 Planes and vector-valued functions) The correspondence which associates to each pair of real numbers sand t the vector P + sA + tB on the plane M = {P+ sA + tB} is another example of a vector-valued function. In this case, the domain of the function is the set of all pairs of real numbers (s, t) and its range is the plane M. If we denote the function by X and the function values by Xes, t), then for each pair (s, t) we have) ( 13.6)) Xes, t) = P + sA + tB .) We call X a vector-valued function of two real variables. The scalars sand t are called parameters, and the equation (13.6)is called a parametric or vector equation of the plane. This is analogous to the representation of a line by a vector-valued function of one real variable. The presence of two parameters in Eq uation (13.6) gives the plane a two- dimensional quality. When each vector is in V 3 and is expressed in terms of its components, say) P = (PI , P2 , P3) ,) A = (aI' a 2 , a 3) ,) B = (b I , b 2 , b 3) ,) and) Xes, t) = (x, y, z) ,) the vector equation (13.6) can be replacedby three scalar equations,) x = PI + sal + tb I ,) y = P2 + sa 2 + tb 2 ,) z = P3 + sa 3 + tb 3 .) The parameters sand t can always be eliminated from these three equations to give one linear equation of the form ax + by + cz = d, called a Cartesian equation of the plane. We illustrate with an example.))) 482) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometr}') EXAMPLE. Let M = {P + sA + tB}, where P = (1,2,3), A = (1,2, 1), and B = (1,-4, -1). The corresponding vector equation is) X(s, t) = (1,2,3) + s(l, 2,1) + t(l, -4, -1).) From this we obtain the three scalar parametric equations) x=l+s+t,) y = 2 + 2s - 4t ,) z=3+s-t.) To obtain a Cartesianequation, we rewrite the first and third equations in the form x-I - s + t, z - 3 = s - t. Adding and then subtracting these equations, we find that 2s = x + z - 4, 2t = x - z + 2. Substituting in the equation for y, we are led to the Cartesian equation x + y - 3z = -6. We shall return to a further study of linear Cartesian equa- tions in Section 13.16.) 13.8 Exercises) 1. Let M = {P + sA + IB}, where P = (1,2, -3), A = (3,2,1), and B = (1,0,4).

This is accomplishedby means of the cross product A X B (read -'A cross B\\\") which is defined as follows:) DEFINITION. Let A = (aI' a 2 , a 3) and B = (bl , b2 , b 3) be tH'O vectors in V3 . Their cross product A X B (in that order) is defined to be the vector) A X B = (a2 b 3 - a3b2, a3 b I - aIb3 , a I b 2 - a 2 b l ) .) The following properties are easily deduced from this definition.) THEOREM 13.12. For all vectorsA, B, C in (a) A X B = -(B X A) (b) A X (B + C) = (A X B) + (A X C) (c) c(A X B) = (cA) X B, (d) A . (A X B) = 0 (orthogonality to A), (e) B. (A X B) = 0 (orthogonality to B), (f) II A X BI12 = IIA 11211BI12 - (A . B)2 (Lagrange's identity), (g) A X B = 0 if and only if A and B are linearly dependent.) V 3 and for all real c H'e have: (skelv symmetry), (distributive law),) Proof Parts (a), (b), and (c) follow quickly from the definition and are left as exercises for the reader. To prove (d), we note that) A \\302\\267 (A X B) = a1(a2 b 3 - a 3 b 2) + a 2 (a 3b 1 - aIb3 ) + a 3(a Ib2 - a 2 b 1) = 0 .))) 484) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) Part (e) follows in the same way, or it can be deduced from (a) and (d). To prove (f), we write) IIA X BI12 = (a 2 b 3 - a 3 b 2)2 + (a 3 b 1 - a1b3 )2 + (a 1b 2 - a 2b 1)2) and) IIAI1211BI12 - (A' B)2 = (a\\037 + a\\037 + a\\037)(b\\037 + b\\037+ b\\037) - (a1b1 + a2 b 2 + a3b3)2) and then verify by brute force that the two right-hand members are identical. Property (f) shows that A X B = 0 if and only if (A \\302\\267 B)2 = IIA 11211B112. By the Cauchy- Schwarz inequality (Theorem 12.3), this happens if and only if one of the vectors is a scalar multiple of the other. In other words, A X B = 0 if and only if A and B are linearly dependent, which proves (g).) EXAMPLES. Both (a) and (g) show that A X A = O. From the definition of cross product we find that) ixj=k,) jxk=i,) k X i=j.) The cross product is not associative. For example, we have) i X (i X j) = i x k = - j) but) (i x i) x j = 0 x j = 0 .) The next theorem describes two more fundamental properties of the cross product.) THEOREM 13.13. Let A and B be linearly independent vectors in V3 . Then we have the following: (a) The vectors A, B, A x B are linearly independent. (b) Every vector N in V 3 orthogonal to both A and B is a scalar multiple of A x B.) Proof Let C = A x B. Then C \\037 0 since A and B are linearly independent. Given scalars a, b, c such that aA + bB + cC = 0, we take the dot product of each member with C and use the relations A \\302\\267C = B . C = 0 to find c = O. This gives aA + bB = 0, so a = b = 0 since A and B are independent. This proves (a). Let N be any vector orthogonal to both A and B, and let C = A X B. We shall prove that) (N' C)2 = (N' N)(C' C) .) Then from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality (Theorem ] 2.3) it follows that N is a scalar multiple of C. SinceA, B, and C are linearly independent, we know, by Theorem 12.10(c),that they span V3 . In particular, they span N, so we can write) N = aA + bB + cC) for some scalars a, b, c. This gives us) N \\302\\267N = N \\302\\267 (aA + bB + cC) = c N \\302\\267 C))) The cross product) 485) since N . A = N . B = O. Also, since C \\302\\267A = C' B = 0, we have) C \\302\\267N = C' (aA + bB + cC)= cC' C .) Therefore, (N' N)(C' C) = (cN' C)(C' C) = (N' C)(cC'C) = (N' C)2, which completes the proof.) Theorem 13.12 helps us visualize the cross product geometrically. From properties (d) and (e), we know that A x B is perpendicular to both A and B. When the vector A x B is represented- geometrically by an arrow, the direction of the arrow dependson the relative) k) k) . J) i) I) j) AxB) (a) A right-handed coordinate system) (b) A left-handed coordinate system) FIGURE 13.4 Illustrating the relative positions of A, B, and A x B.) positions of the three unit coordinate vectors. If i, j, and k are arranged as shown in Figure 13.4(a), they are said to form a right-handed coordinate system. In this case, the direction of A X B is determined by the \\\"right-hand rule.\\\" That is to say, when A is rotated into B in such a way that the fingers of the right hand point in the direction of rotation, then the thumb indicates the direction of A x B (assuming, for the sake of the discussion, that the thumb is perpendicular to the other fingers). In a left-handed coordinate system, as shown in Figure 13.4(b), the direction of A x B is reversed and may be determined by a corre- sponding left-hand rule. The length of A x B has an interesting geometric interpretation. If A and B are nonzero vectors making an angle () with each other, where 0 < () < 'TT', we may write A \\302\\267B = IIA II IIBII cos () in property (f) of Theorem 13.12 to obtain) IIA X BI12 = II A 11211B112(1 - cos 2 ()) = IIA 11211BI12 sin 2 () ,) from which we find) IIA X BII = IIA II IIBII sin () .) Since II B II sin () is the altitude of the parallelogramdetermined by A and B (see Figure 13.5), we see that the length of A x B is equal to the area of this parallelogram.))) 486) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) B) FIGURE 13.5 The length of A x B is the area of the parallelogram determined by A and B. 13.10 The cross product expressed as a determinant The formula which defines the cross product can be put in a more compact form with the aid of determinants. If a, b, c, d are four numbers, the difference ad - bc is often denoted by the symbol) a b c d) and is called a determinant (of order two). The numbers a, b, c, d are called its elements, and they are said to be arranged in two horizontal rows, a, band c, d, and in two vertical columns, a, c and b, d. Note that an interchange of two rows or of two columns only changes the sign of the determinant. For example,sincead - bc = -(bc - ad), we have) a b b a) c d d c) If we express each of the components of the cross product as a determinant of ordertwo, the formula defining A X B becomes) ( a2 a3 a3 a l al a2 ) AxB= , , . b 2 b 3 b 3 b I b I b 2) This can also be expressed in terms of the unit coordinate vectors i, j, k as follows:) ( 13. 7)) AxB=) a 2 a 3) i+) a 3 a l) a l a 2) k.) b 2 b 3) b 3 b I) j+ b I b 2) Determinants of order three are written with three rows and three columns and they may be defined in terms of second-order determinants by the formula) a l a 2 a 3 b 2 b 3 b I b 3 b I b 2 ( 13.8) b I b 2 b 3 = a l - a2 + a 3 C2 C3 CI C3 CI C2 CI C2 C3 This is said to be an \\\"expansion\\\" of the determinant along its first row. Note that the))) Exercises) 487) determinant on the right that multiplies GI may be obtained from that on the left by deleting the row and column in which G I appears. The other two determinants on the right are obtained similarly. Determinants of order greater than three are discussed in Volume II. Our only purpose in introducing determinants of order two and three at this stage is to have a useful device for writing certain formulas in a compact form that makes them easier to remember. Determinants are meaningful if the elements in the first row are vectors. For example, if we write the determinant) i j k) G I G2 G 3) b I b 2 b 3) and \\\"expand\\\" this according to the rule prescribed in (13.8), we find that the result is equal to the right member of (13.7). In other words, we may write the definition of the cross product A X B in the following compact form:) . . kI ] AxB= G I G 2 G 3 b I b 2 b 3) For example, to compute the cross product of A = 2i - 8j + 3k and B = 4j + 3k, we wri te) . . kI ] -8 3 2 3 2 -8 AxB= 2 -8 3 . j+ k = - 36i- 6j+ 8k- 1- 4 3 0 3 0 4 0 4 3 13.11 Exerc i ses) 1.

Since this is a dot product of two vectors, its value is a scalar. We can compute this scalar by means of determinants. Write A = (aI' a 2 , a 3), B = (bl , b2 , b 3), C = (cl , c2 , c 3) and express B X C according to Equation (13.7). Forming the dot product with A, we obtain) bl bl al a2 a 3 b 2 b 3 b 3 b 2 A \\302\\267B x C = al + a2 + a3 - bl b2 b 3 C2 C3 C3 CI C I C2 CI C2 C3))) The scalar triple product) 489) Thus, A . B X C is equal to the determinant whose rows are the components of the factors A, B, and C. In Theorem 13.12we found that two vectors A and B are linearly dependent if and only if their cross product A X B is the zero vector. The next theorem gives a corresponding criterion for linear dependence of three vectors.) THEOREM 13.14. Three vectors A, B, C in V 3 are linearly dependent if and only if) A . B X C = O.) Proof Assume first that A, B, and C are dependent. If Band C are dependent, then B x C = 0, and hence A \\302\\267B X C = O. Suppose, then, that Band C are independent. Since all three are dependent, there exist scalars a, b, c, not all zero, such that aA + bB + cC = O. We must have a \\\"\\302\\245=0 in this relation, otherwise Band C would be dependent. Therefore, we can divide by a and express A as a linear combination of Band C, say A = tB + sC. Taking the dot product of each member with B X C, we find) A . (B X C) = tB . B X C + sC . B x C = 0 ,) since each of Band C is orthogonal to B X C. Therefore dependence of A, B, and C implies A . B X C = O. To prove the converse, assume that A . B X C = O. If Band C are dependent, then so are A, B, and C, and there is nothing more to prove. Assume then, that Band C are linearly independent. Then, by Theorem 13.13, the three vectors B, C, and B X C are linearly independent. Hence, they span A so we can write) A = aB + bC + c(B X C)) for some scalars a, b, c. Taking the dot product of each member with B X C and using the fact that A . (B X C) = 0, we find c = 0, so A = aB + bC. This proves that r1, B, and C are linearly dependent.) EXAMPLE. To determine whether the three vectors (2, 3, - 1), (3, - 7, 5), and (1, - 5, 2) are dependent, we form their scalar triple product, expressingit as the determinant) 2 3-1 3 -7 5 =2(-14+25)-3(6-5)-1(-15+7)=27. 1 -5 2) Since the scalar triple product is nonzero, the vectors are linearly independent.) The scalar triple product has an interesting geometric interpretation. Figure 13.6 shows a parallelepiped determined by three geometric vectors A, B, C not in the same plane. Its altitude is II C II cos cP, where cP is the angle between A X Band C. ] n this figure, cos cP is positive because 0 < cP < \\0377T. The area of the parallelogram which forms the base is II A x B II, and this is also the area of each crosssection parallel to the base. Integrating the cross-sectional area from 0 to II CII cos cP, we find that the volume of the parallelepiped))) 490) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) is II A X B II (II C II cos 4\\302\\273,the area of the base times the altitude. But we have) IIA x BII (IICII cos 4\\302\\273 = (A x B)' C.) In other words, the scalar triple product A X B. C is equal to the volume of the parallele- piped determined by A, B, C. When i7T < 4> < 7T, cos 4> is negative and the product A X B. C is the negative of the volume. If A, B, C are on a plane through the origin, they are linearly dependent and their scalar triple product is zero. In this case, the parallelepiped degenerates and has zero volume.) AxB) Altitude = II ell cos (jJ-) Volume = A x B . e) = II A xB11) FIGURE 13.6 Geometric interpretation of the scalar triple product as the volume of a parallelepiped.) This geometric interpretation of the scalar triple product suggests certain algebraic properties of this product. For example, a cyclic permutation of the vectors A, B, C leaves the scalar triple product unchanged. By this we mean that) (13.9)) A X B. C = B X C' A = C X A. B.) An algebraic proof of this property is outlined in Exercise 7 of Section 13.14.This property implies that the dot and cross are interchangeable in a scalar triple product. In fact, the commutativity of the dot product implies (B X C). A = A \\302\\267 (B X C) and when this is combined with the first equation in (13.9), we find that) (13.10)) AxB'C=A.BxC.) The scalar triple product A \\302\\267B X C is often denoted by the symbol [ABC] without indi- cating the dot or cross. Because of Equation (13.10), there is no ambiguity in this notation- the product depends only on the order of the factors A, B, C and not on the positions of the dot and cross.) 13.13 Cramer's rule for solving a system of three linear equations The scalar triple product may be used to solve a system of three simultaneous linear equations in three unknowns x, y, z. Suppose the system is written in the form a1x + b1y + clZ = d 1 ,) (13.11)) a 2 x + b 2y + c2Z = d 2 , a3 x + b 3y + c3 Z = d 3 .))) Exercises) 491) Let A be the vector with components a I , a 2 , a 3 and define B, C, and D similarly. Then the three equations in (13. I 1) are equivalent to the single vector equation) (13.12)) xA + yB + zC = D .) If we dot multiply both sides of this equation with B x C, writing [ABC] for A . B x C, we find that) x[ABC] + y[BBC] + z[CBC]= [DBC].) Since [BBC] = [CBC] = 0, the coefficients of y and z drop out and we obtain) (13.13)) [DBC]x= [ABC]) if [ABC] =;f 0 .) A similar argument yields analogous formulas for y and z. Thus we have) (13.14)) [ADC] Y = [ABC]) and) [ABD]z= [ABC]) if [ABC] =;f 0 .) The condition [A BC] =;f 0 means that the three vectors A, B, C are linearly independent. In this case, (13.12) shows that every vector D in 3-space is spanned by A, B, C and the multipliers x, y, z are uniquely determined by the formulas in (13.13) and (13.14). When the scalar triple products that occur in these formulas are written as determinants, the result is known as Cramer's rule for solving the system (13.11):) dl bi C I a l d l CI a l bi dl d2 b 2 C2 a 2 d 2 C2 a 2 b 2 d 2 d 3 b 3 C 3 a 3 d 3 C 3 a3 b 3 d 3 x= Y= z= al bi C I a l bi CI al bI C I a 2 b 2 C2 a 2 b 2 C2 a 2 b 2 C2 a 3 b 3 C 3 a 3 b 3 C 3 a 3 b 3 C 3) If [ABC] = 0, then A, B, C lie on a plane through the origin and the system has no solution unless D lies in the same plane. In this latter case, it is easy to show that there are infinitely many solutions of the system. In fact, the vectors A, B, C are linearly dependent so there exist scalars u, v, M,' not all zero such that uA + vB + }vC= O. If the triple (x, y, z) satisfies (13.12),then so does the triple (x + tu, y + tv, z + tH') for all real t, since we have) (x + tu)A + (y + tv)B + (z + t}v)C = xA + yB + zC + t(uA + vB + }vC)= xA + yB + zC .) 13.14 Exercises) 1.

Now we show that planes in V 3 can be described in an entirely different way, using the concept of a normal vector.) DEFINITION. Let M = {P + sA + tB} be the plane through P spanned by A and B. A vector N in V 3 is said to be perpendicular to M if N is perpendicular to both A and B. If, in addition, N is nonzero, then N is called a norlnal vector to the plane. Note: If N. A = N . B = 0, then N. (sA + tB) = 0, so a vector perpendicular to both A and B is perpendicular to every vector in the linear span of A and B. Also, if N is normal to a plane,so is tN for every real f \\037 O.) THEOREM 13.15. Given a plane M = {P+ sA + tB} through P spanned by A and B. Let N = A X B. Then \\037vehave the following: (a) N is a normal vector to M. (b) M is the set of all X in V 3 satisfying the equation) (13.16)) (X - P) . N = 0 .) Proof Since M is a plane, A and B are linearly independent, so A x B =;f O. This proves ,a) since A x B is orthogonal to both A and B.))) 494) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) To prove (b), let M' be the set of all X in V 3 satisfying Equation (13.16). If X EM, then X - P is in the linear span of A and B, so X - P is orthogonal to N. Therefore X E M' which proves that M e M'. Conversely, suppose XE M'. Then X satisfies (13.16).Since A, B, N are linearly independent (Theorem 13.13),they span every vector in V 3 so, in particular, we have) X - P = sA + tB + uN) for some scalars s, t, u. Taking the dot product of each member with N, we find u = 0, so X - P = sA + tB. This shows that X E M. Hence, M' c M, which completes the proof of (b). The geometric meaning of Theorem 13.15 is shown in Figure 13.7. The points P and X are on the plane and the normal vector N is orthogonal to X - P. This figure suggests the following theorem.) THEOREM 13.16. to M, let) Given a plane M through a point P, and given a nonzerovector N normal) (13.17)) d = IP . NI . IINII) Then every X on M has length II XII > d. Moreover, M,'e have II XII = d if and only if X is the projection of P along N:) x = tN ,) where) P'N t= N.N) Proof The proof follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in exactly the same way as we proved Theorem 13.6, the corresponding result for lines in V2 .) By the same argument we find that if Q is a point not on M, then among all points X on M the smallestlength II X - Q II occurs when X - Q is the projection of P - Q along N. This minimum length is I(P - Q) . NI/IINII and is called the distance from Q to the plane. The number d in (13.17) is the distance from the origin to the plane.) 13.16 Linear Cartesian equations for planes The results of Theorems 13.15 and 13.16 can also be expressed in terms of components. If we write N = (a, b, c), P = (Xl'YI , Zl), and X = (x, y, z), Equation (13.16) becomes) (13.18)) a(x - Xl) + bey - YI) + c(z - Zl) = 0 .) This is called a Cartesian equation for the plane, and it is satisfied by those and only those points (x, y, z) which lie on the plane. The set of points satisfying (13.18) is not altered if we multiply each of a, b, c by a nonzero scalar t. This simply amounts to a different choice of normal vector in (13.16). We may transpose the terms not involving x, y, and z, and write (13.18) in the form) (13.19)) ax + by + cz = dl ,))) Linear Cartesian equations for planes) 495) where dl = aX l + bYl + CZ l . An equation of this type is said to be linear in x, y, and z. We have just shown that every point (x, y, z) on a plane satisfies a linear Cartesian equation (13.19) in which not all three of a, b, C are zero. Conversely, every linear equation with this property represents a plane. (The reader may verify this as an exercise.) The number d l in Equation (13.19) bears a simple relation to the distance d of the plane from the origin. Since dl = p. N, we have Idll = IP' NI = diINII. In particular Idll = d if the normal N has length 1. The plane passes through the origin if and only if d l = O.) z) N) (0, 1. 0)) y) x) FIGURE 13.7 A plane through P and X with normal vector N.)

The numbers 3, 1, 2 are called,respectively, the X-, y-, and z- intercepts of the plane. A knowledge of the interceptsmakes it possible to sketch the plane quickly. A portion of the plane is shown in Figure 13.8. Its distance d from the origin is d = 6/IINII = 6/7.) Two parallel planes will have a common normal N. If N = (a,b, c), the Cartesian equa- tions of two parallel planes can be written as follows:) ax + by + cz = dl ,) ax + by + cz = d2 ,) the only difference being in the right-hand members. The number Idl - d2 1/ IINil is called the perpendicular distance between the two planes, a definition suggested by Theorem 13.16.))) 496) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) Two planesare calledperpendicular if a normal of one is perpendicular to a normal of the other. More generally, if the normals of two planes make an angle () with each other, then we say that () is an angle between the two planes.) 13.17 Exercises 1. Given vectorsA = 2; + 3j - 4k and B = j + k.

The line G is called a generator of the cone, A is its axis, and P its vertex. Each of the cones shown in Figure 13.9 has a vertical axis. The upper and lower portions of the cone meeting at the vertex are called nappes of the cone. The curves obtained by slicing the cone with a plane not passing through the vertex are called conic sections,or simply conics. If the cutting plane is paraIlelto a line of the cone through the vertex, the conic is called a) Parabola /) \\\\ Hyperbola /) FIGURE 13.9 The conic sections.))) 498) Applications of vectoralgebra to analytic geometry) parabola. Otherwise the intersection is called an ellipse or a hyperbola, according as the plane cuts just one or both nappes. (See Figure 13.9.) The hyperbola consists of two \\\"branches,\\\" one on each nappe. Many important discoveries in both pure and applied mathematics have been related to the conic sections. Appolonius' treatment of conicsas early as the 3rd century B.C.\\\",'as one of the most profound achievementsof classical Greek geometry. Nearly 2000 years later, Galileo discovered that a projectile fired horizontally from the top of a tower falls to earth along a parabolic path (if air resistance is neglected and if the motion takes place above a part of the earth that can be regarded as a flat plane). One of the turning points in the history of astronomy occurred around 1600 when Kepler suggested that all planets move in elliptical orbits. Some 80 years later, Newton was able to demonstrate that an elliptical planetary path implies an inverse-square law of gravitational attraction. This led Newton to formulate his famous theory of universal gravitation which has often been referred to as the greatest scientific discovery ever made. Conicsections appear not only as orbits of planets and satellites but also as trajectories of elementary atomic particles. They are used in the design of lenses and mirrors, and in architecture. These examples and many others show that the importance of the conic sectionscan hardly be overestimated.) There are other equivalent definitions of the conic sections. One of these refers to special points known asfoci (singular:focus). An ellipse may be defined as the set of all points in a plane the sum of whose distances dl and d2 from two fixed points F1 and F2 (the foci) is) I Directrix I I I) d 2) d 1 + d 2 = constant (ellipse)) I d 1 - d 21 = constant (hyperbola)) d) = d2 (parabola)) FIGURE 13.1 0 Focal definitions of the conic sections.) constant. (See Figure 13.10.) If the foci coincide, the ellipsereducesto a circle. A hyper- bola is the set of all points for which the difference Id1 - d2 1 is constant. A parabola is the set of all points in a plane for which the distance to a fixed point F (called the focus) is equal to the distance to a given line (called the directrix). There is a very simple and elegant argument which shows that the focal property of an ellipse is a consequence of its definition as a section of a cone. This proof, which we may refer to as the \\\"ice-cream-cone proof,\\\" was discovered in 1822 by a Belgian mathematician, G. P. Dandelin (1794-1847), and makes use of the two spheres SI and S2 which are drawn so as to be tangent to the cutting plane and the cone, as illustrated in Figure 13.11. These spheres touch the cone along two parallel circles C1and C 2 . We shall prove that the points F I and F 2 , where the spheres contact the plane, can serve as foci of the ellipse.))) The conic sections) 499) Sphere5.) Circle C 2 Sphere 52) FIGURE 13.11 The ice-cream-cone proof.) \\037 \\037 Let P be an arbitrary point of the ellipse. The problem is to prove that IIPF111 + IIPF 2 11 is constant, that is, independent of the choice of P. For this purpose, draw that line on the cone from the vertex 0 to P and let Al and A 2 be its intersections with the circles Cl \\037 \\037 -+ and C 2 , respectively. ThenPFI and PAl are two tangents to Sl from P, and hence IIPFll1 - -+ --+-+ liP Alii. Similarly IIPF 2 11 = IIPA 2 11, and therefore we have) \\037 -+ -+ -+ IIPFll1 + IIPF 2 11 = liP Alii + IIPA 2 11 \\302\\267) \\037 \\037 \\037 But liP Alii + liP A 2 11 = IIA lA211, which is the distance between the parallel circles C l and C2 measured along the surface of the cone. This proves that Fl and F 2 can serve as foci of the ellipse,as asserted. Modifications of this proof work also for the hyperbola and the parabola. In the case of the hyperbola, the proof employs one sphere in each portion of the cone. For the))) 500) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) parabola one sphere tangent to the cutting plane at the focus F is used. This sphere touches the cone along a circlewhich lies in a plane whose intersectionwith the cutting plane is the directrix of the parabola. With these hints the reader should be able to show that the focal properties of the hyperbola and parabola may be deducedfrom their definitions as sections of a cone.) 13.19 Eccentricity of conic sections Another characteristic property of conic sections involves a concept called eccentricity. A conic section can be defined as a curve traced out by a point moving in a plane in such a way that the ratio of its distances from a fixed point and a fixed line is constant. This constant ratio is called the eccentricity of the curve and is denoted bye. (This should not be confused with the Euler number e.) The curve is an ellipse if 0 < e < 1, a parabola if e = 1, and a hyperbola if e > 1. The fixed point is called a focus and the fixed line a directrix. We shall adopt this definition as the basis for our study of the conic sections since it permits a simultaneous treatment of all three types of conics and lends itself to the use of vector methods. In this discussion it is understood that all points and lines are in the same plane.) DEFINITION. Given a line L, a point F not on L, and a positive number e. Let d(X, L) denote the distance from a point X to L. The set of all X satisfying the relation) (13.20)) II X - FII = e d(X, L)) is calleda conic section with eccentricity e. The conicis called an ellipse if e < 1,a parabola if e = 1,and a hyperbola if e > 1.) If N is a vector normal to L and if P is any point on L the distance d(X,L) from any point X to L is given by the formula d(X L) = I(X- P) . NI , II Nil .) When N has length 1, this simplifies to d(X, L) = I(X - P) . NI, and the basic equation (13.20) for the conic sections becomes) (13.21)) II X - FII = e I(X - P). NI.) The line L separates the plane into two parts which we shall arbitrarily label as \\\"positive\\\" and \\\"negative\\\" according to the choice of N. If (X - P) . N > 0, we say that X is in the positive half-plane, and if (X - P) \\302\\267N < 0, we say that X is in the negative half-plane. On the line L itself we have (X - P) \\302\\267N = O. In Figure 13.12 the choice of the normai vector N dictates that points to the right of L are in the positive half-plane and those to the left are in the negative half-plane. Now we place the focus F in the negative half-plane, as indicated in Figure 13.12, and choose P to be that point on L nearest to F.

For example, if the focus is at the origin the equation becomes) (13.23)) II XII =eIX'N-dl.) This form is especially useful if we wish to express X in terms of polar coordinates. Take the directrixL to be vertical, as shown in Figure 13.13, and let N = i. If X has polar co- ordinates rand (), we have II XII = r, X. N = r cos (), and Equation (13.23) becomes) (13.24)) r = e Ir cos () - dl .) If X lies to the left of the directrix, we have r cos () < d, so Ir cos () - dl = d - r cos() and (13.24) becomes r = e(d - r cos()), or, solving for r, we obtain) (13.25)) ed r= e cos () + 1))) 502) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) If X lies to the right of the directrix, we have r cos (j > d, so (13.24) becomes) r = e(rcos(j - d) ,) . . gIvIng us) (13.26)) ed r= e cos (j - 1) Since r > 0, this last equation implies e > 1.

We show next that the focus of an ellipse or hyperbola can always be placed so the conic section will be symmetric about the origin. To do this we rewrite the basic equation (13.22)as follows:) (13.29) II X - FII = e I(X - F) \\302\\267N - dl = e IX' N - F. N - dl = leX' N - ai,) where a = ed + eF' N. Squaring both members, we obtain) (13.30)) IIXI1 2 - 2F' X + IIFI12 = e2 (X' N)2 - 2eaX'N + a 2 .) If we are to have symmetry about the origin, this equation must also be satisfied when X is replaced by - X, giving us) (13.31)) IIXI1 2 + 2F. X + IIFI12 = e2 (X' N)2 + 2eaX' N + a 2 .) Subtracting (13.31) from (13.30), we have symmetry if and only if) F. X = eaX \\302\\267N) or) (F - eaN)\\302\\267X = o.) This equation can be satisfied for all X on the curve if and only if F and N are related by the equation) ( 13.32)) F = eaN ,) where a = ed + eF' N .) The relation F = eaN implies F. N = ea, giving us a = ed + e 2 a. If e = 1, this last equation cannot be satisfied sinced, the distance from the focus to the directrix,is nonzero. This means there is no symmetry about the origin for a parabola. If e \\\"\\302\\245=1, we can always satisfy the relations in (13.32) by taking) (13.33)) ed a = 2'1 - e) F = e 2d N. 1 - e 2) Note that a > 0 if e < 1 and a < 0 if e > 1. Putting F = eaN in\\\" (13.30) we obtain the following.) THEOREM 13.19. Let C be a conic section with eccentricity e \\\"\\302\\245=1 and with a focus Fat a distance d from a directrix L. If N is a unit normal to L and if F = eaN, \\037i'here a = edl(1 - e 2), then C is the set of all points X satisfying the equation) (13.34)) IIXI1 2 + e 2a 2 = e2 (X' N)2 + a2 .))) Cartesian equations for the conic sections) 505) This equation displays the symmetry about the origin since it is unchanged when X is replaced by - X. Because of this symmetry, the ellipse and the hyperbola each have two foci, symmetrically located about the center, and two directrices, also symmetrically located about the center. Equation (13.34) is satisfied when X = -I. aN. These two points are called vertices of the conic. The segment joining them is called the major axis if the conic is an ellipse, the transverseaxis if the conic is a hyperbola. Let N' be a unit vector orthogonal to N. If X = bN',then X' N = 0, so Equation (13.34) is satisfied by X = bN' if and only if b2 + e 2a 2 = a 2. This requires e < 1,b 2 = a 2 ( I - e2 ). The segment joining the points X = -I.bN',where b = aV 1 - e 2 is called the minor axis of the ellipse.) Note: If we put e = 0 in (13.34), it becomes IIX II = a, the equation of a circle of radius a and center at the origin. In view of (13.33),we can considersuch a circle as a limiting case of an ellipse in which e --+ 0 and d --+ 00 in such a way that ed --+ a.) 13.23 Cartesian equations for the conic sections) To obtain Cartesian equations for the ellipse and hyperbola, we simply write (13.34) in terms of the rectangular coordinatesof X. Choose N = i (which means the directrices are vertical) and let X = (x,y). Then IIXI1 2 = x 2 + y2, X' N = x, and (13.34)becomes x 2 + y2 + e2 a 2 = e 2x 2 + a 2 , or x2 (1 - e2) + y2 = a 2 (1 - e2 ), which gives us) (13.35)) x2 y2 -+ =1. a 2 a 2(1 _ e2 )) This Cartesian equation represents both the ellipse (e < 1)and the hyperbola (e > I) and is said to be in standard form. The foci are at the points (ae, 0) and (-ae, 0); the directrices are the vertical lines x = ale and x = -ale. If e < I, we let b = aV 1 - e 2 and write the equation of the ellipsein the standard form) (13.36)) x2 y2 -+-=1. a 2 b 2) Its foci are located at (c, 0) and (-c, 0), where c = ae = Va 2 - b2 . An example is shown in Figure 13.14( a). If e > 1, we let b = lalVe 2 - 1 and write the equation of the hyperbola in the standard form) (13.37)) x2 y2- --1 a 2 - b 2 - .) Its foci are at the points (c, 0) and (-c, 0), where c = lal e = V a 2 + b 2 . An example is shown in Figure 13.14(b).))) 506) Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) Note: Solving for y -in terms of x in (13.37) , we obtain two solutions) ( 13.38)) b y= ::I:\\037 Y x2-a2.) For large positive x, the number Y x 2 - a 2 is nearly equal to x, so the right member of (13.38) is nearly :l:bxllal. It is easy to prove that the difference between Yl = bxllal and Y2 = by x 2 - a 2/1al approaches 0 as x -+ + 00. This difference is) b A / 2 2 b x 2 - (x 2 - a 2 ) Ia I b Ia I b Yl - Y2 = - (x - -V x - a ) = - = < - , lal lalx+yx 2 -a 2 x+ V x2-a 2 x) so Yl - Y2 -+ 0 as x -+ + 00. Therefore, the line y = bxllal is an asymptote of the hyperbola. The line y = -bxllal is another asymptote. The hyperbola is said to ap- proach these lines asymptotically. The asymptotes are shown in Figure 13.14(b).) y) y) x) x) (a,O)) (a) Ellipse) (b) Hyperbola) x2 y2- + - = 1; b 2 = a 2 - c2 a 2 b 2) x2 Y2 -- -= 1. b'l.=c 2 -a 2 a 2 b 2 ') FIGURE 13.14 Conic sections of eccentricity e \\037 1, symmetric about the origin. The foci are at (:l:c, 0), where c = lal e. The triangles relate a, b, c geometrically.) The Cartesian equation for the ellipse and hyperbola will take a different form if the directrices are not vertical. For example, if the directrices are taken to be horizontal, we may take N = j in Equation (13.34). Since X' N = X' j = y, we obtain a Cartesian equation like (13.35),except that x and yare interchanged. The standard form in this case IS) (13.39)) y2 x2 -+ =1. a 2 a 2(1 - e 2 ) If the conic is translated by adding a vector Xo = (xo , Yo) to each of its points, the center will be at (xo , Yo) instead of at the origin. The corresponding Cartesian eq uations may be obtained from (13.35) or (13.39) by replacing x by x - Xo and y by Y - Yo.))) Cartesian equations for the conic sections) 507) To obtain a Cartesian equation for the parabola, we return to the basic equation (13.20) with e = 1. Take the directrix to be the vertical line x = - c and place the focus at (c, 0). If X = (x,y), we have X - F = (x - c,y), and Equation (13.20) gives us (x - C)2 + y2 = Ix + c1 2 . This simplifies to the standard form) ( 13.40)) y2 = 4cx.) The point midway between the focus and directrix (the origin in Figure 13.15) is cal1ed the vertex of the parabola, and the line passing through the vertex and focus is the axis of the parabola. The parabola is symmetric about its axis. If c > 0, the parabola lies to the right of the y-axis, as in Figure 13.15. When c < 0, the curve lies to the left of the y-axis.)

If the axes are chosenso the focus is on the y-axis at the point (0, c) and if the horizontal line y = -c is taken as directrix, the standard form of the Cartesian equation becomes) x 2 = 4cy . When c > 0 the parabola opens upward as shown in Figure 13. 16. When c < 0, it opens downward. If the parabola in Figure 13.15 is translated so that its vertex is at the point (xo , Yo), the corresponding equation becomes) (y - YO)2 = 4c(x - xo) .) The focus is now at the point (xo + c, Yo) and the directrix is the line x = Xo - c. The axis of the parabola is the line y = Yo . Similarly, a translation of the parabola in Figure 13.16 leads to the equation) (x - XO)2 = 4c(y - Yo) ,) with focus at (xo , Yo + c). The line y = Yo - c is its directrix, the line x = Xo its axis. The reader may find it amusing to prove that a parabola does not have any asymptotes.))) 508 Applications of vector algebra to analytic geometry) 13.24 Exercises) Each of the equations in Exercises 1 through 6 represents an ellipse.

Given that Q describes the straight line x + 2Y - 5 = 0, find the locus of the point P symmetric to Q with respect to the circle x 2 + y2 = 4.))) 14) CALCULUS OF VECTOR-VALUED FUNCTIONS) 14.1 Vector-valued functions of a real variable This chapter combines vector algebra with the methods of calculus and describes some applications to the study of curves and to some problems in mechanics. The concept of a vector-valuedfunction is fundamental in this study.) DEFINITION. A function whose dOl11ain is a set of real numbers and whose range is a subsetof n-space V n is called a vector-valued function of a real variable.) We have encountered such functions in Chapter 13. For example, the line through a point P parallel to a nonzero vector A is the range of the vector-val ued function X given by) X(t) = P + tA) for all real t. Vector-valued functions will be denoted by capital letters such as F, G, X, Y, etc., or by small bold-face italic letters.t:g, etc. The value of a function Fat t is denoted, as usual, by F(t). In the examples we shall study, the domain of F will be an interval which may contain one or both endpoints or which may be infinite.) 14.2 Algebraic operations. Components The usual operations of vector algebra can be applied to combine two vector-valued functions or to combine a vector-valued function with a real-valued function. If F and G are vector-valued functions, and if u is a real-valued function, all having a common domain, we define new functions F + G, uF, and F. G by the equations) (F + G)(t) = F(t) + G(t) ,) (uF)(t) = u(t)F(t) ,) (F . G)(t) = F(t) . G(t) .) The sum F + G and the product uF are vector valued, whereas the dot product F. G is real valued. If F(t) and G(t) are in 3-space, we can also define the cross product F X G by the formula) (F x G)(t) = F(t)x G(t).) 512))) Limits, derivatives, and integrals) 513) The operation of composition may be applied to combine vector-valued functions with real-valued functions. For example, if F is a vector-valued function whose domain in- cludes the range of a real-valued function u, the composition G = F 0 u is a new vector- valued function defined by the equation) G(t) = F[u(t)]) for each t in the domain of u. If a function F has its values in V n , then each vector F(t) has n components, and we can write) F(t) = (fl(t),f2(t)\\\", . . ,fn(t)) .) Thus, each vector-valued F gives rise to n real-valued functions fl , . . . ,fn whose values at t are the components of F(t). We indicate this relation by writing F = (fl , . . . ,fn)' and we call he the kth component of F.) 14.3 Limits, derivatives, and integrals The basic concepts of calculus, such as limit, derivative, and integral, can alsobe extended to vector-valued functions. We simply express the vector-valued function in terms of its components and perform the operations of calculus on the components.) DEFINITION. If F = (fl , . . . ,fn) is a vector-valued function, we define limit, derivative, and integral by the equations lim F(t) = ( Iimfl(t), . . . , l imfn(t) ) , t\\037p t\\037p t\\037p) F'(t) = (f{(t), . . . ,f\\037(t)),) I: F(t) dt = U: fl(t) dt, . . . ,I: fn(t) dt) ,) \\\"\\\"henever the components on the right are meaningful.) We also say that F is continuous, differentiable, or integrableon an interval if each com- ponent of F has the corresponding property on the interval. In view of these definitions, it is not surprising to find that many of the theorems on limits, continuity, differentiation, and integration of real-valuedfunctions are also valid for vector-valued functions. We state some of the theorems that we use in this chapter.) THEOREM 14.1. If F, G, and u are differentiable on an interval, then so are F + G, uF, and F . G, and H'e have) (F+ G)' = F' + G',) (uF)' = u'F + uF',) (F' G)' = F' \\302\\267G + F. G'.))) 514) Calculus of vector-valued functions) If F and G have values in V 3, H'e also have) (F X G)' = F' X G + F X G'.) Proof To indicate the routine nature of the proofs we discuss the formula for (uF)'. The proofs of the others are similar and are left as exercisesfor the reader. Writing F = (fl , . . . ,fn)' we have) uF = (Ufl , . . . , ufn) ,) (uF)' = \\302\\253ufl)\\\" . . . , (ufn)') \\302\\267) But the derivative of the kth component of uF is (ufk)' = U'fk + uf; , so we have) (uF)' = U'(fl,' . . ,fn) + u(f{,. . . ,f\\037) = u'F + uF'.) The reader should note that the differentiation formulas in Theorem 14.1 are analogous to the usual formulas for differentiating a sum or product of real-valued functions. Since the cross product is not commutative, one must pay attention to the order of the factors in the formula for (F X G)'. . The formula for differentiating F. G gives us the following theorem which we shall use frequently.) THEOREM 14.2. If a vector-valued function is differentiable and has constant length on an open interval I, then F. F' = 0 on I. In other lfords, F'(f) is perpendicular to F(t) for each t in I.) Proof Let get) = II F(t) 11 2 = F(t) . F(t). By hypothesis, g is constant on I, and hence g' = 0 on I. But since g is a dot product, we have g' = F'. F + F. F' = 2F.F'. Therefore we have F . F' = O.) The next theorem deals with composite functions. Its proof follows easily from Theorems 3.5 and 4.2 which contain the corresponding results for real-valued functions.) THEOREM 14.3. Let G = F 0 u, \\037vhere F is vector valued and u is real valued. {f u is continuous at t and if F is continuous at u(t), then G is continuous at t. If the derivatives u'(t) and F'[u(t)] exist, then G'(t) also exists and is given by the chain rule,) G'(t) = F'[u(t)]u'(t) .) If a vector-valued function F is continuous on a closed interval [a, b], then each com- ponent is continuous and hence integrable on [a, b], so F is integrable on [a, b]. The next three theorems give basic properties of the integral of vector-val ued functions. I n each case, the proofs follow at once from the corresponding results for integrals of real-valued functions.) THEOREM 14.4. LINEARITY AND ADDITIVITY.

If C E [a, b], define the indefinite integral A to be the vector-valued function given by) A(x) = J: F(t) dt) if a < x < b .) Then A'(x) exists, and MJe have A'(x) = F(x) for each x in (a, b).) THEOREM 14.6. SECOND FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM OF CALCULUS. Assu111ethat the vecfor- valued function F has a continuous derivative F ' on an open interval I. Then, for each choice of c and x in I, H'e have) F(x) = F(c) + r F(t) dt . \\037c) The next theorem is an extension of the property c S\\037F(t) dt = J\\037 cF(t) dt, with multipli- cation by the scalar c replaced by dot multiplication by a vector C.) THEOREM 14.7. If F = (f1 , . . . ,frJ is integrable on [a, b], then for every vector C = (c1, . . . , c n ) the dot product C' F is integrable on [a, b], and we have) c -f: F(t) dt = I: C. F(t) dt .)

Now we use Theorem 14.7 in conjunction with the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to obtain the following important property of integrals of vector-valued functions.) THEOREM 14.8. If F and IIFII are integrable on [a, b] H'e have) (14.1 )) II I: F(t) dt II < J: IIF(t)11 dt .) Proof Let C = S\\037F(t) dt. If C = 0, then (14.1) holds trivially.

Combining (14.2) and (14.3), we get) IICII 2 < IICIII: IIF(t)11 dt \\302\\267) Since II C II > 0, we can divide by II C II to get (14.1).) 14.4 Exercises) Compute the derivatives F'(I) and F\\\"(I) for each of the vector-valued functions in Exercises 1 through 6. 1.

Prove that there is a constant vector A and a positive real-valued function u such that F(t) = u(t)A for all t.) 14.5 Applications to curves. Tangency Let X be a vector-valued function whose domain is an interval I. As t runs through I, the corresponding function values X(t) run through a set of points which we call the graph of the function X. If the function values are in 2-space or in 3-space, we can visualize the graph geometrically. For example, if X(t) = P + tA, where P and A are fixed vectors in V 3, with A \\302\\245=0, the graph of X is a straight line through P parallel to A. A more general function will trace out a more general graph, as suggestedby the example in Figure 14.1. If X is continuous on I, such a graph is calleda curve; more specifically, the curve described by X. Sometimes we say that the curve is described parametrically by X. The interval I is called a parametric interval; each t in 1 is called a para/neter. Properties of the function X can be used to investigate geometric properties of its graph. In particular, the derivative X' is related to the concept of tangency, as in the case of a real-valued function. We form the difference quotient) (14.4)) X(! + h) - X(t ) h) and investigate its behavior as h \\037 O. This quotient is the product of the vector X( t + h) - X(t) by the scalar 1/11. The numerator, X(t + h) - X(t), illustrated geometrically in Figure 14.2, is parallel to the vector in (14.4). If we express this difference quotient in terms of its components and let h \\037 0, we find that) lim X(t + h) - X(t ) = X'(t), h--.O h))) 518) Calculus of vector-valued functions) x) FIGURE 14.1 A curve traced out by a vector X(t).) x) FIGURE 14.2 The vector X(t + h) - X(t) is parallel to [X(t + h) - X(t)]jh.) assuming that the derivative X'(t) exists. The geometric interpretation of this relation suggests the following definition.) DEFINITION. Let C be a curve described by a continuous vector-valued function X. If the derivative X'(t) exists and is nonzero, the straight line through X(t) parallel to X'(t) is called the tangent line to C at X(t). The vector X'(t) is called a tangent vector to C at X(t).) EXAMPLE 1. Straight line. For a line given by X(t) = P + tA, where A \\302\\245=0, we have X'(t) = A, so the tangent line at each point coincideswith the graph of X, a property which we surely want.) EXAMPLE 2. Circle. If X describes a circle of radius a and center at a point P, then II X(t) - PII = a for each t. The vector X(t) - P is called a radius vector; it may be repre- sented geometrically by an arrow from the center to the point X(t). Sincethe radius vector has constant length, Theorem 14.2 tells us that it is perpendicular to its derivative and hence perpendicular to the tangent line. Thus, for a circle, our definition of tangency agrees with that given in elementary plane geometry.) EXAMPLE 3. Invariance under a change of parameter. Different functions can have the same graph. For example,suppose that X is a continuous vector-valued function defined on an interval I and suppose that u is a real-valued function that is differentiable with u' never zero on an interval J, and such that the range of u is I. Then the function Y defined on J by the equation) yet) = X[u(t))) is a continuous vector-valued function having the same graph as X. Two functions X and Y so related are called equivalent. They are said to provide different parametric representations of the same curve. The function u is said to define a change of parameter. The most important geometricconcepts associated with a curve are those that remain invariant under a change of parameter. For example, it is easy to prove that the tangent))) Applications to curves. Tangency) 519) line is invariant. If the derivative X'[u(t)] exists,the chain rule shows that Y'(t) also exists and is given by the formula) Y'(t) = X'[u(t)]u'(t).) The derivative u'(t) is never zero. If X'[u(t)]is nonzero, then Y'(t) is also nonzero, so Y'(t) is parallel to X'[u(t)]. Therefore both representations X and Y lead to the same tangent line at each point of the curve.) EXAMPLE 4. Reflection properties of the conic sections. Conic sections have reflection properties often used in the design of optical and acoustical eq uipment. Light rays emanat- ing from one focus of an elliptical reflector will converge at the other focus, as shown in) (a) Ellipse) (b) (c) Hyperbola Parabola Reflection properties of the conic sections.) Tangent) FIGURE 14.3) Figure 14.3(a). Light rays directed toward one focus of a hyperbolic reflector will con- verge at the other focus, as suggested by Figure 14.3(b). In a parabolic reflector, light rays parallel to the axis converge at the focus, as shown in Figure 14.3(c). To establish these reflectionproperties, we need to prove that in each figure the angles labeled () are equal. We shall do this for the ellipse and hyperbola and ask the reader to give a proof for the parabola. Place one focus F1at the origin and let \\\"1 and \\\"2 be unit vectors having the same directions as X and X - F2 , respectively, where X is an arbitrary point on the conic. (See Figure 14.4.) If d1= II XII and d 2 = II X - F2 11 are the focal distances between X and the foci F1and F 2 , respectively, we have) X = d1\\\"1) and) X = d 2 \\\"2 + F 2 .) Now we think of X, \\\"1 , \\\"2 , d 1 , and d 2 as functions defined on some interval of real numbers. Their derivatives are related by the equations) (14.5)) X' = d1\\\"\\037 + d\\037\\\"l') X' = d2\\\"\\037 + d\\037\\\"2') Since \\\"1 and \\\"2 have constant length, each is perpendicular to its derivative,so Equations (14.5) give us X\\\"\\\"1 = d; and X\\\"\\\"2 = d\\037. Adding and subtracting these relations, we))) 520) Calculus of vector-valued functions) find that) (14.6)) X' . (Ul + U2) = d\\037 + d;,) x' . (U 1 - U2) = d \\037 - d \\037.)

Therefore, Equations (14.6) give us) X' \\302\\267 (u 1 + u 2) = 0) on the ellipse,) X' . (Ul - u 2) = 0) on the hyperbola.) Let T = X'/ II X' II be a unit vector having the same direction as X'.

If ()1and ()2 denote, respectively, the angles that T makes with U 1 and U2 , where 0 < ()1< 1T and 0 < ()2 < 1T, these last two equations show that) cos ()2 = -cos 01) on the ellipse,) cos O2 = COS 0 1) on the hyperbola.) Hence we have ()2 = 1T - ()1on the ellipse, and ()2 = ()1 on the hyperbola. These relations betweenthe angles 0 1 and ()2give the reflectionproperties of the ellipse and hyperbola.) 14.6 Applications to curvilinear motion. Velocity, speed, and acceleration Supposea particle moves in 2-space or in 3-space in such a way that its position at time t relative to some coordinate system is given by a vector X(t). As t varies through a time interval, the path traced out by the particle is simply the graph of X. Thus, the vector- valued function X serves as a natural mathematical model to describe the motion. We call))) Applications to curvilinear motion. Velocity, speed, and acceleration 521) X the position function of the motion. Physical concepts such as velocity, speed, and acceleration can be defined in terms of derivatives of the position function. In the following discussion we assume that the position function may be differentiated as often as is necessary without saying so each time.) DEFINITION. Consider a motion described by a vector-valued function X. The derivative X'(t) is called the velocity vector at time t. The length 01 the velocity vector, \\\"X'(t)\\\", is called the speed. The second derivative of the position vector, X\\\"(t), is called the acceleration vector.) Notation. Sometimes the position function X is denoted by r, the velocity vector by v, the speed by v, and the acceleration by a. Thus, v = r', v = \\\"v II, and a = v' = r\\\".) If the velocity vector X'(t) is visualizedas a geometric vector attached to the curve at X(t), we see that it lies along the tangent line. The use of the word \\\"speed\\\" for the length of the velocity vector will be justified in Section 14.12 where it is shown that the speed is the rate of change of arc length along the curve. This is what the speedometer of an auto- mobile tries to measure. Thus, the length of the velocity vector tells us how fast the par- ticle is moving at every instant, and its direction tells us which way it is going. The velocity will change if we alter either the speedor the direction of the motion (or both). The acceleration vector is a measure of this change. Acceleration causes the effect one feels when an automobile changes its speed or its direction. Unlike the velocity vector, the acceleration vector does not necessarily lie along the tangent line.) EXAMPLE 1. Linear motion. Consider a motion whose position vector is given by) r(t) = P + f(t)A ,) where P and A are fixed vectors, A \\302\\245:-O. This motion takes place along a line through P parallel to A. The velocity,speed,and acceleration are given by) vet) = 1'(t)A ,) vet) = liv(t) II = 1/'(t)II!A Ii,) a(t) = 1\\\"(t)A .) I f I' (t) and I\\\"(t) are nonzero, the acceleration vector is parallel to the velocity.) EXAMPLE 2. Circular motion. If a point (x,y) in V 2 is represented by its polar coordinates rand (), we have) x = r cos () ,) y = r sin () .) If r is fixed, say r = a, and if () is allowed to vary over any interval of length at least 21T, the corresponding point (x, y) traces out a circle of radius a and center at the origin. If we make () a function of time t, say () = J(t), we have a motion given by the position function) r(t) = a cos J(t); + a sinf(t)j .) The corresponding velocity vector is given by) vet) = r'(t) = -af'(t) sinJ(t); + af'(t)cosf(t)j,))) 522) Calculus of vector-valued functions) from which we find that the speed at time t is) vet) = \\\"v(t)\\\" = a If'(t)1 .) The factor If'(t)1 = Id()/dt I is called the angular speed of the particle. An important special case occurs when () = wt, where w (omega) is a positive constant. In this case, the particle starts at the point (a, 0) at time t = 0 and moves counter-clockwise around the circle with constant angular speed w. The formulas for the position, velocity, and speed become) r(t) = a coswt ; + a sin wt j ,) vet) = -wa sin wt; + wa cos wtj,) vet) = au) .) The acceleration vector is given by) aCt) = -w 2a cos wt; - w 2 a sin wtj = -w 2r(t),) which shows that the acceleration is always directedopposite to the position vector. When it is visualized as a geometric vector drawn at the location of the particle, the acceleration vector is directed toward the center of the circle. Because of this, the acceleration is called centripetal or \\\"center-seeking,\\\" a term originally proposed by Newton.) Note: If a moving particle has mass n1, Newton's second law of motion states that the force acting on it (due to its acceleration) is the vector ma(t), mass times acceleration. If the particle moveson a circlewith constant angular speed, this is called a centripetal force because it is directed toward the center. This force is exerted by the nlechanism that confines the particle to a circular orbit. The mechanism is a string in the case of a stone whirling in a slingshot, or gravitational attraction in the case of a satellite around the earth. The equal and opposite reaction (due to Newton's third law), that is, the force -ma(t), is said to be centrifugal or \\\"center-fleeing.\\ EXAMPLE 3. Motion on an ellipse. Figure 14.5shows an ellipse with Cartesian equation x 2 fa 2 + y2fb 2 = I, and two concentric circles with radii a and b. The angle () shown in the figure is called the eccentric angle. It is related to the coordinates (x, y) of a point on the ellipse by the equations) x = a cos () ,) y = b sin () .) As () varies over an interval of length 21T, the corresponding point (x, y) traces out the ellipse. If we make () a function of time t, say () = J(t), we have a motion given by the position function) r(t) = a cos J(t); + b sinJ(t)j.) If () = wt, where w is a positive constant, the velocity, speed, and acceleration are given by) vet) = w( -a sin wt ; + b cos wt j) ,) vet) = w(a 2 sin 2 wt + b 2 cos 2 0)t)1/2 ,) aCt) = -w 2 (a cos wI; + b sin wtj) = -w 2r(t).)))

Thus, when a particle moves on an ellipsein such a way that its eccentric angle changes at a constant rate, the acceleration is centripetal.) EXAMPLE 4. Motion on a helix. If a point (x, y, z) revolves around the z-axis at a constant distance a from it and simultaneously moves parallel to the z-axis in such a way that its z-component is proportional to the angle of revolution, the resulting path is called a circular helix. An example is shown in Figure 14.6. If () denotes the angle of revolution, we have) (14.7)) x = a cose ,) y = a sin () ,) z = be ,) where a > 0, and b \\302\\245:-O. When () varies from 0 to 21T, the x- and .y-coordinates return to their original values while z changes from 0 to 21Tb. The number 21Th is often referred to as the pitch of the helix. Now suppose that () = wt, where w is constant. The motion on the helix is then de- scribed by the position vector) r(t) = a cos wt i + a sin evlj + bwtk .) The corresponding velocity and acceleration vectors are given by) vet) = -wa sin wI i + wa cos wI j + bwk,) aCt) = -w 2 (a cos wI i + a sin wtj).) Thus, when the acceleration vector is located on the helix, it is parallel to the xy-plane and directed toward the z-axis.

A point (x, y, z) satisfies the equation if and only if its distance from the z-axis is equal to a. The set of aU such points is a right circular cylinder of radius a with its axis along the z-axis.

Prove that the tangent line at a point X of a parabola bisects the angle between the line joining X to the focus and the line through X parallel to the axis.

A particle moves along the parabola x 2 + c(y - x) = 0 in such a way that the horizontal and vertical components of the acceleration vector are equal. If it takes T units of time to go from the point (c,O) to the point (0, 0), how much time will it require to go from (c,O) to the halfway point (cf2, cf4)? 17. Supposea curve C is described by two equivalent functions X and Y, where Y(f) = X[u(t)]. Prove that at each point of C the velocity vectors associated with X and Yare parallel, but that the corresponding acceleration vectors need not be parallel.) 14.8 The unit tangent, the principal normal, and the osculating plane of a curve For linear motion the accelerationvector is parallel to the velocity vector. For circular motion with constant angular speed, the accelerationvector is perpendicular to the velocity. In this section we show that for a general motion the acceleration vector is a sum of two perpendicular vectors, one parallel to the velocity and one perpendicular to the velocity. If the motion is not linear, these two perpendicular vectors determine a plane through each point of the curve called the osculating plane. To study these concepts, we introduce the unit tangent vector T. This is another vector- valued function associated with the curve, and it is defined by the equation) Jr )('(t) (t) = IIX'(t)11) whenever the speed II X'(t) II \\302\\245:-O. Note that II T(t) II = 1 for all t.))) 526) Calculus of vector-valued functions) Figure 14.8 shows the position of the unit tangent geometric vector T(t) for various values of t when it is attached to the curve. As the particle moves along the curve, the corresponding vector T, being of constant length, can change only in its direction. The tendency of T to change its direction is measured by its derivative T'. Since T has constant length, Theorem 14.2 tells us that T is perpendicular to its derivative T' .) z) z) T \\037) T) T) T) N) y) y) x) x) FIGURE 14.8 The unit tangent vector T.) FIGURE 14.9 The osculating plane.) If the motion is linear, then T' = O. If T' \\302\\245:-0, the unit vector having the same direction as T' is called the principal normal to the curve and it is denoted by N. Thus, N is a new vector-valued function associated with the curve and it is defined by the equation) N t _ T'(t) ( ) - II T'(t)11 ') whenever II T' (t) II \\302\\245:-0 .) When the two unit geometric vectors T(t) and N(t) are attached to the curve at the point X(t), they determine a plane known as the osculating plane of the curve. If we choose three values of t, say t 1 , t 2 , and t 3 , and consider the plane determined by the three points X(t 1), X(t 2 ), X(t 3), it can be shown that the position of the plane approaches the position of the osculating plane at X(t 1) as 12 and t 3 approach t 1 . Because of this, the osculating plane is often called the plane that best fits the curve at each of its points. If the curve itself is a plane curve (not a straight line), the osculating plane coincideswith the plane of the curve. In general, however, the osculating plane changes with t. Examples are illustrated in Figure 14.9. The next theorem shows that the acceleration vector is a sum of two vectors, one parallel to T and one parallel to T'.))) The unit tangent, the principal normal, and the osculating plane of a curve 527) THEOREM 14.9. For a motion described b\\037va vector-valued function r, let vet) denote the speed at time t, vet) = Ilr'(t) II.

If T'(t) \\302\\245:-0, we also have) (14.9)) aCt) = v'(t)T(t) + -vet) II T'(t) II N(t) .) Proof The formula defining the unit tangent gives us) v( t) = v( t) T(t) .) Differentiating this product, we find that) a( t) = v'(t) T( t) + v( t) T' (t) ,) which proves (14.8). To prove (14.9), we use the definition of N to write T'(t) = II T'(t) II N(t).) This theorem shows that the acceleration vector always lies in the osculating plane. An example is shown in Figure 14.10. The coefficients of T(t) and N( t) in (14.9) are called, respectively, the tangential and normal components of the acceleration. A change in speed contributes to the tangential component, whereas a change in direction contributes to the normal component. For a plane curve, the length of T'(t) has an interesting geometricinterpretation. Since T is a unit vector, we may write) z) T(t) = cos aCt); + sin a(t)j, y) a'(t) < 0 u(t) = - N(t)) a'(t) > 0 u(t) = N(t)) T(t) \\037 a(t) decreasing) T(t) = cosa(t)i + sin a(t)j) Osculating Plane) \\037 a(t) increasing) y) x) x) FIGURE 14.10 The acceleration vector lies in the osculating plane) FIGURE 14.11 The angle of inclination of the tangent vector of a plane curve.))) 528) Calculus of vector-valued functions) where aCt) denotes the angle between the tangent vector and the positive x-axis, as shown in Figure 14.11. Differentiating, we find that) T'(t) = -sin aCt)a/(t); + cos aCt) a/(t)j = a/(t)u(t),) where u(t) is a unit vector. Therefore II T'(t) II = la'(t)1 and this shows that II T'(t) II is a measure of the rate of change of the angle of inclination of the tangent vector. When a'(t) > 0, the angle is increasing, and hence u(t) = N(t). When a/(t) < 0, the angle is decreasingand, in this case, u(t) = - N(t). The two cases are illustrated in Figure 14.11.

Before we can study the properties of the length of a curve we must agree on a definition of arc length. The purpose of this section is to formulate sllch a definition. This will lead, in a natural way, to the construction of a function (called the arc-length function) which measures the length of the path traced out by a moving particle at every instant of its motion. Some of the basic properties of this function are discussed in Section 14.12. In particular, we shall prove that for most curves that arise in practice this function may be expressed as the integral of the speed. To arrive at a definition of what we mean by the length of a curve, we proceedas though we had to measure this length with a straight yardstick. First, we mark off a number of points on the curve which we use as vertices of an inscribed polygon. (An example is shown in Figure 14.12.) Then, we measure the total length of this polygon with our yard- stick and consider this as an approximation to the length of the curve. We soon observe that some polygons \\\"fit\\\" the curve better than others. I n particular, if we start with a polygon PI , and construct a new inscribed polygon P 2 by adding more verticesto those of PI , it is clear that the length of P 2 will be larger than that of PI , as suggested in Figure 14.13. In the same way we can form more and more polygons with successively larger and larger lengths. On the other hand, our intuition tells us that the length of any inscribed polygon should not exceed that of the curve (sincea straight line is the shortest path between two points).))) 530) Calculus of vector-valuedfunctions) In other words, when we arrive at a definition for the length of a curve, it should be a number which is an upper bound to the lengths of all inscribed polygons. Therefore, it certainly seems reasonable to define the length of the curve to be the least upper bound of the lengths of all possibleinscribedpolygons. For most curves that arise in practice, this definition gives us a useful and reasonable way to assign a length to a curve. Surprisingly enough, however, there are certain patho- logical cases where this definition is not applicable. There are curves for which there is no upper bound to the lengths of the inscribed polygons. (An example is given in Exercise) c) A) FIGURE 14.12 A curve with an In- scribed polygon.) FIGURE 14.13 The polygon ABC has a length greater than the polygon AC.) 22 in Section 14.13.) Therefore it becomes necessary to classify all curves into two cate- gories: those which have a length, and those which do not. The former are calledrectifiable curves, the latter, nonrectifiable. To formulate these ideasin analytic terms, we begin with a curve in 3-space or in 2-space described by a vector-valued function r, and we consider the portion of the curve traced out by r(t) as t varies over an interval [a, b]. At the outset, we only assume that r is contin- uous on the parametric interval. Later we shall add further restrictions. Consider now any partition P of the interval [a, b], say) P = {to, tl , . . . , t n } ,) where a = to < t l < \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 < t n = b .) Denote by 1T(P) the polygon whosevertices are the points r(t o), r(tI), . . . , r(t n ), respectively. (An example with n = 6 is shown in Figure 14.14.) The sides of this polygon have lengths) IIr(tI) - r(to ) II, IIr(t 2) - r(t I) II, . \\302\\267\\302\\267, IIr(t n) - r(t n - I) II \\302\\267) Therefore, the length of the polygon 1T(P),which we denote by j1T(P)I, is the sum) n I 1T(P) I = I Ilr(t k) - r(t k - I ) II . k=l) DEFINITION. If there exists a positive number M such that) (14.10) I1T(P) I < M))) The definition of arc length) 531) for all partitions P of [a, b], then the curve is said to be rectifiableand its arc length, denoted by A(a, b), is defined to be the least upper bound of the set of all numbers 17T(P)I. If there is no such M, the curve is called nonrectifiable.) Note that if an M exists satisfying (14.10), then, for every partition P, we have) (14.11)) 17T(P)1 < A(a, b) < M ,) since the least upper bound cannot exceed any upper bound.) z) r( 16)) r( 14)) r(1 3)) a) b) .) . .) . 13) . 14) . 15) . 16) y) 10 II 12) x) FIGURE 14.14 A partition of [a, b] into six subintervals and the corresponding inscribed polygon.) It is easy to prove that a curve is rectifiable whenever its velocity vector v is continuous on the parametric interval [a, b]. In fact, the following theorem tells us that in this case we may use the integral of the speed as an upper bound for all numbers 17T(P)I.) THEOREM 14.10. Denote by ,,(t) the velocity vector of the curve \\037,ith position vector r(t) and let v(t) = Ilv(t)11 denote the speed. Ifv is continuous on [a, b], the curve is rectifiable and its length A( a, b) satisfiesthe inequality) (14.12)) A(a, b) < I: v(t) dt \\302\\267) Proof For each partition P of [a, b], we have) /7T(P)/ = kt11r(tk) - r(tk - 1) II = Jl t\\037l r'(t) dt = kt i:\\037l v(t) dt < kt It:\\037lIlV(t)1I dt = {b v(t) dt,))) 532) Calculus of vector-valued functions) the inequality being a consequence of Theorem 14.8. This shows that we have) I 7T(P) I < f: v(t) dt) for all partitions P, and hence the number S\\037vet) dt is an upper bound for the set of all numbers 17T(P)I.This proves that the curve is rectifiable and, at the same time, it tells us that the length A(a, b) cannot exceedthe integral of the speed.) In a later section we shall prove that the inequality in (14.12) is, in fact, an equality. The proof of this fact will make use of the additivity of arc length, a property describedin the next section.) 14.11 Additivity of arc length If a rectifiablecurve is cut into two pieces, the length of the whole curve is the sum of the lengths of the two parts. This is another of those \\\"intuitively obvious\\\" statements whose proof is not trivial. This property is called additivity of arc length and it may be expressed analytically as follows.) THEOREM 14.11. Consider a rectifiable curve of length A(a, b) traced out by a vector r(t) as t varies over an interval [a, b]. If a < c < b, let C I and C 2 be the curves traced out by r(t) as t varies over the intervals [a, c] and [c, b], respectively. Then C I and C 2 are also rectifiable and, if A(a, c) and A(c, b) denote their respective lengths, \\0371'ehave) A(a, b) = A(a, c) + A(c, b) .) Proof Let PI and P 2 be arbitrary partitions of [a, c] and [c, b], respectively. The points in PI taken together with those in P 2 give us a new partition P of [a, b] for which we have) (14.13)) 17T(PI)I + 17T(P 2 ) I = 17T(P)/ < A(a, b) .) This shows that 17T(PI)I and 17T(P 2) I are bounded by A(a, b), and hence CI and C 2 are rectifia ble. From (14.13),we also have) /7T(P I )/ < A(a, b) - 17T(P 2) I .) Now, keep P 2 fixed and let PI vary over all possible partitions of [a, c]. Sincethe number A(a, b) - 17T(P 2 )/ is an upper bound for all numbers 17T(PI)I, it cannot be less than their least upper bound, which is A(a, c). Hence, we have A(a, c) < A(a, b) - 17T(P 2 ) I or, what is the same thing,) 17T(P 2) I < A(a, b) - A(a, c) .) This shows that A(a, b) - A(a, c) is an upper bound for all the sums /7T(P 2 )1, and since it cannot be less than their least upper bound, A(c, b), we have A(c, b) < A(a, b) - A(a, c). In other words, we have) (14.14)) A(a, c) + A(c, b) < A(a, b) .))) The arc-length function) 533) Next we prove the reverse inequality. We begin with any partition P of [a, b]. If we adjoin the point c to P, we obtain a partition PI of [a, c] and a partition P2 of [c, b] such that) 17T(P)1 < 17T(P 1) I + 17T(P 2 ) I < A(a, c) + A(c, b) .) This shows that A(a, c) + A(c, b) is an upper bound for all numbers 17T(P)I.Since this cannot be less than the least upper bound, we must have) A(a, b) < A(a, c) + A(c, b) .) This inequality, along with (14.14), implies the additive property.) 14.12 The arc-length function Suppose a curve is the path traced out by a position vectorr(t). A natural question to ask is this: How far has the particle moved along the curve at time t? To discuss this question, we introduce the arc-length function s, defined as follows:) set) = A(a, t)) if t > a,) s( a) = 0 .) The statement sea) = 0 simply means we are assuming the motion begins when t = a. The theorem on additivity enables us to derive some important properties of s. For example, we have the following.) THEOREM 14.12. For any rectifiable curve, the arc-length function s is monotonically increasing on [a, b]. That is, \\037re have) (14.15)) s(t 1) < s(t2)) if a < t 1 < t 2 < b .) Proof If a < t 1 < t 2 < b, we have) s(t 2) - s(t1) = A(a, t 2) - A(a, t 1) = A(t 1, (2 ) ,) where the last equality comes from additivity. Since A(t 1 , t 2 ) > 0, this proves (14.15).) Next we shall prove that the function s has a derivative at each interior point of the parametric interval and that this derivative is equal to the speed of the particle.) THEOREM 14.13. Let s denote the arc-length function associated H:ith a curve and let vet) denote the speed at time t. If v is continuous on [a, b], then the derivative S'(t) exists for each t in (a, b) and is given by the formula) (14.16)) S'(t) = v(t).) Proof Define J(t) = S\\037v(u) duo We know that f'(t) = vet) because of the first funda- mental theorem of calculus. We shall prove that S'(t) = vet). For this purpose we form the))) 534) Calculus of vector-valued functions) difference quotient) ( 14.1 7)) r(t + h) - r(t) h) Suppose first that h > O. The line segment joining the points r(t) and r(t + h) may be thought of as a polygon approximating the arc joining these two points. Therefore, because of (14.11), we have) Ilr(t + h) - r(t) II < A(t, t + h) = set + h) - set) .) Using this in (14.17) along with the inequality (14.12) of Theorem 14.10we have) r(t + h) - r(t) h) < set + h) - set) < ! f f+hV ( U ) du = J(t + h) - J(t ) .- h -ht h) A similar argument shows that these inequalities are also valid for h < O. If we let h -+ 0, the difference quotient on the extreme left approaches Ilr'(t) II = vet) and that on the extreme right approaches f'(t) = vet). It follows that the quotient [set + h) - s(t)]fh also approaches vet). But this means that S'(t) exists and equals vet), as asserted.) Theorem 14.13conforms with our intuitive notion of speed as the distance per unit time being covered during the motion. Using (14.16) along with the second fundamental theorem of calculus, we can compute arc length by integrating the speed. Thus, the distance traveled by a particle during a time interval [t 1 , 12] is) f t2 f t2 s(t 2) - s(t1) = s'(t) dt = vet) dt . tl tl) In particular, when t 1 = a and t 2 = b, we obtain the following integral for arc length:) A( a, b) = I: v( t) d t .) EXAMPLE 1. Length of a circular arc. To compute the length of an arc of a circle of radius a, we may imagine a particle moving along the circle according to the equation r(t) = a cost i + a sin t j. The velocity vector is vet) = - a sin t i + a cos t j and the speed is vet) = a. Integrating the speed over an interval of length (), we find that the length of arc traced out is a(). In other words,the length of a circular arc is proportional to the angle it subtends; the constant of proportionality is the radius of the circle. For a unit circle we have a = 1, and the arc length is exactly equal to the angular measure.) EXAMPLE 2. Length of the graph of a real-valued function.

If the curve is not a straight line, the derivative T' measures the tendency of the tangent to change its direction. The rate of change of the unit tangent with respect to arc))) Curvature of a curve) 537) length is called the curvature vector of the curve. We denote this by dTlds, where s repre- sents arc length. The chain rule, used in conjunction with the relation S'(t) = vet), tells us that the curvature vectordTldsis related to the \\\"time\\\" derivative T ' by the equation) dT = dt dT = --LT'( t ) = --L T' (t ) ds ds dt S'(t) v(t)' SinceT'(t)= II T'(t) II N(t), we obtain) (14.19)) dT = II T(t)11 N(t) , d s v(t)) which shows that the curvature vector has the same direction as the principal normal N(t). The scalar factor which multiplies N(t) in (14.19) is a nonnegative number called the curvature of the curve at t and it is denoted by K(t) (K is the Greek letter kappa). Thus the curvature K(t), defined to be the length of the curvature vector, is given by the following formula:) ( 14.20)) K(t) = II T(t)11 . vet)) EXAMPLE 1. Curvature of a circle.For a circleof radius a, given by r(t) = a cos t i + a sin tj, we have vet) = -a sin t i + a cos tj, vet) = a, T(t) = -sin t i + cos tj, and T'(t) = -cos t i-sin t j. Hence we have II T'(t) II = 1 so K(t) = lla. This shows that a circle has constant curvature. The reciprocal of the curvature is the radius of the circle.) When K(t) \\302\\245=0, its reciprocal is called the radius of curvature and is denoted by pet) (p is the Greek letter rho). That circle in the osculating plane with radius pet) and center at the tip of the curvature vector is called the osculating circle. It can be shown that the osculating circle is the limiting position of circles passing through three nearby points on the curve as two of the points approach the third. Because of this property, the osculating circle is often called the circle that \\\"best fits the curve\\\" at each of its points.) EXAMPLE 2. Curvature of a plane curve. For a plane curve, we have seen that II T'(t) II = 1\\037/(t)l, where \\037(t) is the angle the tangent vector makes with the positive x-axis, as shown in Figure 14.11. From the chain rule, we have \\037/(t) = d\\037/dt = (d\\037/ds)(dsldt) = v(t)d\\037/ds, so Equation (14.20) implies) d\\037 K(t) = - . ds) In other words, the curvature of a plane curve is the absolute value of the rate of change of \\037with respect to arc length. It measures the change of direction per unit distance along the curve.) EXAMPLE 3. Plane curves of constant curvature. If d\\037/ds is a nonzero constant, say d\\037/ds = a, then \\037= as + b, where b is a constant. Hence,if we use the arc length s as))) 538) Calculus of vector-valued functions) a parameter, we have T = cos(as + b)i + sin (as + b)j. Integrating, we find that r = (11a) sin (as + b)i - (11a) cos (as + b)j + A, where A is a constant vector. Therefore Ilr - AI/ = l/lal, so the curve is a circle(or an arc of a circle) with center at A and radius l/lal. This proves that a plane curve of constant curvature K \\302\\245=0 is a circle (or an arc of a circle) with radius 1/K.) Now we prove a theorem which relates the curvature to the velocity and acceleration.) THEOREM 14.14. For any motion with velocity vet), speed vet), acceleration a(t), and curvature K( t), we have) (14.21)) aCt) = v'(t)T(t) + K(t)v 2 (t)N(t) .) This formula, in turn, implies) (14.22)) K(t) = Ila(t) X v(t)1 1 . v3 (t)) Proof To prove (14.21), we rewrite (14.20) in the form II T'(t) II = K(t)V(t), which gives us T'(t) = K(t)v(t)N(t). Substituting this expression for T'(t) in Equation (14.8), we obtain (14.21). To prove (14.22), we form the cross product aCt) x vet), using (14.21) for aCt) and the formula vet) = v(t)T(t) for the velocity. This gives us) ( 14.23)) a X v = v'vT X T + Kv 3 N X T = Kv 3 N X T) since T X T = O. If we take the length of each member of (14.23) and note that) IIN X TII = IINII II TII sin i7T = 1 ,) we obtain Iia X v II = KV 3 , which proves (14.22).) In practice it is fairly easy to compute the vectors v and a (by differentiating the position vector r); hence Equation (14.22) provides a useful method for computing the curvature. This method is usually simpler than determining the curvature from its definition. For a straight line we have a X v = 0, so the curvature is everywherezero. A curve with a small curvature at a point has a large radius of curvature there and hence doesnot differ much from a straight line in the immediate vicinity of the point. Thus the curvature is a measure of the tendency of a curve to deviate from a straight line.) 14.15 Exercises) 1.

Since the rectangular coordinates(x,y) are related to the polar coordinatesrand () by the equations) x = r cos () ,) y = r sin () ,) r = xi + yj I I .

FIGURE 14.16 The unit vectors \\\"r and \\\"0') the position vector r = xi + yj joining the origin to (x, y) is given by) r = r cos () i + r sin ()j = r(cos () i + sin ()j) ,) where r = Ilr II. This relation is illustrated in Figure 14.15. The vector cos () i + sin ()j is a vector of unit length having the same direction as r. This unit vector is usually denoted by U r and the foregoing equation is written as follows:) r = rUr') where U r = cos () i + sin ()j .) It is convenient to introduce also a unit vector u(J , perpendicular to ur ' which is defined as follows:) d U r . () . () . U(J = - = - SIn I + cos J. d()) Note that we have) d U(J () . . () .- = -cos I - SIn ] = -U., . d()) In the study of plane curves, the two unit vectors U r and u() play the same roles in polar coordinates as the unit vectors i and j in rectangular coordinates. Figure 14.16 shows the unit vectors u r and u(J attached to a curve at some of its points.))) Velocity and acceleration in polar coordinates) 541) Now suppose the polar coordinates rand B are functions of t, say r = f(t), B = get). We shall derive formulas for expressingthe velocity and acceleration in terms of U r and u(J' For the position vector, we have) r = rUr = t(t)U r .) Since B depends on the parameter t, the same is true of the unit vector u r and we must take this into account when we compute the velocity vector. Thus we have) dr d(ru r ) dr dUr v = ...- = = - U r + r - . dt dt dt dt) Using the chain rule, we may express dur/dt in terms of u(J by writing) (14.24)) dUr dB dU r dB- = - - = - Uo , dt dt dO dt) and the equation for the velocity vector becomes) (14.25)) dr dO v=-u +r-u) dt r dt (J) The scalar factors dr/dt and rdB/dt multiplying U r and u(J are called, respectively, the radial and transverse components of velocity. Since U r and u(J are orthogonal unit vectors, we find that) ( dr \\\\2 ( dB ) ' 2 v . V = dt J + r dt ') so the speed v is given by the formula) J (dr ) 2 ( dB ) 2 v= - + r- . dt dt) Differentiating both sides of (14.25),we find that the acceleration vector is given by) a = ( d 2 r Ur + dr dUr) + ( r d2e Ue + dr de Ue + r de due ) . dt 2 dt dt dt 2 dt dt dt dt) The derivative dur/dt may be expressed in terms of u(J by (14.24). We may similarly express the derivative of u(J by the eq uation) dU(J dB dU(J dB----- -u dt - dt dO - - dt r'))) 542) Calculus of vector-valued functions) This leads to the following formula which expresses a in terms of its radial and transverse components:) (14.26)) ( d 2 r ( dO ) 2 ) ( d20 dr dO ) a = - - r - U r + r - + 2- - U(). dt 2 dt dt 2 dt dt) When () = t, the curve may be described by the polar equation r = J(O). In this case, the formulas for velocity, speed, and acceleration simplify considerably, and we obtain) dr v = - U r + ru(), dO) v= J (:; )2+ r 2 ,) ( d 2 r ) dr a = d0 2 - r U r + 2 dO U() \\302\\267) 14.17 Plane motion with radial acceleration) The acceleration vector is said to be radial if the transverse component in Equation (14.26) is always zero. This component is equal to) r d 2 () + 2 dr d() = 1 !!.. ( r2 dO ) . d t2 d t d t r d t d t) Therefore, the acceleration is radial if and only if r 2 dO/dt is constant. Plane motion with radial acceleration has an interesting geometric interpretation in terms of area. Denote by A(t) the area of the region swept out by the position vector from a fixed time, say t = a, to a later time t. An example is the shaded region shown in Figure 14.17. We shall prove that the time rate of change of this area is exactly equal to ir 2 dO/dt. That is, we have) (14.27)) A'(t) = \\037 r 2 \\037\\037 .) From this it follows that the acceleration vector is radial if and only if the position vector sweeps out area at a constant rate. To prove (14.27),we assume that it is possible to eliminate t from the two equations r = J(t), 0 = get), and thereby express r as a function of 0, say r = R(O). This means that there is a real-valuedfunction R such that R[g(t)] = J(t). Then the shaded region in Figure 14.17 is the radial set of R over the interval [g(a), get)]. By Theorem 2.6, the area of this region is given by the integral) f y(t) A(t) = i R2(O) dO . g(a)) Differentiating this integral by the first fundamental theorem of calculus and the chain rule, we find that) A'(t) = ! R2[g(t)]g'(t) = ! F(t)g'(t) = ! r 2 dB 2 2 2 dt') which proves (14.27).)))

There were six known planets at that time and, according to the Copernican theory, their orbits were thought to lie on concentric spherical shells about the sun. Kepler attempted to show that the radii of these shells were linked up with the five regular solids of geometry. He proposed an ingenious idea that the solar system was designed something like a Chinese puzzle. At the center of the system he placed the sun. Then, in succession, he arranged the six concentric spheres that can be inscribed and circumscribed around the five regular solids-the octahedron, icosahedron,dodecahedron, tetrahedron, and cube, in respective order (from inside out). The innermost sphere, inscribed in the regular octahedron, corresponded to Mercury's path. The next sphere, which circumscribed the octahedron and inscribed the icosahedron, corresponded to the orbit of Venus. Earth's orbit lay on the sphere around the icosahedron and inside the dodecahedron, and so on, the outermost sphere, containing Jupiter's orbit, being circumscribed around the cube. Although this theory seemed correct to within five percent, astronomical observations at that time were accurate to a percentageerror much smaller than this, and Kepler finally realized that he had to modify this theory. After much further study it occurred to him that the observed data concerning the orbits corresponded more to elliptical paths than the circular paths of the Copernican system. After several more years of unceasing effort, Kepler set forth three famous laws, empiri- cally discovered, which explained all the astronomical phenomena known at that time. They may be stated as follows:) Kepler's first la\\037v: Planets move in ellipses with the sun at one focus. Kepler'ssecondla\\037v: The position vector from the sun to a planet sweeps out area at a constant rate.))) 546) Calculus of vector-valuedfunctions) Kepler's third la'tv: The square of the period of a planet is proportional to the cube of its mean distance from the sun.) Note: By the period of a planet is meant the time required to go once around the elliptical orbit. The mean distance fronl the sun is one half the length of the major axis of the ellipse. The formulation of these laws from a study of astronomical tables was a remarkable achievement. Nearly 50 years later, Newton proved that all three of Kepler's laws are consequences of his own second law of motion and his celebrateduniversal law of gravi- tation. In this section we shall use vector methods to show how Kepler's laws may be deducedfrom Newton's.) Orbit) Sun) FIGURE 14.19 The position vector from the sun to a planet.) Assume we have a fixed sun of mass M and a moving planet of mass nl attracted to the sun by a force F. (We neglectthe influence of all other forces.) Newton's secondlaw of motion states that) ( 14.28)) F = ma ,) where a is the acceleration vector of the moving planet. Denote by r the position vector from the sun to the planet (as in Figure 14.19), let r = \\\\Ir 1\\\\, and let Ur be a unit vector with the same direction as r, so that r = ru r . The universal law of gravitation states that) mM F = - G \\037 Ur , r) where G is a constant. Combining this with (14.28), we obtain) (14.29)) GM a = - 2 U r , r) which tells us that the acceleration is radial. In a moment we shall prove that the orbit lies in a plane. Once we know this, it follows at once from the results of Section 14.17 that the position vector sweeps out area at a constant rate.))) Applications to planetary motion) 547) To prove that the path lies in a plane we use the fact that r and a are parallel. If we introduce the velocity vector v = drfdt, we have) dv dv dr d r x a = r X - + v X v = r X - + - X v = - (r X v) . dt dt dt dt) Since r X a = 0, this means that r X v is a constant vector, say r X v = e. If e = 0, the position vector r is parallel to v and the motion is along a straight line. Since the path of a planet is not a straight line, we must have e \\037 O. The relation r x v = e shows that r . C = 0, so the position vector lies in a plane perpendicular to e. Since the acceleration is radial, r sweeps out area at a constant rate. This proves Kepler's second law. I t is easy to prove that this constant rate is exactly half the length of the vector e. In fact, if we use polar coordinates and express the velocity in terms of Ur and u(J as in Equation (14.25), we find that) (14.30)) ( dr dB ) \\\" dO e = r X v = (ru r) X dt U r + r dt U(J = r- dt U r x U(J ,) and hence lie II = Ir 2 dBfdtl. By (14.27) this is equal to 2IA'(t)l, where A'(t) is the rate at which the radius vector sweeps out area. Kepler's secondlaw is illustrated in Figure 14.20. The two shaded regions, which are swept out by the position vector in equal time intervals, have equal areas. We shall prove next that the path is an ellipse. First of all, we form the cross product a X e, using (14.29) and (14.30), and we find that) ( GM ) ( 2 dB ) dB dB a X e = - \\037 U r X r dt U r X U(J = -GM dt U r X (u r X u(J) = GM de U().) Since a = dvfdt and u(J = durfdB, the foregoing equation for a X e can also be written as follows:) d d dt (v X e) = dt (GMu r ) .) Integration gives us) v X e = GMu r + h ,) where h is another constant vector. We can rewrite this as follows:) (14.31)) v X e = GM(u r + e) ,) where GMe = h. We shall combine this with (14.30) to eliminate v and obtain an equation for r. For this purpose we dot multiply both sides of (14.30)by c and both sides of (14.31) by r. Equating the two expressions for the scalar triple product r \\302\\267v X e, we are led to the equation) ( 14.32)) GMr(1 + e cos1\\302\\273 = c 2 ,) where e = IIell, c = IIell, and 1> represents the angle between the constant vector e and the))) 548) Calculus of vector-valued functions) radius vector r. (See Figure 14.21.) If we let d = c2 f(GMe), Equation (14.32) becomes) ed e cos 1> + 1) or) r = e( d - r cos1\\302\\273.)(14.33)) By Theorem 13.18, this is the polar equation of a conic section with eccentricity e and a focus at the sun.

Since planets are known to move on closed paths, the orbit under consideration must be an ellipse. This proves Kepler's first law. Finally, we deduce Kepler's third law. Suppose the ellipse has major axis of length 2a and minor axis of length 2b. Then the area of the ellipseis 7Tab. Let T be the time it takes for the planet to go once around the ellipse. Since the position vector sweeps out area at the rate ic, we have icT = 7Tab, or T = 27Tab/c. We wish to prove that T2 is proportional to a3 . From Section 13.22 we have b 2 = a 2 (1 - e 2 ), ed = a(l - e 2), so) c 2 = GMed = GMa(1- e 2 ),) and hence we have) T 2 = 47T 2 a 2b 2 = 47T 2 a 4(1 - e 2 ) = 47T 2 a 3 c 2 GMa(l - e 2 ) GM .) Since T2 is a constant times a3 , this proves Kepler's third law.))) Miscellaneous review exercises) 549) 14.21 Miscellaneousreview exercises) 1.

First of all, the real numbers themselves are such objects. Other examplesare real-valued functions, the complex numbers, infinite series, vectors in n-space, and vector-valued functions. In this chapter we discuss a general mathematical concept, called a linear space, which includes all these examples and many others as special cases. Briefly, a linear space is a set of elements of any kind on which certain operations (called addition and multiplication by numbers) can be performed. I In defining a linear space, we do not specify the nature of the elements nor do we tell how the operations are to be per- formed on them. Instead, we require that the operations have certain properties which we take as axioms for a linear space. We turn now to a detailed descriptionof these axioms.) 15.2 The definition of a linear space) Let V denote a nonempty set of objects, called elements. The set V is called a linear space if it satisfies the following ten axioms which we list in three groups.) Closureaxioms) AXIOM 1. CLOSURE UNDER ADDITION. For every pair of elementsx and y in V there corresponds a unique element in V called the sum of x and y, denoted by x + y.) AXIOM 2. CLOSURE UNDER MULTIPLICATION BY REAL NUMBERS. For every x in V and every real number a there corresponds an element in V called the product of a and x, denoted by ax.) Axioms for addition) AXIOM 3. COMMUTATIVE LAW. For all x and y in V, }ve have x + y = y + x.) AXIOM 4. ASSOCIATIVELAW. For all x,y, and z in V, we have (x + y) + z = x + (y + z). 551))) 552) Linear spaces) AXIOM 5. EXISTENCE OF ZERO ELEMENT. There is an element in V, denoted by 0, such that) x+O=x) for all x in V .) AXIOM 6. EXISTENCE OF NEGATIVES. For ever.y x in V, the element (-I)x has the property) x + (-I)x = 0 .) Axioms for multiplication by numbers) AXIOM 7. ASSOCIATIVE LAW. For every x in V and all real numbers a and b, }-ve have) a(bx) = (ab)x.) AXIOM 8. DISTRIBUTIVE LAW FOR ADDITION IN V. For all x and y in V and all real a, H'ehave) a(x + y) = ax + ay .) AXIOM 9. DISTRIBUTIVE LAW FOR ADDITION OF NUMBERS. For all x in V and all real a and b, }-ve have) (a + b)x = ax + bx .) AXIOM 10. EXISTENCE OF IDENTITY. For every x in V, we have Ix = x.) Linear spaces, as defined above, are sometimescalled real linear spaces to emphasize the fact that we are multiplying the elements of V by real numbers. If real number is re- placed by complex number in Axioms 2, 7, 8, and 9, the resulting structure is called a com- plex linear space. Sometimes a linear space is referred to as a linear vector space or simply a vector space; the numbers used as multipliers are also called scalars. A real linear space has real numbers as scalars;a complex linear space has complex numbers as scalars. Although we shall deal primarily with examples of real linear spaces, all the theorems are valid for complex linear spaces as well. When we use the term linear space without further designation, it is to be understood that the space can be real or complex.) 15.3 Examples of linear spaces If we specify the set V and tell how to add its elements and how to multiply them by numbers, we get a concreteexample of a linear space. The reader can easily verify that each of the following examples satisfies all the axioms for a real linear space.) EXAMPLE 1. Let V = R, the set of all real numbers, and let x + y and ax be ordinary addition and multiplication of real numbers.) EXAMPLE 2. Let V = C, the set of all complex numbers, define x + y to be ordinary addition of complex numbers, and defineax to be multiplication of the complex number x by the real number a. Even though the elements of V are complex numbers, this is a real linear space because the scalars are real.))) Examples of linear spaces) 553) EXAMPLE 3. Let V = V n , the vector space of all n-tuples of real numbers, with addition and multiplication by scalars defined in the usual way in terms of components.) EXAMPLE 4. Let V be the set of all vectors in Vn orthogonal to a given nonzero vector N. If n = 2, this linear space is a line through 0 with N as a normal vector. If n = 3, it is a plane through 0 with N as normal vector.) The following examples are called.function spaces. The elements of V are real-valued functions, with addition of two functions f and g defined in the usual way:) (I + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)) for every real x in the intersection of the domains ofI and g. Multiplication of a function f by a real scalar a is defined as follows:al is that function whose value at each x in the domain of f is af(x). The zero element is the function whose values are everywhere zero. The reader can easily verify that each of the following sets is a function space.) EXAMPLE 5. The set of all functions defined on a given interval.) EXAMPLE 6. The set of all polynomials.) EXAMPLE 7. The set of all polynomials of degree< n, where n is fixed. (Whenever we consider this set it is understood that the zero polynomial is also included.) The set of all polynomials of degreeequal to n is not a linear space because the closure axioms are not satisfied. For example, the sum of two polynomials of degreen need not have degree n.) EXAMPLE 8. The set of all functions continuous on a given interval. If the interval is [a, b], we denote this space by C( G, b).) EXAMPLE 9. The set of all functions differentiable at a given point.) EXAMPLE 10. The set of all functions integrable on a given interval.) EXAMPLE 11. The set of all functions f defined at 1 with 1(1) = O. The number 0 is essential in this example. If we replace 0 by a nonzero number c, we violate the closure aXioms.) EXAMPLE 12. The set of all solutions of a homogeneous linear differential equation y\\\" + ay' + by = 0, where a and b are given constants. Here again 0 is essential. The set of solutions of a nonhomogeneous differential equation does not satisfy the closure aXioms.) These examples and many others illustrate how the linear space concept permeates algebra, geometry, and analysis. When a theorem is deduced from the axioms of a linear space, we obtain, in one stroke, a result valid for each concrete example. By unifying diverse examples in this way we gain a deeper insight into each. Sometimes special knowl- edge of one particular example helps to anticipate or interpret results valid for other examples and reveals relationships which might otherwise escape notice.))) 554) Linear spaces) 15.4 Elementary consequencesof the axioms The following theorems are easily deduced from the axioms for a linear space.) THEOREM 15.1. UNIQUENESS OF THE ZERO ELEMENT. In any linear space there is one and only one zero element.) Proof Axiom 5 tells us that there is at least one zero element. Suppose there were two, say 0 1 and O2 , Taking x = 0 1 and 0 = O 2 in Axiom 5, we obtain 0 1 + O 2 = 0 1 . Similarly, taking x = O2 and 0 = 0 1 , we find O 2 + 0 1 = O2 , But 0 1 + O2 = O 2 + 0 1 becauseof the commutative law, so 0 1 = O2 .) THEOREM 15.2. UNIQUENESS OF NEGATIVE ELEMENTS. In any linear space every element has exactly one negative. That is,for every x there is one and only one y such that x + y = o.) Proof Axiom 6 tells us that each x has at least one negative, namely (-I)x. Suppose x has two negatives, say Yl and Y2' Then x + Yl = 0 and x + Y2 = O. Adding Y2 to both members of the first equation and using Axioms 5, 4, and 3, we find that) Y2 + (x + Yl) = Y2 + 0 = Y2 ,) and) Y2 + (x + Yl) = (Y2 + x) + Yl = 0 + Yl = Yl + 0 = Yl \\302\\267) Therefore Yl = Y2' so x has exactly one negative, the element (-I)x.) Notation. The negative of x is denoted by -x. The difference y - x is defined to be the sum y + (-x).) The next theorem describes a number of properties which govern elementary algebraic manipulations in a linear space.) THEOREM 15.3. In a given linear space, let x and Y denote arbitrary elements and let a and b denotearbitrary scalars. Then we have the follolving properties: (a) Ox = O. (b) aO = O. (c) (-a)x = -(ax)= a( -x). (d) Ifax = 0, then either a = 0 or x = O. (e) Ifax = ay and a :F- 0, then x = y. (f) Ifax = bx and x :F- 0, then a = b. (g) -(x + y) = (-x) + (-y) = -x - y. (h) x + x = 2x, x + x + x = 3x, and in general, Z\\037=1 x = nx.) We shall prove (a), (b), and (c) and leave the proofs of the other properties as exercises.))) Exercises) 555) Proof of (a). Let z = Ox. We wish to prove that z = O. Adding z to itself and using Axiom 9, we find that) z + z = Ox + Ox = (0 + O)x = Ox = 2-.) Now add -z to both members to get z = O.) Proof of (b). Let z = aO, add z to itself, and use Axiom 8.) Proof of (c). Let z = (-a)x. Adding z to ax and using Axiom 9, we find that) z + ax = (-a)x + ax = (-a + a)x = Ox = 0 ,) so z is the negative of ax, z = -(ax). Similarly, if we add a(-x) to ax and use Axiom 8 and property (b), we find that a( -x) = -(ax).) 15.5 Exercises) In Exercises 1 through 28, determine whether each of the given sets is a real linear space, if addition and multiplication by real scalars are defined in the usual way.

Prove parts (d) through (h) of Theorem 15.3.) 15.6 Subspaces of a linear space Given a linear spaceV, let S be a nonempty subset of V. If S is also a linear space, with the same operations of addition and multiplication by scalars, then S is called a subspace of V. The next theorem gives a simplecriterion for determining whether or not a subset of a linear space is a subspace.) THEOREM 15.4. Let S be a nonempty subset of a linear space V. Then S is a subspace if and only if S satisfies the closure axioms.) Proof If S is a subspace, it satisfies all the axioms for a linear space, and hence, in particular, it satisfies the closure axioms. Now we show that if S satisfies the closure axioms it satisfies the others as well. The commutative and associative laws for addition (Axioms 3 and 4) and the axioms for multiplication by scalars (Axioms 7 through 10) are automatically satisfied in S because they hold for all elementsof V. It remains to verify Axioms 5 and 6, the existence of a zero element in S, and the existence of a negative for each element in S. Let x be any element of S. (S has at least one element since S is not empty.) By Axiom 2, ax is in S for every scalar a. Taking a = 0, it follows that Ox is in S. But Ox = 0, by Theorem 15.3( a), so 0 E S, and Axiom 5 is satisfied. Taking a = -1, we see that { -1)x is in S. But x + (-I)x = 0 since both x and (-I)x are in V, so Axiom 6 is satisfied in S. Therefore S is a subspace of V.) DEFINITION. Let S be a nonempty subset of a linear space V. An element x in V of the form) k X = , c,x'k l l' i=l) where Xl , . . . , x k are all in Sand CI , . . . , C k are scalars, is called a finite linear combination of elements of S. The set of all finite linear combinations of elements of S satisfies the closure axioms and hence is a subspace of V. We call this the subspace spannedby S, or the))) Dependent and independent sets in a linear space) 557) linear span of S, and denote it by L(S). If S is empty, }1'e define L(S) to be {O},the set con- sisting of the zero element alone.) Different sets may span the same subspace. For example, the space V 2 is spanned by each of the following sets of vectors: {i, j}, {i, j, i + j}, {O,i, -i, j, - j,i + j}. The space of all polynomials pet) of degree < n is spanned by the set of n + 1 polynomials) {I, t, t 2, . . . , t n } .) It is also spanned by the set {I, t/2, t 2 /3, . . . , tn/en + I)}, and by {I, (1 + t), (1 + t)2, . . . , (1 + t)n}. The space of all polynomials is spanned by the infinite set of polynomials {I, t, t 2, . . .}. A number of questions arise naturally at this point. For example, which spaces can be spanned by a finite set of elements? If a spacecan be spanned by a finite set of elements, what is the smallest number of elementsrequired?To discuss these and related questions, we introduce the concepts of dependence, independence, bases, and dimension. These ideaswere encountered in Chapter 12 in our study of the vector space V n . Now we extend them to general linear spaces.) 15.7 Dependent and independent sets in a linear space DEFINITION. A set S of elements in a linear space V is called dependentif there is a finite set of distinct elements in S, say Xl' . . . , X k , and corresponding set of scalars C l , . . . , c k , not all zero, such that) k Z CiXi = 0 . i=l) The set S is called independent if it is not dependent. In this case, for all choices of distinct elements Xl , . . . , x k in S and scalars CI , . . . , C k ,) k , c.x. = 0k 't't i=l) implies CI = C2 = \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= C k = 0 .) Although dependence and independence are properties of sets of elements, we also apply these terms to the elements themselves. For example, the elements in an independent set are called independent elements. If S is a finite set, the foregoing definition agrees with that given in Chapter 12 for the space V n . However, the present definition is not restricted to finite sets.) EXAMPLE 1. If a subset T of a set S is dependent, then S itself is dependent. This is logicallyequivalent to the statement that every subset of an independent set is independent.) EXAMPLE 2. If one element in S is a scalar multiple of another, then S is dependent.) EXAMPLE 3. If 0 E S, then S is dependent.) EXAMPLE 4. The empty set is independent.))) 558) Linear spaces) Many examples of dependent and independent sets of vectors in V n were discussed in Chapter 12. The following examples illustrate these concepts in function spaces. In each casethe underlying linear space V is the set of all real-valued functions defined on the real line.) EXAMPLE 5. Let ul(t) = cos2 t, u 2 (t) = sin 2 t, u 3 (t) = 1 for all real t. The Pythagorean identity shows that Ul + U 2 - U3 = 0, so the three functions Ul , U2 , U3 are dependent.) EXAMPLE 6. Let uk(t) = t k for k = 0, 1,2, . . . , and t real. The set S = {uo , Ul , U2 , . . .} is independent. To prove this, it suffices to show that for each n the n + 1 polynomials U o , Ul , . . . , Un are independent. A relation of the form Z CkU k = 0 means that) (15.1)) n zckt k = 0 k=O) for all real t. When t = 0, this gives Co = O. Differentiating (15.1) and setting t = 0, we find that Cl = O. Repeating the process, we find that each coefficient Ck is zero.) EXAMPLE 7. If a l , . . . , an are distinct real numbers, the n exponential functions) Ul(X) = ea1X , . . . , un(x) = eanX) are independent. We can prove this by induction on n. The result holds trivially when n = 1. Therefore, assume it is true for n - 1 exponential functions and consider scalars Cl , . . . , C n such that) (15.2)) n zcke akx = O. k=l) Let aJ.l1: be the largest of the n numbers a l , . . . , an' Multiplying both members of (15.2) by e- aMX , we obtain) (15.3)) n Z cke(ak-aM)x = 0 . k=l) If k :F- M, the number a k - a J.\\0371is negative. Therefore, when x --++ 00 in Equation (15.3), each term with k :F- M tends to zero and we find that CM = O. Deleting the Mth term from (15.2) and applying the induction hypothesis, we find that each of the remaining n - 1 coefficients Ck is zero.) THEOREM 15.5. Let S be an independent set consisting of k elements in a linear space V and let L(S) be the subs pace spanned b\\037yS. Then every set of k + 1 elements in L(S) is dependent.) Proof When V = Vn , Theorem 15.5 reduces to Theorem 12.8. Ifwe examine the proof of Theorem 12.8, we find that it is based only on the fact that V n is a linear space and nc))) Bases and dimension) 559) on any other special property of V n' Therefore the proof given for Theorem 12.8 is valid for any linear space V.) 15.8 Bases and dimension) DEFINITION. A finite set S of elementsin a linear space V is called a finite basis for V if S is independent and spans V. The space V is called finite dimensional if it has a finite basis, or if V consists 0..( 0 alone. Otherwise V is called infinite dimensional.) THEOREM 15.6. Let V be a finite-dimensional linear space. Then every finite basis for V has the same number of elen1ents.) Proof Let Sand T be two finite bases for V. Suppose S consists of k elements and T consists of m elements. Since S is independent and spans V, Theorem 15.5 tells us that every set of k + 1 elementsin V is dependent. Therefore, every set of more than k elements in V is dependent. Since T is an independentset, we must have m < k. The same argu- ment with Sand T interchanged shows that k < nl. Therefore k = m.) DEFINITION. If a linear space V has a basis of n elements, the integer n is called the dimension of V. We H'rite n = dim V. If V = {O}, \\0371'esay V has dimension O.) EXAMPLE 1. The space V n has dimension n. One basis is the set of n unit coordinate vectors.) EXAMPLE 2. The space of all polynomials pet) of degree < n has dimension n + 1. One basis is the set of n + 1 polynomials {I, t, t 2, . . . , t n }. Every polynomial of degree < n is a linear combination of these n + 1 polynomials.) EXAMPLE 3. The space of solutions of the differential equation y\\\" - 2y' - 3y = 0 has dimension 2. One basis consists of the two functions u 1(x) = e- x , u 2 (x) = e 3x. Every solution is a linear combination of these two.) EXAMPLE 4. The space of all polynomials pet) is infinite-dimensional. Although the infinite set {I, t, t 2, . . . } spans this space, no finite set of polynomials spans the space.) THEOREM 15.7. Let V be a finite-dimensional linear space H,ith dim V = n. Then H'e have the folloH'ing: (a) Any set of independent elenlents in V is a subsetof somebasisfor V. (b) Any set of n independent elements is a basis for V.) Proof The proof of (a) is identical to that of part (b) of Theorem 12.10.The proof of (b) is identical to that of part (c) of Theorem 12.10.) Let V be a linear space of dimension n and consider a basis whose elementsel , . . . , en are taken in a given order. We denote such an ordered basis as an n-tuple (el , . . . , en)'))) 560) Linear spaces) If x E V, we can express x as a linear combination of these basis elements:) (15.4)) n X = , c.e,. k\\\" Z l i=l) The coefficients in this equation determine an n-tuple of numbers (Cl, . . . , cn) that is uniquely determined by x. In fact, if we have another representation of x as a linear combination of el , . . . , en , say x = !;=l diei , then by subtraction from (15.4), we find that \\037;=l (c i - di)ei = O. But since the basis elements are independent, this implies Ci = di for each i, so we have (c1,..., cn) = (d l ,..., dn ). The components of the ordered n-tuple (Cl,. . ., cn) determined by Equation (15.4) are called the components of x relative to the ordered basis (el , . . . , en)') 15.9 Exercises) In each of Exercises1 through 10, let S denote the set of all vectors (x,y, z) in V 3 whose com- ponents satisfy the condition given.

Norms In ordinary Euclidean geometry,those properties that rely on the possibility of measuring lengths of line segments and angles betweenlines are called metric properties. In our study of V n , we defined lengths and angles in terms of the dot product. Now we wish to extend these ideas to more general linear spaces. We shaH introduce first a generalization of the dot product, which we caH an inner product, and then define length and angle in terms of the inner product. The dot product x \\302\\267 y of two vectors x = (Xl' . . . , x n ) and y = (YI, . . . , Yn) in V n was defined in Chapter 12 by the formula) (15.5)) n X . Y = ! XiYi . i=l) In a general linear space, we write (x, y) instead of x \\302\\267 y for inner products, and we define the product axiomatically rather than by a specific formula. That is, we state a number of properties we wish inner products to satisfy and we regard these properties as axioms.) DEFINITION. A real linear space V is said to have an inner product if for each pair of elements x and y in V there corresponds a unique real number (x, y) satisfying the folloa'ing axioms for all choicesof x, y, z in V and all real scalarsc. (1) (x, y) = (Y, x) (commutativity, or symmetry). (2) (x, y + z) = (x,Y) + (x, z) (distributivity, or linearity). (3) c(x, y) = (cx,y) (associativity, or homogeneity). (4) (x, x) > 0 if x \\302\\245=0 (positivity).) A real linear space with an inner product is called a real Euclidean space. Note: Taking c = 0 in (3), we find that (0, y) = 0 for all y. In a complex linear space, an inner product (x, y) is a complex number satisfying the same axioms as those for a real inner product, except that the symmetry axiom is replaced by the relation) (1 ')) (x, y) = (y, x) ,) where (}', x) denotes the cOJ11plexconjugateof (y, x). In the homogeneity axiom, the scalar multiplier c can be any complex number. From the homogeneity axiom and (1'), we get))) 562) Linear spaces) the companion relation) (x, cy) = (ey, x) = e(y, x) = e(x,y) .) A complex linear space with an inner product is called a complex Euclidean space. (Sometimes the term unitary space is also used.) One example is complex vector space Vn(C) discussed briefly in Section 12.16. Although we are interested primarily in examples of real Euclidean spaces, the theorems of this chapter are valid for complex Euclidean spaces as well. When we use the term Euclidean space without further designation, it is to be understood that the space can be real or complex. The reader should verify that each of the following satisfies all the axioms for an inner product.) EXAMPLE 1. In V n let (x, y) = x \\302\\267 y, the usual dot product of x and y.) EXAMPLE 2. If x = (Xl' X2) and y = (YI , Y2) are any two vectors in V 2 , define (x, y) by the formula) (x, y) = 2X 1Yl + X 1Y2 + X2YI + X2Y2 \\302\\267) This example shows that there may be more than one inner product in a given linear space.) EXAMPLE 3. Let C(a, b) denote the linear space of all real-valued functions continuous on an interval [a, b]. Define an inner product of two functions f and g by the formula) (f, g) = f: f(t)g(t) dt \\302\\267) This formula is analogous to Equation (15.5)which defines the dot product of two vectors in V n . The function values J(t) and get) play the role of the components Xi and Yi , and integration takes the place of summation.) EXAMPLE 4. In the space C(a, b), define) (f, g) = f: w(t)f(t)g(t) dt ,) where w is a fixed positive function in C(a, b). The function w is called a H'eight function. In Example 3 we have wet) = 1 for all t.) EXAMPLE 5. In the linear space of all real polynomials, define) (f, g) = fooo e-'i(t)g(t) dt .) Because of the exponential factor, this improper integral converges for every choice of polynomials f and g.))) Inner products, Euclidean spaces. Norms) 563) THEOREM 15.8. In a Euclidean space V, every inner product satisfies the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality:) I(x, y)1 2 < (x, x)(y,y)) for all x and y in V.) Moreover, the equality sign holds if and only if x andyare dependent.) Proof When we proved the corresponding result for vectors in V n (Theorem 12.3), we were careful to point out that the proof was a consequence of the properties of the dot product listed in Theorem 12.2 and did not depend on the particular definition used to deduce these properties. Therefore, the very same proof is valid in any real Euclidean space. When we apply this proof in a complex Euclidean space, we obtain the inequality (x, y)(y, x) < (x,x)(y, y), which is the same as the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality since) (x, y)(y, x) = (x,y)(x, y) = I(x, y)1 2 .) EXAMPLE. Applying Theorem 15.8 to the space C(a,b) with the inner product (f, g) = S\\037f(t)g(t) dt, we find that the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality becomes) (I:f(t)g(t) dt r < u: f2(t) dt HI: g2(t) dt) \\302\\267) The inner product can be used to introduce the metric concept of length in any Euclidean space.) DEFINITION. In a Euclidean space V, the nonnegative number Ilx II defined by the equation) Ilx II = (x, X)1/2) is called the norm of the element x.) When the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality is expressed in terms of norms, it becomes) I(x, y)1 < Ilx II Ily II .) Since it may be possible to define an inner product in many different ways, the norm of an element will depend on the choice of inner product. This lack of uniqueness is to be expected.It is analogous to the fact that we can assign different numbers to measure the length of a given line segment, depending on the choice of scale or unit of measurement. The next theorem gives fundamental properties of norms that do not depend on the choice of inner product.) THEOREM 15.9. In a Euclidean space, every norm has the following properties for all elements x and y and all scalars c: (a) Ilxll = 0 if x = O. (b) IIx II > 0 if x \\302\\245=0 (positivity). (c) Ilcxll = Iclllxli (homogeneity). (d) IIx + ,yll < IIx II + Ilyll (triangle inequality). The equality sign holds in (d) if x = 0, if y = 0, orify = cx for some c > o.))) 564) Linear spaces) Proof Properties (a), (b) and (c) follow at once from the axioms for an inner product. To prove (d), we note that) Ilx + yl12 = (x + y, x + y) = (x, x) + (y,y) + (X,y) + (y, x) = IIxl1 2 + IIyl12 + (X,y) + (X,y) .) The sum (x, y) + (x, y) is real. The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows that I(x, y)1 < Ilxllllyll and l(x,y)1 < Ilxllllyll, so we have Ilx + yl12 < IIxl1 2 + IIyl12 + 211xll Ilyll = (1Ixii + Ilyl\\\\)2.) This proves (d). When y = cx, where c > 0, we have Ilx + yll = Ilx + cxll = (1 + c)llxll = Ilxll + Ilcxll = Ilxll + Ilyli.) DEFINITION. In a real Euclidean space V, the angle between two nonzero elementsx and y is defined to be that number () in the interval 0 < () < 'TT' which satisfies the equation) (15.6)) cos () = (x, y) . Ilxllllyll) Note: The Cauchy-Schwarz inequality shows that the quotient on the right of (15.6) lies in the interval [-1, 1], so there is exactly one () in [0, 1T]whose cosine is equal to this quotient.) 15.11 Orthogonality in a Euclidean space) DEFINITION. In a Euclidean space V, t\\037vo elements x and yare called orthogonalif their inner product is zero. A subset S of V is called an orthogonalset if (x,y) = 0 for every pair of distinct elements x and y in S. An orthogonal set is called orthonormal if each of its elements has norm 1.) The zero element is orthogonal to every element of V; it is the only element orthogonal to itself. The next theorem showsa relation between orthogonality and dependence.) THEOREM 15.10. In a Euclidean space V, every orthogonal set of nonzero elementsis independent. In particular, in a finite-dimensional Euclideanspace with dim V = n, every orthogonal set consisting of n nonzero elements is a basisfor V.) Proof Let S be an orthogonal set of nonzero elements in V, and suppose some finite linear combination of elements of S is zero, say) k ! CiX i = 0, i=l) where each Xi E S. Taking the dot product of each member with Xl and using the fact))) Orthogonality in a Euclidean space) 565) that (Xl' Xi) = 0 if i \\037 1, we find that CI(X I , Xl) = O. But (Xl' Xl) \\037 0 since Xl \\037 0 so Cl = O. Repeating the argument with Xl replaced by x j , we find that each C j = O. This proves that S is independent. If dim V = n and if S consistsof n elements, Theorem 15.7(b) shows that S is a basis for V.) EXAMPLE. In the real linear space C(O, 21T) with the inner product (}:g) = S\\0371Tf(x)g(x) dx, let S be the set of trigonometric functions {uo , U I , U2, . . .} given by) Uo( x) = 1 ,) U2n- I(X) = cos nx ,) U2n(X) = sin nx ,) for n = 1, 2, . .. .) If m \\037 n, we have the orthogonality relations) [ 27T un(x)um(x) dx = 0 , -0) so S is an orthogonal set. Sinceno member of S is the zero element,S is independent. The norm of each element of S is easily calculated. We have (u o , u o ) = S\\0371T dx = 21T and, for n > 1, we have) (21T 2 (U 2n - l , U 2n - l) = L cos nx dx = 1T,-0) [ 21T . 2 (U 2n , U 2n) = sin nx dx = 1T. -0) Therefore, Iluoll = V 21T and Ilunll = V 1T for n > 1. Dividing each Un by its norm, we obtain an orthonormal set {!Po,!PI , !P2' . . .} where !Pn = u n / II Un II. Thus, we have) 1 !Po(x) = A /- , 'V 21T) cos nx 1f2n-l(X) = vi; ,) sin nx 1f2n(X) = V 7T ') for n > 1 .) In Section 15.13 we shall prove that every finite-dimensional Euclidean space has an orthogonal basis. The next theorem shows how to compute the components of an element relative to such a basis.) THEOREM 15.11. Let V be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space \\037rith dimension n, and assume that S = {e1 , . . . , en} is an orthogonal basis for v. If an element X is expressed as a linear combination of the basis elelnents, say) (15.7)) n X = , c.e. k\\\" ll' i=l) then its components relative to the ordered basis (e l , . . . , en) are given by the fornlulas) (15.8)) (x, e j)c. = } (ej,e j )) for j = 1, 2, . . . , n .) In particular, if S is an orthonormal basis, each c j is given b,y) (15.9)) c j = (x, ej) .))) 566) Linear spaces) Proof Taking the inner product of each member of (15.7) with e j , we obtain) n (x, e j ) = ! ci(e i , e j ) = cj(e j , ej) i=1) since (e i , ej) = 0 if i \\037j. This implies (15.8), and when (e j , e j) = 1, we obtain (15.9).) If {e1, . . ., en} is an orthonormal basis, Equation (15.7) can be written in the form) (15.10)) n X = ! (x,ei)e i . i=l) The next theorem shows that in a finite-dimensional Euclidean space with an ortho normal basis the inner product of two elements can be computed in terms of their components.) THEOREM 15.12. Let V be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space of dimension n, and assume that {e 1 , . . . , en} is an orthonormal basisfor V. Then for every pair of elefnents x and y in V, }t'e have) (15.11)) n (x, Y) = ! (x, ei)( y, ei ) i=l) (Parseval's formula).) In particular, when x = y, l-ve have) (15.12)) n /lx/l 2 = ! I(x, e i )1 2 . i=l) Proof Taking the inner product of both members of Equation (15.10)with y and using the linearity property of the inner prod uct, we obtain (15.11). When x = y, Eq uation (15.11) reduces to (15.12).) Note: Equation (15.11) is named in honor of M. A. Parseval (circa1776-1836),who obtained this type of formula in a special function space.) 15.12 Exercises) 1. Let x = (Xl' . . . , xn ) and y = (Y1 , . . . , Yn) be arbitrary vectors in V n .

The Gram-Schmidt process) Every finite-dimensional linear space has a finite basis. I f the space is Euclidean, we can always construct an orthogonal basis. This result will be deduced as a consequence of a general theorem whose proof shows how to construct orthogonal sets in any Euclidean space, finite or infinite dimensional. The construction is called the Gram-Schmidt orthog- onalization process, in honor of J. P. Gram (1850-1916)and E. Schmidt (1845-1921).) THEOREM 15.13. ORTHOGONALIZA TION THEOREM. Let Xl' X2 , . . . , be a finite or infinite sequence of elements in a Euclidean space V, and let L(x 1, . . . , xk) denote the subs pace spanned by the first k of these elements.Then there is a corresponding sequence of elements Yl , Y2 , . \\302\\267. , in V \\037vhich has the follo\\037ring properties for each integer k: (a) The element Yk is orthogonal to every elementin the subspace L(YI , \\302\\267. . , Ylc-l)' (b) The subspace spannedby Yl , . . . , Yk is the same as that spanned by Xl , . . . , xk :) L(Yl , . . \\302\\267, Yk) = L(x 1 , . . . , xk) .))) Construction of orthogonal sets. The Gram-Schmidtprocess) 569) (c) The sequence YI , Y2 , . . . , is unique, exceptfor scalarfactors. That is, if Y\\037' Y\\037' . . . , is another sequence of elementsin V satisfying properties (a) and (b), then for each k there is a scalarC k such that Y\\037= CkYk .) Proof We construct the elements YI , .V2 , . . . , by induction. To start the process, we take YI = Xl. Now assume we have constructed YI , . . . , Yr so that (a) and (b) are satisfied when k = r. Then we define Yr+l by the equation) (15.13)) r Yr+l = xr+l - I aiYi , i=l) where the scalars al , . . . , a r are to be determined. For j < r, the inner product of Yr+l with Yj is given by) r (Yr+l , Yj) = (xr + l , Yj) - I ai(Yi , Yj) = (Xr+l , Yj) - alYj , Yj) , i=l) since (Yi , Yj) = 0 if i \\037j. If )J j \\037 0, we can make Yr+l orthogonal to Yi by taking) (15.14)) (X r + l , Y j) a j = . (y j , Y j)) If Yj = 0, then Yr+l is orthogonal to Yj for any choice of aj , and in this case we choose aj = O. Thus, the element Y r+l is well defined and is orthogonal to each of the earlier elements YI , . . . , Yr' Therefore, it is orthogonal to every element in the subspace) L(YI , . . . ,.Y r) .) This proves (a) when k = r + 1. To prove (b) when k = r + 1, we must show that LeVI, . . . , Yr+l) = L(x l , . . \\302\\267, x r+l), given that L(YI , . . . , Yr) = L(x l , . . . , xr ). The first r elements YI , . . . , Yr are in) L( x I , . . . , Xr)) and hence they are in the larger subspace L(x i , . . . , xr + 1). The new element Yr+l given by (15.13) is a differenceof two elements in L(x l , . . . , Xr+l) so it, too, is in L(x i , . . . , x r+l). This proves that) L(YI , . . . , Y r+l) C L(x i , . . . , xr + l ) .) Equation (15.13) shows that xr+l is the sum of two elements in L(YI, . . . , Yr+l) so a similar argument gives the inclusion in the other direction:) L(x i , . . . , xr + 1) C L(Yl , \\302\\267\\302\\267. , Y r+l) .) This proves (b) when k = r + 1. Therefore both (a) and (b) are proved by induction on k.))) 570) Linear spaces) Finally we prove (c) by induction on k. The casek = 1is trivial. Therefore, assume (c) is true for k = r and consider the element Y;+l' Because of (b), this element is in) L(y 1 , . . . , Y r+1) ,) so we can write) r+1 Y;+1 = I CiYi = Zr + Cr+1Yr+1 , i=1) where Zr E L(Yl , . . . , Yr)' We wish to prove that Zr = O. By property (a), both Y;+1 and c r+1Yr+1 are orthogonal to Zr' Therefore, their difference,Zr , is orthogonal to zr' In other words, Zr is orthogonal to itself, so Zr = O. This completes the proof of the orthogonaliza- tion theorem.) In the foregoing construction, suppose we have Yr+l = 0 for some r. Then (15.13) shows that xr+1 is a linear combination of YI , . . . , Yr' and hence of Xl , . . . , X r , so the elements Xl , . . . , xr+l are dependent. In other words, if the first k elements Xl , . . . , X k are independent, then the corresponding elements Yl , . . . , Yk are nonzero. In this case the coefficients a i in (15.13) are given by (15.14), and the formulas defining Yl , . . . , Yk become) (15.15) YI = Xl ,) r \\037 (x r+l , Yi) Yr+l = xr+l - L ( . .) Yi i=l Yz , Yz) for r = 1,2, . . . , k - 1 .) These formulas describe the Gram-Schmidt process for constructing an orthogonal set of nonzero elements Yl , . . . , Yk which spans the same subspaceas a given independent set Xl , . . . , X k . In particular, if Xl , . . . , X k is a basis for a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, then YI , . . . , Yk is an orthogonal basis for the same space. We can also convert this to an orthonormal basis by normalizing each element Yi, that is, by dividing it by its norm. Therefore,as a corollary of Theorem 15.13 we have the following.) THEOREM 15.14. Every finite-dimensional Euclidean space has an orthonormal basis.) If X and yare elements in a Euclidean space, with Y \\037 0, the element) (x, y) y (y, Y)) is called the projection of X along y. In the Gram-Schmidt process (15.15),we construct the element Yr+l by subtracting from xr+l the projection of Xr+l along each of the earlier elementsYI , . . . , y\\\", Figure 15.1 illustrates the construction geometrically in the vector space Va.) EXAMPLE 1. In V4 , find an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by the three vectors Xl = (1, -1, 1, -1), X 2 = (5, 1, 1, 1), and Xa = (-3, -3, 1, -3).))) Construction of orthogonal sets.

Therefore L(x i , X 2 , x 3) is a subspace of dimension 2. The set {YI , Y2} is an orthogonal basis for this subspace. Dividing each of J'l and Y2 by its norm we get an orthonormal basis consisting of the two vectors) Yl 1-=- (1 -11 -1 ) \\\"Ylil 2' \\ and) Y2 1---- = A/- (2, 1,0,1). IIY 2\\\" 'V 6) EXAMPLE 2.

Projections Let V be a Euclidean space and let S be a finite-dimensional subspace. We wish to consider the following type of approximation problem: Given an element x in V, to deter- mine an element in S whose distance from x is as small aspossible. The distance between two elements x and Y is defined to be the norm IIx - y II. Before discussing this problem in its general form, we consider a specialcase,illustrated in Figure 15.2. Here V is the vector space V 3 and S is a two-dimensional subspace,a plane through the origin. Given x in V, the problem is to find, in the plane S, that point s nearest to x. If XES, then clearly s = x is the solution. If x is not in S, then the nearest point s is obtained by dropping a perpendicular from x to the plane. This simple example suggests))) Orthogonal complements. Projections) 573) an approach to the general approximation problem and motivates the discussion that follows.) DEFINITION. Let S be a subset of a Euclidean space V. An element in V is said to be orthogonal to S if it is orthogonal to every element of S. The set of all elements orthogonal to S is denoted by S1- and is called\\\" S perpendicular.\\ It is a simple exercise to verify that S1- is a subspace of V, whether or not S itself is one. In caseS is a subspace, then S1- is called the orthogonal complement of S. EXAMPLE. If S is a plane through the origin, as shown in Figure 15.2, then S1- is a line through the origin perpendicular to this plane. This example also gives a geometric inter- pretation for the next theorem.) s.l) x=s+s.l)-----------) FIGURE 15.2 Geometric interpretation of the orthogonal decomposition theorem in V 3 .) THEOREM 15.15. ORTHOGONAL DECOMPOSITION THEOREM. Let V be a Euclideanspace and let S be afinite-dimensional subspace of V. Then every element x in V can be represented uniquely as a sum of t\\037vo elements, one in S and one in S 1-. That is, \\0371'ehave) ( 15.16)) x = s + s1- ,) \\037vhere s E S) and s1- E S1- .) Moreover, the norm of x is given by the Pythagorean formula) (15.17)) IIxl1 2 = IIsll2 + IIs1-112.) Proof First we prove that an orthogonal decomposition (15.16) actually ex;sts. Since S is finite-dimensional, it has a finite orthonormal basis, say {e1 , . . . , en}' Given x, define the elements sand s1-as follows:) (15.18)) n S = ! (x,ei)e i , i=l) 1- S =x-s.))) 574) Linear spaces) Note that each term (x, ei)e i is the projection of x along e i . The element s is the sum of the projections of x along each basis element. Since s is a linear combination of the basis elements, s lies in S. The definition of s-L shows that Equation (15.16) holds. To prove that s-L lies in S-L, we consider the inner product of s\\037 and any basis element ej . We have) (s-1-, ej) = (x - s,ej) = (x, ej) - (s,ej) .) But from (15.18), we find that (s, ej) = (x, ej), so s-L is orthogonal to ej . Therefore s-1- is orthogonal to every element in S, which means that s-1-E S-1-. Next we prove that the orthogonal decomposition (15.16) is unique. Suppose that x has two such representations, say) (15.19)) x = s + s-1-) and) x = t + f-L ,) where sand t are in S, and s-1- and t-L are in S-L. We wish to prove that s = t and s-L = t-1-. From (15.19), we have s - t = t-L - s-L, so we need only prove that s - t = o. But s - t E Sand t-L - s-L E S-L so S - t is both orthogonal to t-L - s-L and equal to t-L - s-L. Since the zero element is the only element orthogonal to itself, we must have s - t = O. This shows that the decomposition is unique. Finally, we prove that the norm of x is given by the Pythagorean formula. We have) IIxl1 2 = (x, x) = (s + s-L, s + s-1-) = (s, s) + (s-1-,s-L),) the remaining terms being zero sincesand s-L are orthogonal. This proves (15.17).) DEFINITION. Let S be a finite-dimensional subspace of a Euclidean space V, and let {e1, . . . , en} be an orthonormal basis for s. If x E V, the element s defined by the equation) n S = ! (x, ei)e i i=l) is called the projection of x on the subs pace S.) We prove next that the projection of x on S is the solution to the approximation problem stated at the beginning of this section.) 15.15 Best approximation of elements in a Euclidean space by elements in a finite- dimensional subspace) THEOREM 15.16. APPROXIMATION THEOREM. Let S be a finite-dbnensional subspace of a Euclidean space V, and let x be an.y element of V. Then the projection of x on S is nearer to x than any other element of S. That is, if s is the projection of x on S, vre have) IIx - sl! < Ilx - tll) for all t in S; the equality sign holds if and only if t = s.))) Best approximation oj' elements in a Euclidean space) 575) Proof By Theorem 15.15 we can write x = s + s1-, where S E Sand s1- E 51-. Then, for any t in S, we have) x - t = (x - s) + (s - t).) Since s - t E S and x - s = s- E S1-, this is an orthogonal decomposition of x - t, so its norm is given by the Pythagorean formula) IIx - t II 2 = IIx - S 11 2 + IIs - t II 2 .) But lis - t 11 2 > 0, so we have IIx - t 11 2 > Ilx - s 11 2 , with equality holding if and only if s = t. This completesthe proof.) EXAMPLE 1.

The 2n + 1 elements CPo , CPt , . . . , CP2n span a subspace S of dimension2n + 1. The elements of S are called trigonometric pol}'nomials. If f E C(O, 27T), let fn denote the projection off on the subspace S. Then we have) (15.21)) 2n fn = ! (f, CPk)CPk , k=O) where (f, 97k) = J:\\\"f(x) 97ix) dx \\302\\267) The numbers (f, CPk) are called Fourier coefficients off Using the formulas in (15.20), we can rewrite (15.21)in the form) ( 15.22)) n fn(x) = la o + L(a k cos kx + b k sin kx), k=l) where) 1 J 21T a k = - f(x) cos kx dx , 7T 0) 1 i 21T b k = - f(x) sin kx dx 7T 0) for k = 0, 1, 2, . . . , J1. The approximation theorem tells us that the trigonometric poly- nomial in (15.22) approximates f better than any other trigonometric polynomial in S, in the sense that the norm Ilf - fn II is as small as possible.)

Such functions are called transformations, mappings, or operators. This chapter treats the simplest examples, called linear trans- formations, which occur in all branches of mathematics. Properties of more general transformations are often obtained by approximating them by linear transformations. First we introd uce some notation and terminology concerning arbitrary functions. Let Vand W be two sets. The symbol) T: V----* W) will be used to indicate that T is a function whose domain is V and whose values are in W. For each x in V, the element T(x) in W is called the image of x under T, and we say that T maps x onto T(x). If A is any subset of V, the set of all images T(x) for x in A is called the image of A under T and is denoted by T(A). The image of the domain V, T( V), is the range of T. Now we assume that V and Ware linear spaces having the same set of scalars, and we define a linear transformation as follows.) DEFINITION. If V and Ware linear spaces,a function T: V ----* W is called a linear trans- formation of V into W if it has the follo\\037ving t'rt'O properties: (a) T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) for all x and y in V, (b) T(cx) = cT(x) for all x in V and all scalars c.) These properties are verbalized by saying that T preserves addition and multiplication by scalars. The two properties can be combined into one formula which states that) T(ax + by) = aT(x) + bT(y)) for all x, y in V and all scalars a and b. By induction, we also have the more general relation) T(\\037laiXi) = i\\037 aiT(x i )) for any n elements Xl , . . . , X n in V and any n scalars a l , . . . , an .) 578))) Null space and range) 579) The reader can easily verify that the following examples are linear transformations.) EXAMPLE 1. The identity transformation. The transformation T: V -+ V, where T(x) = x for each x in V, is called the identity transformation and is denoted by I or by Ir.) EXAMPLE 2. The zero transformation. The transformation T: V -+ V which maps each element of V onto 0 is called the zero transformation and is denoted by O.) EXAMPLE 3. Multiplication b)' a fixed scalar c. Herewe have T: V -+ V, where T(x) = cx for all x in V. When c = 1, this is the identity transformation. When c = 0, it is the zero transformation.) EXAMPLE 4. Linear equations. Let V = Vn and W = V m' Given mn real numbers a ik , where i = 1,2,..., m and k = 1,2, . .., n, define T: Vn -+ V m as follows: T maps each vector x = (Xl' . . . , x n ) in Vn onto the vector y = (Yl , . . . , Ym) in V m according to the eq uations) n Yi = L aikx k k=l) for i = 1,2, . . . , m .)

For a fixed element z in V, define T: V -+ R as follows: If x E V, then T(x) = (x, z), the inner product of x with z.) EXAMPLE 6. Projection on a subspace. Let V be a Euclidean space and let S be a finite- dimensional subspace of V. Define T: V -+ S as follows: If x E V, then T(x) is the projection of x on S.) EXAMPLE 7. The differentiation operator. Let V be the linear space of all real functions f differentiable on an open interval (a, b). The linear transformation which maps each function f in V onto its derivative f' is called the differentiation operator and is denoted by D. Thus, we have D : V -+ W, where D(f) = f' for each j' in V. The space W consists of all derivativesf'.) EXAMPLE 8. The integration operator. Let V be the linear space of all real functions continuous on an interval [a, b]. Iff E V, define g = T(f) to be that function in V given by) g(x) = (l(t) dt) if a < x < b .) This transformation T is called the integration operator.) 16.2 Null space and range In this section, T denotes a linear transformation of a linear space V into a linear space W.) THEOREM 16.1. The set T(V) (the range of T) is a subspaceof W. Moreover, T maps the zero element of V onto the zero element of W.))) 580) Linear transformations and matrices) Proof To prove that T(V) is a subspace of W, we need only verify the closure axioms. Take any two elements of T(V), say T(x) and T(y). Then T(x) + T(y) = T(x + y), so T(x)+ T(y) is in T(V). Also, for any scalar c we have cT(x) = T(cx),so cT(x)is in T(V). Therefore, T(V) is a subspace of W. Taking c = 0 in the relation T(cx) = cT(x), we find that T(O) = O.) DEFINITION. The set of all elements in V that T maps onto 0 is calledthe null space of T and is denoted by N(T). Thus, we have) N(T) = {x I x E V and T(x) = O}.) The null space is sometimes called the kernel of T.) THEOREM 16.2. The null space of T is a subspace of V.) Proof If x and yare in N(T), then so are x + y and cx for all scalars c, since) T(x + y) = T(x) + T(y) = 0) and) T(cx) = cT(x) = O.) The following examples describe the null spaces of the linear transformations given in Section 16.1.) EXAMPLE 1. Identity transformation. The null space is {O}, the subspace consisting of the zero element alone.) EXAMPLE 2. Zero transformation. Since every element of V is mapped onto zero, the null space is V itself.) EXAMPLE 3. Multiplication by a ,fixed scalar c. If c \\302\\245:0, the null space contains only O. If c = 0, the null space is V.) EXAMPLE 4. Linear equations. The null space consists of all vectors (Xl' . . . , xn ) in Vn for which) n .L QikXk = 0 k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m .) EXAMPLE 5. Inner product with a fixed element z. The null space consists of all elements in V orthogonal to z.) EXAMPLE 6. Projection on a subspace S. If x E V, we have the unique orthogonal decomposition x = s + s-L (by Theorem 15.15). Since T(x) = s, we have T(x) = 0 if and only if x = s-L. Therefore, the null space is S-L, the orthogonal complement of S.) EXAMPLE 7. Differentiation operator. The null space consists of all functions that are constant on the given interval.) EXAMPLE 8. Integration operator. The null space contains only the zero function.))) Nullity and rank) 581) 16.3 Nullity and rank Again in this section T denotesa linear transformation of a linear space V into a linear space W. We are interested in the relation between the dimensionality of V, of the null space N(T), and of the range T( V). If V is finite-dimensional, then the null space is also finite-dimensional since it is a subspace of V. The dimension of N(T) is called the nullity of T. In the next theorem, we prove that the range is also finite-dimensional; its dimension is called the rank of T.) THEOREM 16.3. NULLITY PLUS RANK THEOREM. If V is finite-dimensional, then T(V) is also finite-dimensional, and \\037i'ehave) (16.1 )) dim N(T) + dim T(V) = dim V.) In other 'ri'ords, the nullity plus the rank of a linear transformation is equal to the dimension of its domain.) Proof Let n = dim V and let e l , . . . , ek be a basis for N(T), wherek = dim N(T) < n. By Theorem 15.7, these elements are part of some basis for V, say the basis) ( 16.2)) e I , . . . , ek , e k+ I , . . . , e k+r ,) where k + r = n. We shall prove that the r elements) (16.3)) T( e k+l), . . . , T( ek + r )) form a basis for T( V), thus proving that dim T( V) = r. Since k + r = n, this also proves (16.1). First we show that the r elements in (16.3) span T(V). If Y E T(V), we have y = T(x) for some x in V, and we can write x = cie l + . . . + ck+re k + r . Hence, we have) k+r k k+r k+r y = T(x) = :LciT(ei ) = :L ciT(e i ) + :L ciT(e i ) = :L ciT(e i ) i=I i=l i=k+I i=k+l) since T(e I) = \\302\\267\\302\\267. = T(e k ) = O. This shows that the elements in (16.3) span T(V). Now we show that these elements are independent. Suppose that there are scalars Ck + l , . . . , ck+r such that) k+r :L ciT(e i ) = O. i=k+J) This implies that) ( k+r ) T :L cie i = 0 i = k+ I) so the element x = ck+lek + l + \\302\\267. \\302\\267 + ck+re k + r is in the null space N(T). This means there are scalarsC I , . . . , Ck such that x = clel + \\302\\267. . + cke k , so we have) k k+r X - X = '\\\" c.e. - '\\\" c.e.= 0 \\037ll \\037 II . i=1 i=k+l))) 582) Linear transformations and matrices) But since the elements in (16.2) are independent,this implies that all the scalars ci are zero. Therefore, the elements in (16.3) are independent. Note: If V is infinite-dimensional, then at least one of N(T) or T( V) is infinite- dimensional. A proof of this fact is outlined in Exercise 30 of Section 16.4.) 16.4 Exercises) In each of Exercises 1 through 10,a transformation T: V2 --+ V2 is defined by the formula given for T(x, y), where (x, y) is an arbitrary point in V2 . In each case determine whether T is linear. If T is linear, describe its null space and range, and compute its nullity and rank.) 1. T(x, y) = (y, x). 2. T(x, y) = (x, - y). 3. T(x, y) = (x, 0). 4.

Do the same as above for each of Exercises 11 through 15 if the transformation T: V 2 --+ V2 is described as indicated. 11. T rotates every point through the same angle 4> about the origin. That is, T maps a point with polar coordinates (r, 8) onto the point with polar coordinates (r, 8 + 4\\302\\273,where 4> is fixed. Also, T maps 0 onto itself. 12. T maps each point onto its reflection with respect to a fixed line through the, origin. 13. T maps every point onto the point (1, 1). 14. T maps eachpoint with polar coordinates (r, 8) onto the point with polar coordinates (2r, 8). Also, T maps 0 onto itself. 15. T maps each point with polar coordinates (r, 8) onto the point with polar coordinates (r, 28). Also, T maps 0 onto itself. Do the same as above in each of Exercises 16 through 23 if a transformation T: V 3 --+ V3 is defined by the formula given for T(x, y, z), where (x, y, z) is an arbitrary point of V 3 .) 16. T(x, y, z) = (z,y, x). 17. T(x, y, z) = (x, y, 0). 18. T(x, y, z) = (x, 2 y, 3z). 19. T(x, y, z) = (x,y, 1).) 20. T(x,y, z) = (x + l,y + 1, z - 1). 21. T(x,y,z)=(x + 1,y +2,z +3). 22. T(x,y, z) = (x,y2, z3). 23. T(x,y, z) = (x + z, 0, x + y).) In each of Exercises 24 through 27, a transformation T: V --+ V is described as indicated. In each case, determine whether T is linear. If T is linear, describe its null space and range, and compute the nullity and rank when they are finite. 24. Let V be the linear space of all real polynomials p(x) of degree < n. If p E V, q = T(p) means that q(x) = p(x + 1) for all real x. 25. Let V be the linear space of all real functions differentiable on the open interval (-1, 1). If IE V, g = T(/) means that g(x) = xf'(x) for all x in ( -1, 1). 26. Let V be the linear space of all real functions continuous on [a, b]. If I E V, g = T(f) means that) g(x) = J>(t) sin (x - t) dt) for a < x < b .) 27. Let V be the space of all real functions twice differentiable on an open interval (a, b). If Y E V, define T(y) = y\\\" + Py' + Qy, where P and Q are fixed constants. 28. Let V be the linear space of all real convergent sequences {x n}.

Let T: V \\037 W be a linear transformation of a linear space V into a linear space W. If V is infinite-dimensional, prove that at least one of T( V) or N(T) is infinite-dimensional.) [Hint: Assume dim N(T) = k, dim T( V) = r, let el , . . . , ek be a basis for N(T) and let el , . . . , ek , ek+l , . . . , ek+n be independent elements in V, where n > r. The elements T(ek+l)' . . . , T(ek+rJ are dependent since n > r. Use this fact to obtain a contradiction.]) 16.5 Algebraic operations on linear transformations) Functions whose values lie in a given linear space W can be addedto each other and can be multiplied by the scalars in W according to the following definition.) DEFINITION. Let S: V -+ Wand T: V -+ W be tH'O functions u'ith a common domain V and H,ith z:alues in a linear space W. If c is any scalar in W, \\037redefine the sum S + T and the product cT by the equations) ( 16.4)) (S + T)(x) = Sex)+ T(x) ,) (cT)(x) = cT(x)) for all x in V.) We are especially interested in the case where V is also a linear space having the same scalars as W. In this case we denote by 2( V, W) the set of all linear transformations of V in to W. If Sand T are two linear transformations in 2( V, W), it is an easy exerciseto verify that S + T and cT are also linear transformations in fE( V, W). More than this is true. With the operations just defined, the set 2( V, W) itself becomes a new linear space. The zero transformation serves as the zero element of this space, and the transformation (-1) T))) 584) Linear transformations and matrices) is the negativeof T. It is a straightforward matter to verify that all ten axioms for a linear space are satisfied. Therefore, we have the following.) THEOREM 16.4. The set 2(V, W) of aI/linear transformations of V into W is a linear space with the operations of addition and multiplication by scalars defined as in (16.4).) A more interesting algebraic operation on linear transformations is composition or multiplication of transformations. This operation makes no use of the algebraic structure of a linear space and can be defined quite generally as follows.) ST: U ----. W) FIGURE 16.1 Illustrating the composition of two transformations.) DEFINITION. Let U, V, W be sets. Let T: U \\037 V be a function with domain U and values in V, and let S : V \\037 W be another function \\037vith domain V and values in W. Then the composition ST is the function ST: U \\037 W defined by the equation) (ST)(x) = S[T(x)]) for every x in U .) Thus, to map x by the composition ST, we first map x by T and then map T(x) by S. This is illustrated in Figure 16.1. Composition of real-valued functions has been encountered repeatedly in our study of calculus,and we have seen that the operation is, in general, not commutative. However, as in the case of real-valued functions, composition does satisfy an associative law.) THEOREM 16.5. If T: U \\037 V, S: V -+ W, and R: W -+ X are three functions, then \\037vehave) R(ST) = (RS)T.) Proof Both functions R(ST) and (RS)T have domain U and values in X. For each x in U, we have) [R(ST)](x) = R[(ST)(x)]= R[S[T(x)]]) and) [(RS)T](x) = (RS)[T(x)] = R[S[T(x)]],) which proves that R(ST) = (RS)T.))) Inverses) 585) DEFINITION. Let T: V -+ V be a function \\037vhich maps V into itself. We define integral po'wersof T inductively as follo\\037's:) TO= I ,) Tn = TTn-l) for n > I .) Here I is the identity transformation. The reader may verify that the associative law implies the law of exponents TmTn = Tm+n for all nonnegative integers m and n. The next theorem shows that the composition of linear transformations is again linear.) THEOREM 16.6. If U, V, Ware linear spaces with the same scalars, and if T: U-+ V and S : V -+ Ware linear transformations, then the composition ST : U -+ W is linear.) Proof For all x, y in U and all scalars a and b, we have) (ST)(ax + by) = S[T(ax + by)] = S[aT(x) + bT(y)] = aST(x)+ bST(y) .) Composition can be combined with the algebraic operations of addition and multiplica- tion of scalarsin ff( V, W) to give us the following.) THEOREM 16.7. Let U, V, W be linear spaces a'ith the same scalars, assume Sand T are in \\037(V, W), and let c be any scalar. (a) For any function R H,ith values in V, H'e have) (S + T)R = SR + TR) and) (cS)R = c(SR) .) (b) For any linear transformation R : W \\037 U, \\037vehave) R(S + T) = RS + RT) and) R(cS) = c(RS) .) The proof is a straightforward application of the definition of composition and is left as an exerCIse.) 16.6 Inverses) In our study of real-valued functions we learned how to construct new functions by inversion of monotonic functions. Now we wish to extend the process of inversion to a more general class of functions. Given a function T, our goal is to find, if possible, another function S whosecomposition with T is the identity transformation. Since composition is in general not commutative, we have to distinguish between ST and TS. Therefore we introduce two kinds of inverses which we call left and right inverses.) DEFINITION. Given tM:'o sets V and Wand a function T: V -+ W. A function S: T( V) -+ V is called a left inverse of T if S[T(x)]= xfor all x in V, that is, if) ST = Iv ,))) 586) Linear transformations and matrices) where Iv is the identity transformation on V. A function R : T(V) \\037 V is called a right inverse ofT ifT[R(y)] = Y for all y in T(V), that is, if) TR = IT(v) ,) where IT(V) is the identity transforn1ation on T(V).) EXAMPLE. A function \\037vith no left inverse but \\037vith two right inverses. Let V = {I, 2} and let W = {O}. Define T: V \\037 W as follows: T(I) = T(2) = O. This function has two right inverses R : W \\037 V and R' : W \\037 V given by) R(O) = I ,) R' (0) = 2 .) It cannot have a left inverse S since this would require) 1 = S[T(I)] = S(O)) and) 2 = S[T(2)] = S(O) .) This simple example shows that left inverses need not exist and that right inverses need not be unique.) Every function T: V \\037 W has at least one right inverse. In fact, each y in T( V) has the form y = T(x) for at least one x in V. If we select one such x and define R(y) = x, then T[R(y)] = T(x) = y for each y in T(V), so R is a right inverse. Nonuniqueness may occur because there may be more than one x in V which maps onto a given y in T( V). We shall prove presently (in Theorem 16.9) that if each y in T( V) is the image of exactly one x in V, then right inverses are unique. First we prove that if a left inverse exists it is unique and, at the same time, is a right Inverse.) THEOREM 16.8. A function T: V \\037 W can have at most one left inverse. If T has a left inverse S, then S is also a right inverse.) Proof Assume T has two left inverses, S: T( V) \\037 V and S': T( V) \\037 V. Choose any y in T(V). We shall prove that S(y) = S'(y). Now y = T(x) for some x in V, so we have) S[T(x)] = x) and) S'[T(x)] = x ,) since both Sand S' are left inverses. Therefore S(y) = x and S'(y) = x,soS(y) = S'(y) for all y in T( V). Therefore S = S' which proves that left inverses are unique. Now we prove that every left inverse S is also a right inverse. Choose any element y in T(V). We shall prove that T[S(y)] = y. Since y E T(V), we have y = T(x) for some x in V. But S is a left inverse, so) x = S[T(x)] = S(y). Applying T, we get T(x) = T[S(y)]. But Y = T(x), so Y = T[S(y)], which completes the proof.) The next theorem characterizes all functions having left inverses.))) One-to-one linear transformations) 587) THEOREM 16.9. A function T: V -+ W has a left inverse if and only if T maps distinct elements of V onto distinct elements of W; that is, if and only if, for all x andy in V,) (16.5)) x\\037y) implies) T(x) \\037 T(y).) Note: Condition (16.5) is equivalent to the statement) (16.6)) T(x) = T(y)) implies) x = y.) A function T satisfying (16.5) or (16.6)for all x and y in V is said to be one-to-oneon V.) Proof Assume T has a left inverseS, and aSSUIne that T(x) = T(y). We wish to prove that x = y. Applying S, we find S[T(x)] = S[T(y)]. SinceS[T(x)]= x and S[T(y)] = y, this implies x = y. This proves that a function with a left inverse is one-to-one on its domain. Now we prove the converse. Assume T is one-to-oneon V. We shall exhibit a function S: T( V) -+ V which is a left inverse of T. If Y E T( V), then y = T(x) for some x in V. By (16.6), there is exactly one x in V for which y = T(x). Define S(y) to be this x. That is, we define S on T( V) as follows:) S(y) = x) means that) T( x) = }' .) Then we have S[T(x)] = x for each x in V, so ST = Iv. Therefore, the function S so defined is a left inverse of T.) DEFINITION. Let T: V -+ W be one-to-one on V. The unique left inverse of T (a'hich we know is also a right inverse) is denoted by T-l. We say that T is invertible, and we call T-I the inverse of T.) The results of this section refer to arbitrary functions. Now we apply these ideas to linear transformations.) 16.7 One-to-one linear transformations) In this section, V and W denote linear spaces with the same scalars, and T: V \\037 W denotes a linear transformation in 2( V, W). The linearity of T enables us to express the one-to-one property in several equivalent forms.) THEOREM 16.10. Let T: V -+ W be a linear transformation in 2(V, W). Then the following statements are equivalent. (a) T is one-to-one on V. (b) T is invertible and its inverse T-I: T( V) -+ V is linear. (c) For all x in V, T(x) = 0 implies x = O. That is, the null space N(T) contains only the zero element of V.))) 588) Linear transformations and matrices) Proof We shall prove that (a) implies (b), (b) implies (c), and (c) implies (a). First assume(a) holds. Then T has an inverse (by Theorem 16.9),and we must show that T-l is linear. Take any two elements u and v in T(V). Then u = T(x) and v = T(y) for some x and y in V. For any scalars a and b, we have) au + bv = aT(x) + bT(y) = T(ax+ by) ,) since T is linear. Hence, applying T-\\\\ we have) T-l(au + bv) = ax + by = aT-leu) + bT-l(v) ,) so T-l is linear. Therefore (a) implies (b). Next assume that (b) holds. Take any x in V for which T(x) = O. Applying T-\\\\ we find that x = T-l(O) = 0, since T-l is linear. Therefore, (b) implies (c). Finally, assume (c) holds. Take any two elements u and v in V with T(u) = T(v). By linearity, we have T(u - v) = T(u) - T(v) = 0, so u - v = O. Therefore, Tis one-to-one on V, and the proof of the theorem is complete. When V is finite-dimensional, the one-to-one property can be formulated in terms of independence and dimensionality, as indicated by the next theorem.) THEOREM 16.11. Let T: V -+ W be a linear tran\\037rormation in 2( V, W) and assume that V is finite-dimensional, say dim V = n. Then the folloli'ing statements are equivalent. (a) T is one-to-one on V. (b) If e1, . . . , e p are independent elements in V, then T( e1), . . . , T( e p) are independent elements in T( V). (c) dim T(V) = n. (d) If {e1, . .., en} is a basis for V, then {T(e 1), . . . , T(en )} is a basis for T(V).) Proof We shall prove that (a) implies (b), (b) implies (c), (c)implies (d), and (d) implies (a). Assume (a) holds. Let e l , . . . , e p be independent elements of V and consider the elements T(e1), . .., T(e p ) in T( V). Suppose that) p :2 ciT(e\\037) = 0 i=l) for certain scalars C1 , . . . , C P' By linearity, we obtain) T ( f Cie; ) = 0 , \\037=l) and hence) p , c.e. = 0 \\037 \\037z i=l) since T is one-to-one. But e l , . . . , e p are independent, so C 1 = \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= C p = O. Therefore (a) implies (b). Now assume (b) holds. Let {el,. . . , en} be a basis for V. By (b), the n elements T(el), . . . , T(e n ) in T( V) are independent. Therefore, dim T( V) > n. But, by Theorem 16.3, we have dim T(V) < n. Therefore dim T(V) = n, so (b) implies(c).))) Exercises) 589) Next, assume (c) holds and let {e l , . . . , en} be a basis for V. Take any element y in T( V). Then y = T(x)for some x in V, so we have) n X = \\\"\\\" c.e. \\302\\243..,zZ' i=l) n and hence y = T(x) = L ciT(ei ). i=l) Therefore {T(e l),..., T(en )} spans T( V). But we are assuming dim T( V) = n, so {T(el), . . ., T(e n )} is a basis for T(V). Therefore (c) implies (d). Finally, assume (d) holds. We will prove that T(x) = 0 impliesx = O. Let {e l ,. . ., en} be a basis for V. If x E V, we may write) n X = L czei , i=l) n and hence T(x) = L cZT(e i ). z=l) If T(x) = 0, then C 1 = . . . = Cn = 0, since the elements T(el), . . ., T(e n ) are independent. Therefore x = 0, soT is one-to-one on V. Thus, (d) implies (a) and the proof is complete.) 16.8 Exercises) 1. Let V = {O, I}. Describe all functions T: V \\037 V. There are four altogether.

Matrix representations of linear transformations) 591) THEOREM 16.12. Let e1, . . . , en be a basis for an n-dimensional linear space V. Let u l , . . . , un be n arbitrary elements in a linear space W. Then there is one and only one linear transformation T: V \\037 W such that) (16.7)) T(ek ) = Uk) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n .) This T maps an arbitrary element x in V as folloH's:) (16.8)) n If x =!xke k , k=l) n then T(x) = ! XkU k . k=l) Proof Every x in V can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of el , . . . , en , the multipliers Xl\\\"'\\\" x n being the components of X relative to the ordered basis (el , . . . , en)' If we define T by (16.8), it is a straightforward matter to verify that T is linear. If x = e k for some k, then all components of X are 0 except the kth, which is 1, so (16.8) gives T(ek ) = Uk' as required. To prove that there is only one linear transformation satisfying (16.7), let T' be another and compute T'(x). We find that) ( n ) n n T(x) = T k\\037lxkek = k\\037/kT'(ek) = k\\037/kllk = T(x).) Since T'(x) = T(x) for all x in V, we have T' = T, which completes the proof.) EXAMPLE. Determine the linear transformation T: V 2 \\037 V 2 which maps the basis elements i = (1,0)andj = (0,1)as follows:) T(i) = i + j ,) T(j) = 2i - j .) Solution. If x = xli + x2 j is an arbitrary element of V 2 , then T(x) is given by) T(x) = x1T(i) + x 2 T(j) = xl(i + j) + x2 (2i - j) = (Xl + 2x 2)i + (Xl - x 2 )j.) 16.10 Matrix representations of linear transformations) Theorem 16.12 shows that a linear transformation T: V \\037 W of a finite-dimensional linear space V is completely determined by its action on a given set of basis elements el , . . . , en' Now, suppose the space W is also finite-dimensional,say dim W = m, and let WI , . . . , lV m be a basis for W. (The dimensionsnand m mayor may not be equal.) SinceT has values in W, each element T(ek ) can be expressed uniquely as a linear combination of the basis elements WI , . . . , W m , say) m T(e k) = ! tikw i , i=l) where tlk , . . . , t mk are the components of T(ek ) relative to the ordered basis (WI' . . . , W m)'))) 592) Linear transformations and matrices) We shall display the m-tuple (t ue , . . . , t mk) vertically, as follows:) t lk t 2k) (16.9)) t mk) This array is called a column vector or a column matrix. We have such a column vector for each of the n elements T(e l), . . . , T(e n ). We place them side by side and enclose them in one pair of brackets to obtain the following rectangular array:) t il t12 tIn t 21 t 22 t 2n) t ml t m2 t mn) This array is called a matrix consisting of m rows and n columns. We call it an m by n matrix, or an m X n matrix. The first row is the 1 x n matrix (t II , t I2 , . . . , tIn). The m x 1 matrix displayed in (16.9) is the kth column. The scalarst ik are indexed so the first sub- script i indicates the row, and the second subscript k indicates the column in which t ik occurs. We call t ik the ik-entry or the ik-element of the matrix. The more compact notation) (t ik ) ,) or) (tik)\\037\\037:l ') is also used to denote the matrix whose ik-entry is t ik . Thus, every linear transformation T of an n-dimensional space V into an m-dimensional space W gives rise to an m X n matrix (t ik ) whose columns consist of the components of T(e l ), . . . , T( en) relative to the basis (\\037VI, . . . , Vt'm)' We call this the matrix representation of T relative to the given choice of ordered bases(el , . . ., en) for V and (WI' . . . , W m) for w. Once we know the matrix (t ik ), the components of any element T(x) relative to the basis (\\037Vl, . . . , Wm) can be determined as describedin the next theorem.) THEOREM 16.13. Let T be a linear transformation in 2(V, W), Vt,here dim V = nand dim W = m. Let (el , . . . , en) and (WI' . . . , W m) be ordered bases for V and W, respectively, and let (t ik ) be the m X n matrix whose entries are determined by the equations) (16.10)) m T(e k ) = ! tikw i , i=l) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n .) Then an arbitrary element) (16.11)) 'Y1 X = !xlce k k=l))) Matrix representations of linear transformations) 593) in V with components (Xl' . . . , x n ) relative to (e l , . . . , en) is mapped by T onto the element) (16.12)) m T(x) = \\037 YiWi i=l) in W with components (YI, . . . , Ym) relative to (WI' . . . , W m)' The Y i are related to the components of X by the linear equations) (16.13)) n Yi = \\037 tikx k k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m .) Proof Applying T to each member of (16.11) and using (16.10), we obtain) n n m m ( n ) m T(x) = k\\037lxkT(ek) = k\\037lXk \\\"'!:/ikWi = i\\037 k\\037/ikXk Wi = i\\037/iWi') where each Y i is given by (16.13). This completes the proof.) Having chosen a pair of bases(el , . . ., en) and (\\037i'l , . . . , \\037vm) for Vand W, respectively, every linear transformation T: V \\037 W has a matrix representation (t ik ). Conversely, if we start with any mn scalars arranged as a rectangular matrix (t ik ) and choose a pair of ordered bases for Vand W, then it is easy to prove that there is exactly one linear trans- formation T: V \\037 W having this matrix representation. We simply define T at the basis elementsof V by the equations in (16.10). Then, by Theorem 16.12, there is one and only one linear transformation T: V \\037 W with these prescribed values. The image T(x) of an arbitrary point x in V is then given by Equations (16.12) and (16.13).) EXAMPLE 1. Construction of a linear transformation from a given nlatrix. Suppose we start with the 2 x 3 matrix) [\\037 \\037 -:l) Choose the usual bases of unit coordinate vectors for V3 and V 2 . Then the given matrix represents a linear transformation T: V3 \\037 V 2 which maps an arbitrary vector (Xl' X2 , x 3 ) in V3 onto the vector (YI , Y2) in V 2 according to the linear equations) YI = 3x I + X 2 - 2X3) Y2 = Xl + OX 2 + 4x 3 .) EXAMPLE 2. Construction of a matrix representation of a given linear transforn1ation. Let V be the linear space of all real polynomials p(x) of degree < 3. This space has dimen- sion 4, and we choose the basis (1, x, X2, X3). Let D be the differentiation operator which maps each polynomial p(x) in V onto its derivative p'(x). We can regard D as a linear transformation of V into W, where W is the 3-dimensional space of all real polynomials of degree < 2. In W we choose the basis(1, X, X2). To find the matrix representation of D))) 594) Linear transformations and matrices) relative to this choice of bases, we transform (differentiate)each basiselement of V and express it as a linear combination of the basis elements of W. Thus, we find that) D(I) = 0 = 0 + Ox + Ox2 ,) D(x) = 1 = 1 + Ox + Ox 2 ,) D(x 2) = 2x = 0 + 2x + Ox 2 ,) D(x 3) = 3x 2 = 0 + Ox + 3x 2 .) The coefficients of these polynomials determinethe columns of the matrix representation of D. Therefore, the required representation is given by the following 3 X 4 matrix:) o I 0 0 o 0 2 0 . 000 3) To emphasize that the matrix representation depends not only on the basis elements but also on their order, let us reverse the order of the basis elements in Wand use, instead, the ordered basis (x 2 , x, 1). Then the basis elements of V are transformed into the same poly- nomials obtained above, but the components of these polynomials relative to the new basis (x 2 , x, 1) appear in reversed order. Therefore, the matrix representation of D now becomes) 000 3 o 0 2 0 . o I 0 0) Let us compute a third matrix representation for D, using the basis (1, 1 + x, 1 + x + x 2 , 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 ) for V, and the basis (1, x, x2 ) for W. The basis elements of V are trans- formed as follows:) D(1)= 0 ,) D(1 + x) = I ,) D( I + x + x2 ) = I + 2x ,) D( 1 + x + x 2 + x 3 ) = 1 + 2x + 3x 2 ,) so the matrix representation in this case is 0 I I 1 0 0 2 2 . 0 0 0 3) 16.11 Construction of a matrix representation in diagonal form Since it is possible to obtain different matrix representations of a given linear transforma- tion by different choices of bases, it is natural to try to choose the basesso that the resulting matrix will have a particularly simple form. The next theorem shows that we can make all the entries 0 except possibly along the diagonal starting from the upper left-hand corner))) Construction of a matrix representation in diagonal form) 595) of the matrix. Along this diagonal there will be a string of ones followed by zeros, the number of ones being equal to the rank of the transformation. A matrix (t ik) with all entries t ik = 0 when i \\302\\245=k is said to be a diagonal matrix.) THEOREM 16.14. Let V and W be finite-dimensional linear spaces, with dim V = nand dim W = m. Assume T E 2( V, W) and let r = dim T( V) denote the rank of T. Then there exists a basis (e1, . . . , en) for V and a basis (\\\"\\\"1' . . . , \\\",'m) for W such that) (16.14)) T(e i) = Wi) for i = 1, 2, . . . , r ,) and) (16.15)) T(e i ) = 0) for i = r + 1, . . . , n .) Therefore, the matrix (t ik ) of T relative to these bases has all entries zero except for the r diagonal entries) t 11 = t 22 = \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= t rr = 1 .) Proof First we construct a basis for W. Since T( V) is a subspaceof W with dim T( V) = r, the space T( V) has a basis of r elementsin W, say \\0371!1, . . . , W r' By Theorem 15.7, these elements form a subset of some basis for W. Therefore we can adjoin elements\\\",'r+ 1 , . . . , w m so that) (16.16)) (\\\"\\\"1 , . . . , W r , Wr+ 1 , . . . , W m)) is a basis for W. N ow we construct a basis for V. Each of the first r elements \\\",'i in (16.16) is the image of at least one element in V. Choose one such element in Vand call it ei . Then T(e i ) = Wi for i = 1, 2, . . . , r so (16.14) is satisfied. Now let k be the dimension of the null space N(T). By Theorem 16.3 we have n = k + r. Since dim N(T) = k, the space N(T) has a basis consisting of k elements in V which we designate as er+l , . . . , e r+k . For each of these elements, Equation (16.15) is satisfied. Therefore, to complete the proof, we must show that the ordered set) (16.17)) (e1, . . . , er , e r+ 1 , . . . , e r+ k)) is a basis for V. Since dim V = n = r + k, we need only show that these elements are independent. Suppose that some linear combination of them is zero, say) (16.18)) r+k ! ciei = O. i=1) Applying T and using Equations (16.14)and (16.15), we find that) r+k r \\037 c.T ( e.) = \\037 c.w. = 0 \\302\\243..1, 'l \\302\\243..1,'l \\302\\267 i=l i=l))) 596) Linear transformations and matrices) But H'l,' . . , \\\\Vr are independent, and hence C l = . . . = Cr = O. Therefore, the first r terms in (16.18) are zero, so (16.18)reduces to) r+k .L clei = o. i=r+l) But e r+ l , . . . , er + k are independent since they form a basis for N(T), and hence cr + l = \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267= cr+ k = O. Therefore, all the Ci in (16.18) are zero, so the elements in (16.17) form a basis for V. This completes the proof.) EXAMPLE. We refer to Example 2 of Section 16.10,where D is the differentiation operator which maps the space V of polynomials of degree < 3 into the space W of polynomials of degree< 2. J n this example, the range T(V) = W, so T has rank 3. Applying the method used to prove Theorem 16.14, we choose any basis for W, for example the basis (1, X, x 2). A set of polynomials in V which map onto these elements is given by (x, !X2, tx 3 ). We extend this set to get a basisfor V by adjoining the constant polynomial 1, which is a basis for the null space of D. Therefore, if we use the basis (x, ix2 , !x 3, 1) for V and the basis (1, x, x 2) for W, the corresponding matrix representation for D has the diagonal form) [\\037 r \\037 \\037l) 16.12 Exercises) In all exercises involving the vector space V l1 , the usual basis of unit coordinate vectors is to be chosenunless another basis is specifically mentioned.

Matrices can also be consideredas objects existing in their own right, without necessarily being connected to linear transformations. As such, they form another class of))) 598) Linear transformations and matrices) mathematical objects on which algebraic operations can be defined. The connection with linear transformations serves as motivation for these definitions, but this connection will be ignored for the moment. Let m and n be two positive integers, and let Im,n be the set of all pairs of integers (i,}) such that 1 < i < m, 1 < j < n. Any function A whose domain is Im,n is called an m X n matrix. The function value A(i,j) is called the ij-entry or ij-element of the matrix and will be denoted also by a ij . It is customary to display all the function values in a rectangular array consisting of m rows ana n columns, as follows:) an a12 a 1n a 21 a 22 a 2n) amI a m2 a mn) The elements a ij may be arbitrary objects of any kind. Usually they will be real or complex numbers, but sometimes it is convenient to consider matrices whose elements are other objects, for example, functions. We also denote matrices by the more compact notation) A ( ) rn,n= aij i ,j=1) or) A = (aij) .) If m = n, the matrix is said to be a square matrix. A 1 x n matrix is called a row Inatrix; an m X 1 matrix is called a column matrix. Two functions are equal if and only if they have the same domain and take the same function value at each element in the domain. Since matrices are functions, two matrices A = (aij ) and B = (bij ) are equal if and only if they have the same number of rows, the same number of columns, and equal entries aij = b ij for each pair (i,)). Now we assume the entries are numbers (real or complex) and we define addition of matrices and multiplication by scalars by the same method usedfor any real- or complex- valued functions.) DEFINITION. If A = (aij) and B = (bij) are two fn X n matrices and if c is any scalar, we define matrices A + Band cA as follows:) A + B = (a.. + b..)1.} 1.}') cA = (ca ij ) .) The sun1 is defined only when A and B have the same size.) EXAMPLE. If A = [ 1 2 -:] B=G 0 :l and -1 0 -2 then we have A + B = [\\037 2 -\\037l [-\\037 4 -:l [-5 0 -I} 2A = (-l)B = -2 0 -1 2 -3))) Isomorphism between linear transformations and matrices) 599) We define the zero matrix 0 to be the m x n matrix all of whose elements are O. With these definitions, it is a straightforward exercise to verify that the collection of all m X n matrices is a linear space. We denote this linear space by Mm. n' If the entries are real numbers, the space Mm,n is a real linear space. If the entries are complex, M m, n is a complex linear space. It is also easy to prove that this space has dimension Inn. In fact, a basis for Mm,n consists of the Inn matrices having one entry equal to 1 and all others equal to O. For example, the six matrices) [\\037 : :l [: \\037 :l [: : \\037l [\\037 : :l [: \\037 :l [: : \\037l) form a basis for the set of all 2 X 3 matrices.) 16.14 Isomorphism between linear transformations and matrices) We return now to the connection between matrices and linear transformations. Let V and W be finite-dimensional linear spaces with dim V = n and dim W = m. Choose a basis(el , . . . , en) for V and a basis (H'l , . . . , H'm) for W. I n this discussion, these basesare kept fixed. Let 2( V, W) denote the linear space of all linear transformations of V into W. If T E fe( V, W), let In(T) denote the matrix of T relative to the given bases. We recall that meT) is defined as follows. The image of each basis element ek is expressed as a linear combination of the basis elements in W:) (16.19)) m T(e k ) = L tikw i i=l) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n .) The scalar multipliers t ik are the ik-entries of meT). Thus, we have) ( 16.20)) n1(T) = (tik)\\037\\037:l .) Equation (16.20) defines a new function m whose domain is \\037(V, W) and whose values are matricesin M m,n' Since every m X n matrix is the matrix meT) for some T in \\037(V, W), the range of m is M m,n' The next theorem shows that the transformation m: \\037(V, W)-+ M m,n is linear and one-to-one on \\037(V, W).) THEOREM 16.15. ISOMORPHISM THEOREM. For all Sand T in \\037(V, W) and all scalars e, we have) m(S + T) = m(S) + meT)) and) meeT) = em(T) .) Moreover,) m(S) = meT)) implies S = T,) so m is one-to-one on \\037(V, W).))) 600) Linear transformations and matrices) Proof The matrix m(T) is formed from the multipliers tik in (16.19). Similarly, the matrix m(S) is formed from the multipliers Sik in the equations) (16.21)) m Seek) = L SikWi i=l) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n .) Since we have) m (S + T)(e k ) = L (Silc + tik)W i i=l) and) m (cT)( e k) = L (ctik)W i , i=l) we obtain m(S + T) = (Sik + tik) = m(S) + m(T) and m(cT) = (ct ik ) = cm(T). This proves that m is linear. To prove that m is one-to-one, suppose that m(S) = m(T), where S = (Silc) and T = (t ik ). Equations (16.19) and (16.21) show that Seek) = T(e k) for each basis element e k , so Sex) = T(x) for all x in V, and hence S = T.) Note: The function m is called an isomorphism. For a given choice of bases, m establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the set of linear transformations 2( V, W) and the set of m x n matrices M m,n' The operations of addition and multipli- cation by scalars are preserved under this correspondence. The linear spaces 2( V, W) and M m,n are said to be isomorphic. Incidentally, Theorem 16.11 shows that the domain of a one-to-one linear transformation has the same dimension as its range. Therefore, dim 2(V, W) = dim M m n = mn., If V = Wand if we choose the same basisin both Vand W, then the matrix m(l) which corresponds to the identity transformation I: V \\037 V is an n X n diagonal matrix with each diagonal entry equal to 1 and all others eq ual to O. This is called the identity or unit matrix and is denoted by I or by In.) 16.15 Multiplication of matrices Some linear transformations can be multiplied by means of composition. Now we shall define multiplication of matrices in such a way that the product of two matrices corresponds to the composition of the linear transformations they represent. We recall that if T: U \\037 Vand S: V \\037 Ware linear transformations, their composition ST: U \\037 W is a linear transformation given by) ST(x) = S[T(x)]) for all x in U .) Suppose that U, V, and Ware finite-dimensional,say) dim U = n ,) dim V = P ,) dim W = m .) Choose bases for U, V, and W. Relative to these bases, the matrix m(S) is an m X p matrix, the matrix T is a p x n matrix, and the matrix of ST is an m X n matrix. The following definition of matrix multiplication will enable us to deduce the relation nz(ST)= m(S)m(T).This extends the isomorphism property to products.))) Multiplication of matrices) 601) DEFINITION. Let A be any m X p matrix, and let B be any p X n matrix, say) A = (aij)2;:1) and) B = (bij)\\037,'jn=l .) Then the product AB is defined to be the m X n matrix C = (cij ) whose i)-entry is given by) (16.22)) 'P c., = \\\"'\\\" a. k b k . l3 \\037 l 3' k=l) Note: The product AB is not defined unless the number of columns of A is equal to the number of rows of B.) If we write Ai for the ith row of A, and Bj for the jth column of B, and think of these as p-dimensional vectors, then the sum in (16.22) is simply the dot product Ai' Bj. In other words, the ij-entry of AB is the dot product of the ith row of A with the jth column of B:) AB = (Ai . Bj)\\037\\037\\037l . l,3-) Thus, matrix multiplication can be regarded as a generalization of the dot product.) EXAMPLE 1. Let A = [ 3 -1) 4 6 1 2 ] and B = 5 -1 .

Let) A = [\\037 \\037 -:]) and) B=) -2 1 . 2) Here A is 2 X 3 and B is 3 X 1, so AB is the 2 X 1 matrix given by) AB = [ AI \\302\\267Bl ] = [ -9 ] , A 2 \\302\\267Bl 8) since Al \\302\\267Bl = 2 \\302\\267 (-2) + 1 \\302\\2671 + (-3) \\302\\2672 = -9 and A 2 \\302\\267BI = 1 . (-2) + 2 . 1 + 4 . 2 = 8.))) 602) Linear transformations and matrices) EXAMPLE 3. If A and B are both square matrices of the same size, then both AB and BA are defined. For example, if) A = [ 1 \\037] and B = [\\037 :l-1 we find that [I3 8] [-I lOJ. AB= BA = 3 , 2 -2 12) This example shows that in general AB \\037 BA. If AB = BA, we say A and B commute.) EXAMPLE 4. If I p is the p x p identity matrix, then I pA = A for every p x n matrix A, and BIp = B for every m X p matrix B. For example,) [\\037\\037 \\037][\\037]=[\\037l [\\037\\037 \\037J[\\037 \\037 \\037]=[\\037 \\037 \\037l) Now we prove that the matrix of a composition ST is the product of the matrices m(S) and m(T).) THEOREM 16.16. Let T: U \\037 V and S: V \\037 W be linear transforn1ations, where U, V, W are finite-dimensional linear spaces. Then,for a fixed choice of bases, the matrices of S, T, and ST are related by the equation) m(ST) = m(S)m(T) .) Proof Assume dim U = n, dim V = p, dim W = m. Let (ul , . . . , un) be a basis for U, (VI' . . . , V p) a basis for V, and (WI' . . . , W m) a basis for W. Relative to these bases,we have) m m(S) = (Sij):;:I' where S(v k) = I SikWi i=1) for k = 1, 2, . . . , p ,) and) p meT) = (tij)\\037j\\0371 , where T(u j) = I tkjV k k=I) for j = 1, 2, . . . , n .)

Applying Theorem 16.16 once more to this equation, we obtain m(R)m(ST) = m(RS)m(T)or A(BC)= (AB)C, which proves (a). The proof of (b)can be given by a similar type of argument.) DEFINITION.

A set of m equations of the form) (16.23)) n 2 aikx k = C i k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m ,) is called a system of m linear equations in n unknowns. Here Xl , . . . , X n are regarded as unknown. A solution of the system is any n-tuple of numbers (Xl' . . . , Xu) for which all the equations are satisfied. The matrix A is called the coefficient-matrix of the system. Linear systems can be studied with the help of linear transformations. Choose the usual bases of unit coordinate vectors in V n and in Vm' The coefficient-matrixA determines a linear transformation, T: V n -* Vm , which maps an arbitrary vector X = (Xl' . . . , xn ) in Vn onto the vector y = (Yl , . . . , Ym) in V m given by the m linear equations) n Yi = 2 QikXk k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m .) Let c = (ci , . . . , cm) be the vector in V m whose components are the numbers appearing in system (16.23). This system can be written more simply as) T(x) = c .) The system has a solution if and only if c is in the range of T. If exactly one x in V n maps onto c, the system has exactly one solution. If more than one X maps onto c, the system has more than one solution.) EXAMPLE 1. A systenl \\037i'ith no solution. The system x + Y = 1, x + Y = 2 has no solu- tion. The sum of two numbers cannot be both 1 and 2.) EXAMPLE 2. A system H'ith exactly one solution. The system X + y = 1, X - y' = 0 has exactly one solution: (x,Y) = (1, 1).) EXAMPLE 3. A system 'rvith nlore than one solution. The system x + y = 1, consisting of one equation in two unknowns, has more than one solution. Any two numbers whose sum is 1 gives a solution.) With each linear system (16.23), we can associate another system) n 2aikxk = 0 k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m ,) obtained by replacing each Ci in (16.23) by O. This is called the homogeneoussystem corre- sponding to (16.23). If c \\037 0, system (16.23) is called a nonhomogeneous system. A vector x in V n will satisfy the homogeneous system if and only if) T(x) = 0,))) 606) Linear transformations and matrices) where T is the linear transformation determined by the coefficient-matrix. The homogene- ous system always has one solution, namely x = 0, but it may have others. The set of solutions of the homogeneous system is the null space of T. The next theorem describesthe relation between solutions of the homogeneous system and those of the nonhomogeneous system.) THEOREM 16.18. Assume the nonhomogeneous system (16.23)has a solution, say b. (a) If a vectorx is a solution of the nonhomogeneous system, then the vector v = x - b is a solution of the corresponding homogeneous system. (b) If a vector v is a solution of the homogeneous system, then the vector x = v + b is a solution of the nonhomogeneous system.) Proof Let T: V n \\037 V m be the linear transformation determined by the coefficient- matrix, as described above. Sinceb is a solution of the nonhomogeneous system we have T(b) = c. Let x and v be two vectors in V n such that v = x-b. Then we have) T(v) = T(x - b) = T(x)- T(b) = T(x) - c .) Therefore T(x) = c if and only if T(v) = O. This proves both (a) and (b).) This theorem shows that the problem of finding all solutions of a nonhomogeneous system splits naturally into two parts: (1) Finding all solutions v of the homogeneous system, that is, determining the null space of T; and (2) finding one particular solution b of the nonhomogeneous system. By adding b to each vector v in the null space of T, we thereby obtain all solutions x = v + b of the nonhomogeneous system. Let k denote the dimension of N(T) (the nullity of T). If we can find k independent solutions VI , . . . , Vk of the homogeneous system, they will form a basis for N(T), and we can obtain every v in N(T) by forming all possible linear combinations) v = t 1v l + \\302\\267\\302\\267. + fkv k ,) where t 1 , . . . , tk are arbitrary scalars. This linear combination is called the general solution of the homogeneous system. If b is one particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system, then all solutions x are given by) x = b + tlV l + \\302\\267\\302\\267\\302\\267 + tkVk .) This linear combination is called the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system. Theorem 16.18can now be restated as follows.) THEOREM 16.19. Let T: Vn \\037 V m be the linear transformation such that T(x) = y, }vhere x = (XI' \\302\\267. . , x n)' Y = (y 1 , \\302\\267\\302\\267. , y m) and) n Yi = ! aikx k k=l) for i = 1, 2, . . . , m .))) Computation techniques) 607) Let k denote the nullity of T. If Vi , . . . , Vk are k independent solutions of the homogeneous system T(x) = 0, and if b is one particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system T(x) = c, then the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system is) x = b + tlv! + . . . + tkv k ,) }t'here t l , . . . , tic are arbitrary scalars.) This theorem does not tell us how to decide if a nonhomogeneous system has a particular solution b, nor does it tell us how to determine solutions Vi , . . . , V k of the homogeneous system. It does tell us what to expect when the nonhomogeneous system has a solution. The following example, although very simple, ill ustrates the theorem.) EXAMPLE. The system x + y = 2 has for its associated homogeneous system the equation x + }'= O. Therefore, the null space consists of all vectors in V2 of the form (t, -t), where t is arbitrary. Since (t, -t) = t(l, -1), this is a one-dimensional subspace of V 2 with basis (1, -1). A particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system is (0, 2). There- fore the general solution of the nonhomogeneous system is given by) (x, y) = (0,2) + t(I, -1)) or) x = t,) y=2-t,) where t is arbitrary.) 16.18 Computation techniques We turn now to the problem of actually computing the solutions of a nonhomogeneous linear system. Although many methods have been developed for attacking this problem, all of them require considerablecomputation if the system is large. For example, to solve a system of ten equations in as many unknowns can require several hours of hand com- putation, even with the aid of a desk calculator. We shall discuss a widely-used method, known as the Gauss-Jordan elimination method, which is relatively simple and can be easily programmed for high-speed electronic computing machines. The method consists of applying three basictypes of operations on the equations of a linear system: (1) Interchanging two equations; (2) Multiplying all the terms of an equation by a nonzero scalar; (3) Adding to one equation a multiple of another. Each time we perform one of these operations on the system we obtain a new system having exactly the same solutions. Two such systems are called equivalent. By performing these operations over and over again in a systematic fashion we finally arrive at an equivalent system which can be solved by inspection. We shall illustrate the method with some specific examples. It will then be clear how the method is to be applied in general.) EXAMPLE 1. A system \\037i'ith a unique solution. Consider the system) 2x - 5y + 4z = -3 x - 2y + z = 5 x - 4y + 6z = 10 .))) 608) Linear transformations and matrices) This particular system has a unique solution, x = 124,Y = 75, z = 31, which we shall obtain by the Gauss-Jordan elimination process. To save labor we do not bother to copy the letters x, y, z and the equals sign over and over again, but work instead with the aug- mented matrix) (16.24)) [:) -5 4 -2 1 -4 6) -\\037 ] 10) obtained by adjoining the right-hand members of the system to the coefficient matrix. The three basic types of operations mentioned aboveare performed on the rows of the augmented matrix and are called rOlV operations. At any stage of the process we can put the letters x, y, z back again and insert equals signs along the vertical line to obtain equations. Our ultimate goal is to arrive at the augmented matrix) (16.25)) [ 1 0 0 010 001) 124 ] 75 31) after a succession of row operations. The corresponding system of equations is x = 124, Y = 75, z = 31, which gives the desired solution. The first step is to obtain a 1 in the upper left-hand corner of the matrix. We can do this by interchanging the first row of the given matrix (16.24) with either the second or third row. Or, we can multiply the first row by!. Interchanging the first and second rows, we get) [ \\037 1 = \\037 \\037 -4 6) -\\037 ] . 10) The next step is to make all the remaining entries in the first column equal to zero, leaving the first row intact. To do this we multiply the first row by - 2 and add the result to the second row. Then we multiply the first row by -1 and add the result to the third row. After these two operations, we obtain) ( 16.26)) [\\037 \\037 \\037 -I:}) [ -1 2 -13 ] Now we repeat the process on the smaller matrix which appears -2 5 5 adjacent to the two zeros. We can obtain a 1 in its upper left-hand corner by multiplying the second row of (16.26)by -1. This gives us the matrix) [ 1 - 2 1 o 1-2 o -2 5) I:] .))) Computation techniques) 609) Multiplying the second row by 2 and adding the result to the third, we get) ( 16.27)) [ 1 -2 1 o 1-2 001) l\\037 ] . 31) At this stage, the corresponding system of eq uations is given by) x - 2y + z = 5 Y - 2z = 13 z = 31 .) These equations can be solved in succession, starting with the third one and working backwards, to give us) z = 31 ,) y = 13 + 2z = 13 + 62 = 75,) x = 5 + 2 Y - z = 5 + 150- 31= 124.) Or, we can continue the Gauss-Jordan process by making all the entries zero above the diagonal elements in the second and third columns. Multiplying the second row of (16.27) by 2 and adding the result to the first row, we obtain) [ 1 0 -3 o 1 -2 001) 31 ] 13 . 31) Finally, we multiply the third row by 3 and add the result to the first row, and then multiply the third row by 2 and add the result to the second row to get the matrix in (16.25).) EXAMPLE 2. A system H,ith more than one solution. Consider the following system of 3 equations in 5 unknowns:) ( 16.28)) 2x - 5y + 4z + u - v = -3 x - 2y + z - u + v = 5 x - 4y + 6z + 2u - v = 10.) The corresponding augmented matrix is) 2 -5 4 1 -2 1 1 -4 6) 1 -1 -1 1 2 -1) -3 ] 5 . 10) The coefficients of x, y, z and the right-hand members are the same as those in Example 1.))) 610) Linear transformations and matrices) If we perform the same row operations used in Example 1, we finally arrive at the augmented matrix) [ 1 0 0 -16 19 o 1 0 -9 11 o 0 1 -3 4) 124 ] 75 . 31) The corresponding system of equations can be solved for x, y, and z in terms of u and v, gIvIng us) x = 124 + 16u- 19v y= 75+ 9u-l1v z = 31+ 3u - 4v.) If we let u = t1 and v = t 2 , where t 1 and t 2 are arbitrary real numbers, and determine x, y, z by these equations, the vector (x, y, z, u, v) in Vs given by) (x,y, z, u, v) = (124 + 16t1- 19t2 , 75 + 9t 1 - 1112 ,31 + 3t 1 - 4t2 , t 1 , t 2)) is a solution. By separating the parts involving t 1 and t 2 , we can rewrite this as follows:) (x, y, z, u, v) = (124,75,31,0,0) + t 1(16, 9, 3, 1,0) + 12 ( -19, -11, -4,0, 1) .) This equation gives the general solution of the system. The vector (124,75,31,0,0) is a particular solution of the nonhomogeneous system (16.28). The two vectors (16, 9, 3, 1,0) and (-19, -11, -4, 0, 1)are solutions of the corresponding homogeneous system. Since they are independent, they form a basis for the space of all solutions of the homogeneous system.) EXAMPLE 3. A system with no solution. Consider the system) (16.29)) 2x - 5y + 4z = -3 x - 2y + z = 5 x - 4y + 5z = 10.) This system is almost identical to that of Example 1 except that the coefficient of z in the third equation has been changed from 6 to 5. The corresponding augmented matrix is) [ 2 - 5 4 1 -2 1 1 -4 5) -3 ] 5 \\302\\267 10) Applying the same row operations used in Example 1 to transform (16.24) into (16.27), we arrive at the augmented matrix) (16.30)) [\\037 -\\037) 1 -2 o) l\\037 ] \\302\\267 31))) Inverses of square matrices) 611) When the bottom row is expressed as an equation, it states that 0 = 31. Therefore the original system has no solution since the two systems (16.29) and (16.30) are equivalent.) In each of the foregoing examples,the number of equations did not exceed the number of unknowns. If there are more equations than unknowns, the Gauss-Jordan process is still applicable. For example, suppose we consider the system of Example 1,which has the solution x = 124,Y = 75, z = 31. If we adjoin a new eq uation to this system which is also satisfied by the same triple, for example, the equation 2x - 3y + z = 54, then the elimina- tion process leads to the agumented matrix) 1 0 0 124 o 1 0 75 o 0 1 31 o 0 0 0) with a row of zeros along the bottom. But if we adjoin a new eq uation which is not satisfied by the triple (124,75,31), for example the equation x + y + z = 1, then the elimination process leads to an augmented matrix of the form) 1 0 0 124 o 1 0 75 o 0 1 31 o 0 0 a) where a \\302\\245=O. The last row now gives a contradictory equation 0 = a which shows that the system has no solution.) 16.19 Inverses of square matrices Let A = (a ij ) be a square n X n matrix. If there is another n X n matrix B such that BA = I, where I is the n x n identity matrix, then A is called nonsingular and B is called a left inverse of A. Choose the usual basis of unit coordinate vectors in Vn and let T: Vn -+ V n be the linear transformation with matrix meT) = A. Then we have the following.) THEOREM 16.20. The matrix A is nonsingular if and only if T is invertible. If BA = I, then B = m(T-I).) Proof Assume that A is nonsingular and that BA = I. We shall prove that T(x) = 0 implies x = O. Given x such that T(x) = 0, let X be the n X 1 column matrix formed from the components of x. Since T(x) = 0, the matrix product AX is an n X 1 column matrix consisting of zeros, so B(AX) is also a column matrix of zeros. But B(AX) = (BA)X = IX = X, soevery component of x is O. Therefore,Tis invertible, and the equation TT-I = I implies that m(T)m(T-I) = I or Am(T-l) = I. Multiplying on the left by B, we find m(T-I) = B. Conversely, if T is invertible, then T-IT is the identity transformation so m(T-l)m(T) is the identity matrix. Therefore A is nonsingular and m(T-l)A = I.))) 612) Linear transformations and matrices) All the properties of invertible linear transformations have their counterparts for non- singular matrices. In particular, left inverses (if they exist) are unique, and every left inverse is also a right inverse. In other words, if A is nonsingular and BA = I, then AB = I. We call B the inverse of A and denote it by A-I. The inverse A-I is also nonsingular and its inverse is A. Now we show that the problem of actually determining the entries of the inverse of a nonsingular matrix is equivalent to solving n separate nonhomogeneous linear systems. Let A = (a ij ) be nonsingular and let A-I = (bij ) be its inverse. The entries of A and A-I are related by the n 2 equations) (16.31)) n \\\"\\\" a. k b k , = D.. \\302\\243..,l. '} 'l.'}, k=l) where oij = 1 if i = j, and Oii = 0 if i \\302\\245=j. For each fixed choice ofj, we can regard this as a nonhomogeneoussystem of n linear equations in n unknowns blj , b 2j , . . . , b nj . Since A is nonsingular, each of these systemshas a unique solution, the jth column of B. All these systems have the same coefficient-matrixA and differ only in their right members. For example, if A is a 3 x 3 matrix, there are 9 equations in (16.31) which can be expressed as 3 separate linear systems having the following augmented matrices:) [ all al2 a l3 1 ] a\\037n a 22 a 23 0 , a 31 a 32 a 33 0) l all a12 a 13 0 ] a 21 a 22 a 23 1 _ a 31 a 32 a 33 0 ') [ all al2 a l3 O \\037] .a 21 a 22 a 23 a 31 a 32 a 33) If we apply the Gauss-Jordan process, we arrive at the respective augmented matrices) [ 1 0 0 bll ] o 1 0 b21 , o 0 1 b31) [ 1 0 0 b 12 ] o 1 0 b 22 , o 0 1 b32) [ 1 0 0 b 13 ] o 1 0 b 23 . o 0 1 b 33) In actual practice we exploit the fact that all three systems have the same coefficient-matrix and solve all three systerns at once by working with the enlarged matrix) [all a l2 a l3 1 0 \\037] .a 2 l a 22 a 23 0 1 a 31 a 32 a 33 0 0 The elimination process then leads to) [ 1 0 0 bil b12 b 13 ] o 1 0 b2l b 22 b 23 . o 0 1 b 31 b 32 b 33) The matrix on the right of the vertical line is the required inverse. The matrix on the left of the line is the 3 x 3 identity matrix.))) Exercises) 613) It is not necessary to know in advance whether A is nonsingular. If A is singular (not nonsingular), we can still apply the Gauss-Jordan method, but somewhere in the process one of the diagonal elements will become zero, and it will not be possible to transform A to the identity matrix.) 16.20 Exercises) Apply the Gauss-Jordan elimination process to each of the following systems.

Here v represents the velocity of a moving object, c the speed of light, and a = cfv c 2 - v2 , where Ivl < c. The linear transformation which maps the two-dimensional vector (x, t) onto (x', t') is called a Lorentz transformation.

Hadamard matrices, named for Jacques Hadamard (1865-1963), are those Il x /l matrices with the following properties: I. Each entry is 1 or -1. _ II. Each row, considered as a vectpr in V n , has length VIl . III. The dot product of any two distinct rows is O. Hadamard matrices arise in certain problems in geometry and the theory of numbers, and they have been applied recently to the construction of optimum code words in space com- munication. In spite of their apparent simplicity, they present many unsolved problems. The main unsolved problem at this time is to determine all n for which an /l x n Hadamard matrix exists. This exerciseoutlines a partial solution. (a) Determine all 2 x 2 Hadamard matrices (there are exactly 8). (b) This part of the exercise outlines a simple proof of the following theorem: If A is an n x n Hada/1zard matrix, where n > 2, then n is a multiple 0.( 4.
