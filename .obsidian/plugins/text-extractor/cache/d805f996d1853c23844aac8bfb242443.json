All answers must be expressed in sim- plest form unless speciﬁed otherwise. Only answers written on the answer sheet will be considered for grading. No calculators. 1. Let f (x) = x4 and let g(x) = x−4. Compute f ′′(2)g′′(2). 2. There is a unique positive real number a such that the tangent line to y = x2 + 1 at x = a goes through the origin. Compute a. 3. Moor has $1000, and he is playing a gambling game. He gets to pick a number k between 0 and 1 (inclusive). A fair coin is then ﬂipped. If the coin comes up heads, Moor is given 5000k additional dollars. Otherwise, Moor loses 1000k dollars. Moor’s happiness is equal to the log of the amount of money that he has after this gambling game. Find the value of k that Moor should select to maximize his expected happiness. 4. The set of points (x, y) in the plane satisfying x2/5 + |y| = 1 form a curve enclosing a region. Compute the area of this region. 5. Compute the improper integral ∫ 2 0 (√ 4 − x x − √ x 4 − x ) dx. 6. Compute lim x→∞ [x − x2 ln ( 1 + x x )] . 7. For a given x > 0, let an be the sequence deﬁned by a1 = x for n = 1 and an = xan−1 for n ≥ 2. Find the largest x for which the limit lim n→∞ an converges. 8. Evaluate ∫ 2 −2 1 + x2 1 + 2x dx. 9. Let f satisfy x = f (x)ef (x). Calculate ∫ e 0 f (x) dx. 10. Given that ∑∞ n=1 1 n2 = π2 6 , compute the sum ∞∑ n=1 1 2nn2 .","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
