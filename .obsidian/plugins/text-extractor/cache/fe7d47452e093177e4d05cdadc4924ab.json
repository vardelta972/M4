In this note, I will try to unite these problems to a more general statement. We will start with a very fundamental theorem about quadratic residues and although we won’t need it in this note, the key idea of its proof can be adapted to many problems and we will make use of it throughout this article. Theorem 1. Let p be an odd prime number, k a positive integer and a any integer not divisible by p. Then a is a quadratic residue modulo pk if and only if a is a quadratic residue modulo p. Proof. The “only if ”-part is trivial, so we will only prove the “if ”-part. The proof goes by induction on k: Suppose that a is a quadratic residue modulo pk. We will show that it is a quadratic residue modulo pk+1. By the induction hypothesis, there exists an integer x so that x 2 ≡ a (mod pk), so there exists an integer l so that x 2 = a + lpk. Clearly p ∤ x. Take x ′ = x + y · pk for some integer y. We shall prove that there exists an integer y so that x ′2 ≡ a (mod pk+1). We have x ′2 = (x + ypk)2 = x 2 + 2xypk + y2p2k = a + lpk + 2xypk + y2p2k ≡ a + lpk + 2xypk (mod pk+1) so it remains to be proven that there exists an integer y so that lpk + 2xypk ≡ 0 (mod pk+1) ⇔ l + 2xy ≡ 0 (mod p). But this congruence is solvable in y since it is a linear congruence in y and gcd(2x, p) = 1. Problem 1 (Brazil 2005). Given positive integers a, b and c, prove that there exists a positive integer x such that a x + x ≡ b (mod c). A special case of this problem appeared on the IMO Shortlist of 2006: Problem 2 (IMO Shortlist 2006). For all positive integers n, show that there exists a positive integer m such that n divides 2m + m. A similar problem was given at the USA Team Selection Test in 2007: Problem 3 (USA 2007). Determine whether or not there exist positive integers a and b such that a does not divide b n − n for all positive integers n. All these problems can be generalized to the following statement: Theorem 2. Let A, a, B be integers and let M be a positive integer. Then there exists a positive integer x for every integer C so that Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod M) if and only if gcd(B, M) = 1. Note that another wording of this statement would be: {Aa x + Bx mod m | x ∈ Z +} = {0, . . . , M − 1} if and only if gcd(B, M) = 1. The “only if ”-part is easy: suppose that p is a common prime divisor of B and M. If p | Aa take C = 1, otherwise take C = 0. We see that Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod p) cannot be fulﬁlled this way. I will give two proofs of the “if ”-part: Proof 1. Suppose that gcd(B, M) = 1. Let C be any integer and let M = mn (m, n ∈ Z +) so that every prime divisor of n divides a and gcd(m, a) = gcd(m, n) = 1 (that is, if a = qα1 1 . . . qαs s · a ′ and M = qβ1 1 . . . qβs s · m with qi ∤ a ′ and qi ∤ m, take n = qβ1 1 . . . qβs s ). Then n | a x for suﬃciently large x. We have Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod M) if and only if Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod m) and Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod n). Since gcd(B, n) = 1, there exists a positive integer B′ so that BB′ ≡ 1 (mod n). We see that any suﬃciently large x with x ≡ B′C (mod n) satisﬁes Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod n). (1) Let x = yn + B′C. We shall prove that there exists a suﬃciently large integer y so that Aa x + Bx ≡ C (mod m). (2) 2 This is equivalent to Aa yn+B′C + B(yn + B′C) ≡ C (mod m) ⇔ (Aa B′C)a ny + (Bn)y + (BB′C − C) ≡ 0 (mod m) ⇔ c · e y + by + t ≡ 0 (mod m) where c = (Aa B′C), e = a n, b = Bn, t = BB′C − C. We clearly have gcd(e, m) = gcd(b, m) = 1. Let f (y) = ce y + by + t. We will now work with induction on m. For m = 1, there is nothing left to prove. Suppose that m > 1 and assume that the statement is true for every m ′ < m. Let p be the largest prime divisor of m and let m = pkpk1 1 . . . pkr r be the prime factorization of m. Let m ′ = pk−1pk1 1 . . . pkr r . By the induction hypothesis, there exists a positive integer y so that f (y) ≡ 0 (mod m ′), thus there exists an integer l so that f (y) = lm ′. Take y′ = y + z · (p − 1)pk−1 r∏ i=1(pi − 1)pki for some positive integer z. We shall prove that there exists a z so that f (y′) ≡ 0 (mod m). We have f (y′) = ce y+z·(p−1)pk−1 Qr i=1(pi−1)pki i + b(y + z · (p − 1)pk−1 r∏ i=1(pi − 1)pki i ) + t = ce y · e z·(p−1)pk−1 Qr i=1(pi−1)pki i | and this congruence is solveable since it is a linear congruence in z and gcd(b(p − 1) r∏ i=1(pi − 1), p) = 1, so the induction step is complete. We have proved now that there exists a positive integer y so that f (y) ≡ 0 (mod m), so there exists an x so that (2) is satisﬁed. We still have to prove that we can choose y suﬃciently large so that (1) is satisﬁed. But this is evidential since if y is a solution of f (y) ≡ 0 (mod m), then so is y + λ · mϕ(m) for every λ ∈ Z +. This completes our proof.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
