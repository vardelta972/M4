The most common ﬁrst attempt is with some constants (eg. 0 or 1), after that (if possible) some expressions which will make some part of the equation to become constant. For example if f (x + y) appears in the equations and if we have found f (0) then we plug y = −x. Substitutions become less obvious as the difﬁculty of the problems increase. • Mathematical induction. This method relies on using the value f (1) to ﬁnd all f (n) for n integer. After that we ﬁnd f ( 1 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com • Analyzing the set of values for which the function is equal to the assumed solution. The goal is to prove that the described set is precisely the domain of the function. • Substituting the function. This method is often used to simplify the given equation and is seldom of crucial importance. • Expressing functions as sums of odd and even. Namely each function can be represented as a sum of one even and one odd function and this can be very handy in treating ”linear” functional equations involving many functions. • Treating numbers in a system with basis different than 10. Of course, this can be used only if the domain is N. • For the end let us emphasize that it is very important to guess the solution at the beginning. This can help a lot in ﬁnding the appropriate substitutions. Also, at the end of the solution, DON'T FORGET to verify that your solution satisﬁes the given condition. 2 Cauchy Equation and Equations of the Cauchy type The equation f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) is called the Cauchy equation. If its domain is Q, it is well- known that the solution is given by f (x) = x f (1). That fact is easy to prove using mathematical induction. The next problem is simply the extention of the domain from Q to R. With a relatively easy counter-example we can show that the solution to the Cauchy equation in this case doesn't have to be f (x) = x f (1). However there are many additional assumptions that forces the general solution to be of the described form. Namely if a function f satisﬁes any of the conditions: • monotonicity on some interval of the real line; • continuity; • boundedness on some interval; • positivity on the ray x ≥ 0; then the general solution to the Cauchy equation f : R → S has to be f (x) = x f (1). The following equations can be easily reduced to the Cauchy equation. • All continuous functions f : R → (0, +∞) satisfying f (x + y) = f (x) f (y) are of the form f (x) = ax. Namely the function g(x) = log f (x) is continuous and satisﬁes the Cauchy equa- tion. • All continuous functions f : (0, +∞) → R satisfying f (xy) = f (x) + f (y) are of the form f (x) = loga x. Now the function g(x) = f (ax) is continuous and satisﬁes the Cauchy equation. • All continuous functions f : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) satisfying f (xy) = f (x) f (y) are f (x) = xt , where t = loga b and f (a) = b. Indeed the function g(x) = log f (ax) is continuous and satisﬁes the Cauchy equation. 3 Problems with Solutions The following examples should illustrate the previously outlined methods. Problem 1. Find all functions f : Q → Q such that f (1) = 2 and f (xy) = f (x) f (y) − f (x + y) + 1. Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 3 Solution. This is a classical example of a problem that can be solved using mathematical induction. Notice that if we set x = 1 and y = n in the original equation we get f (n + 1) = f (n) + 1, and since f (1) = 2 we have f (n) = n + 1 for every natural number n. Similarly for x = 0 and y = n we get f (0)n = f (n) − 1 = n, i.e. f (0). Now our goal is to ﬁnd f (z) for each z ∈ Z. Substituting x = −1 and y = 1 in the original equation gives us f (−1) = 0, and setting x = −1 and y = n gives f (−n) = − f (n − 1) + 1 = −n + 1. Hence f (z) = z + 1 for each z ∈ Z. Now we have to determine f ( 1 4 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Solution. Setting m = 1 and n ﬁrst, and m = n, n = 1 afterwards we get f ( f (1) + f (n)) = f ( f (1)) + f (n), f ( f (n) + f (1)) = f ( f (n)) + f (1). Let us emphasize that this is one standard idea if the expression on one side is symmetric with respect to the variables while the expression on the other side is not. Now we have f ( f (n)) = f (n) − f (1) + f ( f (1)) = f (n) − 2 + f (2) = f (n) + 2. From here we conclude that f (n) = m implies f (m) = m + 2 and now the induction gives f (m + 2k) = m + 2k + 2, for every k ≥ 0. Specially if f (1) = 2 then f (2n) = 2n + 2 for all positive integers n. The injectivity of f gives that at odd numbers (except 1) the function has to take odd values. Let p be the smallest natural number such that for some k f (k) = 2p + 1. We have f (2p + 2s + 1) = 2p + 2s + 3 for s ≥ 0. Therefore the numbers 3, 5, . . . , 2p − 1 are mapped into 1, 3, . . . , 2p + 1. If f (t) = 1 for some t, then for m = n = t 4 = f (2) = f ( f (t) + f (t)) = f ( f (t)) + f (t) = 3, which is a contradiction. If for some t such that f (t) = 3 then f (3 + 2k) = 5 + 2k, which is a contradiction to the existence of such t. It follows that the numbers 3, 5, . . . , 2p − 1 are mapped into 5, 7, . . . , 2p + 1. Hence f (3 + 2k) = 5 + 2k. Thus the solution is f (1) = 2 and f (n) = n + 2, for n ≥ 2. It is easy to verify that the function satisﬁes the given conditions. △ Problem 5. (BMO 1997, 2000) Solve the functional equation f (x f (x) + f (y)) = y + f (x) 2, x, y ∈ R. Solution. In probelms of this type it is usually easy to prove that the functions are injective or surjective, if the functions are injective/surjective. In this case for x = 0 we get f ( f (y)) = y + f (0) 2. Since the function on the right-hand side is surjective the same must hold for the function on the left-hand side. This implies the surjectivity of f . Injectivity is also easy to establish. Now there exists t such that f (t) = 0 and substitution x = 0 and y = t yields f (0) = t + f (0)2. For x = t we get f ( f (y)) = y. Therefore t = f ( f (t)) = f (0) = t + f (0)2, i.e. f (0) = 0. Replacing x with f (x) gives f ( f (x)x + f (y)) = x2 + y, hence f (x)2 = x2 for every real number x. Consider now the two cases: First case f (1) = 1. Plugging x = 1 gives f (1 + f (y)) = 1 + y, and after taking squares (1 + y)2 = f (1 + f (y))2 = (1 + f (y))2 = 1 + 2 f (y) + f (y)2 = 1 + 2 f (y) + y2. Clearly in this case we have f (y) = y for every real y. Second case f (1) = −1. Plugging x = −1 gives f (−1 + f (y)) = 1 + y, and after taking squares (1 + y) 2 = f (−1 + f (y)) 2 = (−1 + f (y)) 2 = 1 − 2 f (y) + f (y) 2 = 1 − 2 f (y) + y2. Now we conclude f (y) = −y for every real number y. It is easy to verify that f (x) = x and f (x) = −x are indeed the solutions. △ Problem 6. (IMO 1979, shortlist) Given a function f : R → R, if for every two real numbers x and y the equality f (xy + x + y) = f (xy) + f (x) + f (y) holds, prove that f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) for every two real numbers x and y. Solution. This is a clasical example of the equation that solution is based on a careful choice of values that are plugged in a functional equation. Plugging in x = y = 0 we get f (0) = 0. Plugging in y = −1 we get f (x) = − f (−x). Plugging in y = 1 we get f (2x + 1) = 2 f (x) + f (1) and hence f (2(u + v+ uv)+ 1) = 2 f (u + v+ uv)+ f (1) = 2 f (uv)+ 2 f (u)+ 2 f (v)+ f (1) for all real u and v. On the other hand, plugging in x = u and y = 2v+1 we get f (2(u+v+uv)+1) = f (u+(2v+1)+u(2v+ 1)) = f (u) + 2 f (v) + f (1) + f (2uv + u). Hence it follows that 2 f (uv) + 2 f (u) + 2 f (v) + f (1) = f (u) + 2 f (v) + f (1) + f (2uv + u), i.e., f (2uv + u) = 2 f (uv) + f (u). (1) Plugging in v = −1/2 we get 0 = 2 f (−u/2)+ f (u) = −2 f (u/2)+ f (u). Hence, f (u) = 2 f (u/2) and consequently f (2x) = 2 f (x) for all reals. Now (1) reduces to f (2uv + u) = f (2uv) + f (u). Plugging in u = y and x = 2uv, we obtain f (x) + f (y) = f (x + y) for all nonzero reals x and y. Since f (0) = 0, it trivially holds that f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) when one of x and y is 0. △ Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 5 Problem 7. Does there exist a function f : R → R such that f ( f (x)) = x2 − 2 for every real number x? Solution. After some attempts we can see that none of the ﬁrst three methods leads to a progress. Notice that the function g of the right-hand side has exactly 2 ﬁxed points and that the function g ◦ g has exactly 4 ﬁxed points. Now we will prove that there is no function f such that f ◦ f = g. Assume the contrary. Let a, b be the ﬁxed points of g, and a, b, c, d the ﬁxed points of g ◦ g. Assume that g(c) = y. Then c = g(g(c)) = g(y), hence g(g(y)) = g(c) = y and y has to be on of the ﬁxed points of g ◦ g. If y = a then from a = g(a) = g(y) = c we get a contradiction. Similarly y ̸= b, and since y ̸= c we get y = d. Thus g(c) = d and g(d) = c. Furthermore we have g( f (x)) = f ( f ( f (x))) = f (g(x)). Let x0 ∈ {a, b}. We immediately have f (x0) = f (g(x0)) = g( f (x0)), hence f (x0) ∈ {a, b}. Similarly if x1 ∈ {a, b, c, d} we get f (x1) ∈ {a, b, c, d}, and now we will prove that this is not possible. Take ﬁrst f (c) = a. Then f (a) = f ( f (c)) = g(c) = d which is clearly impossible. Similarly f (c) ̸= b and f (c) ̸= c (for otherwise g(c) = c) hence f (c) = d. However we then have f (d) = f ( f (c)) = g(c) = d, which is a contradiction, again. This proves that the required f doesn't exist. △ Problem 8. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ such that f (x) f (y f (x)) = f (x+ y) for every two positive real numbers x, y. Solution. Obviously f (x) ≡ 1 is one solution to the problem. The idea is to ﬁnd y such that y f (x) = x + y and use this to determine f (x). For every x such that x 6 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Now we prove the existence of α such that g(α) = 0. If f (0) = 0 then putting y = 0 in the given equation we obtain f (x + g(0)) = g(x), so we can take α = −g(0). Now assume that f (0) = b ̸= 0. By replacing x by g(x) in the given equation we obtain f (g(x) + g(y)) = g(x) f (y) − y f (g(x)) + g(g(x)) and, analogously, f (g(x) + g(y)) = g(y) f (x) − x f (g(y)) + g(g(y)). The given functional equation for x = 0 gives f (g(y)) = a − by, where a = g(0). In partic- ular, g is injective and f is surjective, so there exists c ∈ R such that f (c) = 0. Now the above two relations yield g(x) f (y) − ay + g(g(x)) = g(y) f (x) − ax + g(g(y)). (1) Plugging y = c in (1) we get g(g(x)) = g(c) f (x) − ax + g(g(c)) + ac = k f (x) − ax + d. Now (1) becomes g(x) f (y) + k f (x) = g(y) f (x) + k f (y). For y = 0 we have g(x)b + k f (x) = a f (x) + kb, whence g(x) = a − k Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 7 Solution. Our ﬁrst goal is to express f and g using h and get the equation involving h only. First taking y = x and substituting g(0) = a we get f (2x) = 4h(x) − a. Furthermore by putting y = 0 we get g(x) = 2h(x) + 2b − 4h(x 8 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 1.1◦ If f (1) = 0, then from (5) plugging y + 1 instead of y we get f (y) = f (−y). Setting −y instead of y in the initial equality gives f (xy) = f (x) f (y)− f (x− y)+ 1, hence f (x+ y) = f (x − y), for every two rational numbers x and y. Specially for x = y we get f (2x) = f (0) = 1, for all x ∈ Q. However this is a contradiction with f (1) = 0. In this case we don't have a solution. 1.2◦ If f (1) = 2, setting y + 1 instead of y in (5) gives 1 − f (y) = f (−y) − 1. It is clear that we should do the substitution g(x) = 1 − f (x) because the previous equality gives g(−x) = −g(x), i.e. g is odd. Furthermore substituting g into the original equality gives g(xy) = g(x) + g(y) − g(x)g(y) − g(x + y). (6) Setting −y instead of y we get −g(xy) = g(x) − g(y) + g(x)g(y) − g(x − y), and adding with (6) yields g(x+ y)+ g(x− y) = 2g(x). For x = y we have g(2x) = 2g(x) therefore we get g(x + y) + g(x − y) = g(2x). This is a the Cauchy equation and since the domain is Q we get g(x) = rx for some rational number r. Plugging this back to (6) we obtain r = −1, and easy veriﬁcation shows that f (x) = 1 + x satisﬁes the conditions of the problem. 2◦ Let f (1) = 1. Setting z = 1 in (4) we get f (xy + 1) − f (x) f (y + 1) + f (x) = 1, hence for y = −1 we get f (1 − x) = 1, for every rational x. This means that f (x) ≡ 1 and this function satisﬁes the given equation. Now let us solve the problem where f : R → R. Notice that we haven't used that the range is Q, hence we conclude that for all rational numbers q f (q) = q + 1, or f (q) ≡ 1. If f (q) = 1 for all rational numbers q, it can be easily shown that f (x) ≡ 1. Assume that f (q) ̸≡ 1. From the above we have that g(x) + g(y) = g(x + y), hence it is enough to prove monotonicity. Substitute x = y in (6) and use g(2x) = 2g(x) to get g(x2) = −g(x) 2. Therefore for every positive r the value g(r) is non-positive. Hence if y > x, i.e. y = x + r2 we have g(y) = g(x) + g(r2) ≤ g(x), and the function is decreasing. This means that f (x) = 1 + αx and after some calculation we get f (x) = 1 + x. It is easy to verify that so obtained functions satisfy the given functional equation. △ Problem 14. (IMO 2003, shortlist) Let R+ denote the set of positive real numbers. Find all functions f : R+ → R+ that satisfy the following conditions: (i) f (xyz) + f (x) + f (y) + f (z) = f ( √ Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 9 Problem 15. Find all functions f : [1, ∞) → [1, ∞) that satisfy: (i) f (x) ≤ 2(1 + x) for every x ∈ [1, ∞); (ii) x f (x + 1) = f (x)2 − 1 for every x ∈ [1, ∞). Solution. It is not hard to see that f (x) = x + 1 is a solution. Let us prove that this is the only solution. Using the given conditions we get f (x) 2 = x f (x + 1) + 1 ≤ x(2(x + 1)) + 1 < 2(1 + x) 2, i.e. f (x) ≤ √ 10 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Problem 17. Given an integer n, let f : R → R be a continuous function satisfying f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1, and f (n)(x) = x, for every x ∈ [0, 1]. Prove that f (x) = x for each x ∈ [0, 1]. Solution. First from f (x) = f (y) we have f (n)(x) = f (n)(y), hence f is injective. The idea for what follows is clear once we look at the graphical representation. Namely from the picture it can be easily deduced that the function has to be strictly increasing. Let us prove that formally. Assume the contrary, that for some two real numbers x1 < x2 we have f (x1) ≥ f (x2). The continuity on [0, x1] implies that there is some c such that f (c) = f (x2), which contradicts the injectivity of f . Now if x < f (x), we get f (x) < f ( f (x)) etc. x < f (n)(x) = x. Similarly we get a contradiction if we assume that x > f (x). Hence for each x ∈ [0, 1] we must have f (x) = x. △ Problem 18. Find all functions f : (0, +∞) → (0, +∞) that satisfy f ( f (x) + y) = x f (1 + xy) for all x, y ∈ (0, +∞). Solution. Clearly f (x) = 1 Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 11 and adding similar realitions for all described k yields f (x) − f (x + 1) ≥ 1 12 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com If f (2) = 1/2 then f ( 2003 Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 13 can't be a member of Sd′. However this is a contradiction with the previously established properties of the sets Sd and Sd′. Similarly if d′ > d switching the roles of d and d′ gives a contradiction. Simple veriﬁcation shows that each f (x) = x + d satisﬁes the given functional equation. △ Problem 24. Find all functions h : N → N that satisfy h(h(n)) + h(n + 1) = n + 2. Solution. Notice that we have both h(h(n)) and h(n + 1), hence it is not possible to form a recurrent equation. We have to use another approach to this problem. Let us ﬁrst calculate h(1) and h(2). Setting n = 1 gives h(h(1)) + h(2) = 3, therefore h(h(1)) ≤ 2 and h(2) ≤ 2. Let us consider the two cases: 1◦ h(2) = 1. Then h(h(1)) = 2. Plugging n = 2 in the given equality gives 4 = h(h(2)) + h(3) = h(1) + h(3). Let h(1) = k. It is clear that k ̸= 1 and k ̸= 2, and that k ≤ 3. This means that k = 3, hence h(3) = 1. However from 2 = h(h(1)) = h(3) = 1 we get a contradiction. This means that there are no solutions in this case. 2◦ h(2) = 2. Then h(h(1)) = 1. From the equation for n = 2 we get h(3) = 2. Setting n = 3, 4, 5 we get h(4) = 3, h(5) = 4, h(6) = 4, and by induction we easily prove that h(n) ≥ 2, for n ≥ 2. This means that h(1) = 1. Clearly there is at most one function satisfying the given equality. Hence it is enough to guess some function and prove that it indeed solves the equation (induction or something similar sounds ﬁne). The solution is h(n) = ⌊nα⌋ + 1, where α = −1 + √ 14 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Consider any x, y with y > x ≥ 2√ Marko Radovanovi´c: Functional Equations 15 10.
