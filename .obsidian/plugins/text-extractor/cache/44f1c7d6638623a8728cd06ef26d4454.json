I edited them very little since. The syllabus of IMO is, of course, unwritten but there are several tendencies which can be clearly observed. It is all ruled by tradition, there is no logic in all this whatsoever. Some topics are included, alhtough they are not in the school curricula for most countries, on the grounds that they are traditional and feature in the training programmes of most countries. What is not Included ● Any questions where knowledge of Calculus may be an advantage, e.g. most of the inequalities; ● Complex numbers (although they were in the past, when less countries participated); ● Inversion in geometry (the Jury just sick and tired of it for some reason); ● Solid geometry was also present in the past. There are coordinated attempts to return it into the IMO but the resistance is strong; ● After being a darling of the Jury for some time, Pell's equation seems to be strongly out of favour. What is included ● Fundamental Theorems on Arithmetic and Algebra, factorization of a polynomial into a product of irreducible polynomials; ● Symmetric polynomials of several variables, Vieta's theorem; ● Linear and quadratic Diophantine equations, including the Pell's equation (although see the comment above); ● Arithmetic of residues modulo n, Fermat's and Euler's theorems; ● Properties of the orthocentre, Euler's line, nine-point-circle, Simson line, Ptolemy's inequality, Ceva and Menelaus etc.; ● Interesting situation is with the graph theory. It is sort of considered to be all known and virtually disappeared from submissions to IMO. But watch this space!. http://matholymp.com/TUTORIALS/syllabus.html (1 of 2)5/7/2005 12:18:43 PM Syllabus of the IMO Click to go back http://matholymp.com/TUTORIALS/syllabus.html (2 of 2)5/7/2005 12:18:43 PM THE REARRANGEMENT INEQUALITY K. Wu South China Normal University, China Andy Liu University of Alberta, Canada We will introduce our subject via an example, taken from a Chinese competition in 1978. “Ten people queue up before a tap to ﬁll their buckets. Each bucket requires a diﬀerent time to ﬁll. In what order should the people queue up so as to minimize their combined waiting time?” Common sense suggests that they queue up in ascending order of “bucket-ﬁlling time”. Let us see if our intuition leads us astray. We will denote by T1 < T2 < · · · < T10 the times required to ﬁll the respective buckets. If the people queue up in the order suggested, their combined waiting time will be given by T = 10T1 + 9T2 + · · · + T10. For a diﬀerent queueing order, the combined waiting time will be S = 10S1 + 9S2 + · · · + S10, where (S1, S2, . . . , S10) is a permutation of (T1, T2, . . . , T10). The two 10-tuples being diﬀerent, there is a smallest index i for which Si ̸= Ti. Then Sj = Ti < Si for some j > i. Deﬁne S′ i = Sj, S′ j = Si and S′ k = Sk for k ̸= i, j. Let S′ = 10S′ 1 + 9S′ 2 + · · · + S′ 10. Then S − S′ = (11 − i)(Si − S′ i) + (11 − j)(Sj − S′ j) = (Si − Sj)(j − i) > 0. Hence the switching results in a lower combined waiting time. If (S′ 1, S′ 2, . . . , S′ 10) ̸= (T1, T2, . . . , T10), this switching process can be repeated again. We will reach (T1, T2, . . . , T10) in at most 9 steps. Since the combined waiting time is reduced in each step, T is indeed the minimum combined waiting time. We can generalize this example to the following result. The Rearrangement Inequality. Let a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an and b1 ≤ b2 ≤ · · · ≤ bn be real numbers. For any permutation (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a ′ n) of (a1, a2, . . . , an), we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ a ′ 1b1 + a ′ 2b2 + · · · + a ′ nbn ≥ anb1 + an−1b2 + · · · + a1bn, with equality if and only if (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a′ n) is equal to (a1, a2, . . . , an) or (an, an−1, . . . , a1) respectively. This can be proved by the switching process used in the introductory example. See for instance [1] or [2], which contain more general results. Note that unlike many inequalities, we do not require the numbers involved to be positive. Corollary 1. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be real numbers and (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a ′ n) be a permutation of (a1, a2, . . . , an). Then a 2 1 + a 2 2 + · · · + a 2 n ≥ a1a ′ 1 + a2a ′ 2 + · · · + ana ′ n. Corollary 2. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive numbers and (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a ′ n) be a permutation of (a1, a2, . . . , an). Then a ′ 1 a1 + a ′ 2 a2 + · · · + a ′ n an ≥ n. A 1935 K¨ursch´ak problem in Hungary asked for the proof of Corollary 2, and a 1940 Moscow Olympiad problem asked for the proof of the special case (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a ′ n) = (a2, a3, . . . , an, a1). We now illustrate the power of the Rearrangement Inequality by giving simple solutions to a number of competition problems. Example 1. (International Mathematical Olympiad, 1975) Let x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn and y1 ≤ y2 ≤ · · · ≤ yn be real numbers. Let (z1, z2, · · · , zn) be a permutation of (y1, y2, . . . , yn). Prove that (x1 − y1) 2 + (x2 − y2) 2 + · · · + (xn − yn)2 ≤ (x1 − z1) 2 + (x2 − z2)2 + · · · + (xn − zn)2. Solution: Note that we have y2 1 + y2 2 + · · · + y2 n = z2 1 + z2 2 + · · · + z2 n. After expansion and simpliﬁcation, the desired inequality is equivalent to x1y1 + x2y2 + · · · + xnyn ≥ x1z1 + x2z2 + · · · + xnzn, which follows from the Rearrangement Inequality. Example 2. (International Mathematical Olympiad, 1978) Let a1, a2, . . . , an be distinct positive integers. Prove that a1 12 + a2 22 + · · · + an n2 ≥ 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n. Solution: Let (a ′ 1, a ′ 2, . . . , a ′ n) be the permutation of (a1, a2, . . . , an) such that a ′ 1 ≤ a ′ 2 ≤ · · · ≤ a ′ n. Then a ′ i ≥ i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By the Rearrangement Inequality, a1 12 + a2 22 + · · · + an n2 ≥ a ′ 1 12 + a ′ 2 22 + · · · + a ′ n n2 ≥ 1 12 + 2 22 + · · · + n n2 ≥ 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n. Example 3. (International Mathematical Olympiad, 1964) Let a, b and c be the sides of a triangle. Prove that a 2(b + c − a) + b 2(c + a − b) + c2(a + b − c) ≤ 3abc. Solution: We may assume that a ≥ b ≥ c. We ﬁrst prove that c(a + b − c) ≥ b(c + a − b) ≥ a(b + c − a). Note that c(a + b − c) − b(c + a − b) = (b − c)(b + c − a) ≥ 0. The second inequality can be proved in the same manner. By the Rearrangement Inequality, we have a2(b + c − a) + b 2(c + a − b) + c2(a + b − c) ≤ ba(b + c − a) + cb(c + a − b) + ac(a + b − c), a2(b + c − a) + b 2(c + a − b) + c2(a + b − c) ≤ ca(b + c − a) + ab(c + a − b) + bc(a + b − c). Adding these two inequalities, the right side simpliﬁes to 6abc. The desired inequality now follows. Example 4. (International Mathematical Olympiad, 1983) Let a, b and c be the sides of a triangle. Prove that a2b(a − b) + b 2c(b − c) + c2a(c − a) ≥ 0. Solution: We may assume that a ≥ b, c. If a ≥ b ≥ c, we have a(b + c − a) ≤ b(c + a − b) ≤ c(a + b − c) as in Example 3. By the Rearrangement Inequality, 1 c a(b + c − a) + 1 ab(c + a − b) + 1 b c(a + b − c) ≤ 1 aa(b + c − a) + 1 b b(c + a − b) + 1 c c(a + b − c) = a + b + c. This simpliﬁes to 1 c a(b − a) + 1 ab(c − b) + 1 b c(a − c) ≤ 0, which is equivalent to the desired inequality. If a ≥ c ≥ b, then a(b + c − a) ≤ c(a + b − c) ≤ b(c + a − b). All we have to do is interchange the second and the third terms of the displayed lines above. Simple as it sounds, the Rearrangement Inequality is a result of fundamental importance. We shall derive from it many familiar and useful inequalities. Example 5. The Arithmetic Mean Geometric Mean Inequality. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive numbers. Then x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ n√ x1x2 · · · xn, with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof: Let G = n√x1x2 · · · xn, a1 = x1 G , a2 = x1x2 G2 , . . . , an = x1x2 · · · xn Gn = 1. By Corollary 2, n ≤ a1 an + a2 a1 + · · · + an an−1 = x1 G + x2 G + · · · + xn G , which is equivalent to x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ G. Equality holds if and only if a1 = a2 = · · · = an, or x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Example 6. The Geometric mean Harmonic Mean Inequality. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive numbers. Then n√x1x2 · · · xn ≥ n 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn , with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof: Let G, a1, a2, . . . , an be as in Example 5. By Corollary 2, n ≤ a1 a2 + a2 a3 + · · · + an a1 = G x1 + G x2 + · · · + G xn , which is equivalent to G ≥ n 1 x1 + 1 x2 + · · · + 1 xn . Equality holds if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Example 7. The Root Mean Square Arithmetic Mean Inequality. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be real numbers. Then √ x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x2 n n ≥ x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n , with equality if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Proof: By Corollary 1, we have x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n ≥ x1x2 + x2x3 + · · · + xnx1, x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n ≥ x1x3 + x2x4 + · · · + xnx2, · · · ≥ · · · x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n ≥ x1xn + x2x1 + · · · + xnxn−1. Adding these and x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n = x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n, we have n(x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 n) ≥ (x1 + x2 + · · · + x 2 n)2, which is equivalent to the desired result. Equality holds if and only if x1 = x2 = · · · = xn. Example 8. Cauchy’s Inequality. Let a1, a2, . . . an, b1, b2, . . . , bn be real numbers. Then (a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn)2 ≤ (a 2 1 + a 2 2 + · · · + a 2 n)(b 2 1 + b 2 2 + · · · + b 2 n), with equality if and only if for some constant k, ai = kbi for 1 ≤ i ≤ n or bi = kai for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Proof: If a1 = a2 = · · · = an = 0 or b1 = b2 = · · · = bn = 0, the result is trivial. Otherwise, deﬁne S = √ a 2 1 + a 2 2 + · · · + a2 n and T = √b 2 1 + b 2 2 + · · · + b2 n. Since both are non-zero, we may let xi = ai S and xn+i = bi T for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. By Corollary 1, 2 = a 2 1 + a 2 2 + · · · + a 2 n S2 + b 2 1 + b 2 2 + · · · + b 2 n T 2 = x 2 1 + x 2 2 + · · · + x 2 2n ≥ x1xn+1 + x2xn+2 + · · · + xnx2n + xn+1x1 + xn+2x2 + · · · + x2nxn = 2(a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn) ST , which is equivalent to the desired result. Equality holds if and only if xi = xn+i for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, or aiT = biS for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. We shall conclude this paper with two more examples whose solutions are left as exercises. Example 9. (Chinese competition, 1984) Prove that x 2 1 x2 + x 2 2 x3 + · · · + x 2 n x1 ≥ x1 + x2 + · · · + xn for all positive numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn. Example 10. (Moscow Olympiad, 1963) Prove that a b + c + b c + a + c a + b ≥ 3 2 for all positive numbers a, b and c. References: 1. G. Hardy, J. Littlewood and G.

Tutorial 1: Permutations As of late, permutations ﬁnd their way into math olympiads more and more often. The latest example is the Balkan Mathematics Olympiad 2001 where the following problem was suggested. A cube of dimensions 3×3×3 is divided into 27 unit cells, each of dimensions 1 × 1 × 1. One of the cells is empty, and all others are ﬁlled with unit cubes which are, at random, labelled 1,2,...,26. A legal move consists of a move of any of the unit cubes to its neighbouring empty cell. Does there exist a ﬁnite sequence of legal moves after which the unit cubes labelled k and 27 − k exchange their positions for all k = 1, 2, ..., 13? (Two cells are said to be neighbours if they share a common face.) This tutorial was written in responce to this event. 1 Deﬁnitions and Notation We assume here that the reader is familiar with the concept of composition of functions f and g, which is denoted here as f ◦ g. It is a well-known fact that if f : A → B is a function which is both one-to-one and onto then f is invertible, i.e. there exists a function g : B → A such that g ◦ f = idA and f ◦ g = idB, where idA and idB are the identity mappings of A and B, respectively. Note that we assume that in the composition f ◦ g the function g acts ﬁrst and f acts second: e.g., (f ◦ g)(b) = f (g(b)). There are, however, many good books using the alternative convention, so it is always necessary to check whether a particular author uses one or the other convention. In what follows we will be concerned with invertible functions from a ﬁnite set to itself. For convenience, we assume that the elements of the set are the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n (the elements of any ﬁnite set can be labelled with the ﬁrst few integers, so this does not restrict generality). Deﬁnition 1. Let n be a positive integer. A permutation of degree n is a function f : {1, 2, . . . , n} → {1, 2, . . . , n} which is one-to-one and onto. 1 Since a function is speciﬁed if we indicate what the image of each element is, we can specify a permutation π by listing each element together with its image as follows: π = ( 1 2 3 · · · · · · n − 1 n π(1) π(2) π(3) · · · · · · π(n − 1) π(n) ) . For example π = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 2 5 3 1 7 6 4 ) is the permutation of degree 7 which maps 1 to 2, 2 to 5, 3 to 3, 4 to 1, 5 to 7, 6 to 6, and 7 to 4. It is clear that in the second row of such an array all the numbers of the top row must appear exactly once, i.e. the second row is just a rearrangement of the top row. It is also clear that there are exactly n! permutations of degree n (if you want to ﬁll the bottom row of such an array, there are n ways to ﬁll the ﬁrst position, n − 1 ways to ﬁll the second position (since we must not repeat the ﬁrst entry), etc., leading to a total of n(n − 1) · . . . · 2 · 1 = n! diﬀerent possibilities). 2 Calculations with Permutations The composition of two permutations of degree n is again a permutation of degree n (exercise: prove that if f : A → A and g : A → A are one-to-one then f ◦ g is one-to-one; prove that if f : A → A and g : A → A are onto then f ◦ g is onto). First of all we practice the use of our symbolism for the calculation of the composition of two permutations. This is best done with a few examples. In the sequel, we omit the symbol for function composition (◦), and speak of the product πσ of two permutations π and σ, meaning the composition π ◦ σ. Example 1. Let π = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 6 1 3 8 5 7 2 ) , σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 5 6 1 8 3 7 ) . Then πσ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 6 1 3 8 5 7 2 ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 5 6 1 8 3 7 ) = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 3 8 5 4 2 1 7 ) , 2 σπ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 5 6 1 8 3 7 ) ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 4 6 1 3 8 5 7 2 ) = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 6 8 2 5 7 1 3 4 ) . Explanation: the calculation of πσ requires us to ﬁnd • the image of 1 when we apply ﬁrst σ, then π, (1 σ 7→ 2 π 7→ 6, so write the 6 under the 1), • the image of 2 when we apply ﬁrst σ, then π, (2 σ 7→ 4 π 7→ 3, so write the 3 under the 2), • etc. The calculation of σπ requires us to ﬁnd • the image of 1 when we apply ﬁrst π, then σ, (1 π 7→ 4 σ 7→ 6, so write the 6 under the 1) • the image of 1 when we apply ﬁrst π, then σ, (2 π → 6 σ → 8, so write the 8 under the 2) • etc. ... All this is easily done at a glance and can be written down immediately; BUT be careful to start with the right hand factor again! Important note 1: the example shows clearly that πσ ̸= σπ; so we have to be very careful about the order of the factors in a product of permutations. Important note 2: But the good news is that the composition of permutations is associative, i.e., (πσ)τ = π(στ ) for all permutations π, σ, τ . To prove this we have to compute: [(πσ)τ ](i) = (πσ)(τ (i)) = π(σ(τ (i))), [π(στ )](i) = π((στ )(i)) = π(σ(τ (i))). We see that the right hand sides are the same in both cases, thus the left hand sides are the same too. We can also calculate the inverse of a permutation; for example, using the same π as above, we ﬁnd π−1 = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 3 8 4 1 6 2 7 5 ) . 3 Explanation: just read the array for π from the bottom up: since π(1) = 4, we must have π−1(4) = 1, hence write 1 under the 4 in the array for π−1, since π(2) = 6, we must have π−1(6) = 2, hence write 2 under the 6 in the array for π−1, etc. Similarly, we calculate σ−1 = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 5 1 7 2 3 4 8 6 ) . Simple algebra shows that the inverse of a product can be calculated from the product of the inverses (but note how the order is reversed!): (πσ) −1 = σ−1π−1. (To justify this, we need only check if the product of πσ and σ−1π−1 equals the identity, and this is pure algebra: it follows from the associative law that (πσ)(σ−1π−1) = ((πσ)σ−1)π−1 = π(σσ−1)π−1 = ππ−1 = id.) Deﬁnition 2. The set of all permutations of degree n, with the composi- tion as the multiplication, is called the symmetric group of degree n, and is denoted by Sn. 3 Cycles A permutation π ∈ Sn which “cyclically permutes” some of the numbers 1, . . . , n (and leaves all others ﬁxed) is called a cycle. For example, the permutation π = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 5 3 7 4 6 2 ) is a cycle, because we have 5 π → 4 π → 7 π → 2 π → 5, and each of the other elements of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} stays unchanged, namely 3 π → 3, 6 π → 6. To see that, we must of course chase an element around, the nice cyclic structure is not immediately evident from our notation. We write π = (5 4 7 2), meaning that all numbers not on the list are mapped to themselves, whilst the ones in the bracket are mapped to the one listed to the right, the rightmost one going back to the leftmost on the list. Note: cycle notation is not unique, since there is no beginning or end to a circle. We can write π = (5 4 7 2) and π = (2 5 4 7), as well as π = (4 7 2 5) and π = (7 2 5 4)—they all denote one and the same cycle. We say that a cycle is of length k (or a k-cycle) if it involves k numbers. For example, (3 6 4 9 2) is a 5-cycle, (3 6) is a 2-cycle, (1 3 2) is a 3- cycle. We note also that the inverse of a cycle is again a cycle. For example 4 (1 2 3) −1 = (1 3 2) (or (3 2 1) if you prefer this). Similarly, (1 2 3 4 5) −1 = (1 5 4 3 2). Finding the inverse of a cycle one has to reverse the arrows. Not all permutations are cycles; for example, the permutation σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4 3 2 11 8 9 5 6 7 10 1 12 ) is not a cycle (we have 1 σ 7→ 4 σ 7→ 11 σ 7→ 1, but the other elements are not all ﬁxed (2 goes to 3, for example). However, this permutation σ —and any other permutation — can be written as a product of disjoint cycles, simply by chasing each of the elements. The obvious approach is to visualise what the permutation σ does: (draw your picture here!) From this it is evident that every permutation can be written as a prod- uct of disjoint cycles. Moreover, any such representation is unique up to the order of the factors. We also note that disjoint cycles commute; e.g. (1 2 3 4)(5 6 7) = (5 6 7)(1 2 3 4). But we recall that in general multiplication of permutations is not com- mutative; in particular, if we multiply cycles which are not disjoint, we have to watch their order; for example: (1 2)(1 3) = (1 3 2), whilst (1 3)(1 2) = (1 2 3), and (1 3 2) ̸= (1 2 3). It is clear that if τ is a cycle of length k, then τ k = id, i.e. if this permutation is repeated k times, we have the identity permutation. More generally, we will now deﬁne the order of a permutation, and the decompo- sition into a product of disjoint cycles will allow us to calculate the order of any permutation. Deﬁnition 3. Let π be a permutation. The smallest positive integer i such that πi = id is called the order of π. Example 2. The order of the cycle (3 2 6 4 1) is 5, as we noted before. Example 3. The order of the permutation π = (1 2)(3 4 5) is 2 · 3 = 6. 5 Indeed, π = (1 2)(3 4 5), π2 = (1 2) 2(3 4 5) 2 = (3 5 4), π3 = (1 2) 3(3 4 5) 3 = (1 2), π4 = (1 2) 4(3 4 5) 4 = (3 4 5), π5 = (1 2) 5(3 4 5) 5 = (1 2)(3 5 4), π6 = id. Example 4. The order of the cycle (3 2 6 4 1) is 5, as we noted before. Example 5. The order of the permutation ϕ = (1 2)(3 4 5 6) is 4. Indeed, ϕ = (1 2)(3 4 5 6), ϕ 2 = (1 2) 2(3 4 5 6) 2 = (3 5)(4 6), ϕ 3 = (1 2) 3(3 4 5 6) 3 = (1 2)(3 6 5 4), ϕ 4 = id. This suggests that the order of a product of disjoint cycles equals the lcm of the lengths of these cycles. This can be formalised in the following Theorem 1. Let σ be a permutation and σ = τ1τ2 · · · τr be the decompo- sition of σ into a product of disjoint cycles. Let k be the order of σ and k1, k2, . . . , kr be the orders (lengths) of τ1, τ2, . . . , τr, respectively. Then k = lcm (k1, k2, . . . , kr). Proof. We ﬁrst notice that τ m i = id iﬀ m is a multiple of ki. Then, since the cycles τi are disjoint, we know that they commute and hence σm = τ m 1 τ m 2 . . . τ m r . The powers τ m 1 , τ m 2 , . . . , τ m r act on disjoint sets of indices and, if σm = id, it must be τ m 1 = τ m 2 = . . . = τ m r = id. Indeed, if say τ m s (i) = j with i ̸= j, then the product τ m 1 τ m 2 . . . τ m r cannot be equal to id because all permutations τ m 1 , . . . , τ m s−1, τ m s+1, . . . , τ m r leave i and j invariant. Thus the order of σ is a multiple of each of the k1, k2, . . . , kr and hence the multiple of the least common multiple of them. On the other hand, it is clear that σlcm (k1,k2,...,kr) = id, which proves the theorem. Example 6. The order of σ = (1 2 3 4)(5 6 7)(8 9)(10 11 12)(13 14 15 16 17) is 60. 6 Example 7. To determine the order of an arbitrary permutation, ﬁrst write it as product of disjoint cycles. For example, σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 4 3 2 11 8 9 5 6 7 10 1 12 ) = (1 4 11)(2 3)(5 8 6 9 7) and therefore the order of σ is 30. 4 Transpositions. Even and Odd Cycles of length 2 are the simplest permutations, as they involve only 2 objects. We deﬁne Deﬁnition 4. A cycle of length 2 is called a transposition. It is intuitively plausible that any permutation is a product of trans- positions (every arrangement of n objects can be obtained from a given starting position by making a sequence of swaps). Once we observe how a cycle of arbitrary length can be expressed as a product of transpositions, we can express any permutation as product of transpositions. Here are some examples: Example 8. (1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5)(1 4)(1 3)(1 2) (just check that the left hand side equals the right hand side!). Exactly in the same way we can express an arbitrary cycle as a product of transpositions: (i1 i2 . . . ir) = (i1 ir) . . . (i1 i3)(i1 i2). (1) Example 9. To express any permutation σ as product of transpositions, ﬁrst decompose σ into a product of disjoint cycles, then write each cycle as product of transpositions as shown above. For example, ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 4 3 2 11 8 9 5 6 7 10 1 ) = (1 4 11)(2 3)(5 8 6 9 7) = (1 11)(1 4)(2 3)(5 7)(5 9)(5 6)(5 8). Example 10. Note that there are many diﬀerent ways to write a permutation as product of transpositions; for example (1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5)(1 4)(1 3)(1 2) = (3 2)(3 1)(3 5)(3 4) = (3 2)(3 1)(2 1)(2 3)(1 3)(2 3)(3 5)(3 4). 7 (Don’t ask how these products were found! The point is to check that all these products are equal, and to note that there is nothing unique about how one can write a permutation as product of transpositions.) Deﬁnition 5. A permutation is called even if it can be written as a product of an even number of transpositions. A permutation is called odd if it can be written as a product of an odd number of transpositions. An important point is that there is no permutation that is at the same time even and odd—this justiﬁes the use of the terminology. 1 We will es- tablish that by looking at the polynomial f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = ∏ i<j(xi − xj). (2) Example 11. For n = 3, the polynomial (2) will look like f (x1, x2, x3) = (x1 − x2)(x1 − x3)(x2 − x3). If σ = (1 3), we may compute f (xσ(1), xσ(2), xσ(3)) = (x3 − x2)(x3 − x1)(x2 − x1) = −f (x1, x2, x3). This leads us to Proposition 2. For any permutation σ from Sn f (xσ(1), xσ(2), . . . , xσ(n)) = ±f (x1, x2, . . . , xn). (3) Proof. In the left-hand-side of (3), for any pair of indices i and j, we have either xi−xj or xj −xi (but not both) wil be a factor. Thus the left-hand-side can diﬀer from the right-hand-side by its sign only. This proves (3). We will write sign(σ) = 1, if we have ”+” in (3) and sign(σ) = −1 oth- erwise. We notice that sign(στ ) = sign(σ)sign(τ ). (4) Indeed, f (xστ (1), xστ (2), . . . , xστ (n)) = sign(σ)f (xτ (1), xτ (2), . . . , xτ (n)) = sign(σ)sign(τ )f (x1, x2, . . . , xn), 1You may skip this proof for the ﬁrst reading and go straight to Example 12. 8 which shows that sign(στ ) =sign(σ)sign(τ ) holds. It is clear that for π = (i i+1) we have f (xπ(1), xπ(2), . . . , xπ(n)) = −f (x1, x2, . . . , xn) (5) (only one factor changes its sign), hence sign((i i+1)) = −1. Since (i k+1) = (k k+1)(i k)(k k+1), and due to (4), we see that sign((i k)) = −1 implies sign((i k+1)) = −1. This means that by induction (5) can be extended to an arbitrary transposi- tion π. Hence (5) will be true for any odd permutation π, i.e sign(π) = −1. At the same time, it is clear that for every even permutation π we will have sign(π) = +1. This implies that there is no permutation which is both even and odd. Example 12. (1 2 3 4) is an odd permutation, because (1 2 3 4) = (1 4)(1 3)(1 2). (1 2 3 4 5) is an even permutation, because (1 2 3 4 5) = (1 5)(1 4)(1 3)(1 2). Example 13. Since id = (1 2)(1 2), the identity is even. Theorem 3. A k-cycle is even if k is odd; a k-cycle is odd if k is even. Proof. Immediately follows from (1). Example 14. Let π = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 4 3 2 5 1 6 9 8 7 ) . Is π even or odd? First decompose π into a product of cycles, then use the result above: π = (1 4 5)(2 3)(7 9) (= (1 5)(1 4)(2 3)(7 9)). We have an even number (two) of odd cycles, it shows that π is even. Deﬁnition 6. We say that two permutations have the same parity, if they are both odd or both even, and diﬀerent parities, if one of them is odd and another is even. Theorem 4. In any symmetric grooup Sn 1. The product of two even permutations is even. 2. The product of two odd permutations is even. 3. The product of an even permutation and an odd one is odd. 4. A permutation and its inverse are of the same parities. 9 Proof. Only the statements 4 needs a comment. It follows from 1 and 2. Indeed, since the identity permutation id is even, we cannot have a permu- tation and its inverse being of diﬀerent parities. Theorem 5. Exactly half of the elements of Sn are even and half of them are odd. Proof. Denote by E the set of even permutations in Sn, and by O the set of odd permutations in Sn. If τ is any ﬁxed transposition from Sn, we can establish a one-to-one correspondence between E and O as follows: for π in E we know that τ π belongs to O. Therefore we have a mapping f : E → O deﬁned by f (π) = τ π. f is one-to-one since τ π = τ σ implies that π = σ; f is onto, because if κ is an odd permutation then τ κ is even, and f (τ κ) = τ τ κ = κ. Corollary 6. The number of even permutations in Sn is n! 2 . The number of odd permutations in Sn is also n! 2 . Deﬁnition 7. The set of all even permutations of degree n is called the alternating group of degree n. It is denoted by An. Example 15. We can have a look at the elements of S4, listing all of them, and checking which of them are even, which of them are odd. S4 = {id, (1 2 3), (1 3 2), (1 2 4), (1 4 2), (2 3 4), (2 4 3), (1 3 4), (1 4 3), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3), (1 2), (1 3), (1 4), (2 3), (2 4), (3 4), (1 2 3 4), (1 4 3 2), (1 3 2 4), (1 4 2 3), (1 2 4 3), (1 3 4 2)} The elements in the ﬁrst 2 lines are even permutations, and the remaining elements are odd. We have A4 = {id, (1 2 3), (1 3 2), (1 2 4), (1 4 2), (2 3 4), (2 4 3), (1 3 4), (1 4 3), (1 2)(3 4), (1 3)(2 4), (1 4)(2 3)}. 5 The interlacing shuﬄe. Puzzle 15 In this section we consider two applications of permutations. 10 We have a deck of 2n cards (normally 52), we split it into 2 halves and then interlace them as follows. Suppose that our cards were numbered from 1 to 2n and the original order of cards was a1a2a3 . . . a2n−1a2n Then the two halves will contain the cards a1, a2, . . . , an and an+1an+2, . . . , a2n, respectively. The interlacing shuﬄe will put the ﬁrst card of the second pile ﬁrst, then the ﬁrst card of the ﬁrst pile, then the second card of the second pile, then the second card of the ﬁrst pile etc. After the shuﬄe the order of cards will be: an+1a1an+2a2 . . . a2nan We put the permutation σ = ( 1 2 3 . . . n n + 1 n + 2 . . . 2n 2 4 6 . . . 2n 1 3 . . . 2n − 1 ) in correspondence to this shuﬄe. We see that σ(i) = 2i mod 2n + 1 where σ(i) is the position of the ith card after the shuﬄe. Example 16. n = 5 σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 2 4 6 8 10 1 3 5 7 9 ) = = ( 1 2 4 8 5 10 9 7 3 6 ) . What will happen after 2, 3, 4, . . . shuﬄes? The resulting change will be characterised by the permutations σ2, σ3, σ4, . . . , respectively. In the example above σ2 = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 4 8 1 5 9 2 6 10 3 7 ) = = ( 1 4 5 9 3 ) ( 2 8 10 7 6 ) Also σ10 = id and 10 is the order of σ. Hence all cards will be back to their initial positions after 10 shuﬄes but not before. 11 Example 17. n = 4 σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 4 6 8 1 3 5 7 ) = ( 1 2 4 8 7 5 ) ( 3 6 ) The order of σ is 6. We close this section with a few words about a game played with a simple toy. This game seems to have been invented in the 1870s by the famous puzzle-maker Sam Loyd. It caught on and became the rage in the United States in the 1870s, and ﬁnally led to a discussion by W. Johnson in the scholarly journal, the American Journal of Mathematics, in 1879. It is often called the “ﬁfteen puzzle”. Our discussion will be without full proofs. Consider a toy made up of 16 squares, numbered from 1 to 15 inclusive and with the lower right-hand corner blank. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 The toy is constructed so that squares can be slid vertically and horizontally, such moves being possible because of the presence of the blank square. Start with the position shown and perform a sequence of slides in such a way that, at the end, the lower right-hand square is again blank. Call the new position “realisable.” Question: What are all possible realisable positions? What do we have here? After such a sequence of slides we have shuﬄed about the numbers from 1 to 15; that is, we have eﬀected a permutation of the numbers from 1 to 15. To ask what positions are realisable is merely to ask what permutations can be carried out. In other words, in S15, the symmetric group of degree 15, what elements can be reached via the toy? For instance, can we get 13 4 12 15 1 14 9 6 8 3 2 7 10 5 11 12 To answer, we will characterise every position of this game by a permutation. We will denote the empty square by the number 16. The position a1 a2 a3 a4 a5 a6 a7 a8 a9 a10 a11 a12 a13 a14 a15 a16 will be characterised by the transposition ( 1 2 . . . 16 a1 a2 . . . a16 ) . Example 18. The position 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 will correspond to the permutation σ = ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 2 4 16 6 8 10 12 14 ) . If we make a move pulling down the square 13, then the new position will be 1 3 5 7 9 11 15 2 4 13 6 8 10 12 14 and the new permutation is ( 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 1 3 5 7 9 11 16 15 2 4 13 6 8 10 12 14 ) = ( 13 16 ) σ. 13 Theorem 7. If a position characterised by the permutation σ can be trans- formed by legal moves to the initial position, then there exist permutations τ1, τ2, . . . , τm such that id = τ1τ2 . . . τmσ. (6) If the empty square was in the right bottom corner, then m is even and τ is even. Proof. As we have seen every legal move is equivalent to multiplying the permutation corresponding to the existing position by a transposition (i 16). Then (6) follows. In this case: σ = τmτm−1 . . . τ2τ1 hence the parity of σ is the same as that of m. Let us colour the board in the chessboard pattern Every move changes the colour of the empty square. Thus, if at the beginning and at the end the empty square was black, then there was an even number of moves made. Therefore, if initially the right bottom corner was empty and we could transform this position to the initial position, then an even number of moves was made, m is even, and σ is also even. It can be shown that every position, with an even permutation σ can be transformed to the initial positon but no easy proof is known. Copyright: MathOlymp.com Ltd 2001.

Namely, given a society in which any two people have exactly one friend in common, there must be a “host,” who is everybody’s friend. Of course, this is a graph-theoretic theorem and in order to prove it we must express it in graph-theoretic terms. Theorem 1 (Friendship Theorem). Suppose that G is a graph such that, if x and y are any two distinct vertices of G, then there is a unique vetex z adjacent in G to both x and y. Then there is a vertex adjacent to all other vertices. From this, it immediately follows that the graph G is a “windmill” like the one below: We will prove this theorem in several steps.1 We will assume that a counterexample G to the Friendship theorem does exist and will be working with this counterexample until we get a contradiction. Then the theorem will be established. 1following largely J.Q. Longyear and T.D Parsons (1972) 1 Deﬁnition 1. A sequence of vertices x0, x1, . . . , xn will be called a path of length n, if xi−1 is adjacent to xi for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n. These vertices need not be all diﬀerent, i.e. going along this path we may visit a certain vertex several times. Any path x0, x1, . . . , xn−1, x0 is called a cycle of length n. Lemma 1. G does not have any cycles of length 4. Proof. If we had a cycle x0, x1, x2, x3, x4, x0 of length 4, then x0 and x2 would have at least two neighbors in common, namely x1 and x3, which is not possible. Deﬁnition 2. The degree of a vertex is the number of other vertices adjacent to it. The graph is called regular, if all its vertices have the same degree. Lemma 2. Any two nonadjacent vertices of G have the same degree. Proof. Let x and y be two nonadjacent vertices and let z be their unique common neighbor. Then x and z will have a unique common neighbor u and y and z will have a unique common neighbor v. z vu x y Now let u1, u2, . . . , us be all other vertices adjacent to x. For each i = 1, 2, . . . , s, let vi be the unique common neighbor of ui and y. By inspection we check that vi is diﬀerent from any of the x, z, y, u, v, ui (every such assumption lead to the existence of a 4-cycle). Also, no two vertices vi and vj can coincide for i ̸= j, according to the same reason. vsus v2u2 v1u1 z u v yx 2 Thus, we see that the degree of x is not greater than the degree of y. But the situation is symmetric, i.e. we can also prove that the degree of y is not greater than the degree of x. Hence, these two degrees coincide. Lemma 3. G is regular. Proof. Let d(x) denote the degree of the vertex x. Suppose that G is not regular and that there exist two vertices a and b such that d(a) ̸= d(b). Then a and b must be adjacent by Lemma 2. There is a unique common neighbor c of a and b. Since either d(c) ̸= d(a) or d(c) ̸= d(b), or both, we may assume that the former is true and d(c) ̸= d(a). Now let x be any other vertex. Then x is adjacent to one of a or b, for otherwise by Lemma 2 d(a) = d(x) = d(b), contrary to the assumption that d(a) ̸= d(b). Similarly, x is adjacent to either a or c. But x cannot be adjacent to both b and c, as a is their unique common neighbor, hence x must be adjacent to a. This now shows that all vertices of G are adjacent to a and G is not a counterexample. Hence G is regular. Let m be the degree of G. Lemma 4. m is an even number. Proof. Let v1, v2, . . . , vm be the vertices adjacent to v. Let us consider v1. Together with v it must have a vertex which is adjacent to both. Since v1, v2, . . . , vm are all vertices adjacent to v, this third vertex must be among v1, v2, . . . , vm. Let it be v2. No other vertex among v1, v2, . . . , vm can be adjacent to v1 or to v2. Thus v1 and v2 form a pair. This way we can pair oﬀ the vertices adjacent to v which implies that m is even. We show that the neighborhood of every vertex v looks like a “windmill.” Lemma 5. Let N be the number of vertices of G. Then N = m(m − 1) + 1. Proof. Let v be any vertex and v1, v2, . . . , vm be the vertices adjacent to v. We know that the neighborhood of v looks like a “windmill.” Without loss of generality we assume that the vertices are paired oﬀ so that v1 is adjacent to v2, v3 is adjacent to v4 and ﬁnally vm−1 is adjacent to vm. Every vertex diﬀerent from v and v1, v2, . . . , vm must be adjacent to one of the vi since it must have a common neighbor with v. Each vi will have exactly m − 2 neighbors of this kind. In total we then have N = 1 + m + m(m − 2) = m(m − 1) + 1 vertices. 3 vm vm-1 v6 v1 v2 v3 v4 v5 v m-2 vertices m-2 vertices m-2 vertices m-2 vertices m-2 vertices Let us now note that m > 2, or else G is just a triangle which is not a counterexample. Let p be any prime which divides m − 1. Since m − 1 is odd, p is also odd. In the following two lemmas we will consider the set S of all cycles v0, v1, . . . , vp−1, v0 of length p with the ﬁxed initial point v0. This means that the same cycle with two diﬀerent initial vertices will be considered as two diﬀerent elements of S. Let us agree that if the cycle is written as v0, v1, . . . , vp−1, v0, then v0 is chosen as its initial point. Note that we again do not require that all vertices in the cycle are diﬀerent. We shall compute the cardinality |S| of S in two ways. Lemma 6. |S| is a multiple of p. Proof. Every cycle of length p with the ﬁxed initial point v0, v1, . . . , vp−1 gives us p − 1 other cycles by changing the initial point of it: v1, v2, . . . , v0, and v2, v3, . . . , v1, and so on. No two of such sequences are the same, as- suming the opposite will contradict to the primeness of p (see the solution to Exercise 9 of the assignment ”Many faces of mathematical Induction”). Since in every cycle of length p we can choose p initial points, and hence get p diﬀerent elements of S, it is clear that |S| is divisible by p. Proof of the Friendship Theorem. Now we will prove that |S| is NOT divis- ible by p which will give us a contradiction and the proof will be therefore complete. First, we will count the number of vertex sequences v0, v1, . . . , vp−2, such that vi is adjacent to vi+1 for all i = 0, 1, . . . , p − 2. There are two types 4 of such sequences: 1) those for which v0 = vp−2 and 2) those for which v0 ̸= vp−2. Let K1 and K2 be the number of sequences of the ﬁrst and the second type, respectively. Then K1 + K2 = N mp−2. Indeed, we can choose v0 in N diﬀerent ways, and having chosen v0, v1, . . . , vi, we can choose vi+1 in m diﬀerent ways. Now we will return to cycles with ﬁxed initial vertices from S. Each of them can be obtained from a sequence of one of the above types by adding a vertex vp−1 which is adjacent to v0 and vp−2 and considering v0 as the initial vertex of this cycle. If v0 = vp−2, then we can choose vp−1 in m diﬀerent ways, while if v0 ̸= vp−2, then such vp−1 will be unique. Thus |S| = mK1 + K2. But now |S| = (m − 1)K1 + (K1 + K2) = (m − 1)K1 + N mp−2 ≡ N mp−2 (mod p) But N ≡ 1 (mod p), and m = (m − 1) + 1 ≡ 1 (mod p), thus |S| ≡ 1 (mod p) which is a contradiction. Therefore the Friendship theorem is proved. Copyright: MathOlymp.com Ltd 2001. All rights reserved. 5 Number Theory. Tutorial 1: Divisibility and Primes 1 Introduction The theory of numbers is devoted to studying the set N = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, . . .} of positive integers, also called the natural numbers. The most important property of N is the following axiom (which means that it cannot be proved): Axiom 1 (The Least-integer Principle) A non-empty set S ⊆ N of pos- itive integers contains a smallest element. The set of all integers . . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . is denoted by Z. In this section we use letters of the roman alphabet a, b, c, . . . , k, l, m, n, . . . , x, y, z to designate integers unless otherwise speciﬁed. Theorem 1 (The division algorithm) Given any integers a, b, with a > 0, there exist unique integers q, r such that b = qa + r, 0 ≤ r < a. The number q is called the quotient and the number r is called the re- mainder. The notation r = b (mod a) is often used. Example 1 35 = 3 · 11 + 2, −51 = (−8) · 7 + 5; so that 2 = 35 (mod 11) and 5 = −51 (mod 7). 1 Deﬁnition 1 An integer b is divisible by an integer a ̸= 0, if there exists an integer c such that b = ac or else it can be written as 0 = b (mod a). We also say that a is a divisor of b and write a|b. Let n be a positive integer. Let us denote by d(n) the number of divisors of n. It is clear that 1 and n are always divisors of a number n which is greater than 1. Thus we have d(1) = 1 and d(n) ≥ 2 for n > 1. Deﬁnition 2 An integer n is called a prime if d(n) = 2. An integer n > 1, which is not prime is called a composite number. Example 2 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 are primes; 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not primes; 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are composite numbers. Theorem 2 (The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic) Every posi- tive integer n > 1 can be expressed as a product of primes (with perhaps only one factor), that is n = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαr r , where p1, p2, . . . , pn are distinct primes and α1, α2, . . . , αn are positive inte- gers. This factoring is unique apart from the order of the prime factors. Proof: Let us prove ﬁrst that any number n > 1 can be decomposed into a product of primes. If n = 2, the decomposition is trivial and we have only one factor, i.e., 2 itself. Let us assume that for all positive integers, which are less than n, a decomposition exists. If n is a prime, then n = n is the decomposition required. If n is composite, then n = n1n2, where n > n1 > 1 and n > n2 > 1 and by the induction hypothesis there are prime decompositions n1 = p1 . . . pr and n2 = q1 . . . qs for n1 and n2. Then we may combine them n = n1n2 = p1 . . . prq1 . . . qs and get the decomposition for n and prove the ﬁrst statement. To prove that the decomposition is unique, we shall assume the exis- tence of an integer capable of two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions, and from this assumption derive a contradiction. This will show that the hypothesis that there exists an integer with two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions is untenable, and hence the prime decomposition of every integer is unique. We will use the Least-integer Principle. 2 Suppose that there exists an integer with two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions, then there will be a smallest such integer n = p1p2 . . . pr = q1q2 . . . qs, (1) where pi and qj are primes. By rearranging the order of the p’s and the q’s, if necessary, we may assume that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ . . . ≤ pr, q1 ≤ q2 ≤ . . . ≤ qs. It is impossible that p1 = q1, for if it were we could cancel the ﬁrst factor from each side of equation (1) and to obtain two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions for a number smaller than n, contradicting the choice of n. Hence either p1 < q1 or q1 < p1. Without loss of generality we suppose that p1 < q1. We now form the integer n ′ = n − p1q2q3 . . . qs. (2) Then two decompositions of n give the following two decompositions of n ′: n ′ = (p1p2 . . . pr) − (p1q2 . . . qs) = p1(p2 . . . pr − q2 . . . qs), (3) n ′ = (q1q2 . . . qs) − (p1q2 . . . qs) = (q1 − p1)(q2 . . . qs). (4) Since p1 < q1, it follows from (4) that n ′ is a positive integer, which is smaller than n. Hence the prime decomposition for n ′ must be unique and, apart from the order of the factors, (3) and (4) coincide. From (3) we learn that p1 is a factor of n ′ and must appear as a factor in decomposition (4). Since p1 < q1 ≤ qi, we see that p1 ̸= qi, i = 2, 3, . . . , s. Hence, it is a factor of q1−p1, i.e., q1 − p1 = p1m or q1 = p1(m + 1), which is impossible as q1 is prime and q1 ̸= p1. This contradiction completes the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Let x be a real number. Then it can be written in a unique way as z + e, where z ∈ Z and 0 ≤ e < 1. Then, the following notation is used: z = ⌊x⌋, z + 1 = ⌈x⌉, e = {x}. We will use here only the ﬁrst function ⌊x⌋, which is called the integral part of x. Examples: ⌊−2.5⌋ = −3, ⌊π⌋ = 3, ⌊5⌋ = 5. Theorem 3 The smallest prime divisor of a composite number n is less than or equal to ⌊ √n⌋. 3 Proof: We prove ﬁrst that n has a divisor which is greater than 1 but less than √ n. As n is composite, then n = d1d2, d1 > 1 and d2 > 1. If d1 > √ n and d2 > √n, then n = d1d2 > (√n)2 = n, a contradiction. Suppose, d1 ≤ √ n. Then any of the prime divisors of d1 will be less than or equal to √ n. But every divisor of d1 is also a divisor of n, thus the smallest prime divisor p of n will satisfy the inequality p ≤ √ n. Snce p is an integer, p ≤ ⌊ √ n⌋. The theorem is proved. Theorem 4 (Euclid) The number of primes is inﬁnite. Proof: Suppose there were only ﬁnite number of primes p1, p2, . . . , pr. Then form the integer n = 1 + p1p2 . . . pr. Since n > pi for all i, it must be composite. Let q be the smallest prime factor of n. As p1, p2, . . . , pr represent all existing primes, then q is one of them, say q = p1 and n = p1m. Now we can write 1 = n − p1p2 . . . pr = p1m − p1p2 . . . pr = p1(m − p2 . . . pr). We have got that p1 > 1 is a factor of 1, which is a contradiction. The following three theorems are far from being elementary. Of course, no one jury assumes that students are familiar with these theorems. Nev- ertheless, some students use them and sometimes a diﬃcult math olympiad problem can be trivialised by doing so. The attitude of the Jury of the Inter- national Mathematics Olympiad is to believe that students know what they use. Therefore it pays to understand these results even without a proof. Let π(x) denote the number of primes which do not exceed x. Because of the irregular occurence of the primes, we cannot expect a simple formula for π(x). However one of the most impressive results in advanced number theory gives an asymptotic approximation for π(x). Theorem 5 (The Prime Number Theorem) lim x→∞ π(x) ln x x = 1, where ln x is the natural logarithm, to base e. 4 Theorem 6 (Dirichlet’s Theorem) If a and b are relatively prime pos- itive integers (which means that they don’t have common prime factors in their prime factorisations), then there are inﬁnitely many primes of the form an + b, where n = 1, 2, . . .. Theorem 7 (Bertrand’s Postulate, proved by Chebyschef) For every positive integer n > 1 there is a prime p such that n < p < 2n. 5 Number Theory. Tutorial 2: The Euclidean algorithm 1 The number of divisors of n Let n be a positive integer with the prime factorisation n = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαr r , (1) where pi are distinct primes and αi are positive integers. How can we ﬁnd all divisors of n? Let d be a divisor of n. Then n = dm, for some m, thus n = dm = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαr r , Since the prime factorisation of n is unique, d cannot have in its prime factorisation a prime which is not among the primes p1, p2, . . . , pr. Also, a prime pi in the prime factorisation of d cannot have an exponent greater than αi. Therefore d = pβ1 1 pβ2 2 . . . pβr r , 0 ≤ βi ≤ αi, i = 1, 2, . . . , r. (2) Theorem 1. The number of positive divisors of n is d(n) = (α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) . . . (αr + 1). (3) Proof. Indeed, we have exactly αi + 1 possibilities to choose βi in (2), namely 0, 1, 2, . . . , αi. Thus the total number of divisors will be exactly the product (α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) . . . (αr + 1). Deﬁnition 1. The numbers kn, where k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . . , are called multi- ples of n. It is clear that any multiple of n given by (1) has the form m = kp γ1 1 pγ2 2 . . . pγr r , γi ≥ αi, i = 1, 2, . . . , r, where k has no primes p1, p2, . . . , pr in its prime factorisation. The number of multiples of n is inﬁnite. 1 2 Greatest common divisor and least com- mon multiple Let a and b be two positive integers. If d is a divisor of a and also a divisor of b, then we say that d is a common divisor of a and b. As there are only a ﬁnite number of common divisors, there is a greatest common divisor, denoted by gcd (a, b). The number m is said to be a common multiple of a and b if m is a multiple of a and also a multiple of b. Among all common multiples there is a minimal one (Least-integer principle!). It is called the least common multiple and it is denoted by lcm (a, b). In the decomposition (1) we had all exponents positive. However, some- times it is convenient to allow some exponents to be 0. This is especially convenient, when we consider prime factorisations of two numbers a and b, looking for gcd (a, b) and lcm (a, b), since we may assume that both a and b have the same set of primes in their prime factorisations. Theorem 2. Let a = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαr r , b = pβ1 1 pβ2 2 . . . pβr r , where αi ≥ 0 and βi ≥ 0, be two arbitrary positive integers. Then gcd (a, b) = pmin(α1,β1) 1 pmin(α2,β2) 2 . . . pmin(αr,βr) r , (4) and lcm (a, b) = pmax(α1,β1) 1 pmax(α2,β2) 2 . . . pmax(αr ,βr) r . (5) Moreover, gcd (a, b) · lcm (a, b) = a · b. (6) Proof. Formulas (4) and (5) follow from our description of common divisors and common multiples. To prove (6) we have to notice that min(αi, βi) + max(αi, βi) = αi + βi. We suspect (in fact it is an open question) that prime factorisation is computationally diﬃcult and we don’t know easy algorithms for that but fortunately the greatest common divisor gcd (a, b) of numbers a and b can be found without knowing the prime factorisations for a and b. This algorithm was known to Euclid and maybe even was discovered by him. 2 Theorem 3 (The Euclidean Algorithm). Let a and b be positive inte- gers. We use the division algorithm several times to ﬁnd: a = q1b + r1, 0 < r1 < b, b = q2r1 + r2, 0 < r2 < r1, r1 = q3r2 + r3, 0 < r3 < r2, ... rs−2 = qsrs−1 + rs, 0 < rs < rs−1, rs−1 = qs+1rs. Then rs = gcd (a, b). Proof. Is based on the observation that if a = qb + r, then gcd (a, b) = gcd (b, r). Indeed, if d is a common divisor of a and b, then a = a ′d and b = b ′d and then r = a − qb = a ′d − qb ′d = (a ′ − qb ′)d and d is also a common divisor of b and r. Also if d is a common divisor of b and r, then b = b ′d, r = r′d and a = qb + r = qb ′d + r′d = (qb ′ + r′)d, whence d is a common divisor of a and b. It is clear now that gcd (a, b) = gcd (b, r1) = gcd (r1, r2) = . . . = gcd (rs−1, rs) = rs. Theorem 4 (The Extended Euclidean Algorithm). Let us write the fol- lowing table with two rows R1, R2, and three columns: ( a 1 0 b 0 1 ) . In accordance with the Euclidean Algorithm above, we perform the following operations with rows of this table. First we will create the third row R3 by subtracting from the ﬁrst row the second row times q1, we denote this as R3 := R1 − q1R2. Then similarly we create the fourth row: R4 := R2 − q2R3. We will continue this process as follows: when creating Rk we will obtain it taking Rk−2 and subtracting Rk−1 times qk−2, which can be written symbolically as 3 Rk := Rk−2 − qk−2Rk−1. Eventually we will obtain the table:          a 1 0 b 0 1 r1 1 −q1 r2 −q2 1 + q1q2 ... rs m n  | | | | | | |  . Then gcd (a, b) = rs = am + bn. Proof. We will prove this by induction. Let the kth row of the table be Rk = (uk, vk, wk). We assume that ui = avi +bwi for all i < k. This is certainly true for i = 1, 2. Then by induction hypothesis uk = uk−2 − qkuk−1 = avk−2 + bwk−2 − qk(avk−1 + bwk−1) = a(vk−2 − qkvk−1) + b(wk−2 − qkwk−1) = avk + bwk. Thus the statement ui = avi + bwi is true for all i. In particular, this is true for the last row, which gives us rs = am + bn. Example 1. Let a = 321, b = 843. Find the greatest common divisor gcd (a, b), the least common multiple lcm (a, b), and a linear presentation of the greatest common divisor in the form gcd (a, b) = ka + mb. The Euclidean algorithm: 321 = 0 · 843 + 321 843 = 2 · 321 + 201 321 = 1 · 201 + 120 201 = 1 · 120 + 81 120 = 1 · 81 + 39 81 = 2 · 39 + 3 39 = 13 · 3 + 0, 4 and therefore gcd (321, 843) = 3 and lcm (321, 843) = 321 · 843 3 = 107 · 843 = 90201. The Extended Euclidean algorithm: 321 1 0 843 0 1 321 1 0 201 −2 1 120 3 − 1 81 −5 2 39 8 − 3 3 −21 8 obtaining the linear presentation gcd (321, 843) = 3 = (−21) · 321 + 8 · 843. 3 Relatively prime numbers Deﬁnition 2. If gcd (a, b) = 1, the numbers a and b are said to be relatively prime (or coprime). The following properties of relatively prime numbers are often used. Lemma 1. Let gcd (a, b) = 1, i.e., a and b are relatively prime. Then 1. a and b do not have common primes in their prime factorisations; 2. If c is a multiple of a and also a multiple of b, then c is a multiple of ab; 3. If ac is a multiple of b, then c is a multiple of b; 4. There exist integers m, n such that ma + nb = 1. Proof. Part 1 follows from equation (4), parts 2 and 3 follow from part 1, and part 4 follows from Theorem 4. Theorem 5 (The Chinese remainder theorem). Let a and b be two rel- atively prime numbers, 0 ≤ r < a and 0 ≤ s < b. Then there exists a unique number N such that 0 ≤ N < ab and r = N (mod a) and s = N (mod b), (7) i.e., N has remainder r on dividing by a and remainder s on dividing by b. 5 Proof. Let us prove ﬁrst, that there exists at most one integer N with the conditions required. Assume, on the contrary, that for two integers N1 and N2 we have 0 ≤ N1 < ab, 0 ≤ N2 < ab and r = N1 (mod a) = N2 (mod a) and s = N1 (mod b) = N2 (mod b). Let us assume that N1 > N2. Then the number M = N1 − N2 satisﬁes 0 ≤ M < ab and 0 = M (mod a) and 0 = M (mod b). (8) By Lemma 1 part 3, condition (8) implies that M is divisible by ab, whence M = 0 and N1 = N2. Now we will ﬁnd an integer N, such that r = N (mod a) and s = N (mod b), ignoring the condition 0 ≤ N < ab. By Theorem 4 there are integers m, n such that gcd (a, b) = 1 = ma + nb. Multiplying this equation by r − s we get the equation r − s = (r − s)ma + (r − s)nb = m′a + n ′b. Now it is clear that the number N = r − m ′a = s + n ′b satisﬁes the condition (7). If N does not satisfy 0 ≤ N < ab, we divide N by ab with remainder N = q · ab + N1. Now 0 ≤ N1 < ab and N1 satisﬁes (7). Theorem is proved. This is a constructive proof of the Chinese remainder theorem, which gives also an algorithm of calculating such N with property (7). A shorter but nonconsructive proof, which uses Pigeonhole principle can be found in the training material ”Pigeonhole Principle.” It is used there to prove Fermat’s theorem that any prime of the type 4n + 1 can be represented as a sum of two squares.

The number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n, is denoted by ϕ(n). This function is called Euler’s ϕ-function or Euler’s totient function. Let us denote Zn = {0, 1, 2, . . . , n−1} and by Z ∗ n the set of those nonzero numbers from Zn that are relatively prime to n. Then ϕ(n) is the number of elements of Z ∗ n, i.e., ϕ(n) = |Z ∗ n|. Example 1. Let n = 20. Then Z ∗ 20 = {1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19} and ϕ(20) = 8. Lemma 1. If n = pk, where p is prime, then ϕ(n) = pk−p k−1 = pk ( 1 − 1 p ). Proof. It is easy to list all integers that are less than or equal to pk and not relatively prime to pk. They are p, 2p, 3p, . . . , pk−1 · p. We have exactly p k−1 of them. Therefore p k − pk−1 nonzero integers from Zn will be relatively prime to n. Hence ϕ(n) = pk − pk−1. An important consequence of the Chinese remainder theorem is that the function ϕ(n) is multiplicative in the following sense: Theorem 1. Let m and n be any two relatively prime positive integers. Then ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Proof. Let Z ∗ m = {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(m)} and Z ∗ n = {s1, s2, . . . , sϕ(n)}. By the Chinese remainder theorem there exists a unique positive integer Nij such that 0 ≤ Nij < mn and ri = Nij (mod m), sj = Nij (mod n), 1 that is Nij has remainder ri on dividing by m, and remainder sj on dividing by n, in particular for some integers a and b Nij = am + ri, Nij = bn + sj. (1) As in Tutorial 2, in the proof of the Euclidean algorithm, we notice that gcd (Nij, m) = gcd (m, ri) = 1 and gcd (Nij, n) = gcd (n, sj) = 1, that is Nij is relatively prime to m and also relatively prime to n. Since m and n are relatively prime, Nij is relatively prime to mn, hence Nij ∈ Z ∗ mn. Clearly, diﬀerent pairs (i, j) ̸= (k, l) yield diﬀerent numbers, that is Nij ̸= Nkl for (i, j) ̸= (k, l). Suppose now that a number N ̸= Nij for all i and j. Then r = N (mod m), s = N (mod n), where either r does not belong to Z ∗ m or s does not belong to Z ∗ n. Assuming the former, we get gcd (r, m) > 1. But then gcd (N, m) = gcd (m, r) > 1 and N does not belong to Z∗ mn. It shows that the numbers Nij and only they form Z ∗ mn. But there are exactly ϕ(m)ϕ(n) of the numbers Nij, exactly as many as the pairs (ri, sj). Therefore ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Theorem 2. Let n be a positive integer with the prime factorisation n = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . pαr r , where pi are distinct primes and αi are positive integers. Then ϕ(n) = n ( 1 − 1 p1 ) (1 − 1 p2 ) . . . (1 − 1 pr ) . Proof. We use Lemma 1 and Theorem 1 to compute ϕ(n): ϕ(n) = ϕ (p α1 1 ) ϕ (p α2 2 ) . . . ϕ (pαr r ) = pα1 1 ( 1 − 1 p1 ) pα2 2 ( 1 − 1 p2 ) . . . pαr r ( 1 − 1 pr ) = n ( 1 − 1 p1 ) (1 − 1 p2 ) . . . ( 1 − 1 pr ) . Example 2. ϕ(264) = ϕ(23 · 3 · 11) = 264 ( 1 2) ( 2 3 ) ( 10 11 ) = 80. 2 2 Congruences. Euler’s Theorem If a and b are intgers we write a ≡ b (mod m) and say that a is congruent to b if a and b have the same remainder on dividing by m. For example, 41 ≡ 80 (mod 1)3, 41 ≡ −37 (mod 1)3, 41 ̸≡ 7 (mod 1)3. Lemma 2. Let a and b be two integers and m is a positive integer. Then (a) a ≡ b (mod m) if and only if a − b is divisible by m; (b) If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then a + c ≡ b + d (mod m); (c) If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then ac ≡ bd (mod m); (d) If a ≡ b (mod m) and n is a positive integer, then a n ≡ b n (mod m); (e) If ac ≡ bc (mod m) and c is relatively prime to m, then a ≡ b (mod m). Proof. (a) By the division algorithm a = q1m + r1, 0 ≤ r1 < m, and b = q2m + r2, 0 ≤ r2 < m. Thus a − b = (q1 − q2)m + (r1 − r2), where −m < r1 − r2 < m. We see that a − b is divisible by m if and only if r1 − r2 is divisible by m but this can happen if and only if r1 − r2 = 0, i.e., r1 = r2. (b) is an exercise. (c) If a ≡ b (mod m) and c ≡ d (mod m), then m|(a − b) and m|(c − d), i.e., a − b = im and c − d = jm for some integers i, j. Then ac − bd = (ac − bc) + (bc − bd) = (a − b)c + b(c − d) = icm + jbm = (ic + jb)m, whence ac ≡ bd (mod m); (d) Follows immediately from (c) (e) Suppose that ac ≡ bc (mod m) and gcd (c, m) = 1. Then there exist integers u, v such that cu + mv = 1 or cu ≡ 1 (mod m). Then by (c) a ≡ acu ≡ bcu ≡ b (mod m). and a ≡ b (mod m) as required. The property in Lemma 2 (e) is called the cancellation property. Theorem 3 (Fermat’s Little Theorem). Let p be a prime. If an integer a is not divisible by p, then a p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). Also a p ≡ a (mod p) for all a. 3 Proof. Let a, be relatively prime to p. Consider the numbers a, 2a, ..., (p − 1)a. All of them have diﬀerent remainders on dividing by p. Indeed, suppose that for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ p−1 we have ia ≡ ja (mod p). Then by the cancellation property a can be cancelled and i ≡ j (mod p), which is impossible. Therefore these remainders are 1, 2, ..., p − 1 and a · 2a · · · · · (p − 1)a ≡ (p − 1)! (mod p), which is (p − 1)! · a p−1 ≡ (p − 1)! (mod p). Since (p − 1)! is relatively prime to p, by the cancellation property a p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). When a is relatively prime to p, the last statement follows from the ﬁrst one. If a is a multiple of p the last statement is also clear. Theorem 4 (Euler’s Theorem). ) Let n be a positive integer. Then a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) for all a relatively prime to n. Proof. Let Z ∗ n = {z1, z2, . . . , zϕ(n)}. Consider the numbers z1a, z2a, ..., zϕ(n)a. Both zi and a are relatively prime to n, therefore zia is also relatively prime to n. Suppose that ri = zia (mod n), i.e., ri is the remainder on dividing zia by n. Since gcd (zia, n) = gcd (ri, n), yielding ri ∈ Z ∗ n. These remainders are all diﬀerent. Indeed, suppose that ri = rj for some 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n. Then zia ≡ zja (mod n). By the cancellation property a can be cancelled and we get zi ≡ zj (mod n), which is impossible. Therefore the remainders r1, r2, ..., rϕ(n) coincide with z1, z2, . . . , zϕ(n), apart from the order in which they are listed. Thus z1a · z2a · . . . · zϕ(n)a ≡ r1 · r2 · . . . · rϕ(n) ≡ z1 · z2 · . . . · zϕ(n) (mod n), which is Z · a ϕ(n) ≡ Z (mod n), where Z = z1 ·z2 ·. . .·zϕ(n). Since Z is relatively prime to n it can be cancelled and we get a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). Copyright: MathOlymp.com Ltd 2001. All rights reserved. 4 Number Theory. Tutorial 4: Representation of Numbers 1 Classical Decimal Positional System There is an important distinction between numbers and their representations. In the decimal system the zero and the ﬁrst nine positive integers are denoted by symbols 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, respectively. These symbols are called digits. The same symbols are used to represent all the integers. The tenth integer is denoted as 10 and an arbitrary integer N can now be represented in the form N = an · 10n + an−1 · 10n−1 + . . . + a1 · 10 + a0, (1) where a0, a1, . . . , an are integers that can be represented by a single digit 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9. For example, the year, when I started to think about setting up this website, can be written as 1 · 103 + 9 · 102 + 9 · 10 + 8. We shorten this expression to (1998)(10) or simply 1998, having the decimal system in mind. In this notation the meaning of a digit depends on its posi- tion. Thus two digit symbols “9” are situated in the tens and the hundreds places and their meaning is diﬀerent. In general for the number N given by (1) we write N = (anan−1 . . . a1a0)(10) to emphasise the exceptional role of 10. This notation is called positional. Its invention, attributed to Sumerians or Babylonians and its further devel- opment by Hindus, was of enormous signiﬁcance for civilisation. In Roman symbolism, for example, one wrote MCMXCVIII = (thousand) + (nine hundreds) + (ninety)+ (ﬁve) + (one) + (one) + (one), 1 It is clear that more and more new symbols such as I, V, X, C, M are needed as numbers get larger while with the Hindu positional system now in use we need only ten “Arabic numerals” 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, no matter how large is the number. The positional system was introduced into medieval Europe by merchants, who learned it from the Arabs. It is exactly this system which is to blame that the ancient art of computation, once conﬁned to a few adepts, became a routine algorithmic skill that can be done automatically by a machine, and is now taught in elementary school. 2 Other Positional Systems Mathematically, there is nothing special in the decimal system. The use of ten, as the base, goes back to the dawn of civilisation, and is attributed to the fact that we have ten ﬁngers on which to count. Other number could be used as the base, and undoubtedly some of them were used. The number words in many languages show remnants of other bases, mainly twelve, ﬁfteen and twenty. For example, in English the words for 11 and 12 and in Spanish the words for 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15, are not constructed on the decimal principle. In French a special role of the word for 20 is clearly observed. The Babylonian astronomers had a system of notation with the base 60. This is believed to be the reason for the customary division of the hour and the angular degree into 60 minutes. In the theorem that follows we show that an arbitrary positive integer b > 1 can be used as the base. Theorem 1. Let b > 1 be a positive integer. Then every positive integer N can be uniquely represented in the form N = d0 + d1b + d2b 2 + · · · + dnb n, (2) where “the digits” d0, d1, . . . , dn lie in the range 0 ≤ di ≤ b−1, for all i. Proof. The proof is by induction on N, the number being represented. Clearly, the representation 1 = 1 for 1 is unique. Suppose, inductively, that every integer 1, 2, . . . , N−1 is uniquely representable. Now consider the integer N. Let d0 = N (mod b). Then N − d0 is divisible by b and let N1 = (N − d0)/b. Since N1 < N, by the induction hypothesis N1 is uniquely representable in the form N1 = N − d0 b = d1 + d2b + d3b 2 + · · · + dnb n−1, 2 Then clearly, N = d0 + N1b = d0 + d1b + d2b 2 + · · · + dnb n, is the representation required. Finally, suppose that N has some other representation in this form also, i.e., N = d0 + d1b + d2b 2 + · · · + dnb n = e0 + e1b + e2b 2 + · · · + enb n. Then d0 = e0 = r as they are equal to the remainder of N on dividing by b. Now the number N1 = N − r b = d1 + d2b + d3b 2 + · · · + dnb n−1 = e1 + e2b + e3b 2 + · · · + enb n−1 has two diﬀerent representations which contradicts the inductive assumption, since we have assumed the truth of the result for all N1 < N. Corollary 1. We use the notation N = (dndn−1 . . . d1d0)(b) (3) to express (2). The digits di can be found by the repeated application of the division algorithm as follows: N = q1b + d0, (0 ≤ d0 < b) q1 = q2b + d1, (0 ≤ d1 < b) ... qn = 0 · b + dn (0 ≤ dn < b) For example, the positional system with base 5 employ the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and we can write 1998(10) = 3 · 54 + 0 · 53 + 4 · 52 + 4 · 5 + 3 = 30443(5). But in the computers’ era it is the binary (or dyadic) system (base 2) that emerged as the most important one. We have only two digits here 0 and 1 and a very simple multiplication table for them. But under the binary system, the representations of numbers get longer. For example, 86(10) = 1 · 26 + 0 · 25 + 1 · 24 + 0 · 23 + 1 · 22 + 1 · 2 + 0 = 1010110(2). (4) 3 Leibniz (1646–1716) was one of the proponents of the binary system. Ac- cording to Laplace: “Leibniz saw in his binary arithmetic the image of cre- ation. He imagined that Unity represented God, and zero the void; that the Supreme Being drew all beings from the void, just as unity and zero express all numbers in his system of numeration.” Let us look at the binary representation of a number from the information point of view. Information is measured in bits. One bit is a unit of infor- mation expressed as a choice between two possibilities 0 and 1. The number of binary digits in the binary representation of a number N is therefore the number of bits we need to transmit N through an information channel (or input into a computer). For example, the equation (4) shows that we need 7 bits to transmit or input the number 86. Theorem 2. To input a number N by converting it into its binary repre- sentation we need ⌊log2 N⌋ + 1 bits of information, where ⌊x⌋ denotes the integer part of x. Proof. Suppose that N has n binary digits in its binary representation. That is N = 2n−1 + an−22n−2 + · · · + a121 + a020, ai ∈ {0, 1}. Then 2 n > N ≥ 2n−1 or n > log2N ≥ n − 1, i.e., ⌊log2 N⌋ = n − 1 and thus n = ⌊log2 N⌋ + 1. 3 Representations for real numbers The negative powers of 10 are used to express those real numbers which are not integers. The other bases can be also used. For example, 1 8 = 0.125(10) = 1 10 + 2 102 + 5 103 = 0 2 + 0 22 + 1 23 = 0.001(2) 1 7 = 0.142857142857 . . .(10) = 0.(142857)(10) = 0.001001 . . .(2) = 0.(001)(2) The binary expansions of irrational numbers, such as √5 = 10.001111000110111 . . .(2) , are used sometimes in cryptography for simulating a random sequence of bits. But this method is considered to be insecure. The number, √ 5 in the example above, can be guessed after knowing the initial segment which will reveal the whole sequence. 4 Number Theory. Tutorial 5: Bertrand’s Postulate 1Introduction In this tutorial we are going to prove: Theorem 1 (Bertrand’s Postulate). Foreach positive integer n> 1 there is a prime p such that n<p< 2n. This theorem was veriﬁed for all numbers less than three million for Joseph Bertrand (1822-1900) and was proved by Pafnutii Chebyshev (1821- 1894). 2 The ﬂoor function Deﬁnition 1. Let x bea real number such that n ≤ x<n +1. Then we deﬁne ⌊x⌋ = n. This is called the ﬂoor function. ⌊x⌋ is also called the integer part of x with x −⌊x⌋ being called the fractional part of x.If m − 1 <x ≤ m, we deﬁne ⌈x⌉ = m. This is called the ceiling function. In this tutorial we will make use of the ﬂoor function. Two useful prop- erties are listed in the following propositions. Proposition 1. 2⌊x⌋≤⌊2x⌋≤ 2⌊x⌋ +1. Proof. Proving such inequalities is easy (and it resembles problems with the absolute value function). You have to represent x in the form x = ⌊x⌋ + a, where 0 ≤ a< 1is the fractional part of x. Then 2x =2⌊x⌋ +2a and we get two cases: a< 1/2 and a ≥ 1/2. In the ﬁrst case we have 2⌊x⌋ = ⌊2x⌋ < 2⌊x⌋ +1 and in the second 2⌊x⌋ < ⌊2x⌋ =2⌊x⌋ +1. 1 Proposition 2. let a, b be positive integers and let us divide a by b with remainder a = qb + r 0 ≤ r< b. Then q = ⌊a/b⌋ and r = a − b⌊a/b⌋. Proof. We simply write a b = q + r b and since q is an integer and 0 ≤ r/b < 1we see that q is the integer part of a/b and r/b is the fractional part. Exercise 1. ⌊x⌋ + ⌊x +1/2⌋ = ⌊2x⌋. 3 Prime divisors of factorials and binomial coeﬃcients We start with the following Lemma 1. Let n and b be positive integers. Then the number of integers in the set {1, 2, 3,... ,n} that are multiples of b is equal to ⌊n/b⌋. Proof. Indeed, by Proposition 2 the integers that are divisible by b will be b, 2b, ... , ⌊m/b⌋· b. Theorem 2. Let n and p be positive integers and p be prime. Then the largest exponent s such that ps | n! is s = ∑ j≥1 ⌊ n pj ⌋ . (1) Proof. Let mi be the number of multiples of pi in the set {1, 2, 3,... ,n}. Let t = m1 + m2 + ... + mk + ... (2) (the sum is ﬁnite of course). Suppose that a belongs to {1, 2, 3,... ,n}, and such that pj | a but pj+1 ∤ a. Then in the sum (2) a will be counted j times and will contribute i towards t. This shows that t = s.Now (1) follows from Lemma 1 since mj = ⌊n/pj⌋. 2 Theorem 3. Let n and p be positive integers and p be prime. Then the largest exponent s such that ps | (2n n ) is s = ∑ j≥1 (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) . (3) Proof. Follows from Theorem 2. Note that, due to Proposition 1, in (3) every summand is either 0 or 1. Corollary 1. Let n ≥ 3 and p be positive integers and p be prime. Let s be the largest exponent such that ps | (2n n ). Then (a) ps ≤ 2n. (b) If √2n<p, then s ≤ 1. (c) If 2n/3 <p ≤ n, then s =0. Proof. (a) Let t be the largest integer such that pt ≤ 2n. Then for j> t (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) =0. Hence s = t∑ j=1 (⌊ 2n pj ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n pj ⌋) ≤ t. since each summand does not exceed 1 by Proposition 1. Hence ps ≤ 2n. (b) If √2n<p, then p2 > 2n and from (a) we know that s ≤ 1. (c) If 2n/3 <p ≤ n, then p2 > 2n and s = (⌊ 2n p ⌋ − 2 ⌊ n p ⌋) As 1 ≤ n/p < 3/2, we se that s =2 − 2 · 1=0. 3 4Two inequalities involving binomial coeﬃ- cients We all know the Binomial Theorem: (a + b) n = n∑ k=0 (n k )a n−kbk. (4) Let us derive some consequences from it. Substituting a = b =1 we get: 2 n = n∑ k=0 (n k ). (5) Lemma 2. (a) If n is odd, then ( n (n +1)/2 ) ≤ 2 n−1. (b) If n is even, then ( n n/2 ) ≥ 2 n n . Proof. (a) From (5), deleting all terms except the two middle ones, we get ( n (n − 1)/2 ) + ( n (n +1)/2 ) ≤ 2 n. The two binomial coeﬃcients on the left are equal and we get (a). (b) If n is even, then it is pretty easy to prove that the middle binomial coeﬃcient is the largest one. In (5) we have n +1 summand but we group the two ones together and we get n summands among which the middle binomial coeﬃcient is the largest. Hence n( n n/2 ) ≥ n∑ k=0 (n k ) =2 n, which proves (b). 4 5 Proof of Bertrand’s Postulate Finally we can pay attention to primes. Theorem 4. Let n ≥ 2 be an integer, then ∏ p≤n p< 4 n, where the product on the left has one factor for each prime p ≤ n. Proof. The proof is by induction over n.For n =2 we have 2 < 4 2, which is true. This provides a basis for the induction. Let us assume that the statement is proved for all integers smaller than n.If n is even, then it is not prime, hence by induction hypothesis ∏ p≤n p = ∏ p≤n−1 p< 4 n−1 < 4 n, so the induction step is trivial in this case. Suppose n =2s +1 is odd, i.e s =(n − 1)/2. Since ∏ s+1<p≤n p is a divisor of ( n s+1),we obtain ∏ p≤n p = ∏ p≤s+1 p · ∏ s+1<p≤n p< 4 s+1 · ( n s +1 ) < 4 s+12 n−1 using the induction hypothesis for n = s +1 and Lemma 2(a). Now the right-hand-side can be presented as 4 s+12 n−1 =2 2s+22 n−1 =2 4s+2 =4 2s+1 =4 n. This proves the induction step and, hence, the theorem. Proof of Bertrand’s Postulate. We will assume that there are no primes be- tween n and 2n and obtain a contradiction. We will obtain that, under this assumption, the binomial coeﬃcient (2n n ) is smaller than it should be. Indeed, in this case we have the following prime factorisation for it: (2n n ) = ∏ p≤n psp, 5 where sp is the exponent of the prime p in this factorisation. No primes greater than n can be found in this prime factorisation. In fact, due to Corollary 1(c) we can even write (2n n ) = ∏ p≤2n/3 psp. Let us recap now that due to Corollary 1 psp ≤ 2n and that sp =1 for p> √2n. Hence (2n n ) ≤ ∏ p≤√2n psp · ∏ p≤2n/3 p. We will estimate now these product using the inequality psp ≤ 2n for the ﬁrst product and Theorem 4 for the second one. We have no more that √2n/2−1 factors in the ﬁrst product (as 1 and even numbers are not primes), hence (2n n ) < (2n) √2n/2−1 · 4 2n/3. (6) On the other hand, by Lemma 2(b) (2n n ) ≥ 2 2n 2n = 4 n 2n . (7) Combining (6) and (7) we get 4 n/3 < (2n) √n/2. Applying logs on both sides, we get 2n 3 ln 2 < √ n 2 ln(2n) or √8n ln 2 − 3 ln(2n) < 0. (8) Let us substitute n =2 2k−3 for some k. Then we get 2 k ln 2−3(2k−2) ln 2 < 0 or 2 k < 3(2k − 2) which is true only for k ≤ 4(you can prove that by 6 inducton). Hence (8) is not true for n =2 7 = 128. Let us consider the function f (x)= √8x ln 2 − 3 ln(2x) deﬁned for x> 0. Its derivative is f (x)= √2x · ln 2 − 3 x . let us note that for x ≥ 8 this derivative is positive. Thus (8) is not true for all n ≥ 128. We proved Bertrand’s postulate for n ≥ 128. For smaller n it can be proved by inspection. I leave this to the reader. Copyright: MathOlymp.com Ltd 2001-2002.

Ptolemy’s inequality One of the most important tools in proving geometric inequalities is Theorem 1 (Ptolemy’s Inequality) Let ABCD be an arbitrary quadri- lateral in the plane. Then AB · CD + BC · AD ≥ AC · BD. This inequality becomes equality if and only if the quadrilateral is cyclic. Proof: Firstly, we will consider the case, when the quadrilateral ABCD is convex. Let us rotate the plane about B and then dilate, choosing the coeﬃcient of the dilation k so that the image of D coincides with A. Let us denote the image of C as C ′. C' B C A D Since the triangles ABC ′ and DBC are similar we get AB AC ′ = BD CD and hence AC ′ = AB · CD BD . 1 The triangles C ′BC and ABD are also similar because ̸ C ′BC = ̸ ABD and C ′B BC = AB BD = k. This similarity yields BC C ′C = BD AD , whence C ′C = BC · AD BD . By the Triangle inequality AC ′ + C ′C = AB · CD BD + BC · AD BD ≥ AC, and therefore AB · CD + BC · AD ≥ AC · BD. This inequality is an equality if and only if C ′ is on the segment AC in which case we have ̸ BAC = ̸ BAC ′ = ̸ BDC and the points A, B, C, D are concyclic. Let us assume now that the quadrilateral is not convex. Then one of its diagonals, say BD does not have common points with the interior of the quadrilateral. C' B C D A Reﬂecting C about BD we will get a convex quadrilateral ABC ′D whose side are of the same lengths as that of ABCD but the product of the diagonals for ABCD is smaller than for ABC ′D as AC < AC ′ and BD is the same in both cases. Therefore Ptolemy’s inequality holds in this case too, and inequality never becomes equality. Another proof of Ptolemy’s inequality can be obtained using inversion. We will prove even more general statement. 2 Theorem 2 (Generalised Ptolemy’s inequality) Let A, B, C, D be ar- bitrary points in the plane, but not on a line. Then AB · CD + BC · AD ≥ AC · BD. This inequality becomes equality if and only if the points A, B, C, D are con- cyclic and each of the two arcs determined by the points A, C contains one of the two remaining points. Proof: Consider an inversion i with pole D and any coeﬃcient r > 0. Let A ′, B′, C ′ be the images of A, B, C under this inversion respectively. Applying the Triangle inequality for the points A ′, B′, C ′, we get A ′B′ + B′C ′ ≥ A ′C ′. (1) It is well-known (or easy to prove) how distances between points change under inversion. In our case, if X, Y are any two points diﬀerent from D, and if X ′, Y ′ are their images under i then X ′Y ′ = r2 · XY DX · DY . This formula can be applied to any pair of points A, B, C because they are all diﬀerent from D. So we rewrite (1) in the form r2 · AB DA · DB + r2 · BC DB · DC ≥ r2 · AC DA · DC . After multiplying both sides by DA · DB · DC, the latter becomes AB · CD + BC · AD ≥ AC · BD, (2) as desired. It is clear that (2) becomes equality, only when (1) becomes equal- ity. This happens, when A ′, B′, C ′ are on the line with B′ beeing between A ′ and C ′. Since the points are not on the same line, this means that before the inversion they were on a circle with B and D on diﬀerent arcs determined by A and C. Comment 1: Theorem 2 is clearly independent of whether or not the given points lie in the same plane. It does not change in the slightest if they are in three-dimensional space. Comment 2: Theorem 2 is also true in some cases, when the given points lie on the same line. This case can easily be sorted out but it is not of interest to us. 3 Geometry Tutorial 2. Euler’s theorem We shall prove in this section Euler’s theorem that was oﬀered in 1962 to the participants of IMO and therefore introduced to the IMO sillabus forever. We will prove the following lemma ﬁrst and then derive Euler’s theorem and several other corollaries. Lemma 1 A circle of radus r with center I is inside of a circle of radius R with center O. Suppose A is an arbitrary point on the larger circle, AB and AC are two chords of the larger circle which are tangent to the smaller one. Then BC is tangent to the smaller circle if and only if IO = √R(R − 2r). Proof. Let S be a point on the larger circle such that AS is the bisector of ̸ BAC. Let us draw CI and CS. O I N A M S B C BC is tangent to the smaller circle if and only if ̸ BCI = ̸ ICA. This, in turn, happens if and only if ̸ SCI = ̸ CIS, since ̸ CIS = ̸ ICA + ̸ IAC = ̸ ICA + ̸ SCB. Furthermore, ̸ SCI = ̸ CIS if and only if SC = SI. Let MN be the diameter of the large circle passing through I and O. Then SC = SI if and only if SI · IA = SC · IA = 2R sin α · r sin α = 2rR, where α = ̸ CAS. 1 As is well-known, SI · IA = MI · IN = (R − d)(R + d), where d = IO. Hence we have SI · IA = 2rR if and only if (R − d)(R + d) = 2rR, which is the same as d2 = R2 − 2rR, and the lemma is proved. From this lemma Euler’s theorem follows: Theorem 2 (Euler’s theorem) The distance between the incenter and the circumcenter of a triangle is equal to √R(R − 2r). Two more remarkable corollaries from the same lemma: Corollary 3 Two positive real numbers r and R are the inradius and cir- cumradius of some triangle ABC if and only if R ≥ 2r. Moreover, R = 2r if and only if the triangle ABC is equilateral. If R > 2r there exist inﬁnitely many nonsimilar triangles having R and r as the circumradius and inradius, respectively. Corollary 4 Consider the incircle and the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Let us take an arbitrary point A1 on the circumcircle and draw the chords A1B1 and B1C1 both of which are tangent to the incircle. Then the chord C1A1 is also tangent to the incircle. A B1 C B A 1 C 1 This is a partial case of the deep Poncelet’s theorem. Theorem 5 (Poncelet) Suppose that one circle is placed inside another circle. Let A1, . . . , An be the points on a larger circle such that each link of the closed broken line A1A2 . . . AnA1 touches the smaller circle. Then if B1, . . . , Bn be any points on the larger circle such that each link of the broken line B1B2 . . . Bn touches the smaller circle, then BnB1 also touches it.

It contains a comprehensive collection of theorems and other results from many branches of mathematics. METHODS OF PROBLEM SOLVING, BOOKS 1 & 2 JB TABOV & PJ TAYLOR These books introduce senior students aspiring to Olympiad competition to particular mathematical problem solving techniques. The books contain formal treatments of methods which may be familiar or may introduce the student to new, sometimes powerful techniques. INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICS USSR MATHEMATICAL OLYMPIADS 1989–1992 AM SLINKO Arkadii Slinko, now at the University of Auckland, was one of the leading figures of the USSR Mathematical Olympiad Committee during the last years before democratisation. This book brings together the problems and solutions of the last four years of the All-Union Mathematics Olympiads. Not only are the problems and solutions highly expository but the book is worth reading alone for the fascinating history of mathematics competitions to be found in the introduction. INTERNATIONAL MATHEMATICS—TOURNAMENT OF TOWNS 1980-1984, 1984-1989, 1989-1993, 1993-1997 PJ TAYLOR The International Mathematics Tournament of Towns is a problem solving competition in which teams from different cities are handicapped according to the population of the city. Ranking only behind the International Mathematical Olympiad, this competition had its origins in Eastern Europe (as did the Olympiad) but is now open to cities throughout the world. These books of 115, 180, 200 and 180 pages respectively, contain all the problems and solutions of the Tournaments.

The Park Rangers keep records of the numbers of each type of animal. At the end of both the ﬁrst and second years, there were three times as many bettongs as quolls and half the total animal population was bandicoots. 1. If therewerethree quolls at theend of the ﬁrst year, what was the total animal population? 2. If the total population at the end of the second year was 40, how many bandicoots, bettongs and quolls were there? At the end of the third year, the total animal population had grown to 55. There were still three times as many bettongs as quolls and more than half the total population was bandicoots. 3. The Chief Ranger thought he had counted eight quolls. Explain why this was a mistake. 4. What is the largest possible number of quolls in the area at the end of the third year? c2005 Australian Mathematics Trust MATHEMATICS CHALLENGE FOR YOUNG AUSTRALIANS JUNIOR, YEARS 7 and 8 WARM UP PROBLEM 02 The Price is Perfect On the TV show ‘The Price is Perfect’, Chloe will win all the prizes if she can work out the mystery number.

Cornelius holds 50 litres and can travel 100 km on 10 litres. The water sellers at the oases between Hier and Thair charge varying amounts per litre of water, as shown on the map. Gianna stops as infrequently as possible on her journey as it is diﬃcult to get Cornelius going after a stop. She ﬁlls Cornelius with 50 litres of water at Hier and starts her journey. When she does stop, including the beginning of the journey at Hier and the end of the journey at Thair, she always lets Cornelius ﬁll up with water completely. 1. What is the minimum number of times Gianna must stop for water for Cornelius? Give reasons for your answer. 2. Gianna crosses the Gibson Desert with a minimum number of stops. At which oases should she stop to spend as little as possible on waterfor Cornelius? Howmuch doesthiscosther? 3.
