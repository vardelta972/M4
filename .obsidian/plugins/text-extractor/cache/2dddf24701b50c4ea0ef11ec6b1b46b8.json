These notes explore families of solutions to this equation, and give some Olympiad problem applications. 2 Solutions on Q Let f : R → R be any function that satisﬁes the Cauchy equation. Clearly f ([k + 1]x) = f (kx) + f (x); hence by induction f (nx) = nf (x) for all n ∈ N. We can extend this to all integers. First, f (0) = f (0 + 0) = f (0) + f (0), so f (0) = 0. Then for any n ∈ N f (0) = f (nx + [−n]x) = nf (x) + f ([−n]x), so f ([−n]x) = [−n]f (x). Finally, the result can be extended to all rationals, for if m ∈ Z, n ∈ N, then mf (x) = f (mx) = f (n m n x ) = nf ( m n x) , and hence f ( m n x) = m n f (x). In particular, we have proved that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ Q, where c = f (1) is some ﬁxed real. 3 ‘Nice’ solutions on R Certainly all functions of the form f (x) = cx (for some ﬁxed c) are solutions to the Cauchy equation; let us call these linear functions the ‘nice’ solutions to the equation. Unfortunately, not all solutions to the Cauchy equation are ‘nice’. However, all other solutions are very badly behaved indeed. Theorem 1. The only monotonic solutions to the Cauchy equation are the ‘nice’ solutions. Proof. Suppose f satisﬁes the Cauchy equation and is monotonic (that is, either increasing or decreasing). We know there is some c ∈ R such that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ Q. We will prove that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ R. If c = 0, then for all x ∈ R, ⌊x⌋ ≤ x ≤ ⌈x⌉, and 0 = f (⌊x⌋) = f (⌈x⌉), so f (x) = 0 = cx. Otherwise, c ̸= 0. Assume without loss of generality that c > 0 (the proof for c < 0 is almost identical). Suppose that for some z ∈ R, f (z) ̸= cz. Then z ̸= f (z) c . Between any two distinct real numbers there lies some rational; hence there exists q ∈ Q such that either z < q < f (z) c or f (z) c < q < z. 1 If the former, z < q but f (q) = cq < f (z); if the latter, q < z but f (z) < cq = f (q). Either way, as f is monotonic, it follows that f must be decreasing. But as 0 < 1 and f (0) = 0 < c = f (1), this is a contradiction. A function f : R → R is said to be continuous if for all x ∈ R and any ϵ > 0, we can ﬁnd some δ > 0 such that given any x − δ < y < x + δ, it is true that f (x) − ϵ < f (y) < f (x) + ϵ. Intuitively, a function is continuous if it can be drawn without lifting one’s pen. Theorem 2. The only continuous solutions to the Cauchy equation are the ‘nice’ solutions. Proof. Suppose f satisﬁes the Cauchy equation. We know there is some c ∈ R such that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ Q. We need to show that if for some z ∈ R f (z) ̸= cz, then f is discontinuous. Assume without loss of generality that c ≥ 0 (the proof for c ≤ 0 is almost identical). Let ϵ = |f (z) − cz|; as f (z) ̸= cz, ϵ > 0. It suﬃces to show that for any positive δ, however small, there is some z − δ < y < z + δ for which either f (y) ≤ f (z) − ϵ, or f (y) ≥ f (z) + ϵ. Indeed, suppose ﬁrst that f (z) > cz. Between any two distinct reals lies some rational; hence we can choose some rational q for which z − δ < q < z. For this q f (q) = (f (z) − cz) + f (q) − ϵ = f (z) − cz + cq − ϵ ≤ f (z) − ϵ. Otherwise f (z) < cz, and there is some q ∈ Q for which z < q < z + δ. Then f (q) = −[cz − f (z)] + f (q) + ϵ = f (z) − cz + cq + ϵ ≥ f (z) + ϵ. Theorem 3. Given any real interval, the only solutions to the Cauchy equation bounded on that interval are the ‘nice’ solutions. Proof. Let our interval be [a, b]. Suppose f satisﬁes the Cauchy equation and is bounded (that is, both bounded above and bounded below) on [a, b]. We know there is some c ∈ R such that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ Q. We will prove that f (x) = cx for all x ∈ R. Indeed, let x be any real. Between any two distinct reals lies some rational, so for each natural n there is some rational rn such that nx − b < rn < nx − a, and hence such that nx − rn ∈ [a, b]. |f (nx − rn)| = |nf (x) − crn| = |n(f (x) − cx) + c(nx − rn)| ≥ n|f (x) − cx| − |c(nx − rn)| |f (nx − rn)| + |c(nx − rn)| ≥ n|f (x) − cx|. Now nx − rn ∈ [a, b], so c(nx − rn) and f (nx − rn) are bounded as n increases. Hence n|f (x) − cx| must be bounded too; it follows that |f (x) − cx| = 0, so f (x) = cx. 2 4 Transforming the Cauchy equation Many similar functional equations can be solved by an analogous process of 1. induction 2. extension to rationals 3. extension to reals, or alternatively just by transforming the equation into the Cauchy equation. Example 1. Find all monotonic functions f : R → R+ such that for all x and y, f (x + y) = f (x)f (y). Solution: Because f (x) > 0 for all x, we can deﬁne some new function g : R → R by g(x) = log f (x). As the composition of monotonic functions, g is also monotonic. Rewriting the functional equation in terms of g, we ﬁnd that for all x and y, g(x + y) = g(x) + g(y). That is, g satisﬁes the Cauchy functional equation; hence there is some c ∈ R such that for all real x, g(x) = cx and f (x) = eg(x) = ecx. Equivalently, f (x) = a x for some ﬁxed a > 0. It is easy to check that all such functions are solutions to the given problem. Example 2. Find all continuous functions f : R → R such that for all x and y, f (xy) = f (x)f (y). Solution: Suppose that for some k ̸= 0, f (k) = 0. Then for all real x, f (x) = f (k)f ( x k ) = 0f ( x k ) = 0. Clearly this zero function is a valid solution. So let’s look for other solutions to the equation. Clearly any such solution has f (x) ̸= 0 for all x ̸= 0. Also, for any x ≥ 0, f (x) = f ( √x) 2 ≥ 0. So for any x > 0 f (x) > 0. It follows that g(t) = log f (e t) is well-deﬁned for all t ∈ R. As the composition of continuous functions, g is also continuous. Rewriting the functional equation in terms of g, we ﬁnd that for all real s and t, g(s + t) = g(s) + g(t). That is, g satisﬁes the Cauchy functional equation; hence there is some c ∈ R such that for all real t, g(t) = ct, and for all et = x > 0, f (x) = eg(log x) = ec log x = xc. As f is continuous, f (x) must be bounded as x tends to zero; hence c ≥ 0. Then as f (−1)2 = f (1) = 1 c = 1, f (−1) = ±1, and for all negative x f (x) = f (−1)f (−x) = f (−1)xc. If c = 0, f (x) = 1 for all x > 0, and f (x) = f (−1) for all x < 0. So in this case, by continuity, f (0) = 1 and f (−1) = 1, yielding the (valid) solution f (x) = 1 to the original equation. Otherwise by continuity f (0) = lim x→0 f (x) = 0. These conditions yield two potential families of nonzero solutions: f (x) = { xc, x ≥ 0 (−x)c, x < 0 and f (x) = { xc, x ≥ 0 −(−x) c, x < 0. Again, it is easy to check that these are valid solutions. 3 5 Problems 1. (IMO Shortlist 2003) Find all nondecreasing functions f : R → R such that f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1, and for all real x and y such that x < 1 < y f (x) + f (y) = f (x)f (y) + f (x + y − xy). 2.
