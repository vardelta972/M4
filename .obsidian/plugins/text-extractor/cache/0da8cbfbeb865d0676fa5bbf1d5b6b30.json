Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 16 5. Clearly P(n) × P(n + 1) is of fourth degree in ‘n’ as P(n) and P(n+1) are of second degree each in n, and so P(n) × P(n+1) will be a polynomial of 4th degree in n, with leading coefficient 1. So, if there exists an M so that P(M) = 𝑃(𝑛) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1), then M must be in the form of quadratic in n, with leading coefficient 1. Let M = 𝑛2 + 𝑐𝑛 + 𝑑, where c and d are integers. Now P(M) = 𝑃(𝑛2 + 𝑐𝑛 + 𝑑) = (𝑛2 + 𝑐𝑛 + 𝑑) 2 + 𝑎(𝑛2 + 𝑐𝑛 + 𝑑) + 𝑏 = 𝑛4 + 2𝑐𝑛3 + (𝑐2 + 2𝑑 + 𝑎)𝑛2 + (2𝑐𝑑 + 𝑎𝑐)𝑛 + 𝑑2 + 𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃(𝑛) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1) = (𝑛2 + 𝑎𝑛 + 𝑏)[(𝑛 + 1)2 + 𝑎(𝑛 + 1) + 𝑏] = 𝑛4 + 2(𝑎 + 1)𝑛3 + [(𝑎 + 1)2 + (𝑎 + 2𝑏)]𝑛2 + (𝑎 + 1)(𝑎 + 2𝑏)𝑛 + 𝑏(𝑎 + 𝑏 + 1) Now comparing, the coefficients of n3 constant terms of P(M) and P(n) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1), we get 2𝑐 = 2(𝑎 + 1) ⇒ 𝑐 = (𝑎 + 1) And 𝑑2 + 𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏 = 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑏2 + 𝑏 ⇒ 𝑑2 − 𝑏2 + 𝑎𝑑 − 𝑎𝑏 = (𝑑 − 𝑏)(𝑑 + 𝑎 + 𝑏) = 0 ⇒ 𝑑 = 𝑏 𝑜𝑟 𝑑 = −(𝑎 + 𝑏) Using these values of 𝑑 = 𝑏 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑐 = 𝑎 + 1, the coefficient of n2 and n in P(M) are 𝑐2 + 2𝑑 + 𝑎 = (𝑎 + 1) 2 + 2𝑏 + 𝑎 And 2cd+ac = 2 (a+1) b+ a(a+1) = (𝑎 + 1)(2𝑏 + 𝑎) respectively But these are the coefficients of n2 and n in P(n) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1). Thus, with these values for c and d, P(M) = 𝑃(𝑛) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1). So, the M of the desired property is n 2+(a+1)n+b. Thus, we can verify that 𝑑 = −(𝑎 + 𝑏), 𝑐 = (𝑎 + 1), 𝑖𝑓 𝑃(𝑀)𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃(𝑛) × 𝑃(𝑛 + 1) are identical and, hence, show that there exists exactly one M for every n which is a function of n, i.e. 𝑀 = 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑛2 + (𝑎 + 1)𝑛 + 𝑏 6.

We shall use the identity 𝑎3 + 𝑏3 + 𝑐3 − 3𝑎𝑏𝑐 = 1 2 (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐)[(𝑎 − 𝑏)2 + (𝑏 − 𝑐)2 + (𝑐 − 𝑎)2] Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 17 Writing a= 𝑥, 𝑏 = 5 1/3𝑦, 𝑐 = 52/3𝑧 in the given equation, it can be written as 𝑥3 + (5 1 3𝑦) 3 + (5 2 3𝑧) 3 − 3 × 𝑥 × 5 1/3𝑦 × 52/3𝑧 = 0 ∴ 1 2 (𝑥 + 51 3𝑦 + 52 3𝑦) [(𝑥 − 51 3𝑦) 2 + (51 3𝑦 − 52 3𝑧) 2 + (52 3𝑧 − 𝑥) 2] ⇒ (𝑥 + 51 3𝑦 + 52 3𝑧) = 0 𝑜𝑟 [(𝑥 − 51 3𝑦) 2 + (51 3𝑦 − 52 3𝑦) 2 + (52 3𝑧 − 𝑥) 2] = 0 If 𝑥 + 5 1/3𝑦 + 52/3𝑧 = 0, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 5 1/3𝑦 + 52/3𝑧 = −𝑥 Clearly the left hand side is irrational, when y and z are integers other than zero and the right hand side is also an integer. So 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 0 is a solution. If (𝑥 − 5 1 3𝑦) 2 + (5 1 3𝑦 − 5 2 3𝑧) 2 + (5 2 3𝑧 − 𝑥) 2 = 0, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑥 = 5 1/3𝑦, 𝑦 = 5 1/3𝑧 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥 = 52/3𝑧. Again this is possible only when 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 0 as we need integer values for x, y, and z. Aliter : number theoretic solution 𝑥3 + 5𝑦3 + 25𝑧3 − 15𝑥𝑦𝑧 = 0 ⇒ 𝑥3 = 5(3𝑥𝑦𝑧 − 𝑦3 − 5𝑧3) ……….(1) ⇒ 5 𝑥3 and hence 5/x. Let 𝑥 = 5𝑥1 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑥3 = 125𝑥13 So that the equation becomes 𝑦2 = 5𝑥1𝑦𝑧 − 25𝑥13 − 5𝑧3 ⇒ 5 𝑦 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑙𝑒𝑡 𝑦 = 5𝑦1 Again the equation becomes 𝑧3 = 15𝑧𝑥1𝑦1 − 5𝑥13 − 25𝑦13 ⇒ 5 𝑧 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡𝑎𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑧 = 5𝑧1 We get 𝑥13 + 5𝑦13 + 25𝑧13 − 15𝑥1𝑦1𝑧1 = 0 ……….(2) This implies that if (x, y, z) is an integral solution, then (x/5, y/5, z/5) is also an integral solution to eq. (1). Arguing in the same way we find 𝑥2 = 𝑥1 5 , 𝑦2 = 𝑦1 5 , 𝑧2 = 𝑧1 5 𝑜𝑟, 𝑥2 = 𝑥 52 , 𝑦2 = 𝑦 52 , 𝑧2 = 𝑧 52 Is also an integral solution and thus, by induction method, we get 𝑥𝑛 = 𝑥 5𝑛 , 𝑦𝑛 = 𝑦 5𝑛 , 𝑧𝑛 = 𝑧 5𝑛 Is an integral solution for all 𝑛 ≥ 0. This mean that x, y and z are multiple of 5n, for all 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁. This is possible only when x, y, z are all zero. 8.

(1), (2), and (3) by xyz = 24, we can get 𝑥 = 16 24 , 𝑦 = 81 24 , 𝑧 = 256 24 ⇒ 𝑥 = 2 3 , 𝑦 = 27 8 , 𝑧 = 32 3 9. If possible, let us express 𝑥4 + 26𝑥3 + 52𝑥2 + 78𝑥 + 1989 ≡ (𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏)(𝑥2 + 𝑐𝑥 + 𝑑) By comparing coefficients of both sides, we get a + c = 26……….(1) ac+b+d= 52………..(2) bc + ad= 78………(3) bd = 1989 = 13 × 32 × 17 ………..(4) Now, we see that 13 is a divisor of 26, 52, 78 and 1989 and 13 is a prime number. Thus, 13/ b.d. ⇒ 13 divides one of b or d but not both. If 13/b say and 13’/d, them from eq. (3), 13/a. Now, 13/ac and 13/b, and 13/52. ∴ 13/d, from (2) is a contradiction. Such a factorization is not prime. ∴ 13’/d, it is a contradiction. So if 13/d and 13/b, then again from eq. (3), 13/c. [From eq. (1) 13/a also]. Now, 𝑏 = 52 − 𝑎𝑐 − 𝑑. 13/b, 13/52, 13/ac, 13/d but it is again a contradiction. So there does not exist quadratic polynomials p(x) and q(x) with integral coefficients such that f(x) = 𝑝(𝑥) × 𝑞(𝑥). Similarly, if p(x) is a cubic polynomial and q(x) is a linear one then let 𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑥3 + 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 𝑞(𝑥) = (𝑥 + 𝑑) 𝑥4 + 26𝑥3 + 52𝑥2 + 78𝑥 + 13 × 32 × 17 = (𝑥3 + 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐)(𝑥 + 𝑑) Again comparing coefficients 𝑎 + 𝑑 = 26 … … (5) 𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏 = 52 … … … . . (6) 𝑏𝑑 + 𝑐 = 78 … … … . (7) 𝑐𝑑 = 13 × 32 × 17 … … … (8) Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 19 As before 13 divides exactly one of c and d. If 13/d, then 13’/c, then by eq. (7), 13/bd, 13’/c and 13/78 = 𝑏𝑑 + 𝑐 is a contradiction. So let 13/c, 13’/d. By eq. (7), 13/b, By eq. (6), 13/b and 13/52 ⇒ 13/𝑎𝑑 ⇒ 13/𝑎 , as 13/d. By eq. (5), 13/a, 13/d and 13/26 = 𝑎 + 𝑑 (a contradiction) and hence there does not exist any polynomials p(x) and q(x) as assumed and hence the result. 10. x, y, z are integers and 5 is a prime number and given equation is 𝑥 𝑦𝑧. 𝑦 𝑧𝑥. 𝑧𝑥𝑦 = 5𝑥𝑦𝑧 Dividing both sides of the equation by xyz, 𝑥 𝑦𝑧−1. 𝑦 𝑧𝑥−1. 𝑧𝑥𝑦−1 = 5 So the different possibilities are 𝑥 𝑦𝑧−1 = 5 𝑦 𝑧𝑥−1 = 1 𝑧𝑥𝑦−1 = 1 | 𝑜𝑟 𝑥 𝑦𝑧−1 = 1 𝑦 𝑧𝑥−1 = 5 𝑧𝑥𝑦−1 = 1 | 𝑜𝑟 𝑥 𝑦𝑧−1 = 1 𝑦 𝑧𝑥−1 = 1 𝑧𝑥𝑦−1 = 5 | Taking the first column 𝑥 = 5, 𝑦2 − 1 = 1; 𝑦 𝑧 = 2, 𝑦 = 2, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑧 = 1 And these values are satisfying the other expressions in the first column. Similarly from the second column, we get 𝑦 = 5, 𝑧 = 2, 𝑥 = 1 and from the third column, we get 𝑧 = 5, 𝑥 = 2, 𝑦 = 1. 11. If 𝑘 = 1 𝑃1(𝑥) = 𝑥9 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 = 𝑥9 − 𝑥4 + 𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 = 𝑥4(𝑥5 − 1) + (𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1) = 𝑥4(𝑥 − 1)(𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1) + (𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1) = (𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1)[𝑥4(𝑥 − 1) + 1] Thus, 𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 is a non−trivial polynomial divisor of 𝑃1(𝑥). 𝑃𝑘(𝑥) = 𝑥(5𝑘+4) − 𝑥4 + (𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1) = 𝑥4[𝑥5𝑘 − 1] + (𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1) (𝑥5 − 1) divides (𝑥5) 𝑘 − 1, 𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 divides 𝑥5 − 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑥5𝑘 − 1. Therefore 𝑥4 + 𝑥3 + 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠 𝑃𝑘(𝑥) for all k. 12. Suppose there exists an integer b such that f(b) = 1993 Let 𝑔(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥) − 1991. Now, g is a polynomial with integer coefficients and 𝑔(𝑎𝑖) = 0𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑖 = 1,2,3,4 Thus (𝑥 − 𝑎1)(𝑥 − 𝑎2)(𝑥 − 𝑎3)𝑎𝑛𝑑 (𝑥 − 𝑎4) are all factors of g(x). So, 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥 − 𝑎1)(𝑥 − 𝑎2)(𝑥 − 𝑎3)(𝑥 − 𝑎4) × ℎ(𝑥) Where h(x) is polynomial with integer coefficients. 𝑔(𝑏) = 𝑓(𝑏) − 1991 = 1993 − 1991 = 2 (by our choice of b) But 𝑔(𝑏) = (𝑏 − 𝑎1)(𝑏 − 𝑎2)(𝑏 − 𝑎3)(𝑏 − 𝑎4)ℎ(𝑏) = 2 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 20 Thus, (𝑏 − 𝑎1)(𝑏 − 𝑎2)(𝑏 − 𝑎3)(𝑏 − 𝑎4) are all divisors of 2 and are distinct. ∴ (𝑏 − 𝑎1)(𝑏 − 𝑎2)(𝑏 − 𝑎3)(𝑏 − 𝑎4)𝑎𝑟𝑒 1, −1, 2, 2, −2 in some order and h(b) is an integer. ∴ 𝑔(𝑏) = 4. ℎ(𝑏) ≠ 2. Hence such a and b does not exist. 13. Let x, y, z be the roots of the cubic equation 𝑡3 − 𝑎𝑡2 + 𝑏𝑡 − 𝑐 = 0 ………(1) 𝑠1 = 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 𝑎 ………..(2) 𝑠2 = 𝑥𝑦 + 𝑦𝑧 + 𝑧𝑥 = 𝑏 ………….(3) ⇒ 2𝑥𝑦 + 2𝑦𝑧 + 2𝑧𝑥 = 2𝑏 …………(4) From eq. (2) we get 𝑎 = 3. From eq. (2) and eq. (3) we get 2𝑏 = 2𝑥𝑦 + 2𝑦𝑧 + 2𝑧𝑥 = (𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧) 2 − (𝑥2 + 𝑦2 + 𝑧2) = 9 − 3 = 6 ⇒ 𝑏 = 3 Since x, y and z are the roots of eq. (1), substituting and adding, we get (𝑥3 + 𝑦3 + 𝑧3) − 𝑎(𝑥2 + 𝑦2 + 𝑧2) + 𝑏(𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧) − 3𝑐 = 0 ⇒ 3 − 3𝑎 + 3𝑏 − 3𝑐 = 0 ⇒ 3 − 9 + 9 − 3𝑐 = 0 ⇒ 𝑐 = 1 Thus eq. (1) becomes 𝑡3 − 3𝑡2 + 3𝑡 − 1 = 0 ⇒ (𝑡 − 1) 3 = 0 Thus, the roots are 1, 1, 1. Hence 𝑥 = 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 1 is the only solution for the given equation. 14. 1 + 𝑥𝑛 + 𝑥2𝑛 + ⋯ + 𝑥𝑚𝑛 = 𝑥(𝑚+1)𝑛−1 𝑥𝑛−1 (verify) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 1 + 𝑥 + 𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑥𝑚 = 𝑥𝑚+1−1 𝑥−1 We must find m, and n so that 1+𝑥𝑛+𝑥2𝑛+⋯+𝑥𝑚𝑛 1+𝑥+𝑥2+⋯+𝑥𝑚 is a polynomial 𝑥(𝑚+1)𝑛−1 𝑥𝑛 −1 ÷ 𝑥𝑚+1−1 𝑥−1 = [𝑥(𝑚+1)𝑛−1](𝑥−1) (𝑥𝑛−1)(𝑥𝑚+1−1) must be a polynomial. Now, if k and l are relatively prime, then (𝑥𝑘 − 1) and (𝑥1 − 1) have just one common factor. For the roots of 𝑥𝑘 − 1 = 0, say 1, w1, w2, …….wk−1 are all distinct factor. Similarly, also those of 𝑥1 − 1 = 1, 𝑤′1, 𝑤′2, … , 𝑤′𝑟−1 is distinct factor. By De Moivre's formula, the roots of 𝑥𝑘 − 1 are cos 2𝑛𝜋 𝑘 + 𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝑛𝜋 𝑘 For n = 0, 1,2 … , 𝑘 − 1 and those of 𝑥1 − 1 are cos 2𝑛𝜋 𝑙 + 𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝑛𝜋 𝑙 For n= 0, 1, 2, … 𝑙 − 1. If l and k are prime integer other than zero, Roots will be cos 2𝑛𝜋 𝑙 + 𝑖 𝑠𝑖𝑛 2𝑛𝜋 𝑙 𝑎𝑛𝑑 cos 2𝑛𝜋 𝑘 + 𝑖 sin 2𝑛𝜋 𝑘 respectively. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 21 Since all the factors of 𝑥𝑛(𝑚+1) − 1 are distinct, 𝑥𝑚+1 − 1, 𝑥𝑛 − 1 cannot have any common factors other than (x−1). Thus (m+1) and n must be relatively prime. Again 𝑥𝑛(𝑚+1) − 1 = (𝑥𝑛) 𝑚+1 − 1 = (𝑥𝑚+1) 𝑛 − 1. So 𝑥𝑛(𝑚+1) − 1 is divisible by (𝑥𝑛 − 1) and also by (𝑥𝑚+1) − 1. 𝑡ℎ𝑢𝑠, [𝑥(𝑚+1)𝑛 − 1](𝑥 − 1) (𝑥𝑛 − 1)(𝑥𝑚+1 − 1) Is a polynomial which shows that the condition (m + 1) and n must be relatively prime is also sufficient. 15. Consider the quadratic equation 𝑝 + 𝑞𝑡 + 𝑟𝑡2 + 𝑠𝑡3 = 𝑡4 Or, 𝑡4 − 𝑠𝑡3 − 𝑟𝑡2 − 𝑞𝑡 − 𝑝 = 0. Now, by our assumption of the problem, a1, a2, a3 and a4 are the solution of this equation and hence 𝑠1 = 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎3 + 𝑎4 = 𝑠 𝑠2 = (𝑎1 + 𝑎2)(𝑎3 + 𝑎4) + 𝑎1𝑎2 + 𝑎3𝑎4 = −𝑟 𝑠3 = 𝑎1𝑎2(𝑎3 + 𝑎4) + 𝑎3𝑎4(𝑎1 + 𝑎2) = 𝑞 𝑠4 = 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4 = −𝑝 The second system of equation is (𝑡2) 4 − 𝑤(𝑡2) 3 − 𝑧(𝑡2) 2 − 𝑦(𝑡2) − 𝑥 = 0 Putting 𝑡2 = 𝑢, we have 𝑢4 − 𝑤𝑢3 − 𝑧𝑢2 − 𝑦𝑢 − 𝑥 = 0 And the roots can be seen to be 𝑎12, 𝑎22, 𝑎32 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎42 And 𝑠1 = 𝑎12 + 𝑎22 + 𝑎32 + 𝑎42 = 𝑤 ⇒ 𝑤 = (∑ 𝑎𝑖)2 − 2 ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑗 = 𝑠2 + 2𝑟𝑖<𝑗 𝑠2 = ∑ 𝑎𝑖2𝑎𝑗2 = −𝑧 𝑖<𝑗 𝑜𝑟, 𝑧 = − ∑ 𝑎𝑖2𝑎𝑗2 𝑖<𝑗 = −(∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑗) 𝑖<𝑗 2 + 2(∑ 𝑎𝑖) ∑ 𝑎𝑖𝑎𝑗𝑎𝑘 − 2𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4 𝑖<𝑗<𝑘 For (𝑎12𝑎22 + 𝑎12𝑎32 + 𝑎12𝑎42 + 𝑎22𝑎32 + 𝑎22𝑎42 + 𝑎32𝑎42) = (𝑎1𝑎2 + 𝑎1𝑎3 + 𝑎1𝑎4 + 𝑎2𝑎3 + 𝑎2𝑎4 + 𝑎3𝑎4)2 − 2(𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎3 + 𝑎4)(𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3 + 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎4 + 𝑎1𝑎3𝑎4 + 𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4) − 2𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4 Hence z = −𝑟2 + 2𝑞𝑠 + 2𝑝. 𝑠3 = 𝑎12𝑎22𝑎32 + 𝑎12𝑎22𝑎42 + 𝑎12𝑎32𝑎42 + 𝑎22𝑎32𝑎42 = 𝑦 𝑦 = (𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3 + 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎4 + 𝑎1𝑎3𝑎4 + 𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4)2 − 2(𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4)(𝑎1𝑎2 + 𝑎1𝑎3 + 𝑎1𝑎4 + 𝑎2𝑎3 + 𝑎2𝑎4 + 𝑎3𝑎4) = 𝑞2 − 2𝑝𝑟 Finally, 𝑠4 = 𝑎12𝑎22𝑎32𝑎42 = −𝑥 𝑜𝑟, 𝑥 = −(𝑎12𝑎22𝑎32𝑎42) = −(𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4) 2 = −𝑝2 ∴ 𝑥 = −𝑝2, 𝑦 = 𝑞2 − 2𝑝𝑟, 𝑧 = −𝑟2 + 2𝑞𝑠 + 2𝑝 And 𝑤 = 𝑠2 + 2𝑟 is the solution. 16. 2𝑚 = (1 + 1) 𝑚 = 𝐶0 + 𝐶2 + ⋯ + 𝐶𝑚 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑚 =1, 2, …n + 1 Now consider the polynomial Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 22 𝑓(𝑥) = 2 [( 𝑥 − 1 0 ) + ( 𝑥 − 1 1 ) + ( 𝑥 − 1 2 ) + ⋯ + ( 𝑥 − 1 𝑛 )] 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 ( 𝑥 − 1 𝑟 ) = (𝑥 − 1)(𝑥 − 2) … (𝑥 − 𝑟) 𝑟 Clearly, f(x) is of degree n. Now 𝑓(𝑟) = 2 [( 𝑟 − 1 0 ) + ( 𝑟 − 1 1 ) + ⋯ + ( 𝑟 − 1 𝑟 − 1) + ( 𝑟 − 1 𝑟 ) + ⋯ + ( 𝑟 − 1 𝑛 )] 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛 + 1. But (𝑟−1 𝑘 ) = 0 for all k> r−1 where k and are integers. = 2. 2𝑟−1 = 2𝑟 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑟 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛 + 1. ∴ Thus, f(x) is the required polynomial. ∴ 𝑓(𝑛 + 2) = 2 [( 𝑛 + 1 0 ) + (𝑛 + 1 1 ) + ⋯ + ( 𝑛 + 1 𝑛 ) + ( 𝑛 + 1 𝑛 + 1) − 1] = 2[2𝑛+1 − 1] = 2𝑛+2 − 2 Similarly, P(x+2) = 2𝑥+2 − 2. 17. If 𝑘 = 1; 1 < 𝑥 < 2 …….(1) 𝑘 = 2; 2 < 𝑥2 < 3 ………(2) 𝑘 = 3; 3 < 𝑥3 < 4 ………..(3) 𝑘 = 4; 4 < 𝑥4 < 5 ……….(4) 𝑘 = 5; 5 > 𝑥5 > 6 ………..(5) ………………………….. Consider the inequality 2 < 𝑥2 < 3, then x should lie between √2 and √3. i.e. √2 < 𝑥 < √3. Now, 1 < √2 < 𝑥 < √3 < √4 = 2 And hence satisfies eq. (1) and eq. (2) of the inequalities √2 < 𝑥 < √3 ⇒ (√2) 3 < 𝑥3 < (√3) 3 ⇒ 2√2 < 𝑥3 < 3√3 Applying this in eq. (3), 3 < 2√2 < 𝑥3 < 3√3 𝐵𝑢𝑡 3√3 > 4 Now picking up the third inequality, we have 3 < 𝑥3 < 4 ⇒ √3 3 < 𝑥 √4 3 ⇒ √9 3 < 𝑥2 < √16 3 = 2√2 3 Since 23 < 9, 2 < √9 3 < 𝑥2 < √16 3 ≮ √16 3 = 3. Again this value of x falls as x may be lying between 3 = √27 3 and √16 3 . Now we have the same problem with lower limit of x4 for the 4th inequality. So, trying with √3 3 < 𝑥 < √5 4 , we shall get 34<x12<53 or 81<x12<125. 1 < √3 3 < 𝑥 < √5 4 < √16 4 = 2 is true. 2 = √8 3 < √9 3 < 𝑥2 < √524 < √344 = 3 Hence the second of the inequalities also true. Again by our choice of x, Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 23 √3 3 < 𝑥 ⇒ 3 < 𝑥3 < √534 (= √125 4 ) < √444 = 4 (∵ 125 < 44 = 256) For the 4th row, √433 < √343 < 𝑥4 < √544 = 5 is again true. For the 5th row, √353 < 𝑥5 < √554 √533 < √353 < 𝑥5 < √554 ≰ √644 (∵ √554 = √3125 4 ≰ √1296 4 ) However, for the third row, We have 3 < 𝑥3 and for the fifth row and we have, 𝑥5 < 6 So 35 < 𝑥15 < 63 for such x. But this leads to the contradiction 243 < 𝑥15 < 216 and hence the greatest n for which the rows of the given inequalities hold is 4 and for any x such that √3 3 < 𝑥 < √5 5 will satisfy these inequalities. 18. We have 𝑓: 𝑁 → 𝑍. And f(m) > f(n) for m > n. ⇒ 𝑓(1) < 𝑓(2) = 2 2 = 𝑓(2) = 𝑓(1 × 2) = 𝑓(1) × 𝑓(2) = 𝑓(1) × 2 ∴ 𝑓(1) = 2 2 = 1 Now, 𝑓(4) > 𝑓(3) > 𝑓(2) = 2 And 𝑓(4) = 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(2) = 2 × 2 = 4 And so 4 > f(3) > 2 and f(3) is an integer and hence f(3) = 3 And f(6) > f(5) > f(4) ⇒ 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(3) > 𝑓(5) > 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(2) ⇒ 2 × 3 > 𝑓(5) > 4 ⇒ 𝑓(5) = 5 So we guess that f(n)= 𝑛. Let us prove it. We will use mathematical induction for proving. f(n) = n is true for 𝑛 = 1,2. Let us assume that the result is true for all m<n and then we shall prove it for n, where n > 2. If n is even then let n = 2m 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑓(2𝑚) = 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(𝑚) = 2 × 𝑚 = 2𝑚 = 𝑛 If n is odd and n=2m+1, then n > 2m. 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑓(2𝑚 + 1) > 𝑓(2𝑚) = 2𝑚 And 𝑓(2𝑚 + 2) = 𝑓2(𝑚 + 1) = 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(𝑚 + 1) 𝑛 = 2𝑚 + 1 m+1 < n, m < n and hence f(2m+2)= 𝑓[2(𝑚 + 1)] = 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(𝑚 + 1) = 2 × (𝑚 + 1) Thus, 2m< f(2m+1) < f(2m+2) = 2(𝑚 + 1) = 2𝑚+2 ⇒ 2𝑚 < 𝑓(2𝑚 + 1) < 2𝑚 + 2 There is exactly one integer 2m+1 between 2m and 2m+2 and hence Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 24 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑓(2𝑚 + 1) = (2𝑚 + 1) = 𝑛 Thus 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 Hence f(1998) = 1998. 19. Let the number of pages in the novel be n. Since, the number of pages after a leaf is firm is 15,000, the sum of the numbers on all the pages must exceed 15,000. 𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝑛(𝑛+1) 2 > 15,000 ⇒ 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) > 30,000 ∴ (𝑛 + 1) 2 > 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) > 30,000 > 1732 ⇒ (𝑛 + 1) > 173 ⇒ 𝑛 > 172 ………(1) The sum of the numbers on the page torn should be less than or equal to (n−1)+n= 2𝑛 − 1. Hence (1 + 2 + … + n)−(2n−1)≤ 15,000 ⇒ 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) − 2(2𝑛 − 1) ≤ 30,000 ⇒ 𝑛2 − 3𝑛 + 2 ≤ 30,000 ⇒ (𝑛 − 2(𝑛 − 1) ≤ 30,000 ⇒ (𝑛 − 2) 2 < (𝑛 − 2)(𝑛 − 1) ≤ 30,000 < 1742 ⇒ (𝑛 − 2) < 174 ⇒ 𝑛 < 176 …….(2) By eq. (1) and (2), we get 172<n<176 So n could be one of 173, 174 or 175. If n = 173, then 𝑛(𝑛 + 2) 2 = 173 × 174 2 = 15,051 Thus the sum of the numbers on the torn pages = 15015 − 15,000 =51 and this could be x + (x+1)= 2𝑥 + 1 = 51. So, the page numbers on the torn pages = 51+1 2 = 26 𝑎𝑛𝑑 51−1 2 = 25 If 𝑛 = 174, then 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) 2 = 174 × 175 2 = 15,225. So the sum of the numbers on the torn pages 15225 − 15000 = 225 and in this case, the numbers on the torn pages = 225−1 2 = 112 𝑎𝑛𝑑 225+1 2 = 113. (But actually the smaller number on the torn page should be odd and hence, though it is theoretically correct, but no acceptable in reality). If 𝑛 = 175, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑛(𝑛+1) 2 = 175×176 2 = 15,400 and the sum of the numbers on the torn page is 400 (= 15400 − 15000) which is not possible because the sum should be an odd number and hence this value of n also should be rejected. So the numbers on the torn page should be 25 and 26 and the number of pages is 173. 20. Case 1: 𝑛 =4k + 1 𝑛 = 4𝑘 + 1 = (4𝑘 + 1) × (1)2𝑘 × (−1)2𝑘 = (4𝑘 + 1) + (1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1)⏟ 2𝑘 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 + [(−1) + (−1) + ⋯ + (−1)⏟ 2𝑘 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 25 Case 2: 𝑛 = 4𝑙 here there are two cases where (a) l is even with 𝑙 ≥ 2 and (b) l is odd with 𝑙 ≥ 3 (a) 𝑛 = 4𝑙, 𝑙 is even.

(1) and eq. (2), we get 𝑤 = 3𝑙 − 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑣 = 𝑙. (b) l is odd. With 𝑙 ≥ 3. Choose w and v such that 𝑛 = 4𝑙 = (2𝑙) × (−2) × (1)𝑤(−1)𝑣 = 2𝑙 + (−2) + (1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1)⏟ 𝑤 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 + [(−1) + (−1) + ⋯ + (−1)]⏟ 𝑣 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 Again since there are w + v + 2 factors, We have w + v + 2 = 4𝑙 Or 𝑤 + 𝑣 = 4𝑙 − 2 And 4𝑙 = 2𝑙 − 2 + 𝑤 − 𝑣 (by definition of good integer) ⇒ 𝑤 − 𝑣 = 2𝑙 + 2 Solving 𝑤 = 3𝑙 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑣 = 𝑙 − 2 Since l is odd and 𝑙 ≥ 3 𝑙 − 2 ≥ 1 Now, n = 4𝑙 = 2𝑙 × (−2) × (1)3𝑙 × (−1)𝑙−2 = 2𝑙 + (−2) + (1 + 1 + ⋯ + 1)⏟ 3𝑙 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 + [(−1) + (−1) + ⋯ + (−1)⏟ (𝑙−2)𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 = 2𝑙 − 2 + 3𝑙 − (𝑙 − 2) = 4𝑙 21. Without loss of generality, we may assume 𝑎 ≥ 𝑏 ≥ 𝑐, so that |𝑐2 − 𝑎2| = 𝑎2 − 𝑐2 is the maximum of |𝑎2 − 𝑏2|, |𝑏2 − 𝑐2|𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝑐2 − 𝑎2|. It is enough to prove that 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + 𝑐2 − √3(𝑎2 − 𝑏2) > 0 Now 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + 𝑐2 − √3(𝑎2 − 𝑐2) > 𝑎2 + (𝑎 − 𝑐) 2 + 𝑐2 − √3(𝑎2 − 𝑐2) (as b > a –c, by triangle inequality) > 2𝑎2 + 2𝑐2 − 2𝑎𝑐 − √3𝑎2 + √3𝑐2 > (2 − √3)𝑎2 + (2 + √3)𝑐2 − 2𝑎𝑐 But (√3 − 1) 2 = 2(2 − √3) And (√3 + 1) 2 = 2(2 + √3) So 𝑎2 + 𝑏2 + 𝑐2 − √3(𝑎2 − 𝑐2) > [(√3−1)𝑎]2−4𝑎𝑐+[(√3+1)𝑐]2 2 = 1 2 [(√3 − 1)𝑎 − (√3 + 1)𝑐]2 ≥ 0 And hence the result. 22. By checking the first four values we find 3 1/3 to be the largest. We will prove that {𝑛 1 𝑛} , 𝑛 ≥ 3 is a decreasing sequence. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 26 𝑛1 𝑛 > (𝑛 + 1) 1 𝑛+1 ⇔ 𝑛𝑛+1 > (𝑛 + 1) 𝑛 ⇔ 𝑛 > (1 + 1 𝑛) 𝑛 Now, (1 + 1 𝑛) 𝑛 = 1 + 𝑛. 1 𝑛 + 𝑛(𝑛−1) 2 × 1 𝑛2 + 𝑛(𝑛−1)(𝑛−2) 6 . 1 𝑛3 + ⋯ = 1 + 1 + 1 2 (1 − 1 𝑛) + 1 6 (1 − 1 𝑛) (1 − 2 𝑛) + ⋯ < 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 4 + 1 8 + ⋯ < 3 𝑜𝑟, 3 > (1 + 1 𝑛) 𝑛 ∴ 𝑖𝑓 𝑛 ≥ 3, 𝑛 1 𝑛 > (𝑛 + 1) 1 𝑛+1 i.e., {𝑛 1 𝑛 } is decreasing for 𝑛 ≥ 3. But 3 1/3 is also greater than 1 and 2 1/2. Hence 3 1/3 is the largest. 23. Taking 𝑘 = 1, since 𝑎1 𝑘 + 𝑎2 𝑘 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛 𝑘 ≥ 0, And for 𝑘 = 1, we have 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛 ≥ 0……..(1) And since 𝑎1 ≥ 𝑎2 ≥ 𝑎3 ≥ ⋯ ≥ 𝑎𝑛, 𝑎1 ≥ 0 ……..(2) And if all 𝑎1, 𝑖 = 1,2, … 𝑛 are positive a1 is the maximum of all 𝑎𝑖𝑠 ∴ 𝑝 = |𝑎1| = 𝑎1 Suppose that some of the 𝑎𝑖𝑠 are negative and p≠ 𝑎1, then an < 0 and hence 𝑝 = |𝑎𝑛| Let r be an index such that 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 = ⋯ = 𝑎𝑟+1 < 𝑎𝑟 ≤ 𝑎𝑟−1 ≤ ⋯ ≤ 𝑎1 Then 𝑎1 𝑘 + 𝑎2 𝑘 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑟−1𝑘 + 𝑎𝑟 𝑘 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑛 𝑘 = 𝑎𝑛 𝑘 {(𝑎1 𝑎𝑛) 𝑘 + (𝑎2 𝑎𝑛) 𝑘 + ⋯ + ( 𝑎𝑟−1 𝑎𝑛 ) 𝑘 + (𝑎𝑟 𝑎𝑛) 𝑘 + (𝑛 − 𝑟)} = 𝑎𝑛 𝑘𝑋 Where the value of the second bracket is taken as X. Since |𝑎1 𝑎𝑛| , |𝑎2 𝑎𝑛| , … , |𝑎𝑟 𝑎𝑛| are all less than 1, so their kth powers are all less than these fractions and by taking k sufficiently large, which would make X > 0 and 𝑋𝑎𝑛 𝑘 < 0 for k odd, a contradiction and hence 𝑝 = 𝑎1. Taking 𝑥 > 𝑎1, then by AM−GM inequality, (𝑥 − 𝑎2)(𝑥 − 𝑎3)(𝑥 − 𝑎4) … (𝑥 − 𝑎𝑛) ≤ (∑ (𝑥 − 𝑎𝑗) 𝑛 𝑗=2 𝑛 − 1 ) 𝑛−1 ≤ ((𝑛 − 1)𝑥 + 𝑎1 𝑛 − 1 ) 𝑛−1 [∵ ∑ 𝑎𝑖 ≥ 0] 𝑏 𝑖=1 = (𝑥 + 𝑎1 𝑛 − 1)𝑛−1 ≤ 𝑥𝑛−1 + 𝑥𝑛−2. 𝑎1 + 𝑥𝑛−2𝑎1 2 + ⋯ + 𝑎1 𝑛−1 [Here we have used ( 𝑛−1 𝑟 ) ≤ (𝑛 − 1) 𝑟, 𝑟 ≥ 1] Multiplying both sides by (𝑥 − 𝑎1), we get (𝑥 − 𝑎1)(𝑥 − 𝑎2)(𝑥 − 𝑎3) … (𝑥 − 𝑎𝑛) ≤ (𝑥 − 𝑎1)(𝑥𝑛−1 + 𝑥𝑛−2𝑎1 + ⋯ + 𝑎1 𝑛−1 = 𝑥𝑛 − 𝑎1 𝑛. 24. 𝑎0 = 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎1 = 𝑎 > 2 and so a can be written as Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 27 𝑏 + 1 𝑏 = 𝑏2 + 1 𝑏 For real number b > 0 and 𝑎2 − 2 = 𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2 𝑛𝑜𝑤, 𝑎2 = (𝑎1 2 𝑎0 2 − 2) 𝑎1 = (𝑎2 1 − 2) 𝑎 = (𝑎2 − 2)𝑎 = (𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2) (𝑏 + 1 𝑏) = (𝑏3 + 1 𝑏3 + 𝑏 + 1 𝑏) = 𝑏6 + 1 + 𝑏4 + 𝑏2 𝑏3 = (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) 𝑏3 Similarly, 𝑎3 = [(𝑎2 𝑎1) 2 − 2] 𝑎2 = [(𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2) 2 − 2] 𝑎2 = [(𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2) 2 − 2] (𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2) (𝑏 + 1 𝑏) = (𝑏4 + 1 𝑏4) (𝑏2 + 1 𝑏2) (𝑏 + 1 𝑏) (𝑏22 + 1 𝑏22) (𝑏21 + 1 𝑏21) (𝑏20 + 1 𝑏20) (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1)(𝑏8 + 1)/𝑏7 And proceeding in this manner, we get 𝑎𝑛 = (𝑏2𝑛−1 + 1 𝑏2𝑛−1) (𝑏2𝑛 + 1 𝑏2𝑛) … (𝑏 + 1 𝑏) Hence, L.H.S. = ∑ 1/𝑎𝑖 𝑛 𝑖=0 = 1 + 𝑏 𝑏2 + 1 + 𝑏3 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) + 𝑏7 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1)(𝑏8 + 1) + ⋯ + 𝑏2𝑛−1 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) … (𝑏2𝑛 + 1) The right hand side of the inequality is 1 2 (𝑎 + 2 − √𝑎2 − 4) = 1 2 [𝑏 + 1 𝑏 + 2 − (𝑏 − 1 𝑏)] = (1 𝑏 + 1) You may know the following identity: ∑ 𝑎𝑗 (1 + 𝑎1) … (1 + 𝑎𝑛) 𝑛 𝑗=1 = 1 − 1 (1 + 𝑎1) … (1 + 𝑎𝑛) [This result is obtained by using partial fractions]. So the L.H.S. ∑ 1 𝑎𝑖 𝑛 𝑖=1 = 1 + 𝑏 𝑏2 + 1 + 𝑏3 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) + ⋯ + 𝑏2𝑛−1 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) … (𝑏2𝑛 + 1) ∑ 𝑏2𝑖 (𝑏2 + 1) … (𝑏2𝑖 + 1) 𝑛 𝑖=1 = 1 − 1 (𝑏2 + 1)(𝑏4 + 1) … (𝑏2𝑛 + 1) < 1 Now 𝐿. 𝐻.

Case I : if c, d ≥ 0, then 𝑃(1) = 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑑 ≤ 1 < 7 Case II: if 𝑑 ≤ 0 and 𝑐 ≥ 0, then |a|+|b|+|c|+|d|= 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑑 = (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑑) − 2𝑑 = 𝑃(1) − 2𝑃(0) ≤ 1 + 2 = 3 < 7 Case III: If 𝑑 ≥ 0, 𝑐 < 0 |a|+|b|+|c|+|d| = 𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐 + 𝑑 = 4 3 𝑃(1) − 1 3 𝑃(−1) − 8 3 𝑃 ( 1 2) + 8 3 𝑃 (− 1 2) ≤ 4 3 + 1 3 + 8 3 + 8 3 = 21 3 = 7 Case IV: d > 0, c > 0 |a|+|b|+|c|+|d| = 𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐 − 𝑑 5 3 𝑃(1) − 4𝑃 ( 1 2) + 4 3 𝑃 (− 1 2) ≤ 5 3 + 4 + 4 3 = 21 3 = 7 26. Here we use A.P. ≥ G.P. 𝑎 = (𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐) + (𝑎 − 𝑏 + 𝑐) 2 ≥ √(𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐)(𝑎 − 𝑏 + 𝑐) 𝑏 = (𝑏 + 𝑎 − 𝑐) + (𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑐) 2 ≥ √(𝑏 + 𝑎 − 𝑐)(𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑐) 𝑐 = (𝑐 + 𝑎 − 𝑏) + (𝑐 − 𝑎 + 𝑏) 2 ≥ √(𝑐 + 𝑎 − 𝑏)(𝑐 − 𝑎 + 𝑏) ∴ 𝑎. 𝑏. 𝑐. = [(𝑎+𝑏−𝑐)+(𝑎−𝑏+𝑐)][(𝑏+𝑎−𝑐)+(𝑏−𝑎+𝑐)][(𝑐+𝑎−𝑏)+(𝑐−𝑎+𝑏)] 8 ≥ √(𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐) − (𝑎 − 𝑏 + 𝑐)(𝑏 + 𝑎 − 𝑐)(𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑐)(𝑐 + 𝑎 − 𝑏)(𝑐 − 𝑎 + 𝑏) = (𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐)(𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑐)(𝑐 − 𝑏 + 𝑎) i.e., 𝑎𝑏𝑐 ≥ (𝑎 + 𝑏 − 𝑐)(𝑏 − 𝑎 + 𝑐)(𝑐 − 𝑏 + 𝑎) = (2 − 2𝑐)(2 − 2𝑎)(2 − 2𝑏) = 8(1 − 𝑐)(1 − 𝑎)(1 − 𝑏)[∵ 𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐 = 2] ∴ 𝑎 1 − 𝑎 . 𝑏 1 − 𝑏 . 𝑐 1 − 𝑐 ≥ 8 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 29 27. Taking 𝑥 = 1 in the given equation : (1 + 𝑥 + 𝑥2)25 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1𝑥 + 𝑎2𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑎50𝑥50 We get 325 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + ⋯ + 𝑎50 Similarly, 𝑥 = −1 gives 1 = 𝑎0 + 𝑎1 + 𝑎2 + ⋯ + 𝑎50 Adding these, we have 1 + 325 = 2(𝑎0 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎4 + ⋯ + 𝑎50) But 1 + 325 = 325 − 1 + 2 = 2(324 + 323 + 322 + ⋯ + 1 + 1) There are even number of odd terms in the braces, and hence the sum is even. This implies that 𝑎0 + 𝑎2 + 𝑎4 + ⋯ + 𝑎50 is even. 28. Assume, if possible 𝑓(𝑥) = (𝑥 + 𝑎)(𝑥3 + 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐) Comparing the coefficients of like powers of x, we get 𝑎 + 𝑏 = 26 𝑎𝑏 + 𝑐 = 52, 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑑 = 78, 𝑎𝑑 = 1989 But 1989 = 32. 13.17. Thus 13 divides ad and hence 13 divides a or d but not both. If 13 divides a then 13 divides 𝑑 = 78 − 𝑎𝑐 which is not possible. Suppose 13 divides d. Then 13 divides ac. But since 13 does not divide a, 13 divides c which implies 13 divides 𝑎𝑑 = 52 − 𝑐 and so b is divisible by 13 which in turn implies 13 divides 𝑎 = 26 − 𝑏, a contradiction. Therefore, f(x) has no linear factors: If 𝑓(𝑥) = (𝑥2 + 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏)(𝑥2 + 𝑐𝑥 + 𝑑), then again 𝑎 = 𝑐 = 26, 𝑏 + 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑑 = 52, 𝑎𝑑 + 𝑏𝑐 = 78 𝑏𝑑 = 1989 Since 1989= 32. 13.17, 13 divides bd. This implies that 13 divides b or d but not both. If 13 divides b, the 13 divides ad (= 78 − 𝑏𝑐) and hence 13 divides a. But then 13 divides d (= 52 − 𝑏 − 𝑎𝑐) a contradiction. Similar argument shows that 13 divides d is also not possible. We conclude that f(x) cannot be written as a product of two polynomials with integral coefficients, each of degree < 4. 29. Consider 2001 numbers 1 𝑘 , 1001 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 3001 Using AM−HM inequality, we get ( ∑ 𝑘 3001 𝑘=1001 ) ( ∑ 1 𝑘 3001 𝑘=1001 ) > (2001) 2 But ∑ 𝑘 = (2001) 2 3001 𝑘=1001 Hence we get the inequality. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 30 ∑ 1 𝑘 > 1 3001 𝑘=1001 On the other hand, grouping 500 terms at a time, we also have 𝑆 = ∑ 1 𝑘 3001 𝑘=1001 < 500 1000 + 500 1500 + 500 2000 + 500 2500 + 1 3001 < 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + 1 5 + 1 3000 = 3851 3000 > 4 3 Note : We can sharpen the above inequality. Consider the sum 𝑆 = ∑ 1 𝑘 3𝑛+1 𝑘=𝑛+1 There are 2n+1 terms in the sum and the middle term is 1 2𝑛+1 . We can write the sum in the form 𝑆 = 1 2𝑛 + 1 + ∑ ( 1 2𝑛 + 1 + 𝑘 + 1 2𝑛 + 1 − 𝑘) 𝑛 𝑘=1 = 1 2𝑛 + 1 + 2 (2𝑛 + 1) ∑ 1 1 − ( 𝑘 2𝑛 + 1) 2 𝑛 𝑘=1 For 0 < a < ½, we have 1 + 𝑎 < 1 1 − 𝑎 < 1 + 2𝑎 Thus we get the bounds 1 2𝑛 + 1 + 2 2𝑛 + 1 ∑ [1 + ( 𝑘 2𝑛 + 1) 2] < 𝑆 𝑛 𝑘=1 And 𝑆 < 1 2𝑛 + 1 + 2 2𝑛 + 1 ∑ [1 + 2 ( 𝑘 2𝑛 + 1) 2] 𝑛 𝑘=1 . This on simplification gives 1 + 2 (2𝑛 + 1)3 ∑ 𝑘2 < 𝑆 𝑛 𝑘=1 < 1 + 4 (2𝑛 + 1)3 ∑ 𝑘2 𝑛 𝑘=1 . Now using the identity ∑ 𝑘2 = 𝑛(𝑛 + 1)(2𝑛 + 1) 6 𝑛 𝑘=1 The inequality simplifies to 1 + 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) 3(2𝑛 + 1)2 < 𝑆 < 1 + 2𝑛(𝑛 + 1) 3(2𝑛 + 1)2 But for 𝑛 ≥ 1, we also have 2 9 ≤ 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) (2𝑛 + 1)2 ≤ 1 4 This leads to 29 27 < 𝑆 < 7 6 30. We have, 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 4 − 𝑥 𝑦2 + 𝑧2 = 6 − 𝑥2 From Cauchy Schwarz inequality we get, 𝑦2 + 𝑧2 ≥ 1 2 (𝑦 + 𝑧) 2 Hence, 6 − 𝑥2 ≥ 1 2 (4 − 𝑥)2 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 31 This simplifies to (3x−2)(x−2)≤ 0. Hence we have 2/3 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 2. Suppose 𝑥 = 2. Then 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 2, 𝑦2 + 𝑧2 = 2 which has solution 𝑦 = 𝑧 = 1. (Similarly 𝑥 = 2/3 is also possible (verify)). Since the given relations are symmetric in x, y and z, similar assertions hold for y and z also. 31. Consider the polynomial f(x) −2. This vanishes at 𝑎1, 𝑎2, 𝑎3, 𝑎4 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎5. Hence 𝑓(𝑥) − 2 = (𝑥 − 𝑎1)(𝑥 − 𝑎2)(𝑥 − 𝑎3)(𝑥 − 𝑎4)(𝑥 − 𝑎5)𝑔(𝑥) For some polynomial g(x) with integral coefficients. If f(b) = 9 for some integer b, then 7 = (𝑏 − 𝑎1)(𝑏 − 𝑎2)(𝑏 − 𝑎3)(𝑏 − 𝑎4)(𝑏 − 𝑎5)𝑔(𝑏) which is impossible because the integers 𝑏 − 𝑎1, 𝑏 − 𝑎2, … , 𝑏 − 𝑎5 are all distinct and 7 cannot be factored into more than 3 distinct numbers. [Best we can do is 7 = (−7)(−1)(1)]. Remark : The same conclusion holds even if f(x) assumes the value 2 for only 4 distinct integers. 32. The relation (i) gives 𝑓(1990) − 90 [𝑓(1990) 90 ] = 1990 − 19 [1990 19 ] = 1990 − 1976 = 14 Using relation (ii), 1990 90 < 𝑓(1990) 90 < 2000 90 𝑜𝑟, 21 10 90 < 𝑓(1990) 90 < 22 20 90 Thus [ 𝑓(1990) 90 ] = 21 𝑜𝑟 22 If [ 𝑓(1990) 90 ] = 21 Then 𝑓(1990) = 14 + 90.21 = 1904 If [1990 90 ] = 22 Then 𝑓(1990) = 1994 33. Since the right hand side is positive, so is the left hand side. Hence x must be positive. Let 𝑥 = 𝑛 + 𝑓, where 𝑛 = [𝑥] 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓 = [𝑥]. We consider two cases: Case 1: 0 ≤ 𝑓 < 1/2 : In this case, we get [2x]= [2𝑛 + 2𝑓] = 2𝑛, as 2f < 1. Hence the equation becomes 1 𝑛 + 1 2𝑛 = 𝑓 + 1 3 This forces (1/n)+(1/2n) ≥ 1/3. We conclude that 2𝑛 − 9 ≤ 0. Thus n can take values 1, 2, 3, 4. Among these 𝑛 = 2,3,4 are all admissible, because for n = 2,3,4 we get f=5/12, 1/6, 1/24 respectively which are all less than ½; while 𝑛 = Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 32 1 is not admissible, because 𝑛 = 1 gives f > ½. We get three solutions in this case; 𝑥 = 2 + ( 5 12) = 29 12 ; 𝑥 = 3 + ( 1 6) = 19 6 ; 𝑥 = 4 + ( 1 24) = 97 24 Case 2: (1/2) ≤ 𝑓<1: Now we get [2x] = 2𝑛 + 1, as 1≤ 2𝑓 < 2. The given equation reduces to 1 𝑛 + 1 2𝑛 + 1 = 𝑓 + 1 3 We conclude, as in Case 1. 1/n + 1/ (2n+1) ≥ 1/2 + 1/3. This reduces to 10𝑛2 − 13𝑛 − 6 ≤ 0 . It follows that 𝑛 = 1. But this is not admissible since n = 1 gives 𝑓 = 1. We do not have any solution in this case. 34. By looking at the first few values of 𝑎𝑛, we guess that 𝑎𝑛 = (𝑛 − 1) 2 + 1 = 𝑛2 − 2𝑛 + 2 . We prove this by induction on n. In fact, 𝑎𝑛+1 = 2𝑎𝑛 − 𝑎𝑛−1 + 2 = 2[(𝑛 − 1)2 + 1] − [(𝑛 − 2)2 + 1] + 2 = 2𝑛2 − 4𝑛 + 4 − (𝑛2 − 4𝑛 + 5) + 2 = 𝑛2 + 1 Now we have, 𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑚+1 = [(𝑚 − 1)2 + 1][𝑚2 + 1] = 𝑚2(𝑚 − 1) 2 + 𝑚2 + (𝑚 − 1) 2 + 1 = [𝑚(𝑚 − 1) + 1] 2 + 1 = 𝑎𝑚2−𝑚+2 35. Let 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 be the rots of the given cubic 𝑥3 − 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑏 = 0, where a > 0 and b > 0. We have 𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 = 0 𝛼𝛽 + 𝛽𝛾 + 𝛾𝛼 = −𝑎 𝛼𝛽𝛾 = −𝑏 } From the last of these equations, we see that either all the roots are negative or two are positive and one negative. However, the second equation in (*) shows that all three cannot be negative. So, two of 𝛼, 𝛽, 𝛾 are positive and the remaining root is negative. The first equation in (*) implies that the negative rot is numerically larger than the other two positive roots. Hence, we may assume that 𝛾 < 0 < 𝛼 ≤ 𝛽 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 |𝛼| ≤ |𝛽| ≤ |𝛾|. We have 𝑏 − 𝑎𝛼 = −𝛼𝛽𝛾 + 𝛼(𝛼𝛽 + 𝛽𝛾 + 𝛾𝛼) = 𝛼2(𝛽 + 𝛾) = −𝛼3 < 0. Since a is positive, we get b/a < 𝛼 proving the first inequality. Again, we have 3𝑏 − 2𝑎𝛼 = −3𝛼𝛽𝛾 + 2𝛼(𝛼𝛽 + 𝛽𝛾 + 𝛾𝛼) = −𝛼𝛽𝛾 + 2𝛼2𝛽 + 2𝛼2𝛾 𝛼[2𝛼(𝛽 + 𝛾) − 𝛽𝛾] = 𝛼[−2(𝛽 + 𝛾)2 − 𝛽𝛾] (𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝛼 = −(𝛽 + 𝛾) = −𝛼(2𝛽2 + 5𝛽𝛾 + 2𝛾2) = −𝛼(2𝛽 + 𝛾)(𝛽 + 2𝛾) = −𝛼(𝛽 − 𝛼)(𝛾 − 𝛼). Observe that –𝛼 < 0, 𝛽 ≥ 𝛼, 𝛾 − 𝛼 < 0. Hence 3𝑏 − 2𝑎𝛼 is nonnegative. This proves the second inequality, 𝛼 ≤ 3𝑏/2𝑎. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 33 36. Since l is a root of the equation 𝑥3 + 𝑎𝑥2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0, We have 𝑙3 = −𝑎𝑙2 − 𝑏𝑙 − 𝑐 This implies that 𝑙4 = −𝑎𝑙3 − 𝑏𝑙2 − 𝑐𝑙 = (1 − 𝑎)𝑙3 + (𝑎 − 𝑏)𝑙2 + (𝑏 − 𝑐)𝑙 + 𝑐 Where we have used again −𝑙3 − 𝑎𝑙2 − 𝑏𝑙 − 𝑐 = 0 . Suppose |𝑙| ≥ 1. Then we obtain |𝑙| 4 ≤ (1 − 𝑎)|𝑙|3 + (𝑎 − 𝑏)|𝑙|2 + (𝑏 − 𝑐)|𝑙| + 𝑐 ≤ (1 − 𝑎)|𝑙|3 + (𝑎 − 𝑏)|𝑙|3 + (𝑏 − 𝑐)|𝑙|3 + 𝑐|𝑙| 3 ≤ |𝑙| 3. This shows that |𝑙| ≤ 1. Hence the only possibility in this case is |𝑙| = 1. We conclude that |𝑙| ≤ 1 is always true. 37. Let us take square of an even integer, say, 2a. 𝑁 = 2𝑎 ⇒ 𝑁2 = 2𝑎 × 2𝑎 = 4𝑎2 And 4a 2 is not in the form of 4n + 3 or 4n + 2. If N is an odd number, then 𝑁 = 2𝑎 + 1. And 𝑁2 = (2𝑎 + 1) 2 = 4𝑎2 + 4𝑎 + 1 = 4𝑎(𝑎 + 1) + 1 = 4𝑛 + 1. Here again the square is not in the form of 4n + 3 or 4n + 2. In other words, any number in the form of 4n + 3 or 4n + 2 cannot be a square number. Where N is odd, 𝑁2 = 4𝑎(𝑎 + 1) + 1. As either a or a+1 is even, 𝑁2 = 8𝑘 + 1 for some k ∈ 𝑁. ∴ The square of an odd number is in the form of 8k+1. 38. Let 𝑛 = 2𝑚−1 × 𝑝, where 𝑝 = 2𝑚 − 1 is a prime number. The divisors of 2𝑚−1 × 𝑝 are 1, 2, 22, 23, 2𝑚−1, 𝑝, 2𝑝, 22𝑝, … , 2𝑚−2𝑝, 2𝑚−1𝑝. Now, we should sum all these divisors excepting the last one, viz. 2𝑚−1𝑝. The number of ways, in which a composite number can be expressed as a product of two factors, which are relatively prime to each other, is 2𝑛−1, where n is the number of distinct prime. For example, 58 × 37 × 415 can be resolved into product of two factors, in 23−1 = 22 = 4 ways so that factors are co−prime numbers. Here they are 58 × (37 × 415) 37 × (58 × 415) 415 × (37 × 58) And finally, 1 × (415 × 37 × 58). 𝑆 = (1 + 2 + 22 + ⋯ + 2𝑚−1 + 𝑝(1 + 2 + 22 + ⋯ + 2𝑚−2) Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 34 = 1(2𝑚 − 1) 2 − 1 + 𝑝[1(2𝑚 − 1)] 2 − 1 = 2𝑚 − 1 + 𝑝(2𝑚−1 − 1) 2𝑚 + 𝑝2𝑚−1 − 𝑝 − 1 = 2𝑚−1(2 + 𝑝) − (𝑝 + 1) = 2 𝑚−1(1 + 2𝑚) − 2𝑚 [∵ 𝑝 = 2𝑚 − 1] = 2𝑚−1(2 𝑚 − 1) = 𝑛 Now s(n), the sum of positive divisors of n, is given by 𝑠(𝑛) = 𝑝1 𝑎1+1 − 1 𝑝1 − 1 × 𝑝2 𝑎2+1 − 1 𝑝2 − 1 × … × 𝑝𝑚 𝑎𝑚+1 − 1 𝑝𝑚 − 1 Where 𝑛 = 𝑝1 𝑎1 × 𝑝2 𝑎2 × 𝑝𝑚 𝑎𝑚 For example, 𝑠(48) = 𝑠(24 × 3) = 25 − 1 2 − 1 × 32 − 1 2 − 1 = 31 × 4 = 124 𝑠𝑘(𝑛), the sum of the kth power of the divisors of n = 𝑝1 𝑘(𝑎1+1)−1 𝑝1 𝑘−1 × 𝑝2 𝑘(𝑎2+1)−1 𝑝2 𝑘−1 × … 𝑝𝑚 𝑘(𝑎𝑚+1) 𝑝𝑚 𝑘 −1 . 39. Let the divisor be d and the remainder be r. Then by Euclidean Algorithm, we find 19779 = 𝑑𝑞1 + 𝑟 ……(1) 17997 = 𝑑𝑞2 + 𝑟 ………(2) By subtracting eq. (2) from eq. (1), we get 1782 = 𝑑(𝑞1 − 𝑞2) ∴ d is a three digit divisor of 1782. Therefore, possible values of d are 891, 594, 297, 198. Hence, largest three digit divisor is 891 and the remainder is 177. 40. (i) If 60 = 3 × 4 × 5 and 4|100n, then 4 should divide 𝑛3 + 30𝑛2 i.e., 4 should divide 𝑛2(𝑛 + 30). This implies that n is even. (ii) If 5 |(30𝑛2 + 100𝑛), then 5 should divide 𝑛3. Hence 5 should divide n. (iii) If 3|30 n2, then 3 should divide n3+100n, i.e., 3 should divide 𝑛(𝑛2 + 100𝑛) = 𝑛(𝑛2 + 1 + 99) If 𝑛 ≡ ±1(𝑚𝑜𝑑 3), 𝑛2 = 1(mod 3) and 𝑛2 + 1 ≡ 2(𝑚𝑜𝑑 3), so neither of (𝑛2 + 1 + 99) and n are divisible by 3. However, if 𝑛 = 0 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 3), 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑛(𝑛2 + 1 + 99) is divided by 3, i.e., n(n 2+100) is divisible by 3 only if n is a multiple of 3. From (i) , (ii) and (iii), we find that n must be a multiple of 30. So, we should find the sum of all multiples of 30 less than 1998. 𝑆𝑛 = 30 + 60 + ⋯ + 1980 = 30(1 + 2 + ⋯ + 66) = 66330 Principles of Induction 1.

Second Principle of Mathematical Induction Strong principle of mathematical induction: Let {T(n) : 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁} be a set of statements. If (i) T (1) is true and (ii) if for each natural number k, the truth of T(m) for all m < k where 𝑘 ≥ 2 implies the truth of T(k), then T(n) is true for all n. 3. Third Principle of Mathematical Induction. Let {T(n) |𝑛 ∈ 𝑁} be a set of statements for each natural number n. If (i) T (a) is true for some a ∈ 𝑁 (ii) T(k) is true implies that T(k+1) is true for all 𝑘 ≥ 𝑎, then T(n) is true for all natural number 𝑛 ≥ 𝑎. Examples on Mathematical Inductions (1) There must be something wrong with the following proof: what is it? Theorem : Let a be a positive number. For all positive integers n, we have 𝑎𝑛−1 = 1. Proof : If 𝑛 = 1, 𝑎𝑛−1 = 𝑎 1−1 = 𝑎0 = 1. Assume that this statement is true for 𝑛 ≤ 𝑘, 𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝑎𝑛−1 = 1 for all 𝑛 ≤ 𝑘. If 𝑘 ≥ 1 now for n = 𝑘 + 1, we have 𝑎(𝑘+1)−1 = 𝑎𝑘 = 𝑎𝑘−1 × 𝑎𝑘−1 𝑎𝑘−2 = 1 × 1 1 = 1 So the theorem is true for 𝑛 = 𝑘 + 1 wherever the theorem is true for 𝑛 ≤ 𝑘 and hence, by the second principle of Mathematical induction, the theorem is true for all natural numbers, n. Fallacy, for this explanation : When we have written 𝑎(𝑘+1)−1 𝑎𝑠 𝑎𝑘−1×𝑎𝑘−1 𝑎𝑘−2 , we have assumed that the theorem is true for 𝑛 ≤ 𝑘 and we have verified that it is true for 𝑛 = 1. For example, taking 𝑘 = 1; the denominator becomes 𝑎 1−2 = 𝑎−1 but we have not proved that 𝑎−1 = 1; neither can it proved. Therefore the proof has a loop hole here. 41. From the pattern 13 = 1, 23 = 3 + 5, 33 = 7 + 9 + 11, 43 = 13 + 15 + 17 + 19 … Note that the first term on the R.H.S are 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, …, odd numbers. So the R.H.S. of the nth identity to be proved has [(𝑛−1)𝑛 2 + 1] 𝑠𝑡 odd number as first term. Hence the nth identity to be proved is Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 36 𝑛3 = [ (𝑛 − 1)𝑛 2 + 1] 2 − 1 + ⋯ 𝑛 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑠. i.e. 𝑛3 = (𝑛2 − 𝑛 + 1) + (𝑛2 − 𝑛 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 − 1)(n terms) . Assume this is true for n then (n+1)th identity to be proved is (𝑛 + 1) 3 = (𝑛2 + 𝑛 + 1) + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 + 2𝑛 + 1) [(n+1 terms)] = (𝑛2 − 𝑛 + 1) + (𝑛2 − 𝑛 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 − 1) + 2𝑛 + ⋯ + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 + 2𝑛 + 1) = 𝑛3 + 2𝑛2 + 𝑛2 + 3𝑛 + 1 = (𝑛 + 1) 3 So the right hand side of kth row is (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + [(𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘 − 1)2] = (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 − 1) Now if we assume that the pattern holds for the kth row then we will have (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 − 1) = 𝑘3 Now the (k+1)th row numbers will be (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 1 + 2𝑘) = (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑘2 + 3𝑘 + 1) = [(𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + 2𝑘] + [(𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 3) + 2𝑘] + ⋯ + [(𝑘2 + 𝑘 − 1) + 2𝑘] + (𝑘2 + 3𝑘 + 1) (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 1) + (𝑘2 − 𝑘 + 3) + ⋯ + (𝑘2 + 𝑘 − 1)⏟ 𝑘3 + (𝑘 × 2𝑘) + (𝑘2 + 3𝑘 + 1) + 3𝑘2 + 3𝑘 + 1 = (𝑘 + 1) 3 (By assumption) Note : Now adding both the sides of n rows, we get 13 + 23 + 33 + ⋯ + 𝑛3 = 1 + 3 + 5 + ⋯ + (2𝑛 − 1) + ⋯ + (𝑛2 + 𝑛 − 1) Thus, on the right side there are (𝑛2 + 𝑛 − 1) + 1 2 = 𝑛(𝑛 + 1) 2 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 1 𝑠𝑜 13 + 23 + 33 + ⋯ + 𝑛3 = (𝑛(𝑛 + 1) 2 ) 2 [Sum of the first n odd numbers = 𝑛2: Prove by Mathematical Induction Hint: 1 + 3 + 5 + ⋯ + 2𝑛 − 1 = 𝑛2, 𝑛 = 1 = 1 × 1 = 12 …] 42. For 𝑛 = 10, we have 2 10 = 1024 > 103 = 1000. So the statement is true for 𝑛 = 10. Supposing that this statement is true for 𝑛 = 𝑘 ≥ 10; i.e., 2𝑘 > 𝑘3. For 𝑛 = 𝑘 + 1, 2𝑘+1 > 2 × 𝑘3 Now, 2𝑘3 − (𝑘3 + 3𝑘2 + 3𝑘 + 1) = 𝑘3 − 3𝑘2 − 3𝑘 − 1 = (𝑘 − 1)3 − 6𝑘. Let 𝑘 = 10 + 𝑎, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑎 ≥ 0. Then (𝑘 − 1) 3 − 6𝑘 = (10 + 𝑎 − 1) 3 − 6(10 + 𝑎) = (9 + 𝑎)3 − 60 − 6𝑎 = 729 + 243𝑎 + 27𝑎2 + 𝑎3 − 60 − 60𝑎 = 669 + 183𝑎 + 27𝑎2 + 𝑎3 ≥ 0 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 37 [∵ 𝑎 ≥ 0] ⇒ 2𝑘3 > (𝑘 + 1) 3 ⇒ 2𝑘+1 > (𝑘 + 1) 3 Hence the inequality is true for all 𝑛 ≥ 10. 43. Let us assume that the result is true for 𝑡𝑘 for all k > n. 𝑡1 = 1 2 [(1 + √3) 1 + (1 − √3) 1] = 1 2 (1 + √3 + 1 − √3) = 1 2 × 2 = 1 𝑖𝑠 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒. 𝑡2 = 4 = 1 2 [(1 + √3) 2 + (1 − √3) 2] = 1 2 (8) = 4 𝑖𝑠 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒. Now, we have to prove that 𝑡𝑛 = 1 2 [(1 + √3) 𝑛 + (1 − √3) 𝑛] Since 𝑡𝑛 = 2[𝑡𝑛−1 + 𝑡𝑛−2] = 2 [1 2 {(1 + √3) 𝑛−1 + (1 − √3) 𝑛−1} + 1 2 {(1 + √3)𝑛−2 + ⋯ (1 − √3) 𝑛−2}] = [(1 + √3) 𝑛−1 + (1 + √3)𝑛−2 + (1 + √3) 𝑛−1 + (1 + √3) 𝑛−2] = [(1 + √3)𝑛−2(2 + √3) + (1 − √3) 𝑛−2(2 − √3)] = [(1 + √3) 𝑛−2 (1 + √3) 2 2 + (1 − √3) 𝑛−2 (1 − √3)2 2 ] = 1 2 [(1 + √3) 𝑛 + (1 − √3) 𝑛] 𝑇ℎ𝑢𝑠, 𝑡𝑛 = 1 2 [(1 + √3)𝑛 + (1 − √3) 𝑛] So, by the second principle of mathematical induction, the formula is true for all natural numbers. 44. Let T(n) be the statement that (3 + √5) 𝑛 + (3 − √5) 𝑛 is divisible by 2n. 𝑇1: (3 + √5) + (3 − √5) = 6 is divisible by 2 1 = 2 is true. 𝑇2: (3 + √5) 2 + (3 − √5)2 = 28 is divisible by 22 is true. Let us take that 𝑇𝑘 is true for all k < n for some n. 𝑇𝑛: (3 + √5) 𝑛 + (3 − √5) 𝑛 is divisible by 2n. Now, for n −1 < n (3 + √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5) 𝑛−1 is divisible by 2𝑛−1. (3 + √5) 𝑛 + (3 − √5) 𝑛 = [(3 + √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5)𝑛−1] (3 + √5 + 3 − √5) − [(3 + √5)(3 − √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5)(3 + √5) 𝑛−1] Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 38 = 6 [(3 + √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5)𝑛−1] − [4(3 − √5) 𝑛−2 + 4(3 + √5) 𝑛−2] = 3 × 2 [(3 + √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5)𝑛−1] − [4(3 + √5)𝑛−2 + (3 − √5) 𝑛−2] Here 2 [(3 + √5) 𝑛−1 + (3 − √5) 𝑛−1] is divisible by 2 × 2𝑛−1 = 2𝑛, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 4 [(3 + √5) 𝑛−2 + (3 − √5) 𝑛−2] is divisible by 4 × 2𝑛−2 = 2𝑛 Thus (3 + √5) 𝑛 + (3 − √5)𝑛 is divisible by 2n i.e., Tn is true if 𝑡𝑛−1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡𝑛−2 are true. Similarly, 𝑡1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡2 are true and, therefore, by the second principle of mathematical induction, 𝑇𝑛 is true for all 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁. 45. (𝑥𝑦𝑧)11 = (𝑧𝑦𝑥)12 112𝑥 + 11𝑦 + 𝑧 = 92𝑧 + 9𝑦 + 𝑥 ⇒ 120𝑥 + 2𝑦 − 80𝑧 = 0 ⇒ 60𝑥 + 𝑦 − 40𝑧 = 0 ⇒ 40𝑧 − 60𝑥 = 𝑦 ⇒ 20(2𝑧 − 3𝑥) = 𝑦, 𝑏𝑢𝑡 0 ≤ 𝑦 < 9 So 20|y, but as 0 ≤ 𝑦 < 9, 𝑦 = 0 Therefore, 2𝑧 = 3𝑥. As 0 ≤ 𝑥, 𝑧 < 9, the solutions are 𝑥 = 2, 𝑧 = 3 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥 = 4, 𝑧 = 6. Thus two possible solutions are (203)11 𝑎𝑛𝑑 (406)12. 46. Let 𝑛 = 𝑞𝑘 + 𝑟, 0 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑘. 𝑁𝑜𝑤, 𝑛 𝑘 = 𝑞𝑘 + 𝑟 𝑘 = 𝑞 + 𝑟 𝑘 ; 𝑛 + 1 𝑘 = 𝑞𝑘 + 𝑟 + 1 𝑘 = 𝑞 + 𝑟 + 1 𝑘 ; 2𝑛 𝑘 = 2𝑞𝑘 + 2𝑟 𝑘 = 2𝑞 + 2𝑟 𝑘 ; 0 ≤ 𝑟 < 𝑘 Thus, (i) r may be equal to k−1, or (ii) r may be < k−1 If 𝑟 = 𝑘 − 1, we have [𝑛 𝑘] = 𝑞. [𝑛 + 1 𝑘 ] = [𝑞 + 𝑘 𝑘] = 𝑞 + 1 [2𝑛 𝑘 ] = [2𝑞 + 2𝑘 − 2 𝑘 ] = 2𝑞 + 1 [𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑘 > 1. 2 𝑘 ≤ 1] So, by adding and equating, we get [𝑛 𝑘] + [𝑛 + 1 𝑘 ] = 2𝑞 + 1 = [2𝑛 𝑘 ] (ii)If r < k−1 we have [𝑛 𝑘] = 𝑞. [𝑛 + 𝑘 𝑘 ] = 𝑞 [2𝑛 𝑘 ] = [2𝑞 + 2𝑟 𝑘 ] ≥ 2𝑞 So by adding, we get [𝑛 𝑘] = [𝑛 + 1 𝑘 ] ≤ [2𝑛 𝑘 ] Combining (i) and (ii), we get [𝑛 𝑘] + [𝑛 + 1 𝑘 ] ≤ [2𝑛 𝑘 ] Note : When 𝑘 = 2, the above inequality holds as an equality.

(clearly a larger power of 2| 6250!) 𝐵𝑢𝑡, 𝑒 = ∑ [6250 5𝑖 ] ∞ 𝑖=1 = 1250 + 250 + 50 + 10 + 2 = 1562 Hence 6250! Ends with 1562 zeroes. 48. If e is the maximum power of 5 in n!, then 𝑒 = ∑ [ 𝑛 5𝑖] < ∑ [ 𝑛 5𝑖] = 𝑛 5 ∑ 1 5𝑖−1 ∞ 𝑖=1 ∞ 𝑖=1 ∞ 𝑖=1 = 𝑛 5 1 − 1 5 = 𝑛 4 ∴ 𝑛 = 4𝑒 Here e is given to be 20. ∴ 𝑛 ≥ 80. For 80, 𝑒 = 19. Therefore, 85 is the required answer. Not only 85, 86, 87, 88, 89 are also valid values of n. If solution exists for this type of problem, there will be 5 solutions. 49. 𝑥 + 𝑦 = [𝑥] + [𝑦] + {𝑥} + {𝑦} [𝑥 + 𝑦] = [𝑥] + [𝑦] + [{𝑥} + {𝑦}] ≥ [𝑥] + [𝑦] This can be generalized for n numbers: [𝑥1] + [𝑥2] + ⋯ + [𝑥𝑛] ≤ [𝑥1 + 𝑥2 + ⋯ + 𝑥𝑛] 50. 12345 ≤ 𝑥 + 2𝑥 + 4𝑥 + 8𝑥 + 16𝑥 + 32𝑥 = 63𝑥 ∴ 𝑥 ≥ 12345 63 = 195 20 21 When 𝑥 = 196, the L.H.S of the given equation becomes 12348. ∴ 195 20 21 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 196 Consider x in the interval (195 31 32 , 196). The L.H.S. expression of the given equation. = 195 + 0 + 390 + 1 + 780 + 3 + 1560 + 7 + 3120 + 15 + 6240 + 31 = 12342 < 12345 When x < 195 31 32, the L.H.S. is less than 12342. ∴ for no value of x. The given equality will be satisfied. 51. If x > 0, then 𝑥2 < 𝑥2 + 1 + 𝑥 < 𝑥2 + 2𝑥 + 1 = (𝑥 + 1) 2. So 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 lies between the two consecutives square integers and hence, cannot be a square. 𝐼𝑓 𝑥 = 0, 𝑦2 = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1 is a square number. Thus, the solutions in this case are is (0, 1), (0, −1). Again if x < −1, then 𝑥2 > 𝑥2 + 𝑥 + 1 > 𝑥2 + 2𝑥 + 1, and hence, there exists no solution. For = −1 , we have 𝑦2 = 1 − 1 + (−1) 2 = 1 ∴ 𝑦 = ±1 Thus, the only integral solutions are (0,1), (0, −1), (−1, +1), (−1, −1) Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 40 52.

Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 43 So 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3 should be 123. For 𝑎4, we have either 4 or 6 but for 𝑎4 = 4, 1234 is not divisible by 4 and hence 𝑎4 = 6 and hence. The six digit number, when 𝑎 = 1, is 123654. Case 2 : If 𝑎1 = 3, 𝑎2 can be2 or 6 or 4 but then 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3 = 321 is divisible by 3 and 361 o 341 is not divisible by 3. So, 𝑎2 can be 6 or 4. Now 𝑎1𝑎2𝑎3𝑎4 = 321𝑎4 and a4 can be 4 or 6. For 𝑎4 = 4 321𝑎4 is not divisible by 4 and hence 𝑎4 = 6 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎6 = 4’ The number, thus, is 321654. Thus, there are exactly 2 numbers 123654 and 321654 satisfying the condition. 57. It is given that 𝑚 × 𝑛 = 25! = 222 × 3 10 × 56 × 7 1 × 11 1 × 13 1 × 17 1 × 19 1 × 23 1 Thus 25!

Since 10𝑛 ≡ 1 (mod 9) for all 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁, any number written in decimal representation such as 𝑎𝑛 𝑎𝑛−1𝑎𝑛−2 … 𝑎1𝑎0 ≡ 𝑎𝑛 + 𝑎𝑛−1 + ⋯ + 𝑎1 + 𝑎0 (mod 9). ∴ 4333 ≡ 4 + 3 + 3 + 3 ≡ 13 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 9) ≡ 4(mod 9) ∴ 4333 3 ≡ 43 (mod 9) ≡ 64 (mod 9) ≡ 1 (mod 9) i.e., when 43333 is divided by 9, the remainder is 1. 59. Here we should show that there does not exist any positive integer d, which makes (2d−1), (5d−1), (13d−1) to be square number simultaneously. Assuming the contrary, 2𝑑 − 1 = 𝑥2 5𝑑 − 1 = 𝑦2 13𝑑 − 1 = 𝑧2 Where x, y and z are positive integers 𝑥2 = 2𝑑 − 1 is an odd number, and since 𝑥2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) for all odd integer x if d is even, then d= 2, 4 or 6 (mod 8). 2d−1= 3, 7 or 3 (mod 8) which is impossible and hence d must be odd. Hence y and z are even. Now 𝑧2 − 𝑦2 = 8d ⇒ (𝑧 − 𝑦)(𝑧 + 𝑦) = 8𝑑 Therefore either (z –y) or (z+y) is divisible by 4. If z−y is divisible by 4, then z + y = (𝑧 − 𝑦) + 2𝑦 is also divisible by 4 because (z – y) and 2y are divisible by 4. Similarly, if z + y is divisible by 4, then z – y = (z + y) – 2y is also divisible by 4. Thus, (z – y). (z + y) is divisible by 4 × 4 = 16. Thus, 16|8d, where d is an odd number. This is a contradiction and hence, (2d – 1), (5d – 1) and (13d – 1) cannot simultaneously be square integers. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 44 60. We shall make groups of the terms of the expression as follows : (1 1997 + 1996 1997) + (2 1997 + 1995 1997) + ⋯ + (998 1997 + 999 1997) Here each bracket is of the form (𝑎𝑖 2𝑛+1 + 𝑏𝑖 2𝑛+1) is divisible by (𝑎𝑖 + 𝑏𝑖) But (𝑎𝑖 + 𝑏𝑖) = 1997 for all i. ∴ Each bracket and hence, their sum is divisible by 1997. 61. If possible, let 𝑙𝑜𝑔3 2 be a rational number 𝑝 𝑞 where p, q are integers, 𝑞 ≠ 0. 𝑙𝑜𝑔3 2 = 𝑝 𝑞 ⇒ 3𝑝 𝑞 = 2 ⇒ 3𝑝 = 2𝑞 3|3𝑝 𝑏𝑢𝑡 3 |2𝑞 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜 2 | 3𝑝 and hence, it is a contradiction. Or 3𝑝 is an odd number and 2𝑞 is an even number but an odd number equals to an even number is a contradiction. [Note that 30 = 1 < 2 = 3𝑝/𝑞 < 3 1 = 3, 0 < p/q < 1 and both p and q are positive real numbers. What we have proved here p/q is not a rational number or there cannot be exist integers satisfying 3𝑝 = 2𝑞] 62. Since 𝑥3 − 𝑧3 = 721 ⇒ 𝑥3 − 𝑧3 = (𝑥 − 𝑦)(𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑧 + 𝑧2) = 721 For integral x, z; 𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑧 + 𝑧2 > 0, ∵ 𝑥3 − 𝑧3 = 721 ⇒ 𝑥3 − 𝑧3 > 0 ⇒ 𝑥 − 𝑧 > 0 So (x – z) (𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑧 + 𝑧2) = 721 = 1 × 721 = 7 × 103 = 103 × 7 = 721 × 1 Case (i) 𝑥 − 𝑧 = 1 ⇒ 𝑥 = 1 + 𝑧 And 𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑧 + 𝑧2 = (1 + 𝑧) 2 + (1 + 𝑧)𝑧 + 𝑧2 = 721 ⇒ 3𝑧2 + 3𝑧 − 720 = 0 ⇒ 𝑧2 + 𝑧 − 240 = 0 ⇒ (𝑧 + 16)(𝑧 − 15) = 0 ⇒ 𝑧 = −16 or 15 Solving, we get 𝑥 = −15 𝑜𝑟 16 So (−15, −16) and (16, 15) is two of the ordered pairs. Case (ii) 𝑥 − 𝑧 = 7 𝑜𝑟 𝑥 = 7 + 𝑧 And 𝑥2 + 𝑥𝑧 + 𝑧2 = 103 ⇒ (7 + 𝑧2) + (7 + 𝑧)𝑧 + 𝑧2 = 103 ⇒ 3𝑧2 + 21𝑧 − 54 = 0 ⇒ 𝑧2 + 7𝑧 − 18 = 0 ⇒ (𝑧 + 9)(𝑧 − 2) = 0 ⇒ 𝑧 = −9 𝑜𝑟 𝑧 = 2 So the corresponding values of x are −2 and 9. So the other ordered pairs are (−2, −9), (9, 2). Corresponding to x – z = 103 and x – z = 721, the values are imaginary and hence, there are Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 45 exactly four ordered pairs of integers (−15, −16), (16, 15), (−2, −9) and (9, 2), satisfying the equation 𝑥3 = 𝑧3 + 721. 63. Since 1897 = 7 × 271 Now (2903 𝑛 − 803𝑛) − (464𝑛 − 261𝑛) = (2903 − 830)| (2903𝑛 − 803𝑛) And (464 – 261) | (464𝑛 − 261𝑛) i.e. 2100|(2903𝑛 − 803𝑛) 203|(464 𝑛 − 261𝑛) ⇒ 7 | (2903𝑛 − 803𝑛) And 7|(464𝑛 − 261𝑛) ∵ 2100 = 7 × 300 203 = 7 × 29 Hence, 7 | E Again, 2903𝑛 − 803𝑛 − 464𝑛 + 261𝑛 = (2903𝑛 − 464𝑛) − (803𝑛 − 261𝑛) 2903 − 464 = 2439|(2903𝑛 − 464𝑛) And (803 − 261) = 542| (803𝑛 − 261𝑛) i.e. 2439 = 271 × 9 | (2903𝑛 − 464𝑛) and 542 = 271 × 2 | (803𝑛 − 261𝑛) So, 271 | (2903𝑛 − 464𝑛) And also 271 | (803𝑛 − 261𝑛) And hence, 271 | E. Thus, the given expression is divisible by the prime numbers 7 and 271 and, hence is divisible by 271 × 7 = 1897. 64. If 𝑝 = 2, 2𝑝−1 𝑝 = 1 2 is not even an integer. Let p be a prime of the form 4k + 1. Then, if 2𝑝−1 𝑝 = 24𝑘−1 4𝑘+1 = 𝑚2 for some odd integer m. Then 2𝑘 − 1 = (4𝑘 + 1)𝑚2 Since m2 is an odd number, 𝑚2 ≡ | (𝑚𝑜𝑑 4) as all odd squares leave a remainder/ when divide by 4 and hence of the form 4l + 1 (say) Then 24𝑘 − 1 = (4𝑘 + 1)(4𝑙 + 1) = 1 (mod 4) But the left hand side 24𝑘 − 1 = (16𝑘 − 1) ≡ −1 (mod 4) ≡ 3 (mod 4) And it is a contradiction and hence p cannot be of the form 4k + 1. So, let p be of the form 4k + 3. Firstly, let us take k = 0, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑝 = 3. 𝑠𝑜, 2𝑝−1−1 3 = 22−1 3 is a square. Therefore, 𝑝 = 3 is one of the solutions. Let p be 4k + 3 with k > 0. 2𝑝−1 − 1 = 24𝑘+1 − 1 = (22𝑘+1 − 1)(22𝑘+1 + 1) And 22𝑘+1 − 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 22𝑘+1 + 1 being consecutive odd numbers are relatively prime. So, 2𝑝−1 − 1 = 𝑝𝑚2 ⇒ (22𝑘+1 − 1)(22𝑘+1 + 1) = (4𝑘 + 3)𝑚2 = 𝑝𝑚2 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 46 So, 𝑝𝑚2 could be written as 𝑝𝑢2 × 𝑣2 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑝𝑢2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑣2 are relatively prime. Thus, 2 2𝑘+1 − 1 = 𝑝𝑢2 And 22𝑘+1 + 1 = 𝑣2 ⇒ 22𝑘+1 = 𝑣2 − 1 = (𝑣 + 1)(𝑣 − 1) So, (v + 1) and (v – 1) are both powers of 2. Two powers of 2 differ by 2 only if they are 2 and 22. In all other cases, the difference will be greater than 2. So, 𝑣 − 1 = 2 1 = 2 𝑣 + 1 = 22 = 4 ⇒ 𝑣 = 3 i.e., 22𝑘+1 = 23 = 8 hence, 𝑘 = 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑝 = 4𝑘 + 3 = 7. Therefore, the only other possibility is 𝑝 = 7. Thus, for 𝑝 = 7, 2𝑝−1 𝑝 = 27−1 7 = 63 7 = 9 which is a perfect square. Thus, the only primes satisfying the given conditions are 3 and 7. 65. From 5!, all the numbers will have the unit digit zero and from 10!, all the unit and tens digit will be zero. So, the unit digit of the numbers S is the unit digit of 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33. That is unit digit of S, is 3 The tens digit of S, is the tens digit of 1! + 2! + 3! + 4! + 5! + 6! + 7! + 8! + 9!= 33 + 120 + 720 + 5040 + 40320 + 362880 So, to get the tens digit of S, add only the tens digit of 33 + 120 + … + 362880 which is 3 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 21 So, the tens digit of S is 1. 66. N is divisible by 9, if the digit sum is divisible by 9. The digital sum of N : The number of 1𝑆 occurring in the digits form 10 to 19 = 11 And from 20 to 99 = 8. So total of ones is 11 + 8 = 19. Similarly, no. of 2𝑆, 3𝑆 … 9 are all equal to 19. So sum of all the digits = 19(1 + 2 + 3 + ⋯ + 9) = 19×9×10 2 = 19 × 5 × 9 = 855. And hence, 1011 …99 is divisible by 9. When the number start from 12, the sum of the digits become 855 − 2= 852 (Since 10, 11 account for the digital sum 3) and hence, is divisible by 3. (a) For divisibility by 3, it could start from 13, 15, 16, 18, 19, 21, 22, 24, 25,… (b) For divisibility by 32 = 9 the numbers may start from any of 18, 19, 27, 28, 36, 37,… 67. Let 2𝑛 − 1 = 𝑞 We have already seen that 1, 𝑑1𝑑2 … 𝑑𝑘 are 1,2, 22, … , 2𝑛−1, 𝑞, 2𝑞, … , 2𝑛−1𝑞 respectively.

The divisors of N are 1, 𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3, 𝑃1𝑃2, 𝑃1𝑃3, 𝑃2𝑃3, 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 It is given that 1 + 𝑃1 + 𝑃2 + 𝑃3 + 𝑃1𝑃2 + 𝑃1𝑃3 + 𝑃2𝑃3 + 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 = 3𝑁 𝑁𝑜𝑤, ∑ 1 𝑑𝑖 = 1 1 + 1 𝑃1 + 1 𝑃2 + 1 𝑃3 + 1 𝑃1𝑃2 + 1 𝑃1𝑃3 𝑁 𝑖=1 + 1 𝑃2𝑃3 + 1 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 = 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 + 𝑃2𝑃3 + 𝑃1𝑃3 + 𝑃1𝑃2 + 𝑃3 + 𝑃2 + 𝑃1 + 1 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 But the numerator is the sum of the divisors of N. i.e., ∑ 𝑑 = 3𝑁 = 3𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3𝑑|𝑁 and hence ∑ 1 𝑑1 = 3𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 𝑃1𝑃2𝑃3 = 3 𝑁 𝑖=1 69. If 𝑁 = 𝑝1 𝑎1, 𝑝1 𝑎2, … 𝑝𝑛 𝑎𝑛, then the sum of the divisors of N is given by the formula ∑ 𝑑(𝑁) = 𝑝1 𝛼1+1 − 1 𝑝1 − 1 × 𝑝1 𝛼1+2 − 1 𝑝𝑛 − 1 × … 𝑝𝑛 𝛼𝑛+2 − 1 𝑝𝑛 − 1 So, the sum of the divisors of 2𝑛𝑎. 𝑏 = (2𝑛+1 − 1) × 𝑎2−1 𝑎−1 × 𝑏2−1 𝑏−1 = (2𝑛+1 − 1)(𝑎 + 1)(𝑏 + 1) = (2𝑛+1 − 1)(9. 22𝑛−1) But 2𝑛𝑎𝑏 = 2𝑛[9. 22𝑛−1 − 9. 2𝑛−1 + 1] (on simplification). The sum of the divisors of 2𝑛𝑎𝑏 other than 2𝑛𝑎. 𝑏 is 9. 22𝑛−1(2𝑛+1 − 1) − 2𝑛(9. 22𝑛−1 − 9. 2𝑛−1 + 1) = 9. 23𝑛 − 9. 22𝑛−1 − 9. 23𝑛−1 + 9. 22𝑛−1 − 2𝑛 = 9. 23𝑛−1(2 − 1) − 2𝑛 = 9. 23𝑛−1 − 2𝑛 = 2𝑛(9. 22𝑛−1 − 1) = 2𝑛. 𝑐 Thus, the sum of the divisors of 2𝑛. 𝑎𝑏 other than itself is 2𝑛𝑐. Now, sum of the divisors of 2𝑛𝑐 other than itself is 2𝑛+1 − 1 2 − 1 × 𝑐2 − 1 𝑐 − 1 − 2𝑛. 𝑐 = (2𝑛+1 − 1)(𝑐 + 1) − 2𝑛. 𝑐 = (2𝑛+1 − 1)9. 22𝑛−1 − 2𝑛(9. 22𝑛 − 1) = 9. 23𝑛 − 9. 22𝑛−1 − 9. 23𝑛−1 + 2𝑛 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 48 = 9. 23𝑛−1 − 9. 22𝑛−1 + 2𝑛 = 2𝑛[9. 22𝑛−1 − 9. 22𝑛−1 + 1] = 2𝑛𝑎𝑏 i.e., the sum of the divisors of 2𝑛. 𝑐 other than 2𝑛. 𝑐 is equal to 2𝑛𝑎𝑏. 70.

We must have k + n and k – n both to be either even or odd. (If one is odd and the other even, then k and n do not have integer solutions). Also both k + n and k – n cannot be odd as the product is given to be even. So the difference possibilities for k + n, k – n are as follows. 𝑘 − 𝑛 = 2 𝑘 + 𝑛 = 48 … . (1) 𝑘 − 𝑛 = 4 𝑘 + 𝑛 = 24 … .

If 𝑛 = 7995, then the number of zeroes at the end of 7995 is by eq.

𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑛 = 2, 𝑓(2) = 1 2 × 2 = 1 4 𝑖𝑠 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒. 𝑛 = 3, 𝑓(3) = 1 3 × 2 = 1 6 𝑖𝑠 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜 𝑡𝑟𝑢𝑒. So, let us assume that f(n) = 1 2𝑛. Now, we should show that f(n+1) = 1 2(𝑛+1) . (Here we use the principle of Mathematical induction). By the (ii) hypothesis, we have 𝑓(1) + 2𝑓(2) + ⋯ + 𝑛(𝑓𝑛) = 𝑛(𝑛 + 1)𝑓(𝑛) 𝑓(1) + 2𝑓(2) + ⋯ + 𝑛𝑓(𝑛) + (𝑛 + 1)𝑓(𝑛 + 1) = (𝑛 + 1)(𝑛 + 2)𝑓(𝑛 + 1) = 1 + 1 2 + 1 2 + 1 2 + ⋯ + 1 2⏟ 𝑛 𝑡𝑖𝑚𝑒𝑠 + (𝑛 + 1)𝑓(𝑛 + 1) = (𝑛 + 1)(𝑛 + 2)𝑓(𝑛 + 1) ⇒ 1 + (𝑛 − 1) 1 2 = (𝑛 + 1)𝑓(𝑛 + 1)(𝑛 + 2 − 1) ⇒ (𝑛 + 1) 2 × 𝑓(𝑛 + 1) Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 52 = 𝑓(𝑛 + 1) = 1 + (𝑛 − 1) 1 2 (𝑛 + 1)2 = 𝑛 + 1 2(𝑛 + 1)2 = 1 2(𝑛 + 1) Thus, by the principle of mathematical induction, we have proved that f(n) = 1 2𝑛 for n > 1. ∴ 𝑓(1997) = 1 2 × 1997 = 1 3994 81. 𝑓(2) = 2 𝑓(4) = 𝑓(2.2) = 𝑓(2). 𝑓(2) = 2.2 = 4 𝑓(8) = 𝑓(2.4) = 𝑓(2). 𝑓(4) = 2.4 = 8 Thus, we infer that 𝑓(2𝑛) = 2𝑛. Let us use M. I. for proving 𝑓(2 1) = 2 (by hypothesis) ……..(1) Assume 𝑓(2𝑛) = 2𝑛 ………..(2) 𝑓(2𝑛+1) = 𝑓(2. 2𝑛) = 𝑓(2). 𝑓(2𝑛) = 2. 2𝑛 ……..(3) By hypothesis and eq. (1) and (2), we need to find f(n) for all n. Let us see what happens for f(1), f(3) at first. f(1) < f(2) (Given) Now 𝑓(2) = 𝑓(1 × 2) = 𝑓(1) × 𝑓(2) ⇒ 𝑓(1) = 1 Similarly, f(2) < f(3) < f(4) 2 < f(3) < 4 But the only integer lying between 2 and 4 is 3. Thus f(3) = 3. So again we guess that 𝑓(𝑛) = 𝑛, for all n. Let us prove by using the strong principle of mathematical induction. Let f(n) = 𝑛 for all n < a, fixed 𝑚 ∈ 𝑁. Now, we should prove that f(m)= m. If m is an even integer, then f(m) = 2𝑘 and k < m. So, 𝑓(𝑚) = 𝑓(2𝑘) = 𝑓(2) × 𝑓(𝑘) = 2 × 𝑘 = 2𝑘 = 𝑚 So, all even m, f(m) = m. If m is an odd integer, let m = 2𝑘 + 1 And f(2k) < f( 2k + 1)< f(2k + 2) 2k < f(2k + 1) < (2k + 1) (Because the function f(n) = n is true for all even integer n). But only integer lying between 2k and 2k + 2, is 2k + 1, (since the range of f is integer). Thus, f(2k + 1) = 2k + 1 i.e., f(m) = m, in the case of odd m also. Thus, f(n) = n, for all 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 ∴ 𝑓(1983) = 1983 82. First let us show that the expression 𝑓(𝑚) = 1 8 [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6] is an integer. 𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑚 = 1 8 × [2 × 3𝑐0 × 33 + 2 × 3𝑐2 × 3 1 × (2√2) 2 − 6] Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 53 = 1 8 × [54 + 144 − 6] = 1 8 × [192] = 24 And hence, is an integer. For any m > 1, let us prove that the expression 𝑓(𝑚 + 1) = 1 8 [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6] is an integer. Expanding and cancelling the terms, we get 𝑓(𝑚 + 1) = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6] = 1 4 × [32𝑚+1 + 2𝑚 + 1𝑐2. 32𝑚−1. (2√2) 2 + 2𝑚 + 1𝑐4. 32𝑚−3(2√2) 4 + ⋯ + 2𝑚 + 1𝑐𝑚. 3.

(2. √2)2𝑚 + 32𝑚+1 − 3] All the terms in the above expression except 32𝑚+1 − 3 are multiples of 4, as the even powers of (2√2) is a multiple of 4. 32𝑚+1 − 3 = 3[9𝑚 − 1] is also a multiple of 4. 𝑁𝑜𝑤, 𝑓(𝑚) + 1 = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6] + 1 = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6 + 8] = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + 2] Now, 3 + 2√2 = (1 + √2) 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 3 − 2√2 = (1 − √2) 2. 𝑆𝑜, 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + 2] = 1 8 × [{(1 + √2) 2} 2𝑚+1 + {(1 − √2) 2} 2𝑚+1 + 2] = 1 8 × [{(1 + √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + {(1 − √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + 2] = 1 8 × [{(1 + √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + {(1 − √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 − 2(−1)] = 1 8 × [{(1 + √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + {(1 − √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 − 2 × (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1(1 − √2) 2𝑚+1] Since (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1(1 − √2) 2𝑚+1 = [(1 + √2)(1 − √2)]2𝑚+1 = (−1)2𝑚+1 = −1. So the given expression is equal to = { (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1 − (1 − √2) 2𝑚+1 2√2 } 2 Note that Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 54 (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1 − (1 − √2) 2𝑚+1 2√2 Is an integer, as all the left over terms contain 2√2 as a factor in the numerator. 𝑁𝑜𝑤, 2𝑓(𝑚) + 1 = 1 4 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 6] + 1 = 1 4 × [(3 + 2√2) 2𝑚+1 + (3 − 2√2) 2𝑚+1 − 2] Since n is shown to be an integer, so (2n + 1) is also an integer. Now, (2n + 1) can be written as = 1 4 × [{(1 + √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + {(1 − √2)2𝑚+1} 2 − 2] = 1 4 × [{(1 + √2) 2𝑚+1} 2 + {(1 − √2)2𝑚+1} 2 + 2 × {(1 + √2)(1 − √2)}2𝑚+1] = { (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1 + (1 − √2) 2𝑚+1 2 } 2 By a similar reasoning, the expression (1 + √2) 2𝑚+1 + (1 − √2) 2𝑚+1 2 Is an integer. Hence, the result. 83. As the terms containing √2 vanishes in the expansion of (17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 and integral terms are all multiples of 8 and hence, n is an integer. (Prove it). 𝑛 − 1 = 1 8 × [(17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 + 6 − 8] = 1 8 × [(17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 − 2] We know 17 + 12√2 = (3 + 2√2) 2 17 − 12√2 = (3 − 2√2) 2 Again both (17 + 12√2)(17 − 12√2) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 (3 + 2√2)(3 − 2√2) are equal to 1. 𝑆𝑜, 1 8 × [(17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 − 2] = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 𝑚] 2 + [(3 − 2√2) 𝑚] 2 − 2 × (3 + 2√2)(3 − 2√2) = 1 8 × [(3 + 2√2) 𝑚 − (3 − 2√2) 𝑚 2√2 ] 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 2𝑛 − 1 = 1 4 × [(17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 + 6 − 4] = 1 4 × [(17 + 12√2) 𝑚 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑚 + 2] = [(3 + 2√2) 𝑚 + (3 − 2√2) 𝑚 2 ] 2 And hence the result. (Show that (3 + 2√2) 𝑚 − (3 − 2√2) 𝑚 𝑎𝑛𝑑 (3+2√2) 𝑚+(3−2√2) 𝑚 2 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑜 (1+√2) 𝑛−(1−√2) 𝑛 2√2 is also an integer and hence, their sum is also an integer. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 55 Thus, 1 32 [(17 + 12√2) 𝑛 + (17 − 12√2) 𝑛 − 2] is a square integer. To show that exp. (1) can be written as 1 2 𝑚(𝑚 + 1). Consider the exp.

Clearly for 𝑛 = 1, we get {(1 + √2) 𝑛 − (1 − √2)𝑛} 2 4 = 8 4 = 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 {(1 + √2) 𝑛 + (1 − √2) 𝑛} 2 4 = 4 4 = 1 And hence for 𝑛 = 1, {(1+√2) 𝑛+(1−√2) 𝑛} 2 4 𝑎𝑛𝑑 {(1+√2) 𝑛−(1−√2) 𝑛} 2 4 Are consecutive integers. For any n, (1 + √2) 𝑛 − (1 − √2) 𝑛 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 (1 + √2) 𝑛 + (1 − √2) 𝑛 2 Are integers (prove) and, hence { (1 + √2) 𝑛 − (1 − √2) 𝑛 2 } 2 = {(1 + √2) 𝑛 − (1 − √2) 𝑛} 2 4 𝑎𝑛𝑑 {(1+√2) 𝑛−(1−√2) 𝑛 2 } 2 = {(1+√2) 𝑛−(1−√2) 𝑛} 2 4 𝑎𝑟𝑒 integers. 𝑁𝑜𝑤, {(1 + √2) 𝑛 + (1 − √2) 𝑛} 2 4 = (1 + √2) 2𝑛 + (1 − √2) 2𝑛 − 2 4 = (3 + 2√2) 𝑛 + (3 − 2√2) 𝑛 − 2 4 … … (3) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦, {(1 + √2) 𝑛 − (1 − √2) 𝑛} 2 4 = (3 + 2√2) 𝑛 + (3 − 2√2) 𝑛 − 2 4 … (4) ∴ From exp.

If (a, b, c) is a valid triplet then (7 – c, 7 – b, 7 – a) is also a valid triplet as 1 ≤ (7 − 𝑐) ≤ (7 − 𝑏) ≤ (7 − 𝑎) ≤ 6.

Let the required number be ….abc 7. Since it is given that 5(… 𝑎𝑏𝑐7) = 7 … 𝑎𝑏𝑐 We find that 𝑐 = 5. Putting this value of c back in the equation we have 5(…ab57) = 7…ab5 we give 𝑏 = 8. Continuing this way till we get 7 for the first time, we find that required number is 142857. 87. To test the divisibility of the number N = 19202122… 919293 by 3 or 9 we should find the sum of the digits of N. Noting that 1 occurs 9 times in the digits from 19 to 93 (in 19, 21, 31, …, 91), 2 occurs 18 times (in 20, 21, 22, …, 29, 32, 42, …., 92) etc. we find the sum of the digits of N to be 717. This number is divisible by 3 (since 7 + 1 + 7= 15 is so) but not by 9. Thus the highest power of 3 dividing N is 3. 88. First note that the set of primes dividing x is the same as the set of primes dividing y. Take any prime p dividing x (and hence y also) and suppose it occur to the power 𝛼 in x and 𝛽 in y (that is, 𝑝𝛼 is the maximum power of p dividing x and 𝑝𝛽 is the maximum power of p dividing y). Then 𝑥𝑎 = 𝑦𝑏 ⇒ 𝑝𝛼𝑎 = 𝑝𝛽𝑏 ⇒ 𝛼𝑎 = 𝛽𝑏 ⇒ 𝑎|𝛽𝑏 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏|𝛼𝑎 ⇒ 𝑎|𝛽 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏|𝛼 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝛼, 𝛽) = 1. Write 𝛽 = 𝛼𝛽𝑝 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛼 = 𝛽𝛼𝑝. Then 𝑝𝛼𝑎 = 𝑝𝛽𝑏 ⇒ 𝑝𝑎𝑏𝛼𝑝 = 𝑝𝑎𝑏𝛽𝑝 ⇒ 𝛼𝑝 = 𝛽𝑝. For each prime p dividing x and (and hence y) get the integer 𝛼𝑝. Verify that the integer 𝑛 = ∏ 𝑝𝛼𝑝 𝑝|𝑛 (this notation means n is the product of the numbers 𝑝𝛼𝑝 for each prime p dividing n) satisfies the required properties. 89. Let 𝑛 = 𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏 be a number satisfying the given properties. Since n is 𝛼 square the only possibilities for b are 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9. Among them 1, 5, 6 and 9 are not possible since the numbers aa 11, aa 55, and aa99 leave remainder 3 and aa 66 leaves remainder 2 when divided by 4, which is not possible if n is a square. So b can only be 4. Clearly 11 divides 𝑛 = 𝑎𝑎𝑏𝑏. Since n is a square and 11 is a prime. 112 also divides 𝑛 = 11 × 𝑎0𝑏 that is, 11 divides a0b which implies 11 divides a + b. Since b can be only 4, the only possibility for a is 𝑎 = 7. Noting that 7744 = (88) 2 is indeed a square, we conclude that 7744 is the only number with the given properties. 90. Let [√𝑛] = 𝑘. Then 𝑘2 < 𝑛 < (𝑘 + 1)2. Also since 𝑘3 divides n 2, we have that k2 divides n 2 and hence k divides n. Thus, the only possibilities for n are 𝑛 = 𝑘2 + 𝑘 and 𝑛 = 𝑘2 + 2𝑘. (i) Let 𝑛 = 𝑘2 + 𝑘. Then Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 58 𝑘3|𝑛2 ⇒ 𝑘3|(𝑘2 + 𝑘)2 = 𝑘4 + 2𝑘3 + 𝑘2 ⇒ 𝑘3|𝑘2 ⇒ 𝑘 = 1 i.e., 𝑛 = 2. (ii) Let 𝑛 = 𝑘2 + 2𝑘. Then 𝑘3| 𝑛2 ⇒ 𝑘3 |(𝑘2 + 2𝑘)2 = 𝑘4 + 4𝑘3 + 4𝑘2 Which implies that 𝑘3| 4𝑘2 𝑜𝑟 𝑘|4. Therefore, 𝑘 = 1, 2 𝑜𝑟 4. When 𝑘 = 1, 2, 4, we get the corresponding values 3, 8 and 24 for n. Thus, n= 2, 3, 8 and 24 are all positive integers satisfying the given conditions. 91. Since the product of k consecutive integers is divisible by k!, A(n) is an integer. We compare the highest powers of 2 dividing the numerator and denominator to determine the nature of A(n). Suppose we express n in the base 2, say, 𝑛 = 𝑎𝑙2𝑙 + 𝑎𝑙−12 𝑙−1 + 𝑎𝑙−22𝑙−2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑙. 2 + 𝑎0 = 1. The highest power of 2 dividing n! is given by 𝑠 = [𝑛 2] + [ 𝑛 22] + [ 𝑛 23] + ⋯ + [ 𝑛 2𝑙] Where [x] denotes the largest integer smaller than x. But, for 1 ≤ 𝑚 ≤ 𝑙. [ 𝑛 2𝑚] = 𝑎𝑙2𝑙−𝑚 + 𝑎𝑙−22𝑙−𝑚−1 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑚 Thus, 𝑠 = ∑ [ 𝑛 2𝑚] 𝑙 𝑚=1 = ∑ ∑ 𝑎𝑘2𝑘−𝑚 𝑙 𝑘=𝑚 𝑙 𝑚=1 = ∑ 𝑎𝑘 ( ∑ 2𝑚 − 1 𝑘 𝑚=1 ) 𝑙 𝑘=1 = ∑ 𝑎𝑘(2𝑘 − 1) 𝑙 𝑘=1 = ∑ 𝑎𝑘2𝑘 − ∑ 𝑎𝑘 𝑙 𝑘=0 𝑙 𝑘=0 = 𝑛 − {𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 2} Hence the highest power of 2 dividing (𝑛!)2 is 2𝑠 = 2𝑛 − 2 (sum of the digits of n in the base 2). Similarly the highest power of 2 dividing (2n)! is t = 2𝑛 − (sum of the digits of 2n in the base 2). But the digits of n in base 2 and those of 2n in base 2 are the same except for a zero at the end of the representation for 2n. Thus 𝑡 − 2𝑠 = 𝑎𝑙 + 𝑎𝑙−1 + 𝑎𝑙−2 + ⋯ + 𝑎𝑙 + 𝑎0 Where the 𝑎𝑖 are the digits of n in base 2. Note that 𝑎𝑙 = 1. Hence 𝑡 − 2𝑠 ≥ 1. But A(n) is even if and only if 𝑡 − 2𝑠 ≥ 1. Hence it follows that A(n) is even for all n. Moreover A(n) is divisible by 4 if and only if 𝑡 − 2𝑠 ≥ 2. Since A(1) = 2, 4 does not divide A(1). Suppose n = 2 for some l. Then 𝑎𝑙 = 1 and 𝑎𝑖 = 0 𝑓𝑜𝑟 0 ≤ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑙 − 1. Hence 𝑡 − 2𝑠 = 1 and A(n) is not divisible by 4. On the other hand if n is not a power of 2, then for some l, 𝑛 = 2𝑙 + 𝑎𝑙−12𝑙−1 + 𝑎𝑙−22𝑙−2 + ⋯ + 𝑎0 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 59 Where 𝑎𝑖 ≠ 0 for at least one i and hence must be equal to 1. Thus 𝑡 − 2𝑠 ≥ 1 + 𝑎𝑖 ≥ 2. It follows that A(n) is divisible by 4 if and only if n is not a power of 2. Remark : Given any prime p, the highest power of s of p dividing n! is given by 𝑠 = 𝑛 − (𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑔𝑖𝑡𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑠𝑒 𝑝) 𝑝 − 1 92. Take 𝑎 = 2𝑛 + 1 2 , 𝑏 = 2𝑛+1 + 1 2. In the binomial expansions of 𝑎𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏𝑘, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛, we see that all the terms except the last are integral and the last terms are each equal to 1/2k. Hence 𝑎𝑘 − 𝑏𝑘 is an integer for 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛. 93. ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. ‘O’ is the circumcentre of ∆𝐴𝑃𝐵. That is, if M is the midpoint of PB, then OM is ⊥r to PB in the fig., H, is the ortho−centre of ∆𝐶𝑃𝐷. Let OP produced meet DC in L. To prove that : O, P and H, are collinear. That is, to prove that H lies on OP or OP produced. That is, to prove that H lies on OP or OP produced. Or, in other words, OP produced is perpendicular to DC. Proof : Since quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic. ∠𝐶𝐷𝐵 = ∠𝐶𝐴𝐵 = ∠𝑃𝐴𝐵 = 1 2 ∠𝑃𝑂𝐵 (𝑆𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑂 𝑖𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑐𝑖𝑟𝑐𝑢𝑚𝑐𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑟𝑒 𝑜𝑓 ∆𝑃𝐴𝐵) = ∠𝑃𝑂𝑀(= ∠𝐵𝑂𝑀)𝑎𝑠 𝑂𝑀 𝑖𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑒 ⊥ 𝑟 𝑏𝑖𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑃𝐵 In ∆𝐿𝐷𝑃 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∆𝑀𝑂𝑃 ∠𝐿𝐷𝑃 = ∠𝑃𝑂𝑀 ∠𝐷𝑃𝐿 = ∠𝑂𝑃𝑀 (𝑉𝑒𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑦 𝑜𝑝𝑝. ∠𝑠) ∴ ∠𝑃𝐿𝐷 = ∠𝑃𝑀𝑂 = 90° and hence the result. 94. Let ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 = ∠𝐴𝐶𝐵 = 𝑏° AT is the angle bisector of ∠𝐴. I is the midpoint of PQ. Now 𝐴𝑃 = 𝐴𝑄 as the smaller circle touches AB and AC at P and Q respectively. The centre of the circle PQT lies on the angle bisector of ∠𝐴, namely AT; since PQ is the chord of contact of the circle PQT, 𝑃𝑄 ⊥ 𝐴𝑇 and the midpoint I of PQ lies on AT. Now, to prove that I is the incentre of ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶, it is enough to prove that BI is the angle bisector of ∠𝐵 and CI is the angle bisector of ∠𝐶 respectively. By symmetry, ∠𝑃𝑇𝐼 = ∠𝑄𝑇𝐼 = 𝑎°. Now ∠𝐴𝐵𝑇 = 90° (∵ 𝐴𝑇 𝑖𝑠 𝑑𝑖𝑎𝑚𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 ⊙ 𝐴𝐵𝐶) ∴ ∠𝑃𝐵𝑇 = 90° Also, ∠𝑃𝐼𝑇 = 90° ∴ PBTI is cyclic. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 60 ∴ ∠𝑃𝐵𝐼 = ∠𝑃𝑇𝐼 = 𝑎° (𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑠𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡) ∴ ∠𝐼𝐵𝐷 = ∠𝐴𝐵𝐷 − ∠𝐴𝐵𝐼 = 𝑏 − 𝑎 ∠𝑇𝐵𝐶 = ∠𝑇𝐴𝐶 = 90° − 𝑏 ∴ ∠𝐼𝐵𝑇 = ∠𝐼𝐵𝐷 + ∠𝐷𝐵𝑇 = 𝑏 − 𝑎 + 90° − 𝑏 = 90° − 𝑎 But since PBTI is cyclic, ∠𝐼𝑃𝑇 = ∠𝐼𝐵𝑇 = 90° − 𝑎 …….(1) ∠𝐵𝑃𝑇 = 180° − ∠𝑇𝑃𝐴 = 180° − ∠𝐴𝑃𝐼 − ∠𝐼𝑃𝑇 = 180° − 𝑏 − 90° + 𝑎 ……..(2) = 90° + 𝑎 − 𝑏 But APT is a tangent to circle PQ. ∴ ∠𝐵𝑃𝑇 = ∠𝑃𝑄𝑇 = ∠𝐼𝑄𝑇 From (1) and (2), we get 90° + 𝑎 − 𝑏 = 90° − 𝑎 2𝑎 = 𝑏 ∴ ∠𝐼𝐵𝐷 = 𝑏 − ∠𝑃𝐵𝐼 = 2𝑎 − 𝑎 = 𝑎 ∴ ∠𝐼𝐵𝐷 = ∠𝑃𝐵𝐼 ∴ 𝐵𝐼 is the angle bisector of ∠𝐵 95. Area of the right angled ∆𝐴𝐶𝐵 = 1 2 𝐴𝐶 × 𝐵𝐶 = 1 2 (𝑥 + 𝑟)(𝑦 + 𝑟) = 1 2 {𝑥𝑦 + 𝑟(𝑥 + 𝑦) + 𝑟2} ⇒ 𝐴𝐶 × 𝐵𝐶 = 𝑥𝑦 + 𝑟𝐴𝐵 + 𝑟2 ⇒ 𝑥𝑦 = 𝐴𝐶 × 𝐵𝐶 − 𝑟𝐴𝐵 − 𝑟2 Now 𝐴𝐼2 × 𝐵𝐼2 = (𝑥2 + 𝑟2)(𝑦2 + 𝑟2) = 𝑥2𝑦2 + 𝑟2(𝑥2 + 𝑦2) + 𝑟4 = 𝑥2𝑦2 + 𝑟2[(𝑥 + 𝑦)2 − 2𝑥𝑦] + 𝑟4 = 𝑥2𝑦2 + 𝑟2[𝐴𝐵2 − 2𝑥𝑦] + 𝑟4 = 𝑥2𝑦2 + 𝑟2𝐴𝐵2 − 𝑟22𝑥𝑦 + 𝑟4 = 𝑟2𝐴𝐵2 + (𝑟2 − 𝑥𝑦) 2 = 𝑟2𝐴𝐵2 + [𝑟2 − 𝐴𝐶 × 𝐵𝐶 + 𝑟𝐴𝐵 + 𝑟2]2 = 𝑟2𝐴𝐵2 + [2𝑟2 − 𝐴𝐶 × 𝐵𝐶 + 𝑟𝐴𝐵]2 Area of the ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶 = 𝑟(𝑟 + 𝑥 + 𝑦) = 𝑟(𝑟 + 𝐴𝐵) = 𝑟2 + 𝑟𝐴𝐵 = 1 2 𝐴𝐶.

Let P be the point of intersection of the ⊥r chord AB and CD and let the centre O, belong to the part Z. Let K and L be points on the arc AC and BD respectively as shown in the figure. Let M and N be the midpoints of the chord AB and CD respectively. Since AB and CD intersect each other at right angle, Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 62 We have 𝐵𝑂𝐷⏞ + 𝐶𝑂𝐴⏞ = 𝜋 We have E(AOCK) + E(BODL) = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 𝐸(𝑋) + 𝐸(𝑍) = 𝐸(𝐴𝑂𝐶𝐾) + 𝐸(𝐵𝑂𝐷𝐿) − 𝐸(𝑂𝐴𝑃) − 𝐸(𝐶𝑂𝑃) + 𝐸(𝑃𝑂𝐷) + 𝐸(𝑃𝑂𝐵) = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 − 1 2 𝑂𝑀 × 𝐴𝑃 − 1 2 𝑂𝑁 × 𝐶𝑃 + 1 2 𝑂𝑁 × 𝐷𝑃 + 1 2 𝑂𝑀 × 𝐵𝑃 = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 1 2 𝑂𝑀(𝐵𝑃 − 𝐴𝑃) + 1 2 𝑂𝑁 (𝐷𝑃 − 𝐶𝑃) = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 1 2 𝑂𝑀[(𝐵𝑀 + 𝑀𝑃) − (𝐴𝑀 − 𝑀𝑃)] + 1 2 𝑂𝑁[(𝐷𝑁 + 𝑃𝑁) − (𝐶𝑁 − 𝑃𝑁)] = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 𝑂𝑀. 𝑀𝑃 + 𝑂𝑁 × 𝑁𝑃 = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 2𝐸(𝑂𝑁𝑃𝑀) Where E(ONPM) is the area of the rectangle ONPM. Similarly, 𝐸(𝑌) + 𝐸(𝑊) = 𝜋𝑅2 − [1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 2𝐸(𝑂𝑁𝑃𝑀)] = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 − 2𝐸(𝑂𝑁𝑃𝑀) The quantity 𝐸(𝑋) + 𝐸(𝑍) 𝐸(𝑌) + 𝐸(𝑊) = 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 + 2𝐸(𝑂𝑁𝑃𝑀) 1 2 𝜋𝑅2 − 2𝐸(𝑂𝑁𝑃𝑀) The maximum quantity thus corresponds to the maximum of 2E (ONPM) which is 𝑅2 and hence the maximum quantity of 𝐸(𝑋) + 𝐸(𝑍) 𝐸(𝑌) + 𝐸(𝑊) = 𝑅2 ( 1 2 𝜋 + 1) 𝑅2 ( 1 2 𝜋 − 1) = 𝜋 + 2 𝜋 − 2 And the minimum quantity is obtained when 2E (ONPM)= 0 (i.e., when the perpendicular chord are two ⊥ 𝑟 diameters) Then the minimum value of 𝐸(𝑋) + 𝐸(𝑍) 𝐸(𝑌) + 𝐸(𝑊) = 1 When 𝑂 ∈ the region Y, then the minimum value can be shown to be 𝜋−2 𝜋+2 and the maximum value is 1. Note: The maximum is reached when we have the conditions as shown in the adjacent figure. 𝑂𝑀. 𝑂𝑁 = 𝑅 √2 . 𝑅 √2 = 𝑅2 2 99. Let C1, C2, be two circles. We first show that if APB is a straight line such that there is a circle C touching C1 at A and C2 at B, then AB is the segment giving the required maximum. Let A’P and PB’ be any other chord so that A’PB’ may be collinear and the extension of these chords meet the circle C at C and D. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 63 𝐶𝑃. 𝑃𝐷 = 𝐴𝑃. 𝑃𝐵 > 𝐴′𝑃 × 𝑃𝐵′ ∴ 𝐴𝑃. 𝑃𝐵 is maximum. Now we need to construct such a chord APB. For this we need to construct a circle C touching C1 and C2 at points A and B so that APB are collinear. Let us find the properties of the points A and B. Let O be the centre of the circle C and O1 and O2 be the centres of the circles C1 and C2. Now C and C1 touch at A. ∴ 𝐴𝑂1𝑂 are collinear. Similarly BO2O are collinear. Let AT, BS be the common tangents to circles C and C1 and C and C2 respectively. Let ∠𝑃𝐴𝑇 = 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝑃𝐵𝑆 = 𝑦 since AT is tangent to circle C. ∠𝑃𝐴𝑇 = 𝑥 = 1 2 ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 (𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒 𝑖𝑛 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒 𝑠𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑜𝑟𝑒𝑚) Since BS is tangent to circle C. ∠𝑃𝐵𝑆 = 𝑦 = 1 2 ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 ∴ 𝑥 = 𝑦. Since AT is tangent to circle C1, we get ∠𝑃𝐴𝑇 = 𝑥 = 1 2 ∠𝐴𝑂1𝑃 Similarly, since BS is tangent to circle C2, we get ∠𝑃𝐵𝑆 = 𝑦 = 1 2 ∠𝐵𝑂2𝑃 = 𝑥 ∴ ∠𝐴𝑂1𝑃 = ∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 = ∠𝐵𝑂2𝑃 ∴ ∆𝐴𝑂1𝑃 ≈ ∆𝑃𝑂2𝐵 ∴ 𝐴𝑃 𝑃𝐵 = 𝐴𝑂1 𝑃𝑂2 = 𝑟1 𝑟2 Therefore the line segment AB must be such that P divides AB internally in the ratio r1 : r2. Further PO2||OO1 and PO1||OO2. So join PO1 and PO2. Through O1 draw a line parallel to PO2 to meet circle C1 in A. Through O2 draw a line parallel to PO1 to meet the circle C2 in B. Now these two parallel lines drawn meet at O. If we draw a circle with O as centre and radius OA= OB, the circle touches C1 at A and C2 at B. Note, we can prove that APB are collinear and AB is the required chord. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 64 Note: In the previous problem the line AB and O1O2 meet in a point S1 say. This point S1 divides O1O2 externally in the ratio r1:r2. The point S1 is called the external centre of similitude of the 2 circles C1 and C2. If we draw any line l through S1 meeting C1 in P1, Q1 and C2 in P2, Q2 then P2, Q2 then O1P1||O2P2 and O1Q1||O2Q2. Moreover the direct common tangent to the two circles C1 and C2 meet at S1. 100. Draw BB’ ⊥ 𝑟 to 𝑙 and BB’=CD. Join AB’ and extend it to Y. Through C and D draw perpendiculars to AY meeting AY at P and S. Through B draw BZ perpendicular to CP and SD meeting them at Q and R respectively. PQRS is the required square. Proof: Draw BL and CN ⊥ 𝑟 to AS and SD respectively. ∆𝐿𝐵𝐵′ ≡ ∆𝑁𝐶𝐷 𝑎𝑠 ∠𝐿𝐵𝐵′ = 90° − ∠𝐴𝐵𝐿 = ∠𝐿𝐴𝐵 = ∠𝑁𝐶𝐷 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐵𝐵′ = 𝐶𝐷𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐵𝐿𝐵′ = ∠𝐶𝑁𝐷 = 90° 𝑃𝑄 = 𝐿𝐵 = 𝐶𝑁 = 𝑄𝑅 = 𝑃𝑆 Thus the adjacent sides of the rectangle PQRS are equal and hence it is a square. If B’ is constructed on the opposite half−plane, we get P’Q’R’S’, the reflection of PQRS about the line 𝑙 and lying on the opposite half plane. In fact, this construction is possible, even if A, B, C, D are such that no three of these are collinear (i.e., for any four points in the plane). This construction exactly follows the same procedure. BB’ (BB’’) is perpendicular to CD and equal to CD. Join AB’ (or AB’). Draw CP, DS ⊥ 𝑟 to AB’ produced and extend PC and SD. Through B draw BR and BQ perpendicular to SR and PQ, PQRS is the required square. Draw CP1, DS1 ⊥ 𝑟 to AB’’ and through B draw ⊥ 𝑟 to CP1 and DS1 produced meeting them at Q1 and R1 respectively. P1Q1R1S1 is the required square. Thus there are two solutions. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 65 101. Let m∠𝐴𝑂𝐵 = 𝜃 𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑎 𝑜𝑓 ∆𝐴𝑂𝐵 = 𝑠1 = 1 2 𝑂𝐴. 𝑂𝐵. sin 𝜃. Similarly 𝑠2 = 1 2 𝑂𝐷.

Before proving the main problem, let us prove the following: If in ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶, AD is the median, XY is a line segment parallel to BC intersecting the median.

Join AM. Join the collinear points P, E, N MPAN is a cyclic quadrilateral as ∠𝑀𝑃𝐴 + ∠𝑀𝑁𝐴 = 90° + 90° = 180° Since EF is perpendicular to BC and XY is drawn parallel to BC, ∠𝑋𝐸𝑀 = ∠𝐸𝐹𝐵 = 90° In the quadrilateral MPXE, ∠𝑀𝑃𝑋 + ∠𝑀𝐸𝑋 = 90° + 90° = 180° And hence MPXE is a cyclic quadrilateral and in the quadrilateral MENY. ∠𝑀𝐸𝑌 = ∠𝑀𝑁𝑌 = 90° … … (6) So MENY is a cyclic quadrilateral, since ∠𝑀𝐸𝑌 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝑀𝑁𝑌 are subtended by MY at E and N and they are equal by (6). In ∆s MEX and MEY, 𝑋𝐸 = 𝑌𝐸 ∠𝑀𝐸𝑋 = ∠𝑀𝐸𝑌 = 90° ME is common And hence ∆𝑀𝐸𝑋 ≡ ∆𝑀𝐸𝑌 ∴ ∠𝑀𝑋𝐸 = ∠𝑀𝑌𝐸 … .

Let the incircle touch the side BC at G. ∠𝐴𝐷𝐻 = 180° − ∠𝐷𝐴𝐹 = 180° − 𝐴 2 − 𝐵 = 𝐶 + 𝐴 2 (Since ∠𝐻𝐴𝐹 = ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶, being angles in alternate segments) If the incircle touches BC at G, then ∠𝐴𝐷𝐺 = ∠𝐷𝐴𝐶 + ∠𝐴𝐶𝐷 (exterior angle = sum of the remote interior angles). = 𝐴 2 + 𝐶 𝑖. 𝑒. , ∠𝐼𝐷𝐺 = ∠𝐼𝐷𝐻 … .

Draw PC’||AB and P’C’ ||BC as in the figure. ∆𝐴𝑃′𝐶′ is similar to ∆ APC [∵ ∠𝑃′𝐴𝐶′ = ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶, ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = ∠𝐴𝐶′𝑃′] And ∆𝑃𝐶′𝑃′ is similar to ∆𝐴𝐵𝑃 [∵ ∠𝐶′𝑃′𝑃 = ∠𝐵𝑃𝐴; ∠𝐶′𝑃𝑃′ = ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃] ∴ 𝑃′𝐶′ 𝑃𝐶 = 𝐴𝑃′ 𝐴𝑃 … … (1) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃𝐵 𝑃′𝐶′ 𝑃𝐵 = 𝑃′𝑃 𝑃𝐴 … … . (2) Adding (1) and (2), we get 𝑃′𝐶′ 𝑃𝐶 = 𝑃′𝐶′ 𝑃𝐵 = 𝐴𝑃′ + 𝑃′𝑃 𝑃𝐴 ⇒ 𝑃′𝐶′ ( 1 𝑃𝐶 + 1 𝑃𝐵) = 1 𝑜𝑟, 1 𝑃𝐵 + 1 𝑃𝐶 = 1 𝑃′𝐶′ If the quantity 1 𝑃𝐵 + 1 𝑃𝐶 is a maximum, then P’C’ should be minimum. But C’P’ is minimum if C’P’ is ⊥ 𝑟 to AP. But P’C’ is || to BC and P’C’ ⊥ 𝑟 to AP implies BC should be perpendicular to AP. So, join the vertex A of the given angle to the given point P and draw perpendicular to AP through P, terminated by the arms of the given angle A at C and B. Now, we have got the chord BPC satisfying the hypothesis. 118. ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶 is equilateral ∴ 𝐴𝐵 = 𝐵𝐶 = 𝐶𝐴 ACPB is a cyclic quadrilateral ∴ By Ptolemy’s theorem, we get 𝑃𝐶. 𝐴𝐵 + 𝑃𝐵. 𝐴𝐶 = 𝑃𝐴.

𝑃𝐶 = 1 𝑃𝑄 Substituting in (1), we get 1 𝑃𝐵 + 1 𝑃𝐶 = 1 𝑃𝑄. 119. Let a, b, c be the sides of ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶. Let ℎ𝑎, ℎ𝑏, ℎ𝑐 𝑏𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 ∆𝐴′𝐵′𝐶′. They are also the altitudes of ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶.

Since both S1 and S2 touch AB, AC, their centres O1, O2 lie on the angle bisector of ∠𝐴. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 77 𝐼𝑛 ∆𝐴𝑂𝑂1 (𝑂1𝑂)2 = (𝑅 − 𝑟1) 2 = 𝑅2 + (√2𝑟1) 2 − 2𝑅√2𝑟1 cos(𝐵 − 45°) [Since S and S1 touch each other, the distance between their centres = difference in the radii = 𝑅 − 𝑟1. Also 𝐴𝑂1 = √2 𝑟1 ∠𝑂𝐴𝑂1 = ∠𝑂𝐴𝐵 − ∠𝑂1𝐴𝐵 = 𝐵 − 45° O is the midpoint of the hypotenuse BC ∴ 𝑂𝐵 = 𝑂𝐴 = 𝑂𝐶, ℎ𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 ∠𝑂𝐴𝐵 = ∠𝑂𝐵𝐴 = ∠𝐵] ∴ 𝑅2 + 𝑟1 2 − 2𝑅1 = 𝑅2 + 2𝑟1 2 − 2𝑅√2𝑟1 ( cos 𝐵 √2 + sin 𝐵 √2 ) − 2𝑅𝑟1 = 𝑟1 2 − 𝑟1(2𝑅 sin 𝐶 + 2𝑅 sin 𝐵) [∵ 𝑖𝑡 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑟𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒𝑑 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑙𝑒, ∠𝐶 = 90 − ∠𝐵] = 𝑟1 2 − 𝑟1(𝑏 + 𝑐) But 2𝑅 = 𝑎 −𝑎𝑟1 = 𝑟1 2 − 𝑟1(𝑏 + 𝑐) (𝑏 + 𝑐 − 𝑎) = 𝑟1 Similarly, from ∆𝑂2𝑂𝐴, we get cancelling r1 𝑟2 = (𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑎) ∴ 𝑟1𝑟2 = (𝑏 + 𝑐) 2 − 𝑎2 = 2𝑏𝑐 = 4. 1 2 𝑏𝑐 = 4∆ 121. Join PQ, BZ and AX. In circle C2, we have ∠𝑍𝐵𝑃 = ∠𝑍𝑄𝑃; in circle C1, we have ∠𝑃𝑄𝑋 = ∠𝑃𝐴𝑋. Thus, we obtain ∠𝑍𝐵𝐴 = ∠𝐵𝐴𝑋. (So BZ is parallel to AX). The triangles AXY and BZY are then congruent, because by hypothesis 𝐴𝑌 = 𝑌𝐵 and angles AYX and YAX are respectively equal to BYZ and YBZ. This congruence gives us 𝑋𝑌 = 𝑍𝑌, which is what we want. 122. We shall show that the locus of all such points is the union of the circumcircle and the orthocenter of the triangle ABC. Let P be any point in the cone determined by two sides, say, BA and BC. Using the sine rule in the triangles PAC and PBC, we get ∠𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 𝛼 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛼 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 78 Similarly, using the triangles CAP and BAP, we also get ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = 𝛽 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛽 Consider the case ∠𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 𝛼 and ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = 180° − 𝛽 Here we get, ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 180° − (𝑎 + 180° − 𝛽) = 𝛽 − 𝛼 Again the triangle BPC and BPA give ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃 = ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 𝑜𝑟 ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃 = 180° − ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃. If ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃 = ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 𝛾, then the sum of the angles of the quadrilateral is equal to 2𝛽 + 2𝛾. This implies that 𝛽 + 𝛾 = 180°. Since 𝛽 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛾 are angles of a triangle, this is impossible. If ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃 = 180° − ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 180° − 𝛾, then we get −2𝛽 + 360° = 180°. Hence 𝛽 = 90°. This forces that ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 90° and AP is a diameter of the circle through A, B, C and P, is on the circumcircle of ABC. Similarly, we can dispose off the case ∠𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 180° − 𝛼, ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = 𝛽. Finally consider the case, ∠𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 180° − 𝛼, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = 180° − 𝛽. Considering the triangle ACP, we see that ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 180° − ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 Similarly, the case ∠𝐶𝐴𝑃 = 𝛼, ∠𝐴𝐶𝑃 = 𝛽 𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 are supplementary angles. Thus, A, B, C and P are concyclic. On the other hand, suppose P is in the cone determined by the lines, say CB and AB extended. Since ∠𝑃𝐵𝐶 + ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶 = ∠𝑃𝐵𝐴 + ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 180° It follows that ∠𝐴𝐵𝐶 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 are supplementary angles. Thus, triangles ABC and APC, and hence triangles ABC and BPC, have the same circumradii. Now sine rule gives ∠𝐶𝑃𝐵 = 𝛽 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛽, ∠𝐴𝑃𝐵 = 𝛾 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛾 Also, if ∠𝐵𝐴𝑃 = 𝛼, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛼 Consider the case ∠𝐶𝑃𝐵 = 𝛽, ∠𝐴𝑃𝐵 = 180° − 𝛾 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 Then ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 𝛽 + 180 − 𝛾, ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶 + ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 𝛽 + 𝛾 + 2𝛼 And hence 𝛽 + 𝛾 + 2𝛼 = 𝛾 − 𝛽 𝑜𝑟 𝛼 + 𝛽 = 0 which is impossible. If ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 180° − 𝛼, then we have ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 𝛽 + 180 − 𝛾, ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶 + ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 𝛽 + 𝛾 + 180. Then we would have, 𝛾 − 𝛽 = 𝛽 + 𝛾 + 180 Which is impossible. Similarly we can dispose off the cases ∠𝐶𝑃𝐵 = 180° − 𝛽, ∠𝐴𝑃𝐵 = 𝛾, ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 𝑜𝑟 180° − 𝛼 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 79 Finally if ∠𝐶𝑃𝐵 = 𝛽, ∠𝐴𝑃𝐵 = 𝛾, ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 180° − 𝛼 Then again we get ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 𝛽 + 𝛾, ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶 + ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 180° + 𝛽 + 𝛾 This forces 2(𝛽 + 𝛾) = 0 which is impossible. We conclude that the only possibility is ∠𝐴𝑃𝐵 = 𝛾, ∠𝐶𝑃𝐵 = 𝛽 𝑎𝑛𝑑 ∠𝐵𝐶𝑃 = 𝛼 In this case, we get ∠𝐴𝑃𝐶 = 𝛽 + 𝛾, ∠𝑃𝐴𝐶 + ∠𝑃𝐶𝐴 = 2𝛼 + 𝛽 + 𝛾 This gives us 𝑎 = 90° − (𝛽 + 𝛾) Thus, 𝛼 + 𝛽 = 90° − 𝛾, 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝛼 + 𝛽 = 90° − 𝛽. These imply that AP is perpendicular to CB and CP is perpendicular to AB. Hence P is the orthocenter. Similarly we can consider other regions determined by BA and CA or BC and AC. Finally if P is a point inside the triangle, we can show that P is the orthocenter of the triangle ABC in the similar way. Thus if P is any point satisfying the hypothesis, then either P is the orthocenter of the triangle ABC or P must be on the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. Aliter: We need to know the following facts about three equal circles intersecting in a common point. If three congruent (that is, equal) circle C1, C2, C3 have a common point P and A, B, C are the other three points of intersections, then (a) The circumcircle of triangle ABC has the same radius as the three circles; and (b) The point P is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. A brief proof of (a) and (b) follows: Let X, Y, Z be the centres of the circles C1, C2, C3 respectively. Complete the quadrilaterals PXBZ and PXCY, join AP and ZY. Observe that PXBZ and PXCY are rhombuses and so ZB is parallel and equal to YC. Hence so are BC and ZY. Since AP is perpendicular to ZY, AP is perpendicular to BC. Similarly BP and CP are perpendicular to CA and AB respectively. Hence P is the orthocenter of triangle ABC. This proves (b). To prove (a), complete the parallelogram AYCQ, which is in fact a rhombus. So 𝐴𝑄 = 𝐶𝑄. It is easily see that AZBQ is also a rhombus. So 𝐴𝑄 = 𝐵𝑄. Thus Q is the circumcircle of triangle ABC and its radius (= 𝐴𝑄 = 𝐶𝑌) is the same as that of each of the three circles. Note that we have a configuration of three equal circle such that P falls outside triangle ABC, but statements (a) and (b) are still true. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 80 Coming to the problem : Let (XYZ) denote the circle through any three non collinear points X, Y, Z. It is given that three equal circles pass through P. Hence by (a) above, the four circles (PAB), (PBC), (PCA) and (ABC) are congruent to one another. Observe that either the three circles (PAB), (PBC), (PCA) coincide [and hence coincide with (ABC)] or the three circles are all distinct passing through the point P. Thus either P is on the circumcircle of ABC or P is the orthocenter of ABC. 123. We denote areas of triangles ABC, quadrilaterals ABCD, etc. by [ABC], [ABCD] etc. Join PQ and draw one of the diagonals, say BD. We use the fact that the median of a triangle bisects its area. From triangles DAB (with median DQ) and BCD (with median BP), we have [𝐴𝐷𝑄] = [𝐵𝐷𝑄]𝑎𝑛𝑑 [𝐵𝑃𝐶] = [𝐵𝑃𝐷] Adding, we have [𝐴𝐷𝑄] + [𝐵𝑃𝐶] = [𝐵𝐷𝑄] + [𝐵𝑃𝐷] = [𝐵𝑃𝐷𝑄] = [𝐵𝑃𝑄] + [𝐷𝑃𝑄] = [𝐴𝑃𝑄] + [𝐶𝑃𝑄] Since PQ is a median of both the triangles APB and CQD. Writing in terms of smaller areas, we have [AXQ] + [AXD] + [BYC] + [PYC] = [AXQ] + [PXQ] + [CPY] + [QPY]. On cancellation, this yields, [ADX] + [BCY] = [PXCY]. If ABCD is a concave quadrilateral and the points P, Q, X, Y are located as in the problem (see figure) then by a similar argument, we arrive at the relation | [ADX] – [BCY]|= [𝑃𝑋𝐶𝑌], where the left hand side denotes the modulus of the difference of areas. The proof is left to the reader. 124. From the relation 𝐵𝐼2 = 𝐵𝑋. 𝐵𝐴 we see that BI is a tangent to the circle passing through A, X, I at I. Hence ∠𝐵𝐼𝑋 = ∠𝐵𝐴𝐼 = 𝐴 2 … … . . (1) [Alternatively, one observes that in triangles BIX and BAI, ∠𝐼𝐵𝑋 is common and BI|BX= 𝐵𝐴|𝐵𝐼. Consequently the two triangles are similar, implying (1)]. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 81 Similarly, from the relation 𝐶𝐼2 = 𝐶𝑌. 𝐶𝐴. CA we obtain ∠𝐶𝐼𝑌 = ∠𝐶𝐴𝐼 = 𝐴 2 (2) It is known that ∠𝐵𝐼𝐶 = 90° + 𝐴 2 (3) From (1), (2), (3) and the fact that X, I, Y are collinear, we obtain 𝐴 2 + 𝐴 2 + (90° + 𝐴 2) = 180° Solving we get 𝐴 = 60°. 125. From the given relation, we have A1A2 . A1A3 + A1A2 . A1A4 = A1A3 . A1A4 (1) Also in the cyclic quadrilateral A1A3A4A5, we have, by Ptolemy’s theorem, 𝐴4𝐴5. 𝐴1𝐴3 + 𝐴3𝐴4. 𝐴1𝐴5 = 𝐴3𝐴5. 𝐴1𝐴4 (2) Since A1A2….An is a regular polygon, we have 𝐴1𝐴2 = 𝐴4𝐴5, 𝐴1𝐴2 = 𝐴3𝐴4, 𝐴1𝐴3 = 𝐴3𝐴5 Comparing (1) and (2), we have 𝐴1𝐴4 = 𝐴1𝐴5 Since that two diagonals A1A4 and A1A5 are equal, it follows that there must be the same number of vertices between A1 and A4 as between A1 and A5. That is the polygon must be 7−sided, that is 𝑛 = 7. Aliter: If O is the centre of the circle in which A1A2….An is inscribed and 𝜃 is the angle which each side of the polygon subtends at O then using the relation 1 𝐴1𝐴2 = 1 𝐴1𝐴3 + 1 𝐴1𝐴4 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 82 Obtain as equation in 𝜃. Solve the equation to get 𝜃 = 2𝜋 7 . This means 𝑛 = 7. 126. Let S1 touch the circle S at K, the rays AB and AC at M and L respectively. We have 𝑃𝐿 = 𝑃𝑀 = 𝑃𝐾 = 𝑟1 (as P is the centre of S1) and 𝑅 = 𝑂𝐾 = 𝑂𝑃 + 𝑟1. Where R is the circumradius of triangle ABC (Note that O, the midpoint of the hypotenuse BC is the circumcentre of triangle ABC). From the figure, it is clear that AMPL is a square with side r1. So 𝐵𝑀 = 𝐴𝐵 − 𝐴𝑀 = 𝑐 − 𝑟1; and 𝐿𝐶 = 𝐴𝐶 − 𝐴𝐿 = 𝑏 − 𝑟1 Therefore from triangle BMP and CLP, we have 𝑃𝐵2 = 𝑃𝑀2 + 𝑀𝐵2 = 𝑟1 2 + (𝑐 − 𝑟1)2 𝑃𝐶2 = 𝑃𝐿 2 + 𝐿𝐶2 = 𝑟1 2 + (𝑏 − 𝑟1)2 And Applying Appolonius theorea to DPBC, in which PO is a median we get 𝑃𝐵2 = 𝑃𝐶2 = 2(𝑃𝑂2 + 𝐶𝑂2) That is, 𝑟1 2 + (𝑐 − 𝑟1)2 + 𝑟1 2 + (𝑏 − 𝑟1) 2 = 2[(𝑅 − 𝑟1)2 + 𝑅2] Using the fact that 𝑅 = 𝑎 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎2 = 𝑏2 + 𝑐2, if we solve the above equation for r1, we obtain 𝑟1 = 𝑏 + 𝑐 − 𝑎. Similarly, working with S2 we obtain 𝑟2 = 𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑎. Hence 𝑟1𝑟2 = (𝑏 + 𝑐 − 𝑎)(𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑎) = (𝑏 + 𝑐) 2 − 𝑎2 = 𝑏2 + 𝑐2 + 2𝑏𝑐 − 𝑎2 = 2𝑏𝑐 = 4 ( 1 2 𝑏𝑐) = 4[𝐴𝐵𝐶] Aliter : Choose A as origin, AB and AC as the x−axis and y−axis respectively. Let B= (𝑏, 0)𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐶 = (0, 𝑐). Then the circumcenter of triangle ABC which is at the midpoint of BC is given by 𝑂 = (𝑏 2 , 𝑐 2). Any circle G which touches the positive x−axis and positive y−axis will have its center at (r, r) where r is the radius of the circle. Now the equation to the circumcircle S of the triangle ABC is (𝑥 − 𝑏 2) 2 + (𝑥 − 𝑐 2)2 = ( 𝑎 2) 2 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 83 The equation to G is (𝑥 − 𝑟)2 + (𝑦 − 𝑟) 2 = 𝑟2. If the two circles S and G touch each other either internally (giving 𝐺 = 𝑆2), then we have (𝑟 ± 𝑎 2) 2 = (𝑟 − 𝑏 2) 2 + (𝑟 − 𝑐 2) 2 Giving 𝑟 = 𝑏 + 𝑐 ± 𝑎. Here b + c – a is the radius of the circle 𝑆1, namely, r1 and b + c + a is that of S2, namely r2. Hence 𝑟1𝑟2 = (𝑏 + 𝑐 − 𝑎)(𝑏 + 𝑐 + 𝑎) = 4 (area ABC), as before. 127. We have (see figure) PQ. QR > BQ. QC, QR. RS> CR. RD, etc. Therefore, (𝑃𝑄 + 𝑄𝑅 + 𝑅𝑆 + 𝑆𝑃) 2 = 𝑃𝑄2 + ⋯ + 2𝑃𝑄. 𝑄𝑅 + ⋯ > (𝑃𝐵2 + 𝐵𝑄2) + ⋯ + 2𝐵𝑄. 𝑄𝐶 + ⋯ = (𝑃𝐴 + 𝑃𝐵) 2 + (𝐵𝑄 + 𝑄𝐶) 2 + (𝐶𝑅 + 𝑅𝐷) 2 + (𝐷𝑆 + 𝑆𝐴) 2 = 𝐴𝐵2 + 𝐵𝐶2 + 𝐶𝐷2 + 𝐷𝐴 2 = 𝐴𝐶2 + 𝐵𝐷2 = 2𝐴𝐶2 Hence PQ +QR + RS + SP > √2 AC. 128. Draw a line 𝑙 parallel to BC through A and reflect AC in this line to get AD. Let CD intersect 𝑙 in P. Join BD. Observe that 𝐶𝑃 = 𝑃𝐷 = 𝐴𝑄 = ℎ𝑎, 𝐴𝑄 being the altitude through A. We have 𝑏 + 𝑐 = 𝐴𝐶 + 𝐴𝐵 = 𝐴𝐷 + 𝐴𝐵 ≥ 𝐵𝐷 = √𝐶𝐷2 + 𝐶𝐵2 = √4ℎ𝑎 2 + 𝑎2. Which yields the result. Equality occurs if and only if B, A, D are collinear, i.e., if and only if 𝐴𝐷 = 𝐴𝐵 (as AP is parallel to BC and bisects DC) and this is equivalent to 𝐴𝐶 = 𝐵𝐶. Alternatively, the given inequality is equivalent to (𝑏 + 𝑐) 2 − 𝑎2 ≥ 4ℎ𝑎 2 = 16∆2 𝑎2 Where ∆ is the area of the triangle ABC. Using the identity 16∆2= [(𝑏 + 𝑐)2 − 𝑎2][𝑎2 − (𝑏 − 𝑐)2] We see that the inequality to be proved is 𝑎2 − (𝑏 − 𝑐) 2 ≤ 𝑎2 (here we use a < b + c) which is true. Observe that equality holds if and only if 𝑏 = 𝑐. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 84 129. More generally, let [𝐵𝑃𝐹] = 𝑢, [𝐵𝐹𝐶] = 𝑣 𝑎𝑛𝑑 [𝐶𝑃𝐸] = 𝑤. 𝐽𝑜𝑖𝑛 𝐴𝑃. 𝐿𝑒𝑡 [𝐴𝐹𝑃] = 𝑥 𝑎𝑛𝑑 [𝐴𝐸𝑃] = 𝑦. Using the triangles AFC and BFC, we get 𝑥 𝑦 + 𝑤 = 𝐹𝑃 𝑃𝐶 = 𝑢 𝑣 This gives the equation 𝑣𝑥 − 𝑢𝑦 = 𝑢𝑤 Again using the triangles AEB and CEB we get another equation 𝑤𝑥 − 𝑣𝑦 = −𝑢𝑤 Solving these equations, we obtain 𝑥 = 𝑢𝑤(𝑢 + 𝑣) 𝑣2 − 𝑢𝑤 , 𝑦 = 𝑢𝑤(𝑤 + 𝑣) 𝑣2 − 𝑢𝑤 Hence we obtain 𝑥 + 𝑦 = 𝑢𝑤(𝑢 + 2𝑣 + 𝑤) 𝑣2 − 𝑢𝑤 Putting the values 𝑢 = 4, 𝑣 = 8, 𝑤 = 1, 𝑤𝑒 𝑔𝑒𝑡 [𝐴𝐹𝑃𝐸] = 143. 130. Let 𝐴𝐵 = 𝑎, 𝐵𝐶 = 𝑏, 𝐶𝐷 = 𝑐, 𝐷𝐴 = 𝑑. We are given that 𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑 ≥ 4. Using Ptolemy’s theorem and the fact that each diagonal cannot exceed the diameter of the circle we get 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑 = 𝐴𝐶. 𝐵𝐷 ≤ 4. But on application of AM−GM inequality gives 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑 ≥ 2√𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑 ≥ 2√4 = 4 We conclude that 𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑 = 4. This forces 𝐴𝐶. 𝐵𝐷 = 4 𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝐴𝐶 = 𝐵𝐷 = 2. Each of AC and BD is thus a diameter. This implies that ABCD is a rectangle. Note that (𝑎𝑐 − 𝑏𝑑) 2 = (𝑎𝑐 + 𝑏𝑑) 2 − 4𝑎𝑏𝑐𝑑 ≤ 16 − 16 = 0 And hence 𝑎𝑐 = 𝑏𝑑 = 2. Thus we get 𝑎 = 𝑐 = √𝑎𝑐 = √2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑚𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑙𝑦 𝑏 = 𝑑 = √2. It now follows that ABCD is a square. 131. Let 𝐴1 = {(𝑎, 𝑏)|𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ {1, 2, 3, … , 10}, |𝑎 − 𝑏| = {𝑖}, 𝑖 = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 𝐴0 = {(𝑖, 𝑖)|𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, … , 10}𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴0| = 10 𝐴1 = {(𝑖, 𝑖 + 1)|𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, … , 9} ∪ {(𝑖, 𝑖 − 1)|𝑖 = 2, 3, … , 10} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴1| = 9 + 9 = 18 𝐴2 = {(𝑖, 𝑖 + 2)|𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, … , 8} ∪ {(𝑖, 𝑖 − 2)|𝑖 = 3, 4, … , 10}𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴2| = 8 + 8 = 16 𝐴3 = {(𝑖, 𝑖 + 3)|𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 7} ∪ {(𝑖, 𝑖 − 3)|𝑖 = 4, 5, … , 10} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴3| = 7 + 7 = 14 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 85 𝐴4 = {(𝑖, 𝑖 + 4)|𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 6} ∪ {(𝑖, 𝑖 − 4)|𝑖 = 5, 6, … , 10} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴4| = 6 + 6 = 12 𝐴5 = {(𝑖, 𝑖 + 5)|𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 5} ∪ {(𝑖, 𝑖 − 5)|𝑖 = 6, 7, … , 10}𝑎𝑛𝑑 |𝐴5| = 5 + 5 = 10 ∴ 𝑇ℎ𝑒 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑑 𝑠𝑒𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑠 (𝑎, 𝑏) = ⋃ 𝐴𝑖 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 𝑜𝑓 𝑠𝑢𝑐ℎ 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑠, (𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑐ℎ 𝑎𝑟𝑒 𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛𝑡) = 5 𝑖=0 |⋃ 𝐴𝑖 5 𝑖=0 | = ∑ |𝐴𝑖| = 10 + 18 + 16 + 14 + 5 𝑖=0 12 + 10 = 80 132. From (i) 5, 8 ∈ 𝑆 … … . (1) From (ii), 7, 8 ∈ 𝑆 … … . (2) From (ii), 8, 13 ∈ 𝑆 … … . (3) Therefore from eqns. (1), (2) and (3), we find that 5, 7, 8, 13 ∈ 𝑆 … … (4) 𝑆 ⊂ {5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13} (𝐺𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑛) If at all S contains any other element other those given in (4), it may be 9 or 11 or both. But 9 ∉ 𝑆 [ ∵ 9 ∉ 𝑆 ∪ {4, 5, 11, 13} = {4, 5, 7, 8, 11, 13}] Again 11 ∉ 𝑆, 𝑓𝑜𝑟 11 ∉ 𝑆 ∩ {3, 5, 8, 11} = {5, 8} ∴ 𝑆 = {5, 7, 8, 13} If condition (i) is not given, then S is not unique as S may be {7, 8, 13} or {5, 7, 8, 13} or {5, 7, 8, 11, 13}. Similarly, deleting any other data leads to more than one solution to S (verify). 133. Let n(S) be 100. ∴ 𝑛(𝑆) ≥ 𝑛(𝐸 ∪ 𝐻) = 𝑛(𝐸) + 𝑛(𝐻) − 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻) ⇒ 100 ≥ 70 + 75 − 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻) ⇒ 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻) ≥ 45 Similarly 100 ≥ 𝑛(𝐿 ∪ 𝐴) = 𝑛(𝐿) + 𝑛(𝐴) − 𝑛(𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) = 80 + 85 − 𝑛(𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) 𝑜𝑟, 𝑛(𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) ≥ 65 Now, 𝑛(𝑆) = 100 ≥ 𝑛[(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻) ∪ (𝐿 ∩ 𝐴)] = 𝑛[(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻) + 𝑛(𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) − 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐿 ∩ 𝐴)] 𝑂𝑟, 100 ≥ 45 + 65 − 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) 𝑂𝑟, 𝑛(𝐸 ∩ 𝐻 ∩ 𝐿 ∩ 𝐴) ≥ 110 − 100 = 10 That is at least 10 percent of the people must have lost all the four. 134. Every (positive) integer is a multiple of 1. So, we will first see a set consisting of a1 and other elements: There are 11 elements other than a1. So the set with a1 and another element, with one other element, 2 other elements, …, and all the 11 other elements, that is, we have to choose a1 and 0, 1, 2, …, 11 other elements a2, a3, …, a11. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 86 This could be done in 11𝐶0 + 11𝐶1 + 11𝐶2 + ⋯ 11𝐶11 = 2 11 ways. If a set contains a2 as the element with the least subscript, then besides a2 the set can have a4, a6, a8, a10, a12, or 5 other elements, none or one or more of them. This could be done in 𝑛𝐶0 + 𝑛𝐶1 + 𝑛𝐶2 + 𝑛𝐶3 + 𝑛𝐶4 + 𝑛𝐶5 = 25 𝑤𝑎𝑦𝑠 Similarly for having a3 as the element with the least subscript 3, we have 𝑎6, 𝑎9, 𝑎12 to be the elements such that the subscripts (6, 9, 12) are divisible by 3. So, the number of subsets with a3 as one element is 3𝐶0 + 3𝐶1 + 3𝐶2 + 3𝐶3 = 23 For a4, one of the elements, the number of subsets (other elements being a8 and a12, is 22. For a5 it is 21 (there is just an element a10 such that 10 is a multiple of 5). For a6, it is again 21. (as 6/12) For a7, a8, a9, a10, a11 and a12, there is just one subset, namely, the set with these elements. This is total up to 6. So, the total number of acceptable set according to the conditions is 2 11 + 25 + 23 + 22 + 2 1 + 2 1 + 6 = 2048 + 32 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 6 = 2102. If there are n elements in the set a1, a2, a3, …, an then there are n multiples of 1. [𝑛 2] 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 2 [𝑛 3] 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 3 ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ ⋯ [𝑛 𝑛] 𝑚𝑢𝑙𝑡𝑖𝑝𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑜𝑓 𝑛 So that the total number of such sets is given by 2𝑛−1 + 2[𝑛 2] −1 + 2[ 𝑛 3] −1 + ⋯ + 2[ 𝑛 𝑛] −1 135. Let us number the cards, for the moment. Let us accept the case where all the cards go to one of the two players, also. With just two cards, we have possibilities, AA. AB. BA. BB. ……..(1) Here, AA means A gets card 1 and also card 2, AB means A gets card 1 and B gets card 2, BA means B gets card 1 and A gets card 2, BB means B gets card 1 and also card 2, Thus, for two cards we have 4 possibilities. For three card AAA, ABA, BAA, BBA, AAB, ABB, BAB, BBB ……..(2) i.e., for three cards there are 23 = 8 possibilities. Here, if the third card goes to A, then, in (1) annex A at the end, thus getting AAA, ABA, BAA, BBA If it goes to B then in (1) annex B at the end, which gives AAB, ABB, BAB, BBB. Thus, the possibilities doubled, when a new card (third card) is included. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 87 In fact, just with one card it may either go to A or B, giving AB. By annexing the second card, it may give AA BA giving (1) AA BB Thus, every new card doubles the existing number of possibilities of distributing the cards. Hence, the number of possibilities with n cards is 2n but this includes the 2 distributions where one of them gets all the cards, and the other none. So, total number of possibilities is 2𝑛 − 2 = 2(2𝑛−1 − 1). Note: We can look at the same problem in the following way. The above distribution of cards is the same as number of possible n digit numbers where only 2 digits 1 and 2 are used, and each digit must be used at least once. This is 2𝑛 − 2 = 2(2𝑛−1 − 1). Aliter: Since n cards are dealt with and each player must get at least one card, player 1 can get r cards and player 2 get (n−r) cards where 1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛 − 1. Now player 1 can get r cards in C (n, r) ways. Total number of ways of dealing cards to players 1 and 2 = ∑ 𝐶(𝑛, 𝑟) = ∑ 𝐶(𝑛, 𝑟) − 𝐶(𝑛, 0) 𝑛 𝑟=0 𝑛−1 𝑟=1 − 𝐶(𝑛, 𝑛) = 2𝑛 − 2 136. (a) S consists of single digit numbers, two digit numbers, three digit numbers and four digit numbers. No. of single digit numbers = 4 No. of two digit numbers 4 × 3 = 12 (Since repetition is not allowed, there are four choices for ten’s place and three choices for unit’s place). No. of three digit numbers = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24 No. of four digit numbers = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24 ∴ 𝑛(𝑆) = 4 + 12 + 24 + 24 = 64 Now, for the sum of these 64 numbers, sum of all the single digit numbers is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. (Since there are exactly 4 digits 1, 2, 3, 4 and their numbers are 1, 2, 3, and 4). Now, to find the sum of all the two digit numbers: No. of two digit numbers is 12. The digits used in unit’s place are 1, 2, 3 and 4. In the 12 numbers, each of 1, 2, 3 and 4 occurs thrice in unit digit ( 12 4 = 3) Again in ten’s place, each of these digits occur thrice also. So, the sum of these 12 numbers = 30 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 3 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 300 + 30 = 330. No. of three digits numbers is 24. So, the number of times each of 1, 2, 3, 4 occurs in each of unit’s, ten’s and hundred’s place is 24 4 = 6 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 88 So, sum of all these three digit numbers is 100 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 10 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 1 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 6,000 + 600 + 60 = 6660 Similarly for the four digit numbers, the sum is computed as 1000 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 100 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 10 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 1 × 6(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 60,000 + 6,000 + 600 + 60 = 66,660 [Since there are 24 four digit numbers, each of 1, 2, 3, 4 occurs in each of the four digits in 24 4 = 6 times]. So, the sum of all the single digit, two digit, three digit and four digit numbers = 10 + 330 + 6660 + 66660 = 73,660. (b)(i) There are just four single digit numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4. (ii) There are 4 × 4 = 16 two digit numbers, as digits can be repeated. (iii) There are 4 × 4 × 4 = 64 three digit numbers. (iv) There are 4 × 4 × 4 × 4 = 256 four digit numbers. So, total number of numbers up to 4 digit numbers that could be formed using the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4 is 4 + 16 + 64 + 256 = 340. Sum of the 4 single digit numbers = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10. To find the sum of 16, two digit numbers each of 1, 2, 3, 4 occur in each of unit’s and ten’s place = 16 4 = 4 times. So, the sum of all these 16 numbers is = 10 × 4(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 4(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 400 + 40 = 440 Similarly, the sum of all the 64 three digits numbers = 100 × 64 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 10 × 64 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 1 × 64 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 16,000 + 1,600 + 160 = 17,760 Again the sum of all the 256 four digit numbers = 1000 × 256 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 100 × 256 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 10 × 256 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) + 1 × 256 4 × (1 + 2 + 3 + 4) = 6,40,000 + 64,000 + 6,400 + 640 = 7,11,040 Therefore, sum of all the numbers is = 10 + 440 + 17,760 + 7,11,040 = 7,29,250 137. We consider numbers like 222222 or 233200 but not 212222, since the digit 1 occurs only once. The set of all such 6 digit can be divided into following classes. 𝑆1 = the set of all 6 digit numbers where a single digit is repeated 6 times. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 89 𝑛(𝑆1) = 9, since ‘0’ cannot be a significant number when all its digits are zero. Let S2 be set of all six digit numbers, made up of three distinct digits. Here we should have two cases S2 (a) one with exclusion of zero as a digit and other S2 (b) with the inclusion of zero as a digit. S2 (a) The number of ways, three digits could be chosen from 1, 2, …, 9 is 9𝐶3. Each of these three digits occur twice. So, the number of six digit numbers in this case is = 9𝐶3 × 6! 2! × 2! × 2! = 9 × 8 × 7 1 × 2 × 3 × 720 8 = 9 × 8 × 7 × 15 = 7560 S2 case (b) The three digit used include one zero, implying, we have to choose the other two digits from the 9 non−zero digits. This could be done in 9𝐶2 = 9 × 8 1.2 = 36 Since zero cannot be in the leading digit, so let us fix one of the fixed non−zero number in the extreme left. Then the other five digits are made up of 2 zeroes, 2 fixed non zero number and the another non zero number, one of which is put in the extreme left. In this case the number of six digit numbers that could be formed is 5! 2! × 2! × 2! × 2 (since from either of the pairs of fixed non zero numbers, one can occupy the extreme digit) = 60. So, the total number in this case = 36 × 60 = 2160. ∴ 𝑛(𝑆2) = 𝑛(𝑆2𝑎) + 𝑛(𝑆2𝑏) = 7560 + 2160 = 9720 Now, let S3 be the set of six digit numbers whose digits are made up of two distinct digits each of which occurs thrice. Here again, there are two cases : S3(a) excluding the digit zero and S3 (b) including the digit zero. S3(a) is the set of six digit numbers, each of whose digits are made up of two non zero digits each occurring thrice. ∴ 𝑛[𝑆3(𝑎)] = 9𝐶2 × 6! 3! × 3! = 36 × 20 = 720 S3 (b) consists of 6 digit numbers whose digits are made up of three zeroes and one of the non zero digit, occurring thrice. If you fix one of the nine non zero digit, use that digit in the extreme left. This digit should be used thrice. So in the remaining 5 digits, this fixed non zero digit is used twice and the digit zero occurs thrice. So, the number of 6 digit numbers formed in this case is 9 × 5! 3! × 2! = 90. ∴ 𝑛(𝑆3) = 𝑛𝑆3(𝑎) + 𝑛𝑆3(𝑏) = 720 + 90 = 810. Now, let us take S4, the case where the six digit number consists of exactly two digits, one of which occurs twice and the other four times. Here again, there are two cases: S4 (a) excluding zero and S4(b) including zero. If a and b are two non zero numbers a used twice and b four times, then we get Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 90 6! 2! × 4! And when a used four times, b twice, we again get 6! 4! × 2! So, when 2 of the nine non zero digit are used to form the six digit number in this case, the total numbers got is 9𝐶2 × 2 × 6! 4! × 2! = 36 × 5 × 6 = 1080 Thus 𝑛[𝑆4(𝑎)] = 1080 For counting the numbers is S4(b): In this case we may use 4 zeroes and a non zero number twice or 2 zeroes and a non zero number four times. In the former case, assuming the one of the fixed non zero digit occupying the extreme left, we get the other five digits consisting of 4 zeroes and one non zero number. This result in 9 × 5! 4!×1! = 45 six digit numbers. When we use the fixed non zero digit 4 times and use zero twice, then we get 9 × 5! 3!×2! = 90 six digit numbers, as the fixed number occupies the extreme left and for the remaining three times it occupies 3 of the remaining digits, other digits being occupied by the two zeroes. 𝑆𝑜, 𝑛(𝑆4) = 𝑛[𝑆4(𝑎)] + 𝑛[𝑆4(𝑏)] = 1080 + 45 + 90 = 1215 Hence, the total number of six digit numbers satisfying the given condition = 𝑛(𝑆1) + 𝑛(𝑆2) + 𝑛(𝑆3) + 𝑛(𝑆4) = 9 + 720 + 810 + 1215 = 2754. 138. From the hypothesis 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛 − 𝑟 + 1, we get 2𝑟 ≤ 𝑛 + 1. Each such r combination can be represented by a binary sequence b1 b2 b3 …. 𝑏𝑛 where 𝑏𝑖 = 1, if i is a member of the r combination and 0, otherwise with no consecutive 𝑏′𝑖𝑠 = 1 (the above r combinations contain no consecutive integers). The number of Is in the sequence is r. Now, this amounts to counting such binary sequences. Now, look at the arrangement of the following boxes; and the balls in them. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 OO OOO OO OOOO O O OOO Here, the balls stand for the binary digits zero, and the boundaries on the left and right of each box can be taken as the binary digit one. In this display of boxes and balls as interpreted gives previously how we want the binary numbers. Here, there are 7 boxes, and 6 left/right boundary for the boxes. So this is an illustration of 6 combination of non−consecutive numbers. The reason for zeroes in the front and at the end is that we can have leading zeroes and trailing zeroes in the binary sequence 𝑏1, 𝑏2, … , 𝑏𝑛. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 91 Now, clearly finding the r combination amounts to distribution of (n – r) balls into (r + 1) distinct boxes [(𝑛 − 𝑟)𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑙𝑠 = (𝑛 − 𝑟)𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜𝑒𝑠as these are r ones, in the n number sequence] such that the 2nd, 3rd … rth boxes are non empty. (The first and last boxes may or may not be empty – in the illustration of 1st and 7th may have zeroes or may not have balls as we have already had 6 combinations). Put (r−1) balls one in each of 2nd, 3rd, …, rth boxes (so that no two 1’s occur consecutively). Now we have (n – r) – (r – 1) balls to be distributed in (r + 1) distinct boxes. 139. T can be written as 𝑇 = 𝑇1 ∪ 𝑇2, 𝑇1 = {(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)|𝑥, 𝑧 ∈ 𝑆, 𝑥 < 𝑦} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑇2 = {(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧)! 𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑧 ∈ 𝑆, 𝑥 + 𝑦 < 𝑧}. The number of elements in T1 is the same as choosing two elements from the set S, where 𝑛(𝑆) = (𝑛 + 1), 𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝑛(𝑇1) = ( 𝑛+1 2 ). (as every subset of two elements, the larger element will be z and the smaller will be x and y). In T2, we have 2( 𝑛+1 3 ) elements, after choosing 3 elements from the set S, two of the smaller elements will be x and y and they may be either taken as (x, y, z) or as (y, x, z) or in other words, every three element subset of S, say (s, b, c), the greatest is z, and the other two can be placed in two different ways in the first two positions, ∴ 𝑛(𝑇)(𝑜𝑟 |𝑇|) = (𝑛 + 1 2 ) + 2 (𝑛 + 1 3 ) T can also be considered as ⋃ 𝑆𝑖 = {(𝑥, 𝑦, 𝑖)|𝑥, 𝑦 < 𝑖, 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝑆} 𝑛+1 𝑖=2 All these sets are pair wise disjoint as for different i, we get different ordered triplets (x, y, i). Now in S1, the first two components of (x, y, i), namely (x, y), can be any element from the set 1, 2, 3, …, i – 1. x and y can be any member from 1, 2, 3, …, (i−1), equal or distinct. ∴ The number of ways of selecting (x, y), x, y ∈ {1, 2, 3, … , (𝑖 − 1)}𝑖𝑠 (𝑖 − 1) 2. Thus, n(Si) for each i is (𝑖 − 1)2, 𝑖 ≥ 2. For example, 𝑛(𝑆2) = 1, 𝑛(𝑆3) = 22 = 4 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑜 𝑜𝑛 𝑁𝑜𝑤, 𝑛(𝑇) = 𝑛 (⋃ 𝑆𝑖 𝑛+1 𝑖=2 ) = ∑ 𝑛(𝑆𝑖) 𝑛+1 𝑖=2 (because all 𝑆′𝑖𝑠 are pair wise disjoint) = ∑(𝑖 − 1) 2 = ∑ 𝑖2 𝑛 𝑖=1 𝑛+1 𝑖=2 And hence, ( 𝑛 + 1 2 ) + 2 ( 𝑛 + 1 3 ) = ∑ 𝑘2 𝑛 𝑘=1 140. For each positive integer k, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 5, 𝑙𝑒𝑡 𝑁𝑘 denote the number of permutations (p1, p2, …, p6) such that 𝑝1 ≠ 1, (𝑝1, 𝑝2) is not a permutation of (1, 2), … (𝑝1, 𝑝2, … , 𝑝𝑘) is not a permutation of (1, 2, …, k). We are required to find N5. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 92 We shall start with N1. The total number of permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is 6! And the permutations of (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) is 5! Thus, the number of permutations in which 𝑝 = 1is 5!. So, the permutation in which 𝑝 ≠ 1 𝑖𝑠 6! − 5! = 720 − 120 = 600. Now, we have to remove all the permutations with (1, 2)and (2, 1) as the first two elements to get N2. Of these, we have already taken into account (1, 2) in considering N1 and subtracted all the permutations starting with 1. So we should consider the permutation beginning with (2, 1). When 𝑝1 = 2, 𝑝2 = 1 (p3, p4, p5 and p6) can be permuted in 4! ways. So, 𝑁2 = 𝑁1 − 4! = 600 − 24 = 576. Having removed the permutations beginning with (1, 2), we should now remove those beginning with (1, 2, 3). But, corresponding to the first two places (1, 2) and (2, 1), we have removed all the permutations. So, we should now remove the permutations with first three places (3, 2, 1), (3, 1, 2), (2, 3, 1). Note that the first 3 positions being 1 2 3 is included in the permutations beginning with 1. For each of these three arrangements, there are 3! Ways of arranging 4th, 5th and 6th places and hence, 𝑁3 = 𝑁2 − 3 × 3! = 576 − 18 = 558 To get N4, we should remove all the permutations beginning with the permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4) of which the arrangement of (1, 2, 3) in the first three places have already been removed. We have to account for the rest. So, when 4 is in the first place, 3! Arrangements of 1, 2, 3 in the 2nd, 3rd and 4th places are possible. Also, when 4 is in the second place, since we have removed the permutations when 1 occupies the first place, there are two choices for the first place with 2 or 3 and for each of these there are 2 arrangements, i.e., (2, 4, 1, 3), (2, 4, 3, 1), (3, 4, 2, 1), (3, 4, 1, 2). When 4 is in the third place, then there are first 3 arrangements (2, 3, 4, 1), (3, 2, 4, 1) and (3, 1, 4, 2). So, the total permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4) to be removed from S3 to get S4 is (6 + 4 + 3) × 2 = 26, because there are 2 ways of arranging the 5th and 6th places for each one of the above permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4). ∴ 𝑆4 = 𝑆3 − 26 = 558 − 26 = 532 To get N5; we should remove from S4 al the permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) which have not been removed until now. When 5 occupies the first position, there are 4! = 24 ways of getting 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th places which have not been removed so far. When 𝑝2 = 5, 𝑝1 cannot be 1, so p1 can be chosen from the other 3, viz., 2, 3 and 4, in 3 ways and 3rd, 4th and 5th places can be filled for each of the first place choice in 3 × 2 × 1 = 6 ways. So, when 𝑝2 = 5, there are 18 different arrangements to be removed. When 𝑝3 = 5, the first 2 places cannot be (1, 2) so that they can be filled in (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1), (4, 2), (4, 3) and for the fourth and fifth places there are exactly two choices for each of the above arrangements for the first and second place. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 93 So when 𝑝3 = 5, the number of arrangements to be removed is 8 × 2 = 16. When 𝑝4 = 5, 𝑝1𝑝2𝑝3 can be removed (241, 412, 421, 234, 243, 342, 324, 423, 432, 314, 341, 413, 431) and since there is only one choice left, we now to remove 13 arrangements when 𝑝4 = 5 When 𝑝5 = 5, we have already removed the permutations of (1, 2, 3, 4) of the first four places to find S4 So now 𝑆5 = 𝑆4 − (24 + 18 + 16 + 13) = 534 − 71 = 463. So, 463 is the desired number of permutations. 141. The given set 𝑆 = {1, 2, 3, 4, … , 299, 300} can be realized as the union of the three disjoint sets s1, s2 and s3 with 𝑠1 = {𝑥 ∈ 𝑆|𝑥 = 3𝑛 + 1, 99 ≥ 𝑛 ≥ 0}, 𝑠2 = {𝑥 ∈ 𝑆 |𝑥 = 3𝑛 + 2, 99 ≥ 𝑛 ≥ 0} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠3 = {𝑥 ∈ 𝑆 |𝑥 = 3𝑛, 100 ≥ 𝑛 ≥ 1} Now, to get the set of all three element subsets of S, with the sum of the elements of the subset a multiple of 3, we should choose all three elements from the same set s1, s2 or s3 or we should choose one element from each of the set s1, s2 and s3. We see that 𝑛(𝑠1) = 𝑛(𝑠2) = 𝑛(𝑠3) = 100. Choosing all the three elements from either s1, s2 or s3 will give 3 × 100𝐶3 triplets and its sum is also divisible by 3. Choosing the three elements, one each from s1, s2 and s3 will give 100𝐶1 × 100𝐶1 × 100𝐶1 triplets and its sum is also divisible by 3. So, the total number of 3 element subsets with the required property is 3 × 100𝐶3 + 100𝐶1 × 100𝐶1 × 100𝐶1 = 3 × 100 × 99 × 98 1 × 2 × 3 + 1003 = 100 × 99 × 49 + 1000000 = 485100 + 1000000 = 1485100 142. ABC is an equilateral triangle of side 1 cm. If the sides are divided into equal parts, we get 4 equilateral triangles with side ½ cm. Again, if each of these four triangles is subjected to the above method, we get 4 × 4 triangles of side 1 2 × 1 2 = 1 22 𝑐𝑚 Thus, after n steps we get, 4n triangles of side 1 2𝑛 𝑐𝑚. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 94 Now, if we take 4𝑛 + 1 points inside the original equilateral ∆𝐴𝐵𝐶, then at least two of the points lie on the same triangle out of 4n triangles by Pigeon Hole Principle. Hence, the distance between them is less than or at the most equal to the length of the side of the triangle, in which they lie, that is, they are 1 2𝑛 𝑐𝑚 apart or they are less than 1 2𝑛 𝑐𝑚 apart. 143. There are (100−1) 3 + 1 = 34 elements in the progression 1, 4, 7, …, 100. Consider the following pairs: (4, 100), (7, 97), (10, 94), …, (49, 55). There are in all 49 − 4 3 + 1 = 16 𝑝𝑎𝑖𝑟𝑠 (𝑜𝑟 100 − 55 3 + 1) Now, we shall show that we can choose eighteen distinct numbers from the A.P. such that no two of them add up to 104. In the above 16 pairings of the A.P. the numbers 1 and 52 are left out. Now, taking one of the numbers from each of the pairs, we can have 16 numbers and including 1 and 52 with these 16 numbers, we now have 18 numbers. (Note. We can have 216 such sets of numbers, and any two of these sets will have the common elements 1 and 52). But, no pair of numbers from these 18 numbers can sum up to 104, since just one numbers is selected from each pair, and the other number of the pair (not selected) is 104 – the number chosen. Also 1 + 52 ≠ 54. Thus, we can choose 18 numbers, so that no two of them sum up to 104. For getting 19 numbers (all these should be distinct), we should choose one of the 16 not chosen numbers, but then this number chosen is the 104 complement of one of the 16 numbers chosen already (among the 18 numbers). Thus, if a set of 19 distinct elements are chosen, then we have at least one pair whose sum is 104. 144. Since 𝑛(𝑋) = 10, the number of non empty, proper subsets of X is 2 10 − 2 = 1022. The sum of the elements of the proper subsets of X can possibly range from 1 𝑡𝑜 ∑(90 + 𝑖) 9 𝑖=1 . That is 1 to (91 + 92 + … + 99), i.e., 1 to 855. That is, the 1022 subsets can have sums from 1 to 855. By Pigeon−hole Principle, at least two distinct subsets B and C will have the same sum. (Since there are 855 different sums, and so if we have more than 855 subsets, then at least two of them have the same sum). Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 95 If B and C are not disjoint, then let 𝑋 = 𝐵 − (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑌 = 𝐶 − (𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) Clearly, X and Y are disjoint and non empty and have the same sum of their elements Define s(A) = sum of the elements of A. We have B and C not necessarily disjoint such that s(B)= s(C). Now, 𝑠(𝑋) = 𝑠(𝐵) − 𝑠(𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) 𝑠(𝑌) = 𝑠(𝐶) − 𝑠(𝐵 ∩ 𝐶) But 𝑠(𝐵) = 𝑠(𝐶). 𝐻𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒, 𝑠(𝑋) = 𝑠(𝑌). Also 𝑋 ≠ 𝜙. For if X is empty, then 𝐵 ⊂ 𝐶 which implies s(B) < s(C) (a contradiction). Thus, X and Y are non empty and 𝑠(𝑋) = 𝑠(𝑌). 145. Consider three numbered boxes whose contents are denoted as x1, x2, x3 respectively. The problem now reduces to distributing 28 balls in the three boxes such that the first box has at least 3 and not more than 9 balls, the second box has at most 8 balls, and the third box has at least 7 and at most 17 balls. At first, put 3 balls in the first box, and 7 balls in the third box. This takes care of the minimum needs of the boxes. So, now the problem reduces to finding the number of distribution of 18 balls in 3 boxes such that the first has at most (9 – 3) = 6, the second at most 8 and the third at most (17 − 7) = 10. The number of ways of distributing 18 balls in 3 boxes with no condition is ( 18 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = (20 2 ) = 190. [The number of ways of distributing r identical objects in n distinct boxes is ( 𝑛 + 𝑟 − 1 𝑟 ) = ( 𝑛 + 𝑟 − 1 𝑛 − 1 ) where ‘n’ stands for the numbers of boxes and r for balls]. Let d1 be the distribution where the first box gets at least 7; d2, the distributions where the second box gets at least 9; and d3, the distribution where the third gets at least 11. |𝑑1| = ( 18 − 7 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = ( 13 2 ) = 13 × 2 1.2 = 78 |𝑑2| = (18 − 9 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = ( 11 2 ) = 11 × 10 1.2 = 55 |𝑑3| = ( 18 − 11 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = (9 2) = 9 × 8 1.2 = 36 ∴ |𝑑1 ∩ 𝑑2| = (18 − 7 − 9 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = ( 4 2) = 6 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 96 |𝑑2 ∩ 𝑑3| = ( 18 − 9 − 11 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = (0 2) = 0, |𝑑3 ∩ 𝑑1| = ( 18 − 11 − 7 + 3 − 1 3 − 1 ) = ( 2 2) = 1 Therefore, |𝑑1 ∩ 𝑑2 ∩ 𝑑3| = 0 And |𝑑1 ∪ 𝑑2 ∪ 𝑑3| = 78 + 55 + 36 − 6 − 0 − 1 + 0 = 162. So, the required number of solutions = 190 − 162 = 28. [Note that, the number of ways the first box gets utmost 6, the second utmost 8 and the third utmost 10 = Total number of ways of getting 18 balls distributed in 3 boxes – (the number of ways of getting at least 7 in the first box, at least 9 in the second box and at least 1 in the third box). And 𝑛(𝐴 ∪ 𝐵 ∪ 𝐶)′ = 𝑛(𝐴 ′ ∩ 𝐵′ ∩ 𝐶′). 146. Let the proposer of the problems be called X, and the friends be denoted as A, B, C, D, E, F. Since X dines with all the 6 friends exactly on one day, we have the combination XABCDEF (1) for one day 1. Thus, every five of A, B, C, D, E, F had already dined with X for a day. According to the problem, every five of them should dine on another day. It should happen in 6𝐶5 = 6 days. The combination is XABCDE (2), XABCDF (3), XABCEF (4), XABDEF (5), XACDEF (6), XBCDEF (7). In (1) and (2) together, X has already dined with every four friends three times, for example with ABCD, he dined on the first day the numbers above the combinations can be taken as the rank of the days X dines with his friends. 2nd and 3rd days, X dined with every three friends of them on four days, for example with ABC, 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th days, X has dined with every two friends, of them for five days for example with AB, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th days. With just one of them he has dined so far 6 days (with A, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th days). So, he has to dine with every one of them for one more day he should dine with XA, XB, XC, XD, XE and XF for 6 more days. Thus, the total number of days he dined so far with at least one of his friends is 1 + 6 + 6 = 13 days. In this counting, we see that he has dined with every one of them for 7 days. That shows that he has not dined with every one of them for 6 days. But it is given that every friend was absent for 7 days. Since each one of them has been absent for 6 days already, all of them have to be absent for one more day. Thus, he dined alone for 1 day and the total number of dinners he had is 13 + 1 = 14. 147. Now pair of the elements of S as [a, a + 2nd], [a + d, a + (2n – 1)d], …, [a + (n – 1)d, a + (n + 1)d] and one term a + nd is left out. Now, sum of the terms in each of the pairs is 2(a + nd). Thus, each term of the pair is 2(a + nd) complement of the other term. Now, there are n pairs. If we choose one term from each pair, we get n term. To this collection of terms include (a + nd) also. Now, we have (n + 1) numbers. Thus, set A can be taken as the set of the above (n + 1) numbers, here no two elements of the set A add up to 2(a + nd) as no element has its 2(a + Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 97 nd) complement in A except a + nd, but then we should take two distinct elements. If we add any more terms to A so that A contains more than (n + 1) elements, then some of the elements will now have then 2(a + nd) complement in A, so that sum of these two elements will be 2(a + nd), and hence, the result. In the second case, we have 𝑆 = {𝑎, 𝑎 + 𝑑, … , 𝑎 + (2𝑛 + 1)𝑑} There are 2(n + 1) elements. So, pairing them as before gives (n + 1) pairs i.e., [a, a+(2n+1)d], [a+d, a+2nd], …, [a+nd, a+(n+1)d] Now, we can pick exactly one term from each of these (n + 1) pairs. We get a set A of (n + 1) elements where no two of which add up to [2a + 2(n + 1)d]. Note here we need not use distinct numbers, even if the same number is added to itself, the sum will not be [2a + 2(n + 1)d]. Here again, even choosing one more term from the numbers left out, and adding it to A, A will have a pair which adds up to [2a + 2(n+1)d]. Thus, the maximum number of elements in A satisfying the given condition is (n + 1). 148. Let 𝑆 = {1, 2, 3, … , 63}. Let A be the set of all three elementic subsets of S such that (a + b + c) < 95, i.e., 𝐴 = {(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)|(𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) < 95, (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑆} Similarly, let B be the set of all three elements subsets of S such that (a + b + c) > 95, where (a, b, c) ∈ 𝑆}, 𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝐵 = {(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)|(𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) > 95, (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑆} 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐶 = {(𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐)|(𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) > 97, (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑆} Clearly, C is a proper subset of B because (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝑆, 𝑖𝑓 (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) = 96 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝐵 𝑎𝑛𝑑 (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∉ 𝐶. However, every element of C∈ B, As (a + b +c) > 97 𝑜𝑟, (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) > 95 also Hence, (a, b, c) ∈ 𝐶 ⇒ (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝐵 also. Now, it is enough if we show that 𝑛(𝐴) = 𝑛(𝐶) 𝑎𝑠 𝑛(𝐶) < 𝑛(𝐵)𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑛(𝐴) = 𝑛(𝐶) ⇒ 𝑛(𝐴) ⊂ 𝑛(𝐵). If (a, b, c) ∈ 𝐴, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 1 ≤ (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) < 95 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑙𝑠𝑜 1 ≤ (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ≤ 63. 𝑇ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑜𝑟𝑒, 1 ≤ (64 − 𝑎), (64 − 𝑏), (64 − 𝑐) ≤ 63 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎𝑠 (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) < 95, (64 − 𝑎) + (64 − 𝑏) + (64 − 𝑐) = 192 − (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) > 192 − 95 = 97. Thus to each element of A, there is a unique element in C. Conversely, if (a, b, c) ∈ 𝐶, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 (64 − 𝑎), (64 − 𝑏), (64 − 𝑐) ∈ 𝐴 𝑓𝑜𝑟 (64 − 𝑎) + (64 − 𝑏) + (64 − 𝑐) = 192 − (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐), 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑒 (𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐) ∈ 𝐶, (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) > 97 ∴ 192 − (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) < 192 − 97 = 95. And thus {(64 − 𝑎), (64 − 𝑏), (64 − 𝑐)} ∈ 𝐴, which shows that every element of C there corresponds a unique element in A. Thus, there Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 98 is a 1−1 correspondence between the sets A and C. ∴ 𝑛(𝐴) = 𝑛(𝐶) < 𝑛(𝐵). 149. Here we are using the property of tangent functions of trigonometry. Given a real number a, we can find a unique real number A, lying between – 𝜋 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜋 2 i.e., lying in the interval (− 𝜋 2 , 𝜋 2) Such that tan 𝐴 = 𝑎, as the tangent function in the open interval (− 𝜋 2 , 𝜋 2) is continuous and strictly increasing and covers R completely. Therefore, corresponding to the five given real numbers 𝑎𝑖(𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5), we can find five distinct real numbers 𝐴𝑖, (𝑖 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) lying between – 𝜋 2 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝜋 2 𝑠𝑢𝑐ℎ 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 tan 𝐴𝑖 = 𝑎𝑖. Divide the open interval (− 𝜋 2 , 𝜋 2) into four equal intervals, each of length 𝜋 4. Now, by Pigeon hole Principle at least two of the 𝐴𝑖𝑠 must lie in one of the four intervals. Suppose 𝐴𝑘 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝐴𝑙𝑤𝑖𝑡ℎ 𝐴𝑘 > 𝐴𝑙 lie in the same interval, then 0 < 𝐴𝑘 − 𝐴𝑙 < 𝜋 4 So tan 0 < tan (𝐴𝑘 − 𝐴𝑙) < tan 𝜋 2 [It is because tan function increases in the interval (− 𝜋 2 , 𝜋 2)] 𝑖. 𝑒. , 0 < tan 𝐴𝑘 − tan 𝐴𝑙 1 + tan 𝐴𝑘 tan 𝐴𝑙 < 1 0 < 𝑎𝑘 − 𝑎𝑙 1 + 𝑎𝑘𝑎𝑙 < 1 Hence there are two real numbers 𝑥 = 𝑎𝑘, 𝑦 = 𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑢𝑐ℎ 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑡 0 < 𝑥−𝑦 1+𝑥𝑦 . 150. Using 1 = 30, you can weigh 31−1 2 = 1 weight is clear. If 1, 3 are given weights, then using both sides of the balance, we can weigh 4 weights as follows. Wt. of the object Left pan Right pan 1 1 Object 3−1= 2 3 Object + 1 (if object’s weight is 3 − 1 = 2. 3 3 Object 3 + 1= 4 3, 1 Object Thus, we have the four weights 1, 2, 3, 4 = 32−1 2 weighed using only 2 weights, namely, 1 and 3 but using the weights on both pans. To prove the general case we’ll use the principle of Mathematical Induction. Let us assume that using the weights 1, 3, 32, …., 3𝑘, we can weigh from 1 to 3𝑘+1−1 2 units. Now, if we have one more weight, say, 3𝑘+1 at our disposal, then we need to prove that we Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 99 can weigh from 1 unit to 3𝑘+1−1 2 units. We can clearly weigh from 1 unit to 3𝑘+1−1 2 units by the first k + 1 weights, namely, 1, 3, 32, …, 3𝑘. We need to prove that additional we can weigh from 3𝑘+1−1 2 + 1 𝑡𝑜 3𝑘+2−1 2 units using the additional weight 3𝑘+1 along with others. Consider two cases: (i) Weighing from 3𝑘+1−1 2 + 1 𝑡𝑜 3𝑘+1 − 1. (i.e.) we want to weigh 3𝑘+1−1 2 + 𝑟 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 3𝑘+1−1 2 . Now for weighing this use the weigh 3𝑘+1 in one pan and the object and the weights representing 3𝑘+1 − 3𝑘+1 − 1 2 − 𝑟 = 3𝑘+1 − 1 2 − (𝑟 − 1) Note that 3𝑘+1−1 2 − (𝑟 − 1) can be represented using the weights 1, 3, 32, …., 3k by induction hypothesis: ∴ Using 1, 3, 32, …, 3𝑘, 3𝑘+1 we can weigh all weights up to 3𝑘+1−1 2 + 3𝑘+1−1 2 = 3𝑘+1 − 1. Now to weigh 3𝑘+1, we need to use only one weight, namely, 3𝑘+1. To weigh from 3𝑘+1 + 1 𝑡𝑜 3𝑘+2−1 2 , 𝑖. 𝑒. , 𝑡𝑜 𝑤𝑒𝑖𝑔ℎ 3𝑘+1 + 𝑟 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 1 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 3𝑘+1−1 2 𝑤𝑒 𝑛𝑒𝑒𝑑 𝑢𝑠𝑒 3𝑘+1 weight on one pan along with the representation for the weight r in terms of 1, 3, 32, …., 3k in the same pan and the object in the other pan. Thus, we can weigh up to 3𝑘+1−1 2 units starting from 1 unit using the weights 1, 3, 32, …, 3𝑘, 3𝑘+1. Note: In all the above weighings we use weights on both the pans, the pan where the object is placed as well as the other pan. This representation is nothing but the balanced ternary representation of rational numbers where the three digits in the balanced ternary representation are taken to be 0, 1, −1 instead of 0, 1, 2. Any number 𝑛 ∈ 𝑁 can be represented as 𝑛 = 𝑏0 + 𝑏13 + 𝑏232 + ⋯ + 𝑏𝑘3 𝑘 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑏0, 𝑏1, … , 𝑏𝑘 ∈ {0, 1, −1}. 151. Let us find the number of times they have to row front and back when there are 1, 2 and 3 couples. For just one couple, they just row and cross over to the far side thus, it is enough if they row once. So for 𝑛 = 1, no. of times they should row is 1. Observe the following diagrams. For 𝑛 = 2; Let us denote the couples as (𝑥1, 𝑦1), (𝑥2, 𝑦2), … , (𝑥𝑛, 𝑦𝑛). For 𝑛 = 2, we have two couples (𝑥1, 𝑦1), (𝑥2, 𝑦2). So, when there are two couples they will reach the far side of the river by rowing 5 times. When 𝑛 = 3, where the couples are (x1 y1), (x2 y2) and (x3 y3) we can infer that when there are n couples they have n0 row (4n – 3) times. For 𝑛 = 1, we say that they row first once which is 4 × 1 − 1 = 1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑓𝑜𝑟 𝑛 = 2, we also saw that they rowed 5 times which is 4 × 2 − 3 = 8 − 5 = 5 is true. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 100 Also again, for 𝑛 = 3, 𝑤𝑒 𝑔𝑒𝑡 4 × 3 − 3 = 12 − 3 = 9 times, to be true. So, let us see if we can use mathematical induction to see if the formula is true. Since we have already seen that he formula is true for 𝑛 = 1 (also 2, 3). We shall assume that it is true for 𝑛 = 𝑘. That is if there are 𝑛 = 𝑘 couples, they can cross over the river by rowing (4k – 3)times. Now, draw the diagram from this stage, when there are k + 1 couples. Thus assuming that they have to row (4k – 3) times when are k couples, we find that they have to row four more times, i.e., (4k + 1) times when there are (k + 1) couples. 4𝑘 + 1 = 4(𝑘 + 1) − 3 So, the truth of P(k) implies the truth of P(k + 1) and we have shown that this formula is true for 𝑛 = 1. Thus, the formula we informed is true for all 𝑛 ∈ 𝐷. So, when there are n couples they have to row (4n – 3) times to row across the river to reach the far side. 152. We will find the total number of contestants. Since for each pair of problems there were exactly two contestants, let us assume that an arbitrary problem p1 was solved by r contestants. Each of these r contestants solved 6 more problems, solving 6r more problems in all counting multiplicities. Since every problem, other than p1, was paired with p1 and was solved by exactly two contestants, each of the remaining 27 problems (i.e., other than p1) is counted twice among the problems solved by the r contestants, 𝑖. 𝑒. , 6𝑟 = 2 × 27 𝑜𝑟, 𝑟 = 9 Therefore, an arbitrary problem p1 is solved by 9 contestants. Hence, in all we have 9×28 7 = 36 contestants, as each contestant solves 7 problems. For the rest of the proof, let us assume the contrary, that is, every contestant solved either 1, 2 or 3 problems in Part I. Let us assume that there are n problems in part I and let x, y, z be the number of contestants solves either 1, 2 or 3 problems in Part I, we get 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 36 … … (1) 𝑥 + 2𝑦 + 3𝑧 = 9𝑛 … … . (2) (Since each problem was solved by 9 contestants.) Since every contestant among y solves a pair of problems in Part I and every contestant among z solves 3 pairs of problems in Part I and as each pair of problems was solved by exactly two contestants, we get following equations 𝑦 + 3𝑧 = 2 𝑛𝐶2 = 2 𝑛(𝑛 − 1) 2 = 𝑛(𝑛 − 1) … . (3) From eq. (1), eq. (2) and eq. (3) we get 𝑧 = 𝑛2 − 10𝑛 + 36 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑦 = −2𝑛2 + 29𝑛 − 108 = −2 (𝑛 − 29 4 ) 2 − 23 8 < 0 As y < 0 is not an acceptable result, our assumption is wrong. Here, there is at least one contestant who solved either no problem from Part I or solved at least 4 problems from Part I. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 101 153. Since it is given that 1 ∈ 𝐴, 2 ∉ 𝐴. 𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑓 2 ∈ 𝐴, then 20 + 2 = 3 is generated by 2 members of A violating the condition for the partitioning : ∴ 2 ∈ 𝐵 Similarly, 3 ∉ 𝐴 𝑎𝑠 1 + 3 = 4 = 2 1 + 2 ∴ 3 ∈ 𝐵. But 4 ∉ 𝐵. 𝐹𝑜𝑟 𝑖𝑓 4 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 22 + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6 is generated by two members of B. ∴ The partitioning for the first few positive integers is 𝐴 = {1, 4, 7, 8, 12, 13, 15, 16, 20, 23, … } 𝐵 = {2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 14, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, … } Suppose 1, 2, …, n−1 (for 𝑛 ≥ 3) have already been assigned to 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 in such a way that no distinct members of A or B have a sum = 2 1 + 2(𝑙 = 0, 1, 2, … ). Now, we need to assign n to A or B. Let k be a positive integer such that 2𝑘−1 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 < 2𝑘 + 2. Then assign ‘n’ to the complement of the set to which 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 belongs. But for this, we need to check that 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 has already been assigned. Now as 𝑛 ≥ 2𝑘−1 + 2 > 2𝑘−1 + 1 2𝑛 > 2𝑘 + 2 ∴ 𝑛 > 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛. Since all numbers below n have been assumed to be assigned to either A or B, 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 has already been assigned and hence n is also assigned uniquely. For example, consider 𝑘 = 1 3 = 20 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 < 2 1 + 2 = 4 Consider 𝑛 = 3, 4 − 𝑛 = 1. Now 1 ∈ 𝐴 (given) ∴ 3 ∈ 𝐵. Consider 𝑘 = 2 ∴ 22−1 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 < 22 + 2 = 6 4 ≤ 𝑛 < 6 When 𝑛 = 4, 𝑎𝑠 6 − 𝑛 = 2 ∈ 𝐵, we assign 4 to A. When 𝑛 = 5, 𝑎𝑠 6 − 5 = 1 ∈ 𝐴, we assign 5 to B. Since the set to which n gets assigned is uniquely determined by the set to which 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 belongs, the partitioning is unique. Looking at the pattern of the partitioning of the initial set of positive integers, we conjecture the following. (1) 𝑛 ∈ 𝐴 𝑖𝑓 4|𝑛 (2) 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵 𝑖𝑓 2|𝑛 𝑏𝑢𝑡 4 ⋋ 𝑛 (3) If 𝑛 = 2𝑟. 𝑘 + 1 (𝑟 ≥ 1, k odd, then 𝑛 ∈ 𝐴 if k is of the form 4m – 1 and 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵 if k is of the form (4m + 1). Proof of the conjecture : We note that 1, 4 ∈ A and 2, 3 ∈ B. If 2𝑘−1 + 2 ≤ 𝑛 < 2𝑘 + 2 and all the numbers less than n have been assigned to A or B and satisfy the above conjecture, then if 4 | n, as 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 is divisible by 2 but not by 4, 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵. Hence, 𝑛 ∈ 𝐴. Similarly, if 2 Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 102 divides n but not 4, then 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 is divisible by 4 and hence, is in A. ∴ 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵 If 𝑛 = 2𝑟. 𝑘 + 1 Where r > 1, k odd and 𝑘 = 4𝑚 − 1, then 2 𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 = 2𝑘 − 2𝑟. 𝑘 + 1 = 2𝑟(2𝑘−𝑟 − 𝑘) + 1 Where clearly 2𝑘−𝑟 − 𝑘 is odd and equals 1 (mod 4). ∴ 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 = 2𝑘 − 2𝑟. 𝑘 + 1 = 2𝑟(2𝑘−𝑟 − 𝑘) + 1 Where clearly 2𝑘−𝑟 − 𝑘 is odd and equals 1 (mod 4). ∴ 2𝑘 + 2 − 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵. Hence, 𝑛 ∈ 𝐴. Similarly, it can be shown that if 𝑛 = 2𝑟. 𝑘 + 1, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝑘 ≡ 1 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 4), 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑛 𝑛 ∈ 𝐵. Thus, the conjecture is proved. Now, 1988 is divisible by 4. ∴ 1988 ∈ 𝐴 1987 = 2 1. 993 + 1 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 993 = 1 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 4) ∴ 1987 ∈ 𝐵 1989 = 22. 497 + 1 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 497 = 1 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 4) ∴ 1989 ∈ 𝐵 2|1998 𝑏𝑢𝑡 4′/1998 ∴ 1998 ∈ 𝐵 1997 = 22. 499 + 1 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 499 = 3 (𝑚𝑜𝑑 4) ∴ 1997 ∈ 𝐴 154. Since each Ai contains 4 elements, totally we get 24 elements of which some may be repeated. But each element is repeated 4 times as each element belongs to exactly 4 of the Ais. Hence there are 24 4 = 6 distinct elements in S. Since S= 𝐵1 ∪ 𝐵2 ∪ 𝐵3 ∪ … ∪ 𝐵𝑛, and each Bi consists of 2 elements, this union accounts for 2n elements. But each elements appears exactly 3 times. Thus the number of distinct elements in S is also equal to 2n/3. Therefore 2𝑛 3 = 6 𝑤ℎ𝑖𝑐ℎ 𝑔𝑖𝑣𝑒𝑠 𝑛 = 9. 155. This makes repeated use of the Pigeon hole Principle. As there are 65 balls and two boxes, one of the boxes must contain at least 33 balls (as otherwise the total number of balls would be ≤ 32 + 32 = 64). Consider that box (i.e., the one containing ≥ 33 balls).We have more than 33 balls and four colours (white, black, red, yellow) and hence there must be at least 9 balls of the same colour in the box. There are at most 4 different sizes available for these 9 balls of the same colour. For if there were 5 (or more) different sizes, then the collection of five balls, all of the different sizes would not satisfy the given property. Thus among these 9 balls (of the same colour and in the same box) there must be at least 3 balls of the same size. 156. Pair off the elements of the set {1, 11, 21, 31, …, 541, 551} as follows : {(1, 551), (11, 541), …{271, 281}}. There are 28 such pairs and they account for all the numbers in the original set. So if the subset of A has more than 28 elements, then A should contain both the elements of some pair, but then there is a contradiction since each pair above has the property that the two elements in the pair add Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 103 up to 552. Thus A cannot have more 28 elements. 157. We shall look at the problem form a general viewpoint. For any positive integer, n, let 𝑇𝑛 denote the number of permutations of (P1, P2, …, Pn) of 1, 2, 3, …, n such that for each k, 1 ≤ 𝑘 ≤ 𝑛, (𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3, … , 𝑃𝑛) is not a permutation of 1, 2, …, k. We shall obtain a formula for 𝑇𝑛 which expresses 𝑇𝑛 in terms of T1, T2, …, 𝑇𝑛−1 (n > 1). (Such a relation is called a recurrence relation for 𝑇𝑛). Consider any permutation (𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3, … , 𝑃𝑛) of 1, 2, …, n. there is always a least positive integer k such that (𝑃1, 𝑃2, 𝑃3, … , 𝑃𝑘) is a permutation of 1, 2, .. k. in fact k may be any integer in the set {1, 2, …, n}; and those permutations for which 𝑘 = 𝑛 are exactly the ones we wish to count. The number of permutations of (1, 2, …, n) for all of which k is the least positive integer satisfying the above property is Tk . (n – k)!, by our definition of 𝑇𝑛. The second factor corresponds to the permutations of k + 1, k + 2, …, n which fill up the remaining (n – k)places. Since there are n! permutations in all, we obtain 𝑛! = ∑ 𝑇𝑘 . (𝑛 − 𝑘)! 𝑛 𝑘−1 = 𝑇1 . (𝑛 − 1)! + 𝑇2 . (𝑛 − 2)! + ⋯ + 𝑇𝑛−1. 1! + 𝑇𝑛. 0! Hence 𝑇𝑛 = 𝑛! − 𝑇1. (𝑛 − 1)! − 𝑇2. (𝑛 − 2)! … − 𝑇𝑛−1. 1! Clearly 𝑇1 = 1 𝑇2 = 2! − 𝑇1. 1! = 2 − 1 = 1 𝑇3 = 3! − 𝑇1. 1! − 𝑇2. 1! = 6 − 2 − 1 = 3 𝑇4 = 4! − 𝑇1. 1! − 𝑇2. 2! = 𝑇3. 1! = 24 − 6 − 2 − 3 = 13. 𝑇5 = 5! − 𝑇1. 4! − 𝑇2. 3! − 𝑇3. 2! − 𝑇4. 1! = 120 − 24 − 6 − 6 − 13 = 71 𝑇6 = 6! − 𝑇1. 5! − 𝑇2. 4! − 𝑇3. 3! − 𝑇4. 2! − 𝑇5. 1! = 720 − 120 − 24 − 18 − 26 − 71 = 461. Thus the required number is 461. 158. a. Since A contains n + 1 elements of the set {1, 2, 3, …., 2n} some two of the n + 1 element must be consecutive (Why?). But then any two consecutive integers are relatively prime and we have the desired conclusion. b. We give a proof by making use of the Pigeon hole Principle. Write each of the n + 1 numbers in the form 2𝑝. 𝑞, where q is an odd number and p is a non negative integer. What are the possible values of q? Since the numbers of A come from the set {1, 2, 3, …, 2n}, we see that q can be any one of the n odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, …. 2n−1. As there are n + 1 numbers in A, there are n + 1 values of q. Hence by the afore−mentioned principle, for some two numbers 𝑎 = 2𝑝1. 𝑞1 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑏 = 2𝑝2. 𝑞2, we must have 𝑞1 = 𝑞2. Since 𝑎 ≠ 𝑏, 𝑝1 is either greater than 𝑝2 or less than 𝑝2. In the former case b divides a., while in the latter case a divides b. Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 104 159. First, not that A has 233 elements of which 116 are even and 117 are odd. B has 42 elements of which 21 are even and 21 are odd and 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 has 14 elements. Therefore, the required number is: 𝑛 = |{(𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑎 + 𝑏 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛}| − |{(𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑎 = 𝑏}| = |{(𝑎, 𝑏): 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑎 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛, 𝑏 𝑖𝑠 𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛}| + |{(𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑎 𝑜𝑑𝑑, 𝑏 𝑜𝑑𝑑}| − |{(𝑎, 𝑏) ∶ 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴, 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵, 𝑎 = 𝑏}| = 116 × 21 + 117 × 21 − 14 = 4879. 160. Suppose A has r elements, 0 ≤ 𝑟 ≤ 𝑛. Such an A can be chosen in ( 𝑛 𝑟) ways. For each such A, the set B must necessarily have the remaining (n – r) elements and possibly some elements of A. Thus, 𝐵 = (𝑋\\𝐴) ∪ 𝐶, 𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒 𝐶 ⊂ 𝐴. Hence B can be chosen in 2𝑟 ways. Thus there are ∑ ( 𝑛 𝑟) 2𝑟 = (1 + 2) 𝑛 = 3𝑛𝑛 𝑟=0 ways of choosing two sets A and B satisfying the given conditions. Among these choices, only in one case 𝐴 = 𝐵(= 𝑋), and in all other cases 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵. Since the order does not matter, we essentially have (3𝑛 − 1)/2 pairs. 161. Since x + 1 divides ax2 + bc + c, we must have 𝑎 + 𝑐 = 𝑏. Thus we have to count the number of triples (a, b, c) with the condition that a, b, c lie in the set {1, 2, 3, …, 1999}, 𝑎 ≠ 𝑐 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑎 + 𝑐 = 𝑏. If we take a < c, then for each a with 1 ≤ 𝑎 ≤ 999, c can take values from a + 1 to 1999 – a. Thus for 𝑎 = 1, c runs from 2 to 1998 giving 1997 ordered pairs (a, c) with a < c; for 𝑎 = 2, c runs from 3 to 1997, giving 1995 pairs (a, c) with a < c, and so on. The number of ordered pairs (a, c) with a < c and a + c lying in the set {1, 2, 3, …, 1999} is thus equal to 1997 + 1995 + 1993+ …+ 1 = 9992. Similarly the number of pairs (a, c) with c < a and a + c lying in the set {1, 2, 3, …, 1999} is 9992. Hence the required number of polynomials is 2.9992 = 1996002. 162. Let us denote by 0 or 1 the absence or presence of an element of X in the sets A, B, C. For any fixed element of X, there are only four choices to conform with 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 ⊂ 𝐶, namely, 000, 001, 011, 111. Thus there are 4𝑛choices. But 𝐵 = 𝐶 gives three choices, namely, 000, 011, 111. Hence there are 3𝑛 triples (A, B, B). The number of triples (A, B, C) with 𝐴 ⊂ 𝐵 ⊂ 𝐶 𝑏𝑢𝑡 𝐵 ≠ 𝐶 is therefore 4𝑛 − 3𝑛. 163. We fill up the 3 × 3 array at the left top (shown by dots in the adjacent figure) arbitrarily using the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. This can be done in 49 ways. The three numbers in the first row uniquely fix a. similarly b, c, p, q, r are fixed uniquely (If a number n when divided by 4 leaves a remainder R, then n + (4 – R) is divisible by 4 and 4−R is in the set {0, 1, 2, 3}). It is also clear that a+b+c and p+q+r leave the same remainder modulo 4, since both are obtained by the same set of nine numbers adding row−wise and adding column−wise, Olympiad Mathematics by Tanujit Chakraborty 105 modulo 4. Hence x is also fixed uniquely by the nine numbers originally chosen. Then the number of arrays required is 49. 164. Delete any n rows containing maximal number of zeroes. We claim that at most n zeroes are left in the remaining n rows. For, if otherwise, there are at least n + 1 zeroes left and so there are at least 2 zeroes in some row, by the Pigeon hole Principle. Since we have deleted rows containing maximum number of zeroes, each such row must contain at least 2 zeroes. Hence we would have deleted at least 2n zeroes. These along with n+1 zeroes would account for more than 3n zeroes, a contradiction to the hypothesis. This proves our claim. Now remove the columns (numbering not more than n) containing the remaining zeroes. By this process, we are removing all the 3n zeroes in the desired manner. 165. (a) Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle with a+b+c = 1996, and each being a positive integer. Then a + 1, b + 1, c + 1 are also sides of a triangle with perimeter 1999 because 𝑎 < 𝑏 + 𝑐 ⇒ 𝑎 + 1 < (𝑏 + 1) + (𝑐 + 1) and so on. Moreover (999, 999, 1) form the sides of a triangle with perimeter 1999, which is not obtainable in the form (a + 1, b + 1, c + 1) where a, b, c are the integers and the sides of a triangle with a + b +c = 1996. We conclude that f(1999) > f(1996) (b) As in the case (a) we conclude that f(2000) ≥ f(1997). On the other hand, if x, y, z are the integer sides of a triangle with 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 2000, and say 𝑥 ≥ 𝑦 ≥ 𝑧 ≥ 1, then we cannot have 𝑧 = 1; for otherwise we would get 𝑥 + 𝑦 = 1999 forcing x, y to have opposite parity so that 𝑥 − 𝑦 ≥ 1 = 𝑧 violating triangle inequality for x, y, z. Hence 𝑥 ≥ 𝑦 ≥ 𝑧 > 1. This implies that 𝑥 − 1 ≥ 𝑦 − 1 ≥ 𝑧 − 1 > 0. If 𝑥 ≥ 𝑦 + 𝑧 − 1, then we see that y+z−1 ≤ 𝑥 < 𝑦 + 𝑧, showing that 𝑦 + 𝑧 − 1 = 1. Hence we obtain 2000 = 𝑥 + 𝑦 + 𝑧 = 2𝑥 + 1 which is impossible. We conclude that x < y + z – 1. This shows that (x−1)<(y−1) + (z−1) and hence x−1, y−1, z−1 are the sides of a triangle with perimeter 1997. This gives 𝑓(2000) ≤ 𝑓(1997). Thus we obtain the desired result.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
