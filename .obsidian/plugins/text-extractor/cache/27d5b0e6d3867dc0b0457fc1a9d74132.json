Find the maximum possible value of x + y + z − xy − yz − zx. Determine all triples (x, y, z) for which this maximum is attained. Solution: The maximum possible value is 1 and is attained when (x, y, z) = (1, t, 0) for any 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, or any of its permutation solutions. Note that x + y + z − xy − yz − zx = −(1 − x)(1 − y)(1 − z) + 1 − xyz ≤ 1. Equality holds when at least one of x, y, z is equal to 1 and at least one of x, y, z is equal to 0. Clearly, this is possible. Therefore, the maximum possible value of x + y + z − xy − yz − zx is 1 and is attained when (x, y, z) = (1, t, 0) for any 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and any of its permutation solutions. □ Source: Diamonds by Tran Phuong Comments: When the expressions x + y + z, xy + yz + zx, xyz appear, you should always consider poly- nomials of degree three and/or terms of the form (c − x)(c − y)(c − z) for some constant c. This may even help you factor terms in other similar problems. A2 For any positive integer k, prove that 2k2 + k < 2k∑ j=1 √ k2 + j < 2k2 + k + 1 2 . Solutions: By subtracting 2k2 from all three terms, it suﬃces to show that k < 2k∑ j=1( √k2 + j − k) < k + 1 2 . Note that √k2 + j − k = j √k2 + j + k , and j 2k + 1 < j √k2 + j + k < j 2k . Therefore, 2k∑ j=1 j 2k + 1 < 2k∑ j=1 j √ k2 + j + k < 2k∑ j=1 j 2k . 3 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 4 Hence, 2k(2k + 1) 2(2k + 1) < 2k∑ j=1 j √ k2 + j + k < 2k(2k + 1) 2(2k) . Since j√k2+j+k = √k2 + j − k, we conclude that k < 2k∑ j=1 (√k2 + j − k) < k + 1 2 . This solves the problem. □ Source: Mongolian Mathematical Olympiad 2009 Comments: The appearance of the square root suggests that you rationalize the numerator of some expression. It should be natural for you to consider the term √k2 + j − k, since k < √ k2 + j < k + 1 for 1 ≤ j ≤ 2k. Bounding the term j/(√ k2 + j + k) between j 2k+1 and j 2k should also be natural since you are looking for rational lower and upper bounds of j√k2+j+k . □ A3 Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a 2 + b2 + c 2 = 3. Prove that 1 1 + ab + 1 1 + bc + 1 1 + ca ≥ 3 2 . Solution 1: Note that ab ≤ a 2+b 2 2 . Therefore, 1 1+ab ≥ 1 1+ a2+b2 2 for all a, b ≥ 0. Therefore, by AM-HM inequality, we have ∑ cyc 1 1 + ab ≥ ∑ cyc 1 1 + a2+b2 2 ≥ 9 ∑ cyc(1 + a2+b2 2 ) = 9 3 + a2 + b2 + c2 = 3 2 , as desired. □ Solution 2: By adding the terms on the left-hand side and cross multiplying, the inequality becomes equivalent to 3 + (ab + bc + ca) ≥ abc(a + b + c) + 3a2b2c 2. By homogenizing (i.e. using the condition a 2 + b 2 + c 2 = 3 to make every term have the same degree), we have 3 · (a 2 + b2 + c2)3 27 + (a 2 + b 2 + c 2) 2(ab + bc + ca) 9 ≥ (a2 + b2 + c 2)abc(a + b + c) 3 + 3a 2b 2c 2. By clearing denominators, this inequality becomes equivalent to (a 2 + b2 + c 2)3 + (a 2 + b2 + c2)2(ab + bc + ca) ≥ 3(a 2 + b2 + c 2)abc(a + b + c) + 27a 2b2c2. For any non-negative real numbers x, y, z, let [x, y, z] = ∑ sym a xbyc z. 4 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 5 We recall Muirhead’s Majorization inequality, which states that if x, y, z, u, v, w are non-negative real numbers such that x ≥ y ≥ z, u ≥ v ≥ w, x + y + z = u + v + w, x ≥ u, x + y ≥ u + v, then [x, y, z] ≥ [u, v, w]. [x, y, z] is said to majorize [u, v, w]. Note that (a 2 + b2 + c2)3 = 1 2 [6, 0, 0] + 3[4, 2, 0] + [2, 2, 2], (a 2 + b 2 + c 2) 2(ab + bc + ca) = [5, 1, 0] + 1 2 [4, 1, 1] + [3, 3, 0] + 2[3, 2, 1], 3(a 2 + b 2 + c2)abc(a + b + c) = 3 2 [4, 1, 1] + 3[3, 2, 1], 27a 2b 2c 2 = 9 2 [2, 2, 2]. Hence, after cancellation of terms, the previous inequality becomes equivalent to 1 2 [6, 0, 0] + 3[4, 2, 0] + [5, 1, 0] + [3, 3, 0] ≥ [4, 1, 1] + [3, 2, 1] + 7 2 [2, 2, 2]. By Muirhead’s inequality, [5, 1, 0] ≥ [4, 1, 1], [3, 3, 0] ≥ [3, 2, 1], 1 2 [6, 0, 0] + 3[4, 2, 0] ≥ 1 2 [2, 2, 2] + 3[2, 2, 2] = 7 2 [2, 2, 2]. Hence, the inequality holds. □ Source: Belarus Mathematical Olympiad 1999 Comments: You should always be able to solve any three-variable symmetric inequality, that can be homogenized, has equality case a = b = c and/or a = b, c = 0 and its permutation solutions, and whose variables are non-negative real numbers, using Muirhead’s and Schur’s inequality. Muirhead’s inequality states that [x, y, z] ≥ [u, v, w] whenever [x, y, z] majorizes [u, v, w]. An equivalent version of Schur’s in- equality is [x + 2, 0, 0] + [x, 2, 0] ≥ 2[x + 1, 1, 1]. For proofs of these inequalities, see Chapter 3.2 of [2]. You may be thinking that solving problems in this manner is not elegant and can be considered ugly. But the truth of the matter is that a lot of mathematics is initially done by getting your hands dirty and working with cumbersome expressions. Muirhead’s and Schur’s inequality is in the arsenal of every top math olympian in the world and should always be used as a last resort to solve inequalities of this type. To test your ability to use these inequalities, do try the following problem. Exercise: Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 3. Prove that 1 a2 + 1 b2 + 1 c2 ≥ a 2 + b 2 + c2. A4 P (x) is a polynomial of odd degree with real coeﬃcients. Show that the equation P (P (x)) = 0 has at least as many distinct real roots, as the equation P (x) = 0. Solution: Let x1, · · · , xn be all of the distinct roots of the equation P (x) = 0. We want to show that P (P (x)) = 0 has at least n distinct real roots. For each i = 1, · · · , n, consider the equation P (x) = xi. It has at least one real root ai since P is a polynomial of odd degree. Now, for i, j ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}, i ̸= j, if ai = aj, then P (ai) = P (aj). Therefore, 5 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 6 xi = xj, which is impossible since x1, · · · , xn are pairwise distinct. Therefore, the ai’s are also pairwise distinct. But each ai is a solution to P (P (x)) = 0, since P (P (ai)) = P (xi) = 0. Hence the equation P (P (x)) = 0 has at least n distinct real roots a1, a2, ..., an. The result follows. □ Source: Russian Mathematical Olympiad 2000 Comments: When polynomials in question have certain properties such as having odd degree, a question you should ask yourself is what are the diﬀerences between polynomials of odd degree and those of even degree? The answer will often give you clues as to how to approach a problem. If you have not used the fact that the polynomial has odd degree, you may not be approaching the problem in a correct way. A5 Find all functions f : R 7→ R such that ∀x, y, z ∈ R, we have if x3 + f (y) · x + f (z) = 0, then f (x) 3 + y · f (x) + z = 0. Solution: We will call x3 + f (y) · x + f (z) = 0 relation (A) and f (x) 3 + y · f (x) + z = 0 relation (B). We ﬁrst prove that f is surjective. Let m be an arbitrary real number. We will show that f (x) = m for some x ∈ R. Since (A) is a cubic polynomial in x, given any ﬁxed y, z ∈ R, there exists x ∈ R such that (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). We choose y = 1, z = −m 3 − m. We can choose x ∈ R such that (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). Therefore, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B), i.e. f (x) 3 + f (x) − (m 3 + m) = 0. This implies that (f (x) − m)(f (x)2 + m · f (x) + m 2 + 1) = 0. The latter factor, as a quadratic equation in f (x), has negative discriminant, hence cannot be zero. Therefore, f (x) = m. This proves that f is surjective. We now show that f (x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. Since f is surjective, f (r) = 0 for some r ∈ R. Note that (x, y, z) = (0, a, r) satisﬁes (A) for any choice of a ∈ R. Hence, (0, a, r) satisﬁes (B), i.e. f (0)3 + af (0) + r = 0 holds for all a ∈ R. Therefore, af (0) = r − f (0) 3 for all a ∈ R. The right hand side is a constant. Therefore, f (0) = 0. This implies r = 0. Hence, f (x) = 0 if and only if x = 0. We now show that f is injective. Assume f (a) = f (b) for some a, b ∈ R. Take any z ̸= 0. Then f (z) ̸= 0. There exists x for which x3 + f (a)x + f (z) = 0. Note that x ̸= 0, since f (z) ̸= 0. Then (x, a, z) and (x, b, z) satisfy (A), since f (a) = f (b) and x3 + f (a)x + f (z) = 0. Therefore, (x, a, z), (x, b, z) satisfy (B), i.e. x3 + af (x) + z = x3 + bf (x) + z = 0, hence (a − b)f (x) = 0. But x ̸= 0, implying f (x) ̸= 0. Hence a = b. Therefore, f is injective. We now show that (A) and (B) are equivalent, i.e. (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A) if and only if (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B). From the condition given in the problem, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A) implies (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B). To prove the converse, let x, y, z ∈ R be a triple such that (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B), i.e. we have have f (x) 3 +y ·f (x)+z = 0. Let z′ ∈ R such that (x, y, z′) satisﬁes (A). This is possible since f is surjective. Therefore, (x, y, z′) sat- isﬁes (B), i.e. z′ = −f (x) 3 − yf (x). But this term is also equal to z. Therefore, z′ = z, implying (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). Therefore, (A) and (B) are equivalent. Take (x, y, z) such that x = 1, f (y) = −1, z = 0. Choosing such a y is possible since f is surjective. Then (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). Hence, f (1) 3 + yf (1) = 0. Therefore, y = −f (1) 2, which implies f (−f (1) 2) = −1, by the deﬁnition of y. Take (x, y, z) such that x = 1, y = 0, f (z) = −1. Then (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). Hence, f (1) 3 + z = 0, implying z = −(f (1)) 3. Therefore, f (−f (1) 3) = −1. But f is injective and f (z) = 1. 6 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 7 Therefore, −f (1) 2 = −f (1) 3, or equivalently, f (1) 2(f (1) − 1) = 0. Since f is injective, f (1) ̸= f (0) = 0. Therefore, f (1) = 1. Take x = 1, z = −y − 1. Since f (1) = 1, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B). Since (A) and (B) are equivalent, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A), i.e. f (−y − 1) = −f (y) − 1, ∀y ∈ R. (1) Substitute y = 0 into (1) yields f (−1) = −1. (2) Take x = −1, z = y + 1. Since f (−1) = −1, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B), which implies (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A), i.e. f (y + 1) = f (y) + 1, ∀y ∈ R. Inductively, we can show that f (y + k) = f (y) + k, ∀y ∈ R, k ∈ Z. (3) Because f (0) = 0, from (3), we have that f (x) = x, ∀x ∈ Z. (4) From (1) and (3), we get that f (−y − 1) = −f (y) − 1 = −(f (y + 1) − 1) − 1 = −f (y + 1). Therefore, f (y) = f (−y), ∀y ∈ R. (5) Let x, y be any ﬁxed real numbers and let z = −f (x) 3 − yf (x). Then (x, y, z) satisﬁes (A). Hence, (x, y, z) satisﬁes (B), i.e. x3 + f (y)x + f (z) = 0. Therefore, f (z) = −x3 − f (y)x. By the deﬁnition of z, we now have f (−f (x)3 − yf (x)) = −x3 − f (y)x, ∀x, y ∈ R. (6) Using (5), we get that f (f (x)3 + yf (x)) = x3 + f (y)x, ∀x, y ∈ R. (7) If x is an integer, then by (4), f (x) and x3 are also integers. Therefore, by (3) and (7), we have x3+xf (y) = f (f (x)3 + yf (x)) = f (x)3 + f (yf (x)) = x3 + f (yx). (We substitute y ← yf (x) and k ← f (x) 3 into (3) for the second last assertion and the fact that f (x) = x for all x ∈ Z, for the last assertion.) Therefore, xf (y) = f (yx), ∀x ∈ Z, y ∈ R. (8) Now, if m, n are integers with n ̸= 0, then by (8), we have f (x + m n ) = f ( nx + m n ) = f (nx + m) n = nf (x) + m n = f (x) + m n . Hence, f (x + q) = f (x) + q, ∀x ∈ R, q ∈ Q. (9) Substituting x = 0 into (9) gives us f (q) = q, ∀q ∈ Q. (10) Substituting y = −f (x)2 into (7) gives us 0 = f (0) = −x3 − f (−f (x) 2)x. Therefore, f (−f (x)2) = −x2. By (5), we have f (f (x)2) = x2, ∀x ∈ R. (11) 7 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 8 Let c > 0 be an arbitrary real number. Then since f is surjective, there exists d ∈ R such that c = f (d) 2. Since c ̸= 0, f (0) = 0 and f is injective, d ̸= 0. Therefore, by (11), we have f (c) = f (f (d) 2) = d 2 > 0. Hence, c > 0 ⇒ f (c) > 0, ∀c ∈ R (12) Assume for some x, we have f (x) < x. Then there exists a rational number r for which f (x) < r < x. Then by (12), we have f (x − r) > 0 and by (9), we have r > f (x) = f (r + (x − r)) = r + f (x − r) > r. This is a contradiction. So we cannot have f (x) < x. Similarly, we cannot have f (x) > x. So the only possibility for f is f (x) = x for all x ∈ R. It is easy to check f (x) = x satisﬁes the conditions of the problem and so is the only solution. Source: German Team Selection Test 2009 Comments: This problem is diﬃcult in the sense that the solution requires many steps. However, every step demonstrates an important technique that you should know to solve functional equations. The ﬁrst thing you should almost always do is to ﬁnd solutions to the functional equation by inspection. The most common ones are f (x) = c for some constant c, f (x) = x + c for some constant c, quadratic equations and f (x) = 1 xd for some integer d. You next want to establish properties of the functional equation, i.e. what is f (0)? If f (x) = 0, does it mean x = 0? Is f one-to-one? Is f surjective? (Don’t do the latter two questions if one of the solutions to the functional equation is, say, f (x) = x2. You already know that this function is neither one-to-one or surjective over the reals.) Another technique is solving the problem over the rationals ﬁrst, and then use detailed (and careful) continuity arguments to solve the problem over all of the reals. 8 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 9 Number Theory N1 Let n be a positive integer. The sum of the positive divisors of n is s. Prove that the sum of the reciprocal of these divisors is s n . Solution: Let d1, · · · , dt be the positive divisors of n with 1 = d1 < d2 < · · · < dt = n. Note that n = didt+1−i for each i. Therefore, 1 di = dt+1−i n . Hence, t∑ i=1 1 di = t∑ i=1 dt+1−i n = 1 n t∑ i=1 dt+1−i = 1 n t∑ i=1 di = s n .□ Source: Original Comments: Always remember that the positive divisors of n come in pairs as shown in this solution. The exception is when n is a perfect square. In this case, √n is paired with itself. N2 A rational number x is written on a blackboard. In each step, you erase x and replace it with either x + 1 or − 1 x . (If x = 0, you must replace x with x + 1). Prove that for any rational number p, if p currently appears on the blackboard, then you can make 0 appear in a ﬁnite number of steps. Solution: By adding 1 repeatedly to p (which is a legal step), we may assume that p ≥ 0. If p = 0, we are already done. Let p = m n , where m, n > 0. I claim that after a ﬁnite number of steps, you can obtain a rational number with a non-negative numerator non-negative which is strictly smaller than m. Let n = qm − r where 0 ≤ r < m. We erase m n and replace it with −n m . By adding 1 to this q times, we get a fraction r m and 0 ≤ r < m. We obtain a number with a non-negative numerator which is smaller than m. Repeating this procedure gives us fractions with strictly smaller non-negative numerators. Hence, we can eventually obtain a rational number with numerator 0, which is the number zero. □ Source: John Conway’s Talk on Knot Theory Comments: This is motivated by the Euclidean algorithm and using a general technique in number theory called descent. A strategy for this type of problem generally involves solving this problem for certain values of p with small numerator and denominator. It should be pretty natural to try to lower the numerator and/or denominator of the number on the board. I will leave as an exercise that starting at 0, you can make p appear after a ﬁnite number of steps. Another note is that we used a variant of the division algorithm. Instead of writing n = qm + r with 0 ≤ r < m, which is the more traditional method, we wrote it as n = qm − r with 0 ≤ r < m to make the problem easier. The other useful variant is writing n as n = qm + r where −m/2 < r ≤ m/2. N3 Find all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that a 2 + 2b+1 = 3 c. Solution: The answers are (1, 2, 2) and (7, 4, 4). 9 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 10 Since 2 b+1 is even and 3 c is odd, a 2 is odd. Therefore, a 2 ≡ 1 mod 4. Since 2 b+1 ≡ 0 mod 4, 3 c ≡ 1 mod 4. This implies 3c ≡ 1 mod 4. Hence, (−1) c ≡ 1 mod 4. We conclude that c is even. Therefore, 2 b+1 = (3 c 2 − a)(3 c 2 + a). Hence, 3 c 2 − a and 3 c 2 + a are both powers of 2. Since a is odd, both of these terms are even, so none of these terms are 1. Hence, we can let s, t be positive integers such that 3 c 2 − a = 2s and 3 c 2 + a = 2t. Subtracting the former from the latter yields 2a = 2 t − 2 s. Hence, a = 2 t−1 − 2 s−1. Since a is odd, s = 1. Therefore, a = 2 t−1 − 1. Substituting this into 3 c 2 + a = 2 t yields 3 c 2 + 2t−1 − 1 = 2 t, or equivalently, 3 c 2 − 1 = 2 t−1. If t = 1, then 3 c 2 = 2, which has no integer solutions. If t = 2, then 3 c 2 − 1 = 2. Hence, c = 2, a = 2 t−1 − 1 = 2 2−1 − 1 = 1. Therefore, 1 + 2 b+1 = 3 2, implying b = 2. Hence, (1, 2, 2) is a solution to the equation and is easily veriﬁed to be a solution. Otherwise, t > 2, implying 4 | 2 t−1. Hence, 3 c 2 ≡ 1 mod 4, which implies (−1) c 2 ≡ 1 mod 4. Hence, c 2 is even. Therefore, (3 c 4 − 1)(3 c 4 + 1) = 2 t−1. From this, we have that both 3 c 4 − 1, 3 c 4 + 1 are powers of 2 and are consecutive even integers. This is only possible when the smaller integer is 2 and the larger integer is 4. Therefore, 3 c 4 − 1 = 2, implying c = 4. Therefore, 3 2 − 1 = 2t−1 = a + 1, or equivalently, a = 7. Finally, 72 + 2b+1 = 3 4, implying b = 4. Therefore, (7, 4, 4) is a solution to the equation and is easily veriﬁed to be a solution. □ Source: Italian Team Selection Test 2008 Comments: One technique to solve Diophantine equations is consider reduce everything modulo a cer- tain positive integer. The existence of a square and a power of 2 suggests that mod 4 and mod 8 are possibilities. Problems like this test your comfort level with divisibility problems. You should always try to ﬁnd as many solutions by inspection as you can as a ﬁrst step. (However, I do not expect you to initially ﬁnd the solution (7, 4, 4).) Try to use modular arithmetic to solve the following problem. Exercise: Let m, n be positive integers. Find the minimum possible value of |12m − 5 n|. N4 Find all positive integers that can be written in the form m 2 + n2 + 1 mn , for all positive integers m, n. Solution: The answer is 3. Let S = {(m, n) | mn divides m2 + n 2 + 1, m, n ∈ N} and f (m, n) = m 2 + n2 + 1 mn . 10 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 11 Note that (m, n) ∈ S if and only if (n, m) ∈ S. If m = 1, then n divides n2 + 2. This implies n | 2. Therefore, n = 1 or n = 2. Both yield the property that m2+n2+1 mn = 3. This holds similar for n = 1. Therefore, if m = 1 or n = 1, then f (m, n) = 3. We next consider the case m = n. If (m, n) ∈ S and m = n, then m 2 divides 2m 2 + 1. Therefore, m2 | 1. Therefore, m = 1. Hence, if (m, m) ∈ S, then m = 1. This also yields that f (m, n) = 3. Now, suppose (m, n) ∈ S with 1 < m < n. Suppose k = m2+n2+1 mn . I claim there exists 0 < n′ < m such that (m, n ′) ∈ S. Rewriting the equation gives us n2 − kmn + (m 2 + 1) = 0. Hence, n is an integer root of the equation x2 − kmx + (m 2 + 1) = 0. Let n′ be the other root. Since n + n′ = km, which is an integer, n ′ is an integer. Since nn′ = m2 + 1 > 0 and n > 0, n′ > 0. Note that f (m, n) = f (m, n ′), by rewriting the quadratic equation back to the form f (m, n ′). Therefore, (m, n ′) ∈ S. I claim that n′ < m. Suppose on the contrary that n′ ≥ m. Since (m, n ′) ∈ S and n, m > 1, n′ ̸= m by the argument in the case m = n. Suppose n′ > m. Let n = m + a, n ′ = m + b for some positive integers a, b. Then nn′ = (m + a)(m + b) = m2 + 1, since the product of the roots of x2 − kmx + (m2 + 1) is m 2 + 1. Hence, m(a + b) + ab = 1, which is impossible since a, b ≥ 1. Therefore, n′ < m. This proves the claim. Hence, (m, n ′) ∈ S, which implies (n′, m) ∈ S. Note that k = f (m, n) = f (m, n ′) = f (n′, m). If n ′ = 1, then from an earlier argument, k = 3. Otherwise, we repeat this process for 1 < n ′ < m. Every time we perform the previous paragraph, min{m, n} strictly decreases and remains positive and f (m, n) remains constant. Hence, eventually, at least one of m, n = 1. By an earlier argument, this results in k = 3. Since f (m, n) remains constant at every step, we conclude that f (m, n) = 3. This completes the problem. □ Source: Arthur Engel’s Problem-Solving Strategies Comments: The technique used in this problem is called Vieta-jumping or descent. It is extremely helpful in solving Diophantine equations with quadratic terms. By letting S be a solution set, you can claim statements of the form if (a, b) ∈ S, then (c, d) ∈ S for certain choices of a, b, c, d. By doing so, you can create a series of solutions for which min{m, n} is decreasing. Try to solve the following problem from the 1988 International Mathematical Olympiad using Vieta-jumping. Exercise: Suppose m, n are positive integers such that mn + 1 divides m 2 + n2. Prove that m2 + n2 mn + 1 is a perfect square. N5 Find all prime numbers p such that the following statement is true: there are exactly p ordered pairs of integers (x, y) such that 0 ≤ x, y < p and y2 ≡ x3 − x mod p. Solution: The answers are p = 2 and all primes p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4. 11 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 12 If p = 2, then we can check that the only pairs that work are (0, 0) and (1, 0). There are exactly two solutions. Hence p = 2 is an answer. We may assume now that p is odd. For a ∈ {0, 1, · · · , p − 1}, we call a a quadratic residue modulo p if and only if n 2 ≡ a mod p for some integer n. Otherwise, we call a a quadratic non-residue. We recall that the product of two quadratic residues is a quadratic residue, and the product of two quadratic non- residues is a quadratic residue. Also, the product of a quadratic residue and a quadratic non-residue, is a quadratic non-residue. Also recall that −1 is a quadratic residue of p if and only if p ≡ 1 mod 4 or p = 2. (*) Note that (−1, 0), (0, 0), (1, 0) are the only solutions involving y = 0 and x ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. There are three such solutions. We will henceforth only consider the cases when x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} and y ̸= 0. We will call x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} solvable if there exists y such that y2 ≡ x3 − x mod p. If p ≡ 1 mod 4, then note that x3 − x = −1 · ((−x)3 − (−x)). By the arguments made in (*), since −1 is a quadratic residue mod 4, x is solvable if and only if −x is solvable. For each x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} which is solvable, there are exactly two values of y such that (x, y) is a solution to the original equation. This is because (x, y) is a solution if and only if (x, −y) is a solution. Note that x ̸≡ −x and y ̸≡ −y mod p since p is odd and y ̸= 0. Hence the number of values of x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} which is solvable is even and each solvable x yields two values of y. Hence, the number of ordered pair solutions with x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} is divisible by 4. Including the three aforementioned solutions, the number of solutions (x, y) is congruent to 3 mod 4. But p ≡ 1 mod 4. Therefore, the number of solutions (x, y) cannot equal to p. If p ≡ 3 mod 4, again, note that x3 − x = −1 · ((−x)3 − (−x)). Since −1 is a quadratic non-residue mod p and the product of a quadratic residue and a quadratic non-residue is a quadratic non-residue, x is solvable if and only if −x is not solvable. Hence, exactly half of the value of x ∈ {2, · · · , p − 2} are solvable and using a similar argument as in the case p ≡ 1 mod 4, each solvable x yields two solutions. Therefore, there are p−3 2 · 2 = p − 3 solutions. Adding the aforementioned three solutions, there are p solutions total. Hence, p ≡ 3 mod 4 is a solution to the problem. □ Source: Turkish Team Selection Test 2005 Comments: The facts in the paragraph marked (*) are important topics to learn for number theory, especially the fact that n2 ≡ −1 mod p has a solution if and only if p = 2 or p ≡ 1 mod 4. Please read Theorem 4.9 and Chapter 7 of [3] for more details. Another important point is that the very least you should be able to do for this problem, even without knowledge of quadratic residues and of fact (*), is to conjecture your answer for p by solving this problem for small primes p, say up to p = 17. The motivation behind this given solution arises from the work you do for small values of p. Only then would you be able to consider the diﬀerences between primes 1 and 3 mod 4. The least that you should be able to write, is something along the lines of ”I conjecture that the solution to this problem are p = 2 and all primes p ≡ 3 mod 4”. Of course, now that you have read and under- stood this solution, I will expect much more than this. :) Using fact (*), you can try the following exercise.

Given any point Q on the circumference of C, let M be the midpoint of P Q. Find the locus of point M , i.e. ﬁnd all possible locations for point M . Solution 1: The locus of M is exactly the dilation of C about point P with ratio 1 2 . The image is therefore the circle with radius half of that of C whose centre is the midpoint of P and O, where O is the centre of C. □ Solution 2: Let O be the centre of C, r the radius of C and N the midpoint of P O. Since |P M | |M Q| = |P N | |N O| = 1, we have |M N | |QO| = 1 2 . Hence, |M N | = r 2 . Therefore, M lies on the circle with radius r 2 centered at N . Conversely, let M be any point on the circle centered at N with radius r 2 . Let Q be on the circumference of C such that QO is parallel to M N . Then |M N | |QO| = |P N | |P O| = 1 2 , which implies P, M, Q are collinear and |P M | |P Q| = 1 2 . Therefore, M is the midpoint of P Q. □ Source: Original G2 Let A be a point outside of a circle C. Two lines pass through A, one intersecting C at B, C, with B closer to A than C, and the other intersecting C at D, E, with D closer to A than E. The line passing through D parallel to AC intersects C a second time at F and the line AF intersects C a second time at G. Let M = EG ∩ AC. Prove that 1 |AM | = 1 |AB| + 1 |AC| . Solution: Note that ∠GAM = ∠F AM = ∠AF D = ∠GF D = ∠GED, the latter assertion following from that DEF G is cyclic. Therefore, ∆GAM ∼ ∆AEM . Hence, we have |M A| |M G| = |M E| |M A| , which implies |M A|2 = |M G| · |M E| = |M B| · |M C|. The assertion follows from that DEF G is cyclic. We shall call this property (*). Note that M lies on the segment AB. Therefore, |AB| = |M A| + |M B| and |AC| = |M A| + |M C|. Hence, 1 |AM | = 1 |AB| + 1 |AC| = |AB| + |AC| |AB| · |AC| = 2|M A| + |M B| + |M C| (|M A| + |M B|)(|M A| + |M C|) . This equality holds if and only if (|M A| + |M B|)(|M A| + |M C|) = 2|M A|2 + |M A||M B| + |M A||M C| ⇔ |M B| · |M C| = |M A| 2, which is true by property (*). □ Source: Romanian Team Selection Test 2006 Comments: If you are not familiar with Power of a Point, please read Chapter 6 of [1].

The internal angle bisector of ∠ADB and that of ∠ACB intersect at P . The internal angle bisector of ∠ADC and that of ∠ABC intersect at Q. Let M be the midpoint of P Q. Prove that |M A| < |M D|. Solution: Note that P is the excentre of △ACD opposite C, and Q is the excentre of △ABD opposite B. Therefore, ∠P AD = 180−∠CAD 2 and ∠QAD = 180−∠BAD 2 . Note also that ∠QDP = ∠QDA + ∠ADP = 1 2 (∠BDA + ∠CDA) = 90o. Therefore, |M P | = |M Q| = |M D|. Consider the circle centred at M passing through P, Q, D. To prove that |M A| < |M D|, it suﬃces to show that A is in the interior of the circle, i.e. ∠QAP is obtuse. But ∠QAP = ∠QAD + ∠P AD = 180 − ∠BAD 2 + 180 − ∠CAD 2 = 180 − ∠BAD + ∠CAD 2 = 180 − ∠BAC and this angle is greater than 90 o (and less than 180 o). Therefore, |M A| < |M D|. □ Source: Original and similar to one on Irish Mathematical Olympiad 2005 Comments: It is important to observe excentres in a diagram.

The line through D and the midpoint of BC intersects line AB in point E. Prove that ∠BEC = ∠DAC. Solution: Let F be on side AB such that |DA| = |DF |, which is also equal to |DC|. Since ∠AF D = ∠DAF = ∠DAB = ∠ABC, DF ||BC. Extend DF to meet EC at G. Since DF ||BC and ED passes through the midpoint of BC, D is the midpoint of F G. Hence, |DA| = |DC| = |DF | = |DG|. Hence, ACGF is cyclic. Then ∠F AC = ∠F GC = ∠DGC = ∠BCE.

Let its incircle touch side BC at E. Let AE intersect this incircle again at D. Let F be the second point on AE such that |CE| = |CF |. Let CF intersect BD at G. Prove that |CF | = |F G|. Solution: Let the line tangent to the incircle at D intersect BC (extended) at P . Since |P E| = |P D| and |CE| = |CF |, CF ||P D. 14 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 15 By Menelaus’ Theorem on ∆BCG, we have that |GD| |DB| · |BE| |EC| · |CF | |F G| = 1. Since CF ||P D, |GD| |DB| = |CP | |P B| . Therefore, to prove that |CF | = |F G|, it suﬃces to prove that |CP | |P B| = |CE| |EB| . Note that the polar of P with respect to the incircle is line DE, which also contains A. Therefore, the polar of A contains P . Hence, the polar of A is XY , where X, Y are points where the incircle touches AC, AB, respectively. Hence, P lies on XY . Since |AX| = |AY |, |BY | = |BE|, |CE| = |CX|, we have that AY Y B · BE EC · CX XA = 1. (13) Hence, AE, BX, CY are concurrent by Ceva’s Theorem. Since X, Y, P are collinear, by Menelaus’ Theorem on ∆ABC, we have AY Y B · BP P C · CX XA = −1. (14) Comparing equations (13) and (14), yields |CP | |P B| = |CE| |EB| , as desired. □ Source: China Team Selection Test 2008 Comments: Ceva’s and Menealus’ Theorem are essential pieces of knowledge for proving concurrency and collinearity involving triangles.

Note that k ̸= 0 since 0 ̸∈ {1, · · · , 10}. Every subset of size k must contain k. The other k − 1 elements can be anything. Therefore, there are ( 9 k−1) subsets of size k that contains k.

Prove that for every positive integer m, there exists a positive integer a such that Ga, Ga+1 are both divisible by m. Solution: Consider each pair (Gt, Gt+1) modulo m. Since there are at m 2 pairs of integers (x, y) mod- ulo m, the sequence (Gt, Gt+1) modulo m eventually repeats, by Pigeonhole Principle. It suﬃces to prove that (Ga, Ga+1) = (0, 0) = (G0, G1) modulo m, for some positive integer a. Suppose the sequence {(Gt, Gt+1} repeats the ﬁrst time at index t = a. Then (Ga, Ga+1) = (Gj, Gj+1) modulo m for some 0 ≤ j < t. If j = 0, then (Ga, Ga+1) = (0, 0), implying Ga, Ga+1 are both divisible by m and we are done. Otherwise, note that the pair that appears before (x, y) is (y, x + y − 1). In other words, given a pair of consecutive terms in the sequence, the previous pair of consecutive terms is determined. Hence, (Ga, Ga+1) = (Gj, Gj+1) implies (Gj−1, Gj) = (Ga−1, Ga), contradicting that the sequence repeats the ﬁrst time at index a. Therefore, Ga, Ga+1 are both divisible by m. □ Source: Estonian Mathematical Olympiad 2007 Comments: Pigeonhole Principle is a powerful tool to solve certain existence type of combinatorics prob- lems.

C3 A set S of ≥ 3 points in a plane has the property that no three points are collinear, and if A, B, C are three distinct points in S, then the circumcentre of ∆ABC is also in S. Prove that S is inﬁnite. Solution: Suppose on the contrary that S is ﬁnite. Consider the convex hull P of S, i.e. the smallest poly- gon containing all of S (on the polygon’s boundary and interior). Since |S| ≥ 3, P contains at least three vertices. Let AB be a side of P and C be any other vertex of P. Note that P is contained in the halfplane of AB containing C and there are no points in S in the halfplane not containing C. If ∠ACB > 90 ◦, then the circumcircle of ∆ACB lies in the halfplane of AB not containing C, which does not contain any point 16 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 17 in S. Hence, the circumcircle of ∆ACB is not in S. This contradicts the assumption given in the problem. Otherwise, ∠ACB is acute. We let O1 be the circumcentre of ∆ACB and recursively, deﬁne Oi+1 to be the circumcentre of ∆AOiB. Hence, Oi ∈ S for all i ≥ 1. Hence, ∆AO1B = 2∠ACB. We choose the smallest index k such that ∠AOkB ≥ 90◦. Therefore, ∠AOkB = 2∠AOk−1B. Since ∠AOk−1B ≤ 90◦ by our choice of k, ∠AOk−1B < 180◦. If ∠AOkB = 90 ◦, then Ok+1 lies on AB, contradicting the fact that no three points in S are collinear. (Note that Oi ̸= A, B for any i, since the circumcentre of a triangle cannot be any of the vertices of the triangle.) Otherwise, 90 < ∠AOkB < 180◦, which implies Ok+1 lies on the halfplane of AB not containing Ok. Hence, Ok+1 cannot lie in S, but this contradicts the fact that Oi ∈ S for all i ≥ 1. Hence, S cannot be ﬁnite, implying S is inﬁnite. □ Source: Unknown Comments: When you are given a ﬁnite set of points in the plane in a problem, you should always consider the convex hull of the set.

A survey was done on n people where on each of k days, each person was asked whether he/she was happy on that day and answered either ”yes” or ”no”. It turned out that on any two distinct days, exactly half of the people gave diﬀerent answers on the two days. Prove that there were at most n− n k people who answered ”yes” the same number of times he/she answered ”no” over the k days. Solution: Consider a grid with k rows and n columns. Label the days from 1 to k and the people from 1 to n. We place a 1 in the i th row and jth column if person j is happy on day i and a 0 otherwise. Since on any two days, exactly half of the people gave diﬀerent answers on the two days, we have that for any two rows, exactly half of the columns diﬀer. Hence, the number of pairs of squares in the same column that diﬀer, is (k 2) · n 2 . For each person that answered yes the same number of times as he/she answered no, the number of pairs of squares in the person’s column that diﬀer is ( k 2 )2. Hence, the maximum number of people that could have answered yes the same number of times as he/she answered no, is (k 2) n 2 ( k 2 )2 = nk(k−1) 4 k2 4 = n(k − 1) k = n − n k , as desired. □ Source: Iran Mathematical Olympiad 2006 Comments: An important key to solving combinatorics problem is ﬁnd out what you are suppose to be counting.

Use this technique to solve the following problem from the 1998 International Mathematical Olympiad 17 IMO Winter Camp 2010 Warm-Up Problems 18 Exercise: In a contest, there are m candidates and n judges, where n ≥ 3 is an odd integer. Each candidate is evaluated by each judge as either pass or fail. Suppose that each pair of judges agrees on at most k candidates. Prove that k m ≥ n − 1 2n . C5 There are n ≥ 5 people in a room, where each pair is classiﬁed as friends or strangers. No three people are mutually friends. There also exist an odd number of people P1, · · · , Pm such that Pi is friends with Pi+1 for all i ∈ {1, · · · , m}, where the indices are taken modulo m. Prove that there exists one person who is friends with at most 2n/5 people. Solution: Given a positive integer m ≥ 3, we will call an ordered set of m people P1, · · · , Pm a cycle if Pi is friends with Pi+1 for all i ∈ {1, · · · , m}, where the indices are taken modulo m. If m is odd, we call a cycle an odd cycle. Given the condition in the problem, an odd cycle exists. Consider the odd cycle in the room P1, · · · , Pg with the smallest number of people. Since no three people who are mutually friends, the odd cycle must contain at least ﬁve people, i.e. g ≥ 5 I claim that Pi is not friends with Pj if |i − j| ̸= 1 mod g. Without loss of generality, suppose P1 is friends with Pj for some j ̸= 2, j ̸= g. Consider the set of vertices (P1, · · · , Pj) and (P1, Pj, Pj+1, · · · , Pg). These are both cycles and the sum of the the two sets is j + (g − j + 2) = g + 2, which is odd. Therefore, one of these cycles is odd, and smaller than g. This contradicts the minimality of g. I claim that every person outside of the cycle is friends with at most two people inside the cycle. Suppose there exists a person A outside of the cycle who is friends with three people in the cycle, say Pi, Pj, Pk with i < j < k. Note that no two of Pi, Pj, Pk are friends, since otherwise, A and these two people are three mutual friends, which is not allowed. Consider the cycle drawn as a graph with Pi, Pj, Pk appearing in clockwise order. Let x be the distance of the path between Pi and Pj on the cycle not containing Pk. Deﬁne y, z analogously. Therefore, x + y + z = g. Since no two of Pi, Pj, Pk are friends, x, y, z > 1. Therefore, max{x, y, z} < g−2. Since g is odd, at least one of x, y, z is odd. Without loss of generality, sup- pose x is odd. Then APiPi+1 · · · PjA is an odd cycle of length x + 2 < g, contradicting the minimality of g. Therefore, every person outside of the cycle is friends with at most two people inside the cycle. Hence, the number of pairs of friends with one person in the pair in the cycle and the other person in the pair outside of the cycle, is at most 2(n − g). Therefore, there exists a person inside the cycle who is friends with at most 2(n−g) g friends outside of the cycle. Since this person is friends with exactly two people inside the cycle, this person is friends with at most 2(n−g) g +2 = 2n g ≤ 2n 5 , since g ≥ 5, as desired. □ Source: Unknown Comments: Knowledge in graph theory is of utmost importance to have to solve this problem.
