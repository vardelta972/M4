We direct the interested reader to the splendid collection of problems, Straight From The Book. Here, however, we will be covering diﬀerent techniques in inequalities than normal, namely, the separation technique, the tangent ﬁgure trick, Cauchy ﬂipping, integration reduction in inequalities, and denominator nulliﬁcation. Note that none of these are standard names, so do not cite them in an olympiad! 3 2 The Separation Technique 2.1 Introduction Often times in olympiad inequalities, if the problem is homogenous, or has a condition that can easily homogenize the inequality (ex. abc = 1), we can homogenize the problem and then bash with Muirhead and Schur. However, some inequalities resist all attempts at homogenization, and some are even unhomogenizable. If problems have intractable conditions like a2 + b2 + c2 + abc = 4 or in fact none at all, the resulting problems can be extremely diﬃcult, and dealing with them can be nearly impossible. 2.2 A motivating example Consider the following heterogenous inequality, proposed by Ahann Rugata: Example 2.1. a2 + b2 + c2 + 2abc + 1 ≥ 2(ab + bc + ca), where a, b, c > 0. Solution. WLOG b and c are on the same side of 1 so (b − 1)(c − 1) ≥ 0 (a2 + b2 + c2 + 2abc + 1) − (2ab + 2ac + 2bc) = 2abc − 2ab − 2ac + 2a + b2 − 2bc + c2 + a2 − 2a + 1 = 2a(b − 1)(c − 1) + (b − c) 2 + (a − 1) 2 ≥ 0. The key step in the previous problem is that we randomly assume that two of a, b, and c are on the same side of a number. This concept allows us to deal with abc, which otherwise would cause many problems in sharp inequalities. The problem is that the strongest symmetric inequality with abc is Schur’s inequality. Schur’s is a problem sometimes, because it is very weak compared to other inequalities. Next, we will present a very weird problem, as in that many appproaches fail. The condition seems completely intractable, yet the solution is still beautiful with the separation method. 4 Advanced Topics in Inequalities Wang, Kadaveru Page 5 2.3 A strange inequality Example 2.2. (Mathematical Reﬂections) Let a1, a2, · · · , an ∈ [0, 1] and c be a constant such that a1 + a2 + · · · + an = n + 1 − c. For any permutation b1, b2, · · · , bn of a1, a2, · · · , an, prove that we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ n + 1 − c2. This inequality is not particularly diﬃcult, but its condition is extremely strange. However, with the separation trick, this problem quickly becomes trivial. Solution. Once again, the diﬃculty is in lower bounding akbk. However, this is doable with the what else, the separation trick! For any akbk, we have that (ak − 1)(bk − 1) ≥ 0 because they are both less than one. Then, we have that akbk ≥ ak + bk − 1. Putting this back in, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + · · · + anbn ≥ (a1 + a2 · · · + an) + (b1 + b2 · · · + bn) − n = n + 2 − 2c Now it remains to prove that n + 2 − 2c ≥ n + 1 − c2 Fortunately, this is trivial as it reduces to (c − 1) 2 ≥ 0, so we are done. 2.4 Exercises Problem 2.1. (USAMO 2001/3) If a, b, and c are positive reals such that a2 + b2 + c2 + 2abc = 4, prove that 0 ≤ ab + ac + bc − abc ≤ 2. Problem 2.2. (Franklyn Wang, Akshaj Kadaveru) For all real numbers a, b, and c, prove that 4(1 + a2)(1 + b2)(1 + c2) ≥ 3(a + b + c) 2. Problem 2.3. (Vasc) Prove that if a, b, c ≥ 0 and x = a + 1 b , y = b + 1 c , z = c + 1 a , then xy + yz + zx ≥ 2 + x + y + z. 3 Tangent Figure Trick 3.1 Introduction The tangent ﬁgure trick is most often used when one side involves the sum of one-variable expres- sions. The technique involves bounding each expression with it’s tangent ﬁgure at the equality case. Usually this ﬁgure is a line, but other times polynomials or even strange, rational functions are needed! This technique will be made more clear with examples. 3.2 A motivating example Example 3.1. (USAMO 2003/5)∑ (2a+b+c)2 2a2+(b+c)2 ≤ 8 for positive real a, b, c. Solution. WLOG, assume a + b + c = 3. Then the LHS becomes ∑ (a+3)2 2a2+(3−a)2 = ∑ a2+6a+9 3a2−6a+9 = ∑ ( 1 3 + 8a+6 3a2−6a+9 ) . Notice 3a2 − 6a + 9 = 3(a − 1) 2 + 6 ≥ 6, so 8a+6 3a2−6a+9 ≤ 8a+6 6 . So ∑ (a+3)2 2a2+(3−a)2 ≤ ∑ ( 1 3 + 8a+6 6 ) = 1 + 8(a+b+c)+18 6 = 8 as desired. Motivation. The question is of course, what is the motivation for the constants used? The answer is that they are all derived from the local linear approximation, and that the derivative of the function at the equality case is used (in this case (a+3)2 2a2+(3−a)2 ). Let’s try writing this in a more instructive form: 8a+6 6 = 4(a−1) 3 + 8 3 Aha! Here, that (a − 1) serves as an extra number, and 4 3 is the slope of the line. In other words, the graph of the function lies entirely below this line, and this linearization quickly ﬁnishes. Nevertheless, remember that perhaps its not always a line that the function lies under. Maybe it is a complicated algebraic function. But in any case, this concept of locally bounding each term is very powerful, and is the idea behind the tangent ﬁgure trick and the related concept of isolated fudging. 6 Advanced Topics in Inequalities Wang, Kadaveru Page 7 3.3 Exercises Problem 3.1. (Titu Andresscu) Given that a, b, and c are positive reals such that a + b + c ≥ 3, prove that 1 a2 + b + c + 1 a + b2 + c + 1 a + b + c2 ≤ 1. Problem 3.2. (Japan 1997) Show that (a + b − c) 2 (a + b)2 + c2 + (b + c − a) 2 (b + c)2 + a2 + (c + a − b)2 (c + a)2 + b2 ≤ 3/5 where a, b, and c ∈ R +. Problem 3.3. (PuMaC 2014 Individual Finals A2) Given a, b, c ∈ R +, and that a2 + b2 + c2 = 3. Prove that 1 a3 + 2 + 1 b3 + 2 + 1 c3 + 2 ≥ 1. Problem 3.4. (Akshaj Kadaveru) Given that a, b, and c are positive reals such that a + b + c = 3, show that (2a2 + 3)(2b2 + 3)(2c2 + 3) ≥ 125 4 Cauchy Flipping 4.1 Introduction We return to an exercise from the previous chapter, using a radically diﬀerent strategy. 4.2 The Power of Cauchy Flipping Example 4.1. (PuMaC 2014 Individual Finals A2) Given a, b, c ∈ R +, and that a2+b2+c2 = 3. Prove that 1 a3 + 2 + 1 b3 + 2 + 1 c3 + 2 ≥ 1 Solution. (By Michael Kural) If we use AM − GM on the denominator (keeping in mind that the equality case is a = b = c = 1), we get a3 + 2 ≥ 3a, so 1 a3+2 ≤ 1 3a . However, this is going the wrong direction, so instead we try to move the fractions to the other side. The easiest way to do so is to subtract each fraction from 1: ∑ 1 a3 + 2 ≥ 1 ⇔ 2 ≥ ∑ 1 − 1 a3 + 2 ⇔ 2 ≥ ∑ 2a3 a3 + 2 ⇔ 1 ≥ ∑ a3 a3 + 2 and now we can use AM-GM as we would like. Since a3 + 2 ≥ 3a, ∑ a3 a3 + 2 ≤ ∑ a3 3a = 1 3 ∑ a2 = 1 so we’re done. 8 Advanced Topics in Inequalities Wang, Kadaveru Page 9 4.3 Exercises Problem 4.1. (Bulgaria) Let a, b, c be positive reals such that a + b + c = 3. Prove that a 1 + b2 + b 1 + c2 + c 1 + a2 ≥ 3 2 Problem 4.2. (T.Q. Anh) If a, b, c are positive reals such that ab + ac + bc = 3, prove that a 2a + b2 + b 2b + c2 + c 2c + a2 ≤ 1 5 Denominator Nulliﬁcation 5.1 Introduction One of the most diﬃcult parts of inequalities involving large amounts of fractions is when the denominators are not the same. Dealing with these inequalities usually requires clever Titu’s lemma or smoothing. Yet sometimes, wishfully thinking is good. If we can modify all the denominators to be the same thing, we can multiply it out. This idea seems trivial, but the problems it can solve are far from trivial! 5.2 An IMO/3 Example 5.1. (IMO 2005/3) Let x, y, z be three positive reals such that xyz ≥ 1. Prove that x5 − x2 x5 + y2 + z2 + y5 − y2 x2 + y5 + z2 + z5 − z2 x2 + y2 + z5 ≥ 0. Taking the negative and adding 3, we have x2 + y2 + z2 x5 + y2 + z2 + x2 + y2 + z2 x2 + y5 + z2 + x2 + y2 + z2 x2 + y2 + z5 ≤ 3. Normally, we would never induce an ≤ sign, but in denominator nulliﬁcation, this is required. Our sacriﬁce is richly rewarded. Making the denominators equal, we have (x5 + y2 + z2)( 1 x + y2 + z2) ≥ (x2 + y2 + z2) 2 So x2 + y2 + z2 x5 + y2 + z2 ≤ (x2 + y2 + z2)( 1 x + y2 + z2) (x2 + y2 + z2)2 = 1 x + y2 + z2 (x2 + y2 + z2) The ﬁnish is now clear. Summing over, it suﬃces to prove that 1 x + 1 y + 1 z x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 1 Fortunately, this is trivial as it reduces to 10 Advanced Topics in Inequalities Wang, Kadaveru Page 11 1 x + 1 y + 1 z x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ (xyz)( 1 x + 1 y + 1 z ) x2 + y2 + z2 = xy + yz + xz x2 + y2 + z2 ≤ 1 where the last step is straightforward. 5.3 Exercises Problem 5.1. (Tuan Le) Prove that for xyz ≥ 1, and x, y, z ∈ R +, the following inequality holds: x x3 + y2 + z + y y3 + z2 + x + z z3 + x2 + y ≤ 1 6 Inequality Separation 6.1 Introduction Frequently, inequalities on one side are just sums or products of functions, while the other side is more symmetrical. Many strategies have been concocted to deal with these diﬃcult inequalities, such as isolated fudging and the tangent ﬁgure trick, but usually the best approach is quite a bit diﬀerent: Working backwards from the symmetric part. Heuristically speaking, if our inequality is proving f (x)f (y)f (z) ≥ g, we want to reduce the problem to proving f (x) ≥ k(x), where it is easy to somehow show that k(x)k(y)k(z) ≥ g. This is best demonstrated through an example. 6.2 A Diﬃcult Problem Example 6.1. (USAMO 2004/5) Let a, b, c > 0. Prove that (a 5−a2+3)(b5−b2+3)(c5−c2+3) ≥ (a + b + c)3. 12 Advanced Topics in Inequalities Wang, Kadaveru Page 13 Solution. It is easy to see that by Holder’s inequality, (a3 + 1 + 1)(1 + b3 + 1)(1 + 1 + c3) ≥ (a + b + c)3 so it suﬃces to show that a5 − a2 + 3 ≥ 2 + a 3 Fortunately, this is trivial as a2 and a3 are always on the same side of one and this inequtality reduces to (a3 − 1)(a2 − 1) ≥ 0 which is immediate. Motivation. There are two key steps in this problem. One of them is the use of Holder’s on (a3 + 2)(b3 + 2)(c3 + 2) ≥ (a + b + c)3. Keep this in mind! It will come back on the exercises, so be wary. Another one is the whole idea of separation into factors. 6.3 Exercises Problem 6.1. (APMO 2004/5) (a 2 + 2) (b2 + 2) (c2 + 2) ≥ 9 (ab + bc + ca) holds for all positive reals a, b, c. Problem 6.2. (Vasc) Prove the inequality a3+1 a2+1 · b3+1 b2+1 · c3+1 c2+1 · d3+1 d2+1 ≥ abcd+1 2 for a, b, c, d ∈ R+.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
