It is based on the properties of the derivative operator d dx , deﬁned by d dx f (x) = lim h→0 f (x + h) − f (x) h On the other hand, we can obtain an entirely diﬀerent type of calculus by restricting ourselves to positive integer values for h. In this case, the closest we can get to 0 is h = 1, so we’ll deﬁne the diﬀerence operator ∆ by ∆f (x) = f (x + 1) − f (x) In calculus classes, one of the ﬁrst things taught is the derivative of f (x) = x n. In this case, d dx f (x) = nx n−1. Unfortunately, the same result does not hold true for the ∆ operator; if we try it, we’ll get stuﬀ like ∆(x 4) = 4x 3 + 6x 2 + 4x + 1. However, there is a type of n-th power which has a nice discrete derivative: the falling n-th powers. These are deﬁned by x n = x(x − 1) · · · (x − n + 1) for integers n ≥ 0. By deﬁnition, x 0 = 1. Notice that this is closely related to the factorial function n!, as n! = nn. Looking at the discrete derivative, we see ∆(x n) = (x + 1) n − x n = (x + 1)x(x − 1) · · · (x − n + 2) − x(x − 1) · · · (x − n + 1) = nx(x − 1) · · · (x − n + 2) Hence, we obtain a “derivative of a power” rule: ∆(x n) = nx n−1. We can also obtain linearity rules ∆(αf (x) + βg(x) = α∆f (x) + β∆g(x) as well as product rules: ∆(f (x)g(x)) = f (x + 1)g(x + 1) − f (x)g(x) = f (x + 1)g(x + 1) − f (x)g(x + 1) + f (x)g(x + 1) − f (x)g(x) = f (x)[g(x + 1) − g(x)] + g(x + 1)[f (x + 1) − f (x)] = f (x)∆g(x) + g(x + 1)∆f (x) We can put this into a slightly less messy form by deﬁning E f (x) := f (x + 1) so that we get ∆(f g) = f ∆g + Eg∆f. 1 1.1 Discrete Integration All of this is nice and good, but we’d like to do more. Inﬁnite calculus has a fundamental theorem relating the derivative to the integral: ∫ b a f (x) dx = F (b) − F (a) where F ′(x) = f (x). Thus, we should expect to have a fundamental theorem relating these (dis- crete) diﬀerences to (discrete) sums. Indeed, we’ll say b∑ a f (x) δx = F (b) − F (a) where ∆(F ) = f . What is this discrete integral or “anti-diﬀerence”? We’ll deﬁne it so that several important facts hold: a∑ a f (x) δx = 0 and a+1∑ a f (x) δx = F (a + 1) − F (a) = ∆F = f (a). This forces us to take, in general, the deﬁnite discrete sum to mean an ordinary sum excluding the value at the upper limit. b∑ a f (x) δx = b−1∑ k=a f (k) So now what can we do with this discrete integration operator? Well, we can start oﬀ by looking at how it behaves on our falling powers. The power rule discussed earlier implies that b∑ a x n δx = xn+1 n + 1 \f \f \f \f \f b a ⇒ m−1∑ k=0 kn = mn+1 n + 1 . As an example, this gives us an easy way to derive the formula for the sum of n squares (or cubes, fourth powers, etc.). Since k2 = k(k − 1) + k = k2 + k1, we have that n−1∑ k=0 k2 = n3 3 + n2 2 = n(n − 1)(2n − 1) 6 Setting n − 1 → n gives us the familiar formula n(n + 1)(2n + 1) 6 for the sum of the ﬁrst n squares. 2 Finite diﬀerences on polynomials First, we need the following result, which is easily proven by induction on n: Theorem 2.1. Any polynomial P ∈ R[x] of degree n can be written in the form n∑ k=0 ak (x k ), where a0, a1, · · · , an are nonnegative integers and an ̸= 0. For any polynomial P and nonzero real number a, let ∆aP be the polynomial deﬁned by (∆aP )(x) = P (x + a) − P (x). For a = 1, we get the “standard” ﬁnite diﬀerence operator ∆. The main reason we like to apply ﬁnite diﬀerences to polynomials is that: Theorem 2.2. For a nonconstant polynomial P , deg(∆aP ) = deg(P ) − 1. 2 Proof. Let n = deg P . First, we deﬁne the polynomial Q(x) = P (ax), so that (∆aP )(ax) = (∆Q)(x). It is clear that deg Q = n. Then, we write Q(x) = n∑ k=0 ak (x k ), where a0, a1, · · · , an are nonnegative integers and an ̸= 0. We have ∆(x k ) = ( x k − 1 ) for k > 0 and ∆(x 0 ) = 0, so ∆Q(x) = n∑ k=1 ak ( x k − 1 ), which has degree n − 1. Therefore, deg(∆aP ) = deg(∆Q) = n − 1 = deg(P ) − 1. What this means is that induction and ﬁnite diﬀerences are often seen together. It also means that if P has degree n, then ∆n+1P is the zero polynomial, where ∆n+1P represents ∆ applied to P n + 1 times. It is also worth knowing that for a positive integer k, (∆ kP )(x) (∆ applied to P k times) is equal to k∑ j=0 (k j )(−1) k−jP (x + j). This, again, is easily proven by induction. 3 Problems 1.
