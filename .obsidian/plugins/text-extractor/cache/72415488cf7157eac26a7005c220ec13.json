Divisibility: • If a | b then |a| ≤ |b|. Inequalities are useful! • Division and GCDs: Euclidean algorithm, ax + by = k(a, b). • For any positive integers a and b, we can write a = cx, b = cy where c = (a, b) and (x, y) = 1. 2. Primes • p | ab iﬀ p | a or p | b. • Unique Factorization. • Inﬁnitely many primes. • Bertrand’s Postulate: there is a prime between n and 2n inclusive. • Dirichlet’s theorem: Inﬁnitely many primes in arithmetic progressions where (a, d) = 1. 3. Modular Arithmetic • Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division • Multiplicative Inverses & Complete Residue Sets • Powers and Fermat’s Little Theorem, ϕ and Euler’s extension • Chinese Remainder Theorem • Z/pZ is a ﬁnite ﬁeld. • x2 = −1 mod p has a solution iﬀ p ≡ 1 (mod 4). • Quadratic Reciprocity. 1 MOP 2010, Blue Group Mods & Divisibility June 9, 2010 Examples 1. Prove that x2 + y2 + z2 = 7w2 has no solutions in integers. 2 (Czech-Polish-Slovak ’02). Let n be a positive integer and p a prime such that n divides p − 1 and p divides n3 − 1. Prove that 4p − 3 is a square. 3 (ELMO ’00). Let a be a positive integer and let p be a prime. Prove that there exists an integer m such that mmm ≡ a (mod p). 4. Let fn be the nth Fibonacci number. (We use the convention f0 = 0, f1 = 1.) Prove that gcd(fn, fm) = fgcd(m,n). Problems 5 (APMO 2002). Find all positive integers a and b such that a2 + b b2 − a and b2 + a a2 − b are both integers. 6 (Russia ’01). Find all primes p and q such that p + q = (p − q) 3. 7 (Russia ’01). Let a and b be distinct positive integers such that ab(a+b) is divisible by a2+ab+b2: Prove that |a − b| > 3√ab. 8 (Bulgaria ’07). Let p = 4k + 3 be a prime number. Find the number of diﬀerent residues modulo p of (x2 + y2) 2, where gcd(x, p) = gcd(y, p) = 1. 9 (MOP 2001). How many ordered quadruples (x, y, z, w) are there with x2 + y2 = z3 + w3 (mod 37)? 10 (Japan ’01). Let p be a prime number and m a positive integer. Show that there exists a positive integer n such that there exist m consecutive zeroes in the decimal representation of pn. 11 (Bulgaria ’01). Let p be a prime number congruent to 3 modulo 4, and consider the equation (p + 2)x2 − (p + 1)y2 + px + (p + 2)y = 1. Prove that this equation has inﬁnitely many solutions in positive integers, and show that if (x, y) = (x0, y0). is a solution of the equation in positive integers, then p | x0. 12. Natural numbers a, b and c are pairwise distinct and satisfy a|b+c+bc, b|c+a+ca, c|a+b+ab. Prove that at least one of the numbers a, b, c is not prime. 13 (Bulgaria 2001). Find all triples of positive integers (a, b, c) such that a3 + b3 + c3 is divisible by a2b, b2c, and c2a. 2 MOP 2010, Blue Group Mods & Divisibility June 9, 2010 14 (IMO 2000). Determine if there exists a number n such that n has exactly 2000 prime divisors and 2 n + 1 is divisible by n. 15 (MOP 2004). Let m and n be positive integers such that 2 m divides the number n(n + 1). Prove that 2 2m−2 divides the number 1 k + 2 k + ... + nk for all positive odd integers k with k > 1. 16 (CGMO ’03). Let n be a positive integer. Prove that at most half the divisors of n have last digit equal to 3. 17. Determine all positive integers n for which there exists an integer m such that 2 n − 1 is a divisor of m2 + 9. 18. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be positive integers. Show that ∏ i<j ai − aj i − j is an integer. 19 (IMO 2003). Determine all pairs of positive integers (a, b) such that a2 2ab2−b3+1 is a positive integer. 20 (China, 2002). Sequence {an} satisﬁes: a1 = 3, a2 = 7, a2 n + 5 = an−1an+1, n ≥ 2. If an + (−1) n is prime, prove that there exists a nonnegative integer m such that n = 3 m. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
