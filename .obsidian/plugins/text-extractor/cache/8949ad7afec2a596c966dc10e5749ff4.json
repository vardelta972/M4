The roots (solutions) of a quadratic polynomial are x1,2 = −b ± √b2 − 4ac 2a 1. Vieta’s Theorem: ax2 + bx + c = a(x − x1)(x − x2) where x1, x2 are the roots. Therefore: x1 + x2 = − b a , x1x2 = c a 2. Discriminant: The discriminant of an equation ax2 + bx + c is D = b2 − 4ac. The equation has two real roots if D > 0, one real root if D = 0, and no real roots if D < 0. 3. Factoring: Sometimes factoring an equation simpliﬁes it greatly. Problems 1.
