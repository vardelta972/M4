Prove that the positive integers n that cannot be written as a sum of r consecutive positive integers, with r > 1, are of the form n = 2l for some l ≥ 0. 2. Let f : (0, ∞) → R be deﬁned by f (x) = lim n→∞ cosn� 1 nx �. (a) Show that f has exactly one point of discontinuity. (b) Evaluate f at its point of discontinuity. 3. Let Ω = {z = x + iy ∈ C : |y| ≤ 1}. If f (z) = z2 + 2, then draw a sketch of f (Ω) = {f (z) : z ∈ Ω}. Justify your answer. 4. Let f : R → R be a twice diﬀerentiable function such that 1 2y � x+y x−y f (t) dt = f (x), for all x ∈ R, y > 0. Show that there exist a, b ∈ R such that f (x) = ax + b for all x ∈ R. 5. A subset S of the plane is called convex if given any two points x and y in S, the line segment joining x and y is contained in S. A quadrilateral is called convex if the region enclosed by the edges of the quadrilateral is a convex set. Show that given a convex quadrilateral Q of area 1, there is a rectangle R of area 2 such that Q can be drawn inside R. 1 UGB 2019 6. For all natural numbers n, let An = � 2 − � 2 + � 2 + · · · + √2 (n many radicals). (a) Show that for n ≥ 2, An = 2 sin π 2n+1 . (b) Hence, or otherwise, evaluate the limit lim n→∞ 2 nAn. 7. Let f be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Deﬁne a1 = f (0), a2 = f (a1) = f �f (0)�, and an = f (an−1) for n ≥ 3. If there exists a natural number k ≥ 3 such that ak = 0, then prove that either a1 = 0 or a2 = 0. 8. Consider the following subsets of the plane: C1 = {(x, y) : x > 0, y = 1 x } and C2 = {(x, y) : x < 0, y = −1 + 1 x }. Given any two points P = (x, y) and Q = (u, v) of the plane, their distance d(P, Q) is deﬁned by d(P, Q) = � (x − u)2 + (y − v)2. Show that there exists a unique choice of points P0 ∈ C1 and Q0 ∈ C2 such that d(P0, Q0) ≤ d(P, Q) for all P ∈ C1 and Q ∈ C2. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
