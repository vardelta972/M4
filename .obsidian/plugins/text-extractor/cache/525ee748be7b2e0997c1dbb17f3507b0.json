Determinants are introduced, together with ways in which to calculate them. These concepts are particularly relevant in analytic geometry, where we use them to describe projective transformations. Linear transformations Linear transformations are transformations of n-dimensional Euclidean space \u0000n expressible as x \u0000 M x, where x \u0000 \u0000x1, x2, …, xn\u0000 is the position vector of a point X . M is known as the transformation matrix. For example, the linear transformation with matrix 1 1 0 1 is shown below. O The position of the origin, O, is left unchanged by a linear transformation. Degree-d algebraic curves remain as degree-d algebraic curves; in particular, lines map to lines and conics map to conics. In the shear shown above, a circle is transformed into an ellipse. Parallel lines remain parallel when linear transformations are applied. Finally, the (signed) area of any shape is multiplied by det\u0000M \u0000 when the transformation is applied, where det\u0000M \u0000 is the determinant of the transformation matrix. Hence, ratios of areas remain unchanged. Common linear transformations include rotations (about the origin), reflections (in lines through the origin), dilations (where the origin is the centre of homothety) and stretches (again, preserving the origin). One can combine transformations by multiplying their matrices. 1. Let A \u0000 \u00001, 0, 0\u0000, B \u0000 \u00000, 1, 0\u0000 and C \u0000 \u00000, 0, 1\u0000 be three points in \u00003. After applying the transformation with matrix M \u0000 a b c d e f g h i , find the new locations of A, B and C. Consider the unit cube \u00000, 1\u0000\u0000 \u00000, 1\u0000\u0000\u00000, 1\u0000, where \u0000 denotes Cartesian product. It is transformed into a paral- lelepiped with volume V \u0000 det\u0000M \u0000. In the diagram above, the blue cube is transformed into the red parallelepiped. The origin (the common vertex of the cube and parallelepiped) remains fixed. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Determinants The determinant of a square matrix M is a positive real number det\u0000M \u0000 associated with that matrix. It behaves like the norm of a complex number, in that it is multiplicative. \u0000 For two square matrices A and B of equal dimension, det\u0000A B\u0000 \u0000 det\u0000A\u0000 det\u0000B\u0000. [Multiplicativity of determinants] If a matrix A has an inverse matrix A\u00001 such that A A\u00001 \u0000 A\u00001 A \u0000 I, then det\u0000A\u0000 det\u0000A\u00001\u0000 \u0000 det\u0000I\u0000 \u0000 1. Hence, it is clear that a matrix with a determinant of zero has no inverse. Indeed, the converse is also true: all square matrices with non-zero determinants possess unique well-defined inverses. If a matrix is one-dimensional, then its determinant is equal to its only element. Otherwise, we compute it recursively. M \u0000 a1,1 a1,2 \u0000 a1,n a2,1 a2,2 \u0000 a2,n \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 an,1 an,2 \u0000 an,n Consider the matrix above. We compute the determinant using the following process: \u0000 For some 1 \u0000 i \u0000 n, consider the element ai,1 in the first column of M . \u0000 The \u0000n \u0000 1\u0000-dimensional matrix Mi is obtained by removing everything in the same row or column as ai,1. \u0000 Compute the value Si \u0000 ai,1 det\u0000Mi\u0000. \u0000 Then, we have det\u0000M \u0000 \u0000 S1 \u0000 S2 \u0000 S3 \u0000 S4 \u0000 … \u0000 \u0000\u00001\u0000 n\u00001 Sn. This recursion results in the determinant equating to a sum of n \u0000 terms, each of which is a product of n elements of M . After expanding this somewhat complicated recursive definition, we reach a more elegant formulation. \u0000 det\u0000M \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 sym \u0000\u00001\u0000P\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000a1,\u0000\u00001\u0000 a2,\u0000\u00002\u0000 … an,\u0000\u0000n\u0000\u0000, where the sum is taken over all permutations \u0000 of \u00001, 2, 3, …, n\u0000. We define P\u0000\u0000\u0000 to be even if \u0000 is an even permutation, and odd otherwise. [Leibniz formula for determinants] 2. Express det x y z z x y y z x as a polynomial in x, y, z. You may have noticed that for 3 \u00003 determinants, the even permutations correspond to the three NW-SE ‘diagonals’ and the odd permutations correspond to the three NE-SW ‘diagonals’. The diagonals are considered to wrap around the edges of the matrix as though it were a cylinder. This trick is known as the Rule of Sarrus. a d g b e h c f i a d g b e h c f i a e i \u0000 b f g \u0000 c d h \u0000a f h \u0000 b d i \u0000 c e g Leibniz’s formula requires n\u0000n \u0000\u0000 elementary operations, so is rather time-consuming for large matrices, taking exponential time. Instead, it helps to simplify the calculation by performing operations on the matrix. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Applying elementary operations to the rows or columns of M cause its determinant to behave in a predictable manner: \u0000 Multiplying any row or column of M by x causes the determinant of M to be multiplied by x; \u0000 Adding (or subtracting) any multiple of one row to another row does not affect the determinant of M ; \u0000 Swapping any two rows causes det\u0000M \u0000 to be multiplied by \u00001; \u0000 The transpose of M has the same determinant as M . This can also be used to easily factorise the determinants of matrices. 3. Factorise det 1 1 1 x y z x3 y3 z3 into four linear factors. Interpolating curves The determinant of a matrix is zero if and only if one row can be expressed as a linear combination of the others. This is known as linear dependence. This enables one to create a curve of some type (e.g. a polynomial, circle or conic) interpolating between various points. For example, if we have a sequence of n points \u0000xi, yi\u0000, then the following curve is a degree-\u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 polynomial passing through all n points. \u0000 The curve det 1 y x x2 x3 \u0000 xn\u00001 1 y1 x1 x12 x13 \u0000 x1n\u00001 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1 yn xn xn2 xn3 \u0000 xnn\u00001 \u0000 0 passes through all points \u0000xi, yi\u0000. [Lagrange interpolating polynomial] This is obvious, as the determinant equals zero if two rows are identical. It is also a degree-\u0000n \u0000 1\u0000 polynomial, as we can use the recursive determinant formula to express it as A1 \u0000 A2 y \u0000 A3 x \u0000 A4 x2 \u0000 A5 x3 \u0000 … \u0000 An\u00001 xn\u00001 and rearrange it. If A2 \u0000 0 then this method will fail, but that only occurs if two points have the same abscissa. Using this idea, we can create a unique conic passing through any 5 points in general position, a cubic passing through 9 points et cetera. If the points are not in general position, then seemingly paradoxical things can occur. This forms the basis of the powerful Cayley-Bacharach theorem explored in the projective geometry chapter. The general equation of a conic is A \u0000 B x \u0000 C y \u0000 D x2 \u0000 E y2 \u0000 F x y \u0000 0, so we can determine the equation of the conic passing through five given points. \u0000 The conic 1 x y x2 y2 x y 1 x1 y1 x12 y12 x1 y1 1 x2 y2 x22 y22 x2 y2 1 x3 y3 x32 y32 x3 y3 1 x4 y4 x42 y42 x4 y4 1 x5 y5 x52 y52 x5 y5 \u0000 0 passes through all points \u0000xi, yi\u0000. [Interpolating conic] Circles also have a simple characterisation in Cartesian coordinates. 4. Find the equation of the circle passing through the non-collinear points \u0000x1, y1\u0000, \u0000x2, y2\u0000 and \u0000x3, y3\u0000. [Circumcircle equation] The determinant formula is not constrained to Cartesian coordinates; it can be used to find interpolating curves in any coordinate system, such as projective homogeneous coordinates, areal coordinates, complex numbers and even polar coordinates. As we cover the other coordinate systems in greater depth later in the book, it is worth messing around with polar coordinates here. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 P r O \u0000 \u0000 The point with polar coordinates P \u0000 \u0000r, \u0000\u0000 in the Euclidean plane is defined such that O P has length r and makes an angle of \u0000 with the positive x-axis. In Cartesian coordinates, P \u0000 \u0000r cos \u0000, r sin \u0000\u0000. [Definition of polar coordinates] Although the value of r is uniquely defined, \u0000 is not; adding or subtracting multiples of 2 \u0000 will describe the same point. This is a consequence of the periodicity of the elementary trigonometric functions. 5. Let Q \u0000 \u0000r1, \u00001\u0000 be a point on the polar plane. Show that the equation of the circle with centre Q and radius a is given by r2 \u0000 r12 \u0000 2 r r1 cos\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u00001\u0000 \u0000 a2. [Polar equation of a circle] 6. Hence show that a circle has general equation A r2 \u0000 B r cos \u0000 \u0000 C r sin \u0000 \u0000 D \u0000 0. [General polar equation of a circle] It now becomes more obvious why this should work: the general equation for a circle in Cartesian coordinates is A\u0000x2 \u0000 y2\u0000 \u0000 B x \u0000 C y \u0000 D \u0000 0, and we have x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 r2, x \u0000 r cos \u0000 and y \u0000 r sin \u0000. 7. Find the equation, in polar coordinates, of the circle passing through the non-collinear points \u0000r1, \u00001\u0000, \u0000r2, \u00002\u0000 and \u0000r3, \u00003\u0000. [Circumcircle equation for polar coordinates] If three of the points are collinear, the term in r2 vanishes and we are left with the equation of a line. A curve which is particularly amenable to expressing in polar coordinates is the Archimedean spiral. If the spiral is centred on the origin, then it has polar equation r \u0000 h 2 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000. h is the separation between successive turns of the spiral, and \u0000 is the angle at which is emerges from the origin. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 8. Find the equation for an Archimedean spiral of centre O passing through \u0000r1, \u00001\u0000 and \u0000r2, \u00002\u0000. [Interpolating spiral] Adding multiples of 2 \u0000 to either of the angles can alter the number of turns on the spiral and its direction. There is not a unique interpolating spiral with centre O passing through two given points; there are countably infinitely many. Geometric transformations So far, we have considered linear transformations. If we compose an arbitrary linear transformation with an arbitrary translation, then we obtain an affine transformation. Affine transformations have all the geometric properties of linear transformations, but do not necessarily preserve the origin. They are a special case of projec- tive transformations, which are covered in a later chapter. Projective Affine Linear Similarities Möbius Congruences Translations Homotheties Affine transformations are projective transformations which preserve the line at infinity. Linear transformations also preserve the origin, whereas similarities preserve (or reverse) the circular points at infinity (thus mapping circles to circles). Congruences are similarities with a determinant of \u00001, whereas homotheties are similarities which preserve the direction of all lines (thus all points on the line at infinity). Translations (and reflections in a point) lie in the intersection of congruences and homotheties. Do not worry if these terms are unfamiliar to you; they are explained properly in later chapters. Scalar product Let a \u0000 a1 a2 a3 , b \u0000 b1 b2 b3 and c \u0000 c1 c2 c3 be three vectors in \u00003. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 The dot product (or inner product, or scalar product) a \u0000 b \u0000 a1 b1 \u0000 a2 b2 \u0000 a3 b3 \u0000 a b cos \u0000, where \u0000 is the angle between the vectors a and b. [Definition of dot product] The dot product is commutative and distributive, so a \u0000b \u0000 b \u0000a and a \u0000 \u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000 a \u0000b \u0000 a \u0000c. 9. Prove that, for every triangle A B C , we have a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2 \u0000 2 b c cos A. [Law of cosines] The dot product generalises to vectors in \u0000n. This allows us to interchange between trigonometric, geometric and algebraic inequalities. \u0000 The following three statements are all equivalent: \u0000 cos \u0000 \u0000 1, with equality if and only if \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 n for some integer n; \u0000 a \u0000 b \u0000 a b , with equality if and only if the vectors have the same direction; \u0000 a1 b1 \u0000 a2 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 an bn \u0000 a12 \u0000 a22 \u0000 … \u0000 an2 b12 \u0000 b22 \u0000 … \u0000 bn2 , with equality if and only if ai \u0000 \u0000 bi for some scalar \u0000 \u0000 \u00000, \u0000\u0000. [Cauchy-Schwarz inequality] We can generalise the idea of a vector to a more abstract object, and thus extend the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality even further. See Introduction to Inequalities (Bradley) for an example of this. Another application of the dot product in inequalities is a proof of the rearrangement inequality. That states that if we have two non-negative sequences of equal length and multiply corresponding terms, the product is greatest when the sequences are sorted in the same order. \u0000 Suppose that a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 an \u0000 0 and b1 \u0000 b2 \u0000 … \u0000 bn \u0000 0 are two decreasing sequences of non-negative integers. Then \u0000 n i\u00001 ai bi \u0000 \u0000 n i\u00001 ai b\u0000\u0000i\u0000 for any permutation \u0000. [Rearrangement inequality] Proof: We can prove this by considering the vectors a and b in the space \u0000n. Observe that all n \u0000 vectors in \u0000b\u0000\u0000 (the set of vectors obtained by permuting the elements of b) are of equal length, so lie on a sphere with centre 0. The dot product \u0000 n i\u00001 ai b\u0000\u0000i\u0000 of the vectors a and b\u0000 is greatest when the angle between them is smallest, which occurs when a and b\u0000 are closest (as all vectors in \u0000b\u0000\u0000 are of equal length). So, this has been converted into the equivalent problem of proving that b is the closest vector to a in \u0000b\u0000\u0000. We consider the Voronoi diagram of \u0000n, which is simply a division of space depending on which b\u0000 is closest. The diagrams above illustrate the cases when n \u0000 2 or n \u0000 3. The Voronoi diagram is created by the set of planes of the form xi \u0000 x j, which each partition space into the regions xi \u0000 x j and xi \u0000 x j. This means that the regions of the Voronoi diagram are determined by the ordering of the elements; in the case where n \u0000 3, we have six tetrahe- dral regions, namely x1 \u0000 x2 \u0000 x3 and the five other permutations. As the elements of a and b are ordered in the same way, they must inhabit the same region. Hence, b is the closest vector in \u0000b\u0000\u0000 to a, and we are finished. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Vector and triple products So far, we are able to ‘multiply’ two vectors in \u0000n, resulting in a scalar. We can also define a vector (cross) product, which is specific to \u00003. (There is also a 7-dimensional version based on the octonion algebra, but that is outside the scope of the book.) \u0000 The cross product (or vector product, or exterior product) a b \u0000 a2 b3 \u0000 a3 b2 a3 b1 \u0000 a1 b3 a1 b2 \u0000 a2 b1 \u0000 det i a1 b1 j a2 b2 k a3 b3 , where i, j, k are the unit vectors 1 , 0 and 0 , respectively. [Definition of cross product] The cross product is anti-commutative and distributive, so a b \u0000 \u0000b a and a \u0000b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000 a b \u0000 a c. The vector a b is perpendicular to both a and b, and its magnitude is equal to the area of the parallelogram with vertices \u00000, a, b, a \u0000 b\u0000. Finally, we define the scalar triple product, which is the volume of the parallelepiped with vertices \u00000, a, b, c, a \u0000 b, b \u0000 c, c \u0000 a, a \u0000 b \u0000 c\u0000. \u0000 a \u0000 \u0000b c\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a b\u0000 \u0000 c \u0000 det a1 b1 c1 a2 b2 c2 a3 b3 c3 . [Scalar triple product] Sir William Rowan Hamilton once had an epiphany whilst crossing a bridge, and carved the formula \u00002 \u0000 \u00002 \u0000 k2 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 k \u0000 \u00001 into one of the stones. This defines an extension to the complex numbers, which has four orthogonal units (1, \u0000, \u0000, k) as opposed to two. A Hamiltonian quaternion is a number of the form w \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000 y \u0000 \u0000 z k, where w, x, y, z \u0000 \u0000. Using a slight abuse of notation, this can be written as w \u0000 x y . A scalar added to a vector?! We can multiply two quaternions p \u0000 a \u0000 b and q \u0000 c \u0000 d together to give the quaternion p q \u0000 \u0000a c \u0000 b \u0000 d\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a d \u0000 c b \u0000 b d\u0000. Multiplication of quaternions is associative and distributive, but not commutative; p q ! q p in general. This is inherited from the non-commutativity of the cross product. The quaternion w \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000 y \u0000 \u0000 z k has a norm of w 2 \u0000 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 . As with complex numbers, p q \u0000 p q for any p, q \u0000 \u0000, where \u0000 is the set of all quaternions. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. Using matrix multiplication, we get A \u0000 a d g , B \u0000 b e h and C \u0000 c f . 2. det x y z z x y y z x \u0000 x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z, as the NW-SE diagonals are x3, y3, z3 and the NE-SW diagonals are each x y z. 3. We deduct the first column from the other two, obtaining det 1 0 0 x y \u0000 x z \u0000 x x3 y3 \u0000 x3 z3 \u0000 x3 . Applying the recursion formula reduces this to det y \u0000 x z \u0000 x y3 \u0000 x3 z3 \u0000 x3 . We then divide the first column by y \u0000 x and multiply the entire determinant by y \u0000 x, obtaining \u0000y \u0000 x\u0000 det 1 z \u0000 x y2 \u0000 x2 \u0000 x y z3 \u0000 x3 . Applying a similar factorisation to the second column results in \u0000y \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000z \u0000 x\u0000 det 1 1 x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 x y x2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 x z . Leibniz’s formula can now be used to expand the determinant, giving \u0000y \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000z \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000x y \u0000 x z \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2\u0000. The quadratic factorises to \u0000y \u0000 z\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u0000, so the entire determinant is equal to \u0000y \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000z \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000y \u0000 z\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u0000. 4. det 1 x y x2 \u0000 y2 1 x1 y1 x12 \u0000 y12 1 x2 y2 x22 \u0000 y22 1 x3 y3 x32 \u0000 y32 \u0000 0 will suffice, as the general equation for a circle is A \u0000 B x \u0000 C y \u0000 D\u0000x2 \u0000 y2\u0000 \u0000 0. 5. Let P \u0000 \u0000r, \u0000\u0000 be a point on the circle, so P Q \u0000 a. By using the cosine rule, we have a2 \u0000 r2 \u0000 r12 \u0000 2 r r1 cos\u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u00001\u0000. 6. Using the compound angle formula, we get r2 \u0000 2 r r1 cos \u00001 cos \u0000 \u0000 2 r r1 sin \u00001 sin \u0000 \u0000 r12 \u0000 a2 \u0000 0. By altering \u00001 and r1, we can change the coefficients of r sin \u0000 and r cos \u0000 to anything. Similarly, altering a enables us to change the constant term. Multiplying out by a constant scaling factor enables the coefficient of r2 to be changed. Hence, the general equation is simply A r2 \u0000 B r cos \u0000 \u0000 C r sin \u0000 \u0000 D \u0000 0. 7. det 1 r2 r sin \u0000 r cos \u0000 1 r12 r1 sin \u0000 r1 cos \u0000 1 r22 r2 sin \u0000 r2 cos \u0000 1 r32 r3 sin \u0000 r3 cos \u0000 \u0000 0. 8. The general spiral has equation A \u0000 B r \u0000 C \u0000 \u0000 0, so an interpolating spiral is det 1 r \u0000 1 r1 \u00001 1 r2 \u00002 \u0000 0. 9. Consider the triangle O A B. \u0000 a \u0000 b 2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 a 2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 b 2\u0000 \u0000 2 a \u0000b. The last term equates to \u00002 a b cos \u0000. This is the cosine rule, as required. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
