Line up sequentially in height-order, and say “Cauchy.” 2. (Abel Summation) Suppose that we have (ak) n 1 and (bk) n 1 . Also, suppose that we deﬁne Sk = ∑k i=1 ai. Then: n∑ k=1 akbk = Snbn + n−1∑ k=1 Sk(bk − bk+1). 2 Problems 1. Calculate the sum ∑n k=1 k/(2 k). Solution: Split it into: n∑ 1 k 2k = n∑ k=1 n∑ i=k 1 2i . Now use geometric series summation to get 2 − 1/(2 n−1) − n/(2 n). 2. Prove that 16 < ∑80 k=1 1/ √k < 17. Solution: Divide the sum by 2, and then substitute the denominator with (√k + √k + 1), with appropriate adjustment for the two directions. 3. Let (ak) n 1 be a positive sequence. Let (bk) n 1 be a real sequence (not necessarily positive). Suppose that∑ i̸=j aibj = 0. Prove that ∑ i̸=j bibj ≤ 0. Solution: Let a = ∑ ak and b = ∑ bk. The given tells us that ab = ∑ akbk. The result is equivalent to b2 ≤ ∑ b2 k. By Cauchy-Schwarz: (ab) 2 = ( ∑ akbk) 2 ≤ ( ∑ a 2 k)( ∑ b2 k) ≤ a 2 ∑ b2 k, since (a) is positive. But then we get precisely that b2 ≤ ∑ b2 k. 4. Let (ak) n 1 and (bk) n 1 be two real sequences, and suppose that (bk) is nonnegative and decreasing. For k ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}, deﬁne Sk = ∑k i=1 ai. Let M = max{S1, . . . , Sn} and m = min{S1, . . . , Sn}. Prove that mb1 ≤ n∑ i=1 aibi ≤ M b1 1 5. Let (ak) n 1 and (bk) n 1 be two real sequences with (a) nonnegative and decreasing. Also suppose that ∑k i=1 ai ≤ ∑k i=1 bi for all k. Prove that ∑n i=1 a 2 i ≤ ∑n i=1 b2 i . Solution: Use Abel sum; get ∑ a 2 i ≤ Sbnan + ∑ Sbk(ak − ak+1) = ∑ bkak. But by Cauchy-Schwarz: ( ∑ bkak) 2 ≤ ( ∑ a 2 k)( ∑ b2 k) ≤ ( ∑ akbk)( ∑ b2 k). Divide through both sides (it is positive since it is bigger than ∑ a 2 k) and we get that ∑ bkak ≤ ∑ b2 k and the result follows by transitivity. 6. (IMO78) Let (ak) n 1 be a sequence of distinct positive integers. Prove that for any positive integer n: n∑ k=1 ak k2 ≥ n∑ k=1 1 k . Solution: Rearrangement 7. (USAMO89) For each positive integer n, let: Sn = 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · + 1 n Tn = S1 + S2 + · · · + Sn Un = T1 2 + T2 3 + · · · + Tn n + 1 . Find integers 0 < a, b, c, d < 1000000 for which T1998 = aS1989 − b and U1988 = cS1989 − d. Solution: For the ﬁrst one, write out the sum in table-form with it on horizontals, and add columns. We will get that Tn = (n + 1)Sn − (n + 1). Hence the terms of the Un sum are simply (Sn − 1). Plug this back in and use the previous; we get answers of a = b = 1989, c = 1990, d = 3978. 8. Given two real sequences (ak) n 1 and (bk) n 1 with (a) a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an ≥ 0 (b) b1 ≥ a1 and b1b2 ≥ a1a2 and . . . and b1b2 · · · bn ≥ a1a2 · · · an. Prove that ∑n i=1 bi ≥ ∑n i=1 ai and determine the condition of equality. Solution: Weighted AM-GM: ∑ ai bi ai∑ ai ≥ ∑ ai √ ∏ ( bi ai )ai Now divide through in the given conditions and take the (bn/an) a n term by taking the (b1b2 · · · bn)/(a1a2 · · · an) ≥ 1. Since (a) is decreasing, we can continue in this way without making any of the powers negative. 9. (USAMO94) Let (ak) n 1 be a positive sequence satisfying ∑n j=1 aj ≥ √n for all n ≥ 1. Prove that for all n ≥ 1: n∑ j=1 a 2 j > 1 4 (1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 n ) . Solution: Use result from three problems ago; use the aj for the bk, and add in ak = 1/(2 √k). 2 10. Given two real sequences (ak) n 1 and (bk) n 1 , prove that n∑ i=1 aixi ≤ n∑ i=1 bixi for any x1 ≤ x2 ≤ · · · ≤ xn is equivalent to n∑ i=1 ai = n∑ i=1 bi and k∑ i=1 ai ≥ k∑ i=1 bi, for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Solution: Abel sum; taking ∆k ≡ 0, xn = 1, we get the equality of full sums. For xn = 0, ∆k = δk, we get the rest of it. For the converse, it simply plugs into the Abel sum. 11. (USAMO85) 0 < a1 ≤ a2 ≤ a3 ≤ . . . is an unbounded sequence of integers. Let bn = m if am is the ﬁrst member of the sequence to equal or exceed n. Given that a19 = 85, what is the maximum possible value of a1 + a2 + · · · + a19 + b1 + b2 + · · · + b85? Solution: If all ak are 85, then we get 1700. But use algorithm to turn any sequence into ﬂat-85: if ak < ak+1, then can replace ak by ak + 1. This will increase the sum of ai by 1, but decrease the sum of bi by 1. 12. (Uses Calculus) Find a compact expression for ∑n k=1 kx k. 3 Really Hard Zuming Problem Let (ak) n 1 be a positive sequence. Prove that: n∑ k=1 k a1 + a2 + · · · + ak < 2 n∑ i=1 1 ai . Hint: use the following lemma: 1. For intermediate k: k ∑k i=1 ai ≤ 4 k(k + 1)2 k∑ i=1 i 2 ai Solution: Cauchy-Schwarz with (k), (ak), and (k/ √ak). Solution: Now do this: n∑ 1 k ∑k 1 ai ≤ n∑ 1 4k k2(k + 1)2 k∑ 1 i 2 ai < 2 n∑ 1 2k + 1 k2(k + 1)2 k∑ 1 i 2 ai = 2 n∑ k=1 k∑ i=1 i 2 ai ( 1 k2 − 1 (k + 1)2 ) = 2 n∑ i=1 n∑ k=i i 2 ai ( 1 k2 − 1 (k + 1)2 ) 3 = 2 n∑ i=1 i 2 ai ( 1 i2 − 1 (n + 1)2 ) < 2 n∑ i=1 1 ai 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
