How can we ﬁnd all divisors of n? Let d be a divisor of n. Then n = dm, for some m, thus n = dm = pα1 1 pα2 2 . . . p αr r . Since the prime factorisation of n is unique, all the prime factors of d are among the primes p1, p2, . . . , pr. Also, a prime pi in the prime factorisation of d cannot have an exponent greater than αi. Therefore d = p β1 1 pβ2 2 . . . p βr r , 0 ≤ βi ≤ αi, i = 1, 2, . . . , r. (2) Theorem 1. The number of positive divisors of n is d(n) = (α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) . . . (αr + 1). (3) Proof. Indeed, we have exactly αi + 1 possibilities to choose βi in (2), namely 0, 1, 2, . . . , αi. Thus the total number of divisors will be exactly the product (α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) . . . (αr + 1). The numbers kn, where k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . ., are called multiples of n. It is clear that any multiple of n given by (1) has the form m = kpγ1 1 p γ2 2 . . . p γr r , γi ≥ αi, i = 1, 2, . . . , r, where k has none of the primes p1, p2, . . . , pr in its prime factorisation. The number of multiples of n is inﬁnite. 3 Greatest common divisor and least common multiple Let a and b be two positive integers. If d is a divisor of a and also a divisor of b, then we say that d is a common divisor of a and b. As there are only a ﬁnite number of common divisors, there is a greatest common divisor, denoted by gcd (a, b). The number m is said to be a common multiple of a and b if m is a multiple of a and also a multiple of b. Among all common multiples there is a minimal one (by the Least-Integer Principle!). It is called the least common multiple and it is denoted by lcm (a, b). In the decomposition (1) we had all exponents positive. However, sometimes it is convenient to allow some exponents to be 0. This is especially convenient when we are considering prime factorisations of two numbers a and b, looking for gcd (a, b) and lcm (a, b), since we may assume that both a and b have the same set of primes in their prime factorisations. 1 Theorem 2. Let a = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . p αr r , b = p β1 1 pβ2 2 . . . p βr r , where αi ≥ 0 and βi ≥ 0, be two arbitrary positive integers. Then gcd (a, b) = pmin(α1,β1) 1 pmin(α2,β2) 2 . . . p min(αr,βr) r , (4) and lcm (a, b) = p max(α1,β1) 1 p max(α2,β2) 2 . . . p max(αr,βr) r . (5) Moreover, gcd (a, b) · lcm (a, b) = a · b. (6) Proof. Formulas (4) and (5) follow from our description of common divisors and common multiples. To prove (6) we have to notice that min(αi, βi) + max(αi, βi) = αi + βi. It is suspected (in fact it is an open question) that prime factorisation is computationally diﬃcult. No easy algorithms for it are known. Fortunately, the greatest common divisor gcd (a, b) of numbers a and b can be found without knowing the prime factorisations for a and b. This algorithm was known to Euclid – it is even possible that he discovered it. Theorem 3 (Euclidean Algorithm). Let a and b be positive integers. Suppose we use the division algorithm several times to ﬁnd: a = q1b + r1, 0 < r1 < b, b = q2r1 + r2, 0 < r2 < r1, r1 = q3r2 + r3, 0 < r3 < r2, ... rs−2 = qsrs−1 + rs, 0 < rs < rs−1, rs−1 = qs+1rs, that is, halting when rs+1 reaches 0. (Which must eventually happen. For if not, then we can continue the algorithm forever, obtaining b > r1 > r2 > · · · > 0, which contradicts the Least-Integer Principle.) Then rs = gcd (a, b). Proof. The key observation is that if a = qb + r, then gcd (a, b) = gcd (b, r). Indeed, if d is a common divisor of a and b, then a = a′d and b = b ′d and then r = a − qb = a ′d − qb ′d = (a ′ − qb ′)d and d is also a common divisor of b and r. Conversely, if d is a common divisor of b and r, then b = b ′d, r = r′d and a = qb + r = qb ′d + r′d = (qb ′ + r′)d, whence d is a common divisor of a and b. Proceeding inductively down the table, it is clear that gcd (a, b) = gcd (b, r1) = gcd (r1, r2) = . . . = gcd (rs−1, rs) = rs. Theorem 4 (Extended Euclidean Algorithm). Draw up the following table, with two rows R1, R2: ( a 1 0 b 0 1 ) . Perform the Euclidean algorithm on a and b, and simultaneously construct rows of this table, as follows: First we create the third row R3 by subtracting from the ﬁrst row the second row times q1; that is, R3 := R1 − q1R2. In general, create Rk, for any k ≤ s, by taking Rk−2 and subtracting Rk−1 times qk−2; that is, Rk := Rk−2 − qk−2Rk−1. 2 Suppose the table we eventually obtain is         a 1 0 b 0 1 r1 1 −q1 r2 −q2 1 + q1q2 ... rs m n  | | | | | | |  ; Then gcd (a, b) = rs = am + bn. Proof. We will prove this by induction. Let the integers in the k-th row of the table be Rk = (uk, vk, wk). Certainly u1 = av1 + bw1 and u2 = av2 + bw2. Suppose that for some k < s, for all i ≤ k − 1, ui = avi + bwi. Then uk = uk−2 − qkuk−1 = avk−2 + bwk−2 − qk(avk−1 + bwk−1) = a(vk−2 − qkvk−1) + b(wk−2 − qkwk−1) = avk + bwk. Thus for all i ≤ k, ui = avi + bwi. It follows by induction that for all i ≤ s, ui = avi + bwi. In particular, this is true for the last row, which gives us rs = am + bn. Example 1. Let a = 321, b = 843. Find the greatest common divisor gcd (a, b), the least common multiple lcm (a, b), and a linear presentation of the greatest common divisor in the form gcd (a, b) = ka + mb. Solution: The Euclidean algorithm gives: 321 = 0 · 843 + 321 843 = 2 · 321 + 201 321 = 1 · 201 + 120 201 = 1 · 120 + 81 120 = 1 · 81 + 39 81 = 2 · 39 + 3 39 = 13 · 3 + 0, and therefore gcd (321, 843) = 3 and lcm (321, 843) = 321 · 843 3 = 107 · 843 = 90201. The extended Euclidean algorithm gives:             321 1 0 843 0 1 321 1 0 201 −2 1 120 3 −1 81 −5 2 39 8 −3 3 21 8  | | | | | | | | | |  , obtaining the linear presentation gcd (321, 843) = 3 = (−21) · 321 + 8 · 843. 3 4 Relatively prime numbers If gcd (a, b) = 1, the numbers a and b are said to be relatively prime (or coprime). The following properties of relatively prime numbers are often used. Lemma 5. Let a and b be relatively prime integers; that is, integers for which gcd (a, b) = 1. Then (a) a and b do not have common primes in their prime factorisations. (b) If c is a multiple of a and also a multiple of b, then c is a multiple of ab. (c) If ac is a multiple of b, then c is a multiple of b. (d) There exist integers m, n such that ma + nb = 1. Proof. (a) follows from equation (4), (b) and (c) follow from (a), and (d) follows from Theorem 4. Theorem 6 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). Let a and b be two relatively prime integers, and let r and s be integers with 0 ≤ r < a and 0 ≤ s < b. Then there exists a unique number N with 0 ≤ N < ab, such that r ≡ N (mod a) and s ≡ N (mod b), (7) i.e., such that N has remainder r on dividing by a and remainder s on dividing by b. Proof. Let us prove ﬁrst, that there exists at most one integer N with the conditions required. Assume, on the contrary, that for two integers N1 and N2 we have 0 ≤ N1 < ab, 0 ≤ N2 < ab and r ≡ N1 ≡ N2 (mod a) and s ≡ N1 ≡ N2 (mod b). Without loss of generality N1 ≥ N2. Then the number M = N1 − N2 satisﬁes 0 ≤ M < ab, and 0 ≡ M (mod a) and 0 ≡ M (mod b). (8) By Lemma 5 part 3, condition (8) implies that M is divisible by ab, whence M = 0, so N1 and N2 are actually equal. Next we will ﬁnd an integer N ′, not necessarily between 0 and ab, such that r = N ′ (mod a) and s = N ′ (mod b). Indeed, by Theorem 4 there are integers m, n such that gcd (a, b) = 1 = ma + nb. Multiplying this equation by r − s we get r − s = (r − s)ma + (r − s)nb = m′a + n′b. Now it is clear that the number N ′ = r − m ′a = s + n′b satisﬁes the condition (7). Finally, choose N to be N ′’s remainder on division by ab; that is, 0 ≤ N < ab and N ′ = q · ab + N. This N also satisﬁes (7). So the theorem is proved. This proof of the Chinese Remainder Theorem is constructive; that is, it also gives an algorithm for calculating such an N with property (7). A shorter but nonconsructive proof which uses the Pigeonhole Principle can be found in the notes “Primes that are Sums of Two Squares” (Tutorial 4), where the theorem is used to prove a result of Fermat.
