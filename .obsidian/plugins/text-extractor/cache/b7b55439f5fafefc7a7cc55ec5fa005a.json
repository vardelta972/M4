Then let d(n) := ∑ d|n 1 and σ(n) := ∑ d|n d. 1.1 Primes • Unique prime factorization: Any positive integer n can be uniquely written in the form n = pa1 1 pa2 2 · · · pak k for primes p1 < · · · < pk and positive integers a1, . . . , ak. • Given the prime factorization of n, it is easy to compute d(n) and σ(n): d(n) = (a1 + 1) · · · (ak + 1) and σ(n) = ( pa1+1 1 − 1 p1 − 1 ) · · · ( pak+1 k − 1 pk − 1 ) . • If p is prime and p|ab, then p|a or p|b. Another way of stating this is that you can’t write 0 as the product of two nonzero residues mod p. • Finally, note that any integer greater than 1 has at least one prime divisor. As a sort of converse to this, if a positive integer has a divisor n, then it must be at least as large as n. 1.2 GCDs • If m and n are integers, at least one nonzero, then they have a greatest common divisor d := (m, n), the largest d such that d|m and d|n. • If the prime factorizations of m and n are known, then one can compute (m, n) easily: if m = pa1 1 p a2 2 · · · p ak k and n = p b1 1 pb2 2 · · · pbk k , then (m, n) = p c1 1 pc2 2 · · · pck k with ci = min(ai, bi). • One useful fact is that (m, n) = (m, n − m), or indeed (m, n) = (m, n − km) for any integer k. If you repeat this to decrease the two numbers until one of them is zero, then this is the Euclidean algorithm. • The Euclidean algorithm implies that there exist integers a and b such that (m, n) = am + bn. In fact, the diophantine equation mx + ny = c (in x and y) only has a solution when c is a multiple of (m, n). 1 1.3 Exponentials • Fermat’s Little Theorem: if p is a prime and a is not divisible by p, then p|a p−1 − 1. • Euler generalized this by introducing the function ϕ(n) = ∑ 1≤d≤n (d,n)=1 1, which counts the number of positive integers no larger than n that are relatively prime to n. Then Euler’s generalization states that if (a, n) = 1, then n|a ϕ(n) − 1. • Note that if n = p a1 1 p a2 2 · · · pak k , then ϕ(n) n = ( 1 − 1 p1 ) · · · ( 1 − 1 pk ) . • As a consequence of Euler’s generalization, the sequence 1, a, a2, . . . is periodic when reduced mod n, with period dividing ϕ(n). 2 Problems 1.
