R be a convex function (i.e., (1 \u0000 \u0015)f (x) + \u0015f (y) \u0015 f ((1 \u0000 \u0015)x + \u0015y) for all x, y 2 [a; b], \u0015 2 [0; 1]). Then for any x1, . . . , xn 2 [a; b] and any nonnegative reals \u00151, . . . , \u0015n which sum to 1, \u00151f (x1) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + \u0015nf (xn) \u0015 f (\u00151x1 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + \u0015nxn): Other criteria for convexity: 1. Graphically, f is convex i\u000b the set of points f(x; y) 2 [a; b] \u0002 R j y \u0015 f (x)g is convex (the line segment joining any two points of the set lies entirely within the set). 2. If f is continuous, then it su\u000eces to check the statement for \u0015 = 1 Ordering Inequalities \u000f Rearrangement If a1 \u0014 a2 \u0014 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0014 an and b1 \u0014 b2 \u0014 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0014 bn are two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers, then for any permutation ˇ of f1; 2; : : : ; ng, we have a1b1 + a2b2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anbn \u0015 a1bˇ(1) + a2bˇ(2) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anbˇ(n) \u0015 a1bn + a2bn\u00001 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anb1: Exercise: This is obvious, but prove it formally. \u000f Chebyshev If a1 \u0014 a2 \u0014 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0014 an and b1 \u0014 b2 \u0014 \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 \u0014 bn are two nondecreasing sequences of real numbers, then a1b1 + a2b2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anbn \u000f Majorization (also known as Hardy-Littlewood(-Polya) or Karamata) Let f : [a; b] ! R be a convex function and suppose the sequence (x1; x2; : : : ; xn) majorizes the sequence (y1; y2; : : : ; yn) with xi, yi 2 [a; b]. Then nX i=1 f (xi) \u0015 nX i=1 f (yi): Homework: Prove this using the technique of Abel summation together with the fact that the slope of the segment joining two points on the graph of a convex function is an increasing function of each point's x-coordinate. Note that since f (x) = jxj is a convex function, this theorem extends the previous criterion. \u000f Popoviciu Let f : [a; b] ! R be a convex function, and let x, y, z 2 [a; b].
