Let F be a collection of subsets A1, A2, . . . of {1, . . . , n}, such that for each i ̸= j, Ai ∩ Aj ̸= ∅. Prove that F has size at most 2 n−1. Solution: For each set S ∈ 2 [n], observe that at most one of S and S is contained in F. 2. Suppose that F above has size exactly 2n−1. Must there be a common element x ∈ {1, . . . , n} which is contained by every Ai? Solution: No. First, observe that in [3], one can create an intersecting family with the four sets {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1}, and {1, 2, 3}. Then for every n ≥ 3, one can blow up this construction by taking all sets S which are obtained by taking the union of one of these 4 sets together with an arbitrary subset of {4, . . . , n}. 3. Let F be a family of sets, each of size exactly 3, such that: (a) Every pair of sets intersects in a single element. (b) Every pair of elements in the ground set X = ⋃ L∈F S is contained in a unique set L ∈ F. Suppose that F has more than one set. Prove that the ground set X has exactly 7 elements, and show that such a family F exists. Solution: Let L be the number of “lines,” i.e., sets in F, and let n be the size of the ground set. Observations: • The degree of any element is exactly n−1 2 , because of (b). • The number of lines is L = 1 3 (n 2) because of (a). But by double-counting, we must have: ∑ v∈X (dv 2 ) = (L 2 ) . Substituting our expressions for dv and L, we conclude that n · 1 2 ( n − 1 2 · n − 3 2 ) = L(L − 1) 2 = n(n − 1) 6 · (n − 3)(n + 2) 6 1 4 = n + 2 36 7 = n . The Fano plane provides the desired construction. 1 2 Designs 1. (TST 2005/1.) Let n be an integer greater than 1. For a positive integer m, let Xm = {1, 2, . . . , mn}. Suppose that there exists a family F of 2n subsets of Xm such that: (a) each member of F is an m-element subset of Xm; (b) each pair of members of F shares at most one common element; (c) each element of Xm is contained in exactly 2 elements of F. Determine the maximum possible value of m in terms of n. Solution: Count in two ways: ∑ v (dv 2 ) = # set pairs intersect ≤ (2n 2 ) . But all dv = 2, so we have mn ≤ n(2n − 1), i.e., m ≤ 2n − 1. Equality is possible: take 2n lines in general position in R⊭, and let their (2n 2 ) = mn intersection points be the points. 2. (USAMO 2011/6.) Let X be a set with |X| = 225. Suppose further that there are eleven subsets A1, . . . , A11 of X such that |Ai| = 45 for 1 ≤ i ≤ 11 and |Ai ∩ Aj| = 9 for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 11. Prove that |A1 ∪ · · · ∪ A11| ≥ 165, and give an example for which equality holds. Solution: The |X| = 225 condition is unnecessary. Count in two ways: ∑ v∈X ( dv 2 ) = (11 2 ) · 9 = 495 . But also ∑ v∈X dv = 11 · 45 = 495. This suggests that equality occurs when all dv = (dv 2 ), which is precisely at dv = 3. Indeed, by Cauchy-Schwarz, if we let Let n = |X|, we ﬁnd ( ∑ v∈X 1dv )2 ≤ ( ∑ v∈X 1 ) ( ∑ v∈X d 2 v ) 4952 ≤ n · 3 · 495 , where we deduced ∑ d 2 v = 3 · 495 from ∑ (dv 2 ) and ∑ dv. We conclude that n ≥ 165. For the construction, take 11 planes in general position in R3, and let their (11 3 ) = 165 points of intersection be the points in the set. 3. A collection of subsets L1, . . . , Lm in the universe {1, . . . , n} is called a projective plane if: (a) Every pair of sets (called “lines”) intersects in a single element. (b) Every pair of elements in the ground set X = ⋃ L∈F S is contained in a unique set L ∈ F. Actually, there are two families of degenerate planes which satisfy the two conditions above, but are not considered to be projective planes. They are: (a) L1 = {1, . . . , n}, L2 = {1}, L3 = {1}, L4 = {1}, . . . (b) L1 = {2, 3, . . . , n}, L2 = {1, 2}, L3 = {1, 3}, L4 = {1, 4}, . . . , Ln = {1, n}. It is well-known that for every projective plane, there is an N (called the “order” of the plane) such that: 2 (a) Every line contains exactly N + 1 points, and every point is on exactly N + 1 lines. (b) The total number of points is exactly N 2 + N + 1, which is the same as the total number of lines. 4. For every prime power p n, there exists a projective plane of that order. Solution: Take the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq of order q = p n. Let the points be dimension-1 subspaces of F⊯ q , and let the lines be dimension-2 subspaces (i.e., the collection of dimension-1 subspaces that lie within a given dimension-2 subspace). Every pair of dimension-2 subspaces intersects in a subspace, which has integer dimension. That dimension is obviously strictly less than 2, but also cannot be 0 or else we would have had mutually independent bases of the pair of dimension-2 subspaces, already yielding dimension 4 for the parent space. Hence every pair of dimension-2 subspaces intersects in a dimension-1 subspace, i.e., containing a single point. Also, every pair of dimension-1 subspaces determines a pair of linearly independent basis vectors, whose span is already dimension-2. So For every pair of dimension-1 subspaces, there is a unique dimension-2 subspace that contains both of them. Observe that by calculation, the number of dimension-1 subspaces inside a ﬁxed dimension-2 subspace is exactly q2−1 q−1 = q + 1, because there are q2 nonzero vectors in the dimension-2 subspace, and every pair of dimension-1 subspaces intersects only at the zero vector. Hence the order is q = p n. 5. (Open.) What are the possible orders of projective planes? All known projective planes have prime power order, but it is unknown whether, for example, there is a projective plane of order 12. 3 Graphs and partitioning 1. Construct a bipartite graph in which all degrees are equal, and every pair of vertices on the same side has exactly 1 common neighbor. Show that this must achieve the maximum possible number of edges in any C4-free bipartite graph with the same number of vertices. Solution: Take a projective plane, and create a graph by putting the points on the left, and the lines on the right, connecting a point to a line if they are incident. The codegree conditions are satisﬁed by the deﬁnition of a projective plane. Now suppose we have a C4-free bipartite graph with n vertices on each side. Count the number of K1,2 with 2 points on the Right side. This is ( n 2 ) ≥ ∑ v (dv 2 ) ≥ n( d 2 ) , with equality precisely when the degrees are all equal, and when every pair on the Right side has codegree exactly 1. Since we are optimizing the average degree, this implies the result. 2. Construct a non-bipartite graph in which all degrees are equal, and every pair of vertices has exactly 1 common neighbor. Show that this must achieve the maximum possible number of edges in any C4-free graph with the same number of vertices. Solution: Consider F 3, and associate every vertex with a 1-dimensional subspace. Join two vertices by an edge if their two subspaces are orthogonal. But given two distinct subspaces, there is a unique 1-dimensional subspace orthogonal to both of them. Another way to see this is to say that we join two vertices if one of the dimension-1 subspaces lies within the orthogonal complement (dimension-2 subspace) of the other vertex. Then if we are given two distinct dimension-1 subspaces, the number of common neighbors is the number of common dimension-2 subspaces that contain both, and this is the same calculation as above. For tightness, take the same sum of all K1,2 throughout the graph. 3 3. Let n be odd. Partition the edge set of Kn into n matchings with n−1 2 edges each. Solution: Spread the n vertices around a circle. Take parallel classes. 4. Let n be even. Partition the edge set of Kn into n − 1 matchings with n 2 edges each. Solution: Spread n − 1 vertices around a circle, and let the ﬁnal vertex be the origin. Take parallel classes, along with the orthogonal radius from the origin. 5. Find (nontrivial) inﬁnite families of t and n for which it is possible to partition the edges of Kn into disjoint copies of edges corresponding to Kt. Solution: Suppose n = q2 + q + 1 for a prime power q. Take a projective plane, and identify the vertices of Kn with the points. The cliques Kt correspond to the lines. Alternatively, suppose n = q2 for a prime power q. Take the aﬃne plane, i.e., points corresponding to F 2 q. Lines correspond to the points in aﬃne lines, i.e., with q points each. It is clear that every pair of points determines a unique line, hence every edge is in a unique Kq. 4 Extremal set theory 1. (Erd˝os-Ko-Rado.) Let n ≥ 2k be positive integers, and let C be a collection of pairwise-intersecting k-element subsets of {1, . . . , n}, i.e., every A, B ∈ C has A ∩ B ̸= ∅. Prove that |C| ≤ (n−1 k−1). Remark. This corresponds to the construction which takes all subsets that contain the element 1. Solution: Pick a random k-set A from 2[n] by ﬁrst selecting a random permutation σ ∈ Sn, and then picking a random index i ∈ [n]. Then deﬁne A = {σ(i), . . . , σ(i + k − 1)}, with indices after n wrapping around, of course. It suﬃces to show that P [A ∈ C] ≤ k/n. Let us show that conditioned on any ﬁxed σ, P [A ∈ C|σ] ≤ k/n, which will ﬁnish our problem. But this is equivalent to the statement that C can only contain ≤ k intervals (wrapping after n) of the form {i, . . . , i + k − 1}, which is easy to show. 2. (Non-uniform Fisher’s inequality.) Let C = {A1, . . . , Ar} be a collection of distinct subsets of {1, . . . , n} such that every pairwise intersection Ai ∩ Aj (i ̸= j) has size t, where t is some ﬁxed integer between 1 and n inclusive. Prove that |C| ≤ n. Solution: Consider the n×r matrix A, where the i-th column of A is the characteristic vector of Ai. Then, AT A is a r × r matrix, all of whose oﬀ-diagonal entries are t. We claim that the diagonal entries are all > t. Indeed, if there were some |Ai| which were exactly t, then the structure of C must look like a “ﬂower,” with one set Aj of size t, and all other sets fully containing Aj and disjointly partitioning the elements of [n] \\ Aj among them. Any such construction has size at most 1 + (n − t) ≤ n, so we would already be done. Therefore, AT A is nonsingular by Lemma below, and the previous argument again gives r ≤ n. LEMMA: Let A be a square matrix over R, for which all non-diagonal entries are all equal to some t ≥ 0, and all diagonal entries are strictly greater than t. Then A is nonsingular. Proof. If t = 0, this is trivial. Now suppose t > 0. Let J be the all-ones square matrix, and let D = A − tJ. Note that D is nonzero only on the diagonal, and in fact strictly positive there. We would like to solve (tJ + D)x = 0, which is equivalent to Dx = −tJx. Let s be the sum of all elements in x, and let the diagonal entries of D be d1, . . . , dn, in order. Then, we have dixi = −ts ⇒ xi = −(t/di)s. But since t and di are both strictly postive, this forces every xi to have opposite sign from s, which is impossible unless all xi = 0. Therefore, A is nonsingular. 4 5 Combinatorics and geometry 1. (Happy ending problem.) Given any 5 distinct points in the plane, no 3 collinear, show that some 4 are in convex position, i.e., forming the vertices of a convex quadrilateral. Solution: If the convex hull has size 4 or more, already done. Otherwise, convex hull is a triangle ABC and there are 2 internal points. Consider the line ℓ determined by those internal points. Since no 3 collinear, it divides {A, B, C} into two groups, one of which has size 2. Use those 2, plus the 2 internal points. 2. (Erd˝os-Szekeres.) For every integer n, there is some ﬁnite N such that the following holds. Given any N distinct points in the plane, no 3 collinear, some n are in convex position. Remark. It is conjectured that N = 1 + 2n−2 suﬃces for all n ≥ 3, and known that N ≥ 1 + 2 n−2 is required. The best known upper bound is of order 4n/√n. Solution: If a set S of points has the property that every 4-subset is in convex position, then all of S is in convex position. To see this, suppose there was some point P strictly inside the convex hull of S. Triangulate the convex hull using diagonals, and P will be strictly inside one of the triangles, say ABC. Then P ABC is concave, contradiction. Now suppose we have R(4)(5, n) many points. For every 4-set of points, color the corresponding 4-edge red if they are not in convex position, blue otherwise. Our hypergraph Ramsey bound implies that there must either be 5 vertices with all 4-edges red, or n vertices with all 4-edges blue. But the 5 vertices with all 4-edges red contradicts the Happy Ending Problem, so we must have the latter. By our opening remark, in fact the n points are all in convex position. 3. (Caratheodory.) A convex combination of points xi is deﬁned as a linear combination of the form∑ i αixi, where the αi are non-negative coeﬃcients which sum to 1. Let X be a ﬁnite set of points in Rd, and let cvx(X) denote the set of points in the convex hull of X, i.e., all points expressible as convex combinations of the xi ∈ X. Show that each point x ∈ cvx(X) can in fact be expressed as a convex combination of only d + 1 points of X. Solution: Given a convex combination with d + 2 or more nonzero coeﬃcients, ﬁnd a new vector with which to perturb the nonzero coeﬃcients. Speciﬁcally, seek ∑ i βixi = 0 and ∑i βi = 0, which is d + 1 equations, but with d + 2 variables βi. So there is a non-trivial solution, and we can use it to reduce another αi coeﬃcient to zero. 4. (Radon.) Let A be a set of at least d + 2 points in Rd. Show that A can be split into two disjoint sets A1 ∪ A2 such that cvx(A1) and cvx(A2) intersect. Solution: For each point, create an Rd+1-vector vi by adding a “1” as the last coordinate. We have a non-trivial dependence because we have at least d + 2 vectors in Rd+1, say ∑ i αivi = 0. Split A = A1 ∪ A2 by taking A1 to be the set of indices i with αi ≥ 0, and A2 to be the rest. By the last coordinate, we have ∑ i∈A1 αi = ∑ i∈A2(−αi) . Let Z be that sum. Then if we use αi/Z as the coeﬃcients, we get a convex combination from A1 via the ﬁrst d coordinates, which equals the convex combination from A2 we get by using (−αi)/Z as the coeﬃcients. 5. (Helly.) Let C1, C2, . . . , Cn be sets of points in Rd, with n ≥ d + 1. Suppose that every d + 1 of the sets have a non-empty intersection. Show that all n of the sets have a non-empty intersection. Solution: Induction on n. Clearly true for n = d + 1, so now consider n ≥ d + 2, and assume true for n − 1. Then by induction, we can deﬁne points ai to be in the intersection of all Cj, j ̸= i. Apply Radon’s Lemma to these ai, to get a split of indices A ∪ B. 5 Crucially, note that for each i ∈ A and j ∈ B, the point ai is in Cj. So, each i ∈ A gives ai ∈ ⋂j∈B Cj, and hence the convex hull of points in A is entirely contained in all Cj, j ∈ B. Similarly, the convex hull of points in B is entirely contained in all Cj, j ∈ A. Yet Radon’s Lemma gave intersecting convex hulls, so there is a point in both hulls, i.e., in all Cj, j ∈ A ∪ B = [n]. 6 Bonus problems 1. (From Peter Winkler.) The 60 MOPpers were divided into 8 teams for Team Contest 1. They were then divided into 7 teams for Team Contest 2. Prove that there must be a MOPper for whom the size of her team in Contest 2 was strictly larger than the size of her team in Contest 1. Solution: In Contest 1, suppose the team breakdown was s1 + · · · + s8 = 60. Then in the i-th team, with si people, say that each person did 1 si of the work. Similarly, in Contest 2, account equally for the work within each team, giving scores of 1 s′ i . However, the total amount of work done by all people in Contest 1 was then exactly 8, and the total amount of work done by all people in Contest 2 was exactly 7. So somebody must have done strictly less work in Contest 2. That person saw 1 s′ i < 1 si , i.e., the size of that person’s team on Contest 2 was strictly larger than her team size on Contest 1. 2. (MOP 2008.) Let F be a collection of 2 n−1 subsets A1, A2, . . . of {1, . . . , n}, such that for each i ̸= j ̸= k, Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak ̸= ∅. Prove that there is a common element x ∈ {1, . . . , n} that is contained in every Ai. 3. (Sperner capacity of cyclic triangle, also Iran 2006.) Let A be a collection of vectors of length n from Z3 with the property that for any two distinct vectors a, b ∈ A there is some coordinate i such that bi = ai + 1, where addition is deﬁned modulo 3. Prove that |A| ≤ 2n. Solution: For each a ∈ A, deﬁne the Z3-polynomial fa(x) := ∏n i=1(xi − ai − 1). Observe that this is multilinear. Clearly, for all a ̸= b ∈ A, fa(b) = 0, and fa(a) ̸= 0; therefore, the fa are linearly independent, and bounded in cardinality by the dimension of the space of multilinear polynomials in n variables, which is 2 n. 6","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
