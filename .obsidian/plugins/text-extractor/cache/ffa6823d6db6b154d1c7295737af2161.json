Let ABCD be an isosceles trapezium having an incircle; let AB and CD be the parallel sides and let CE be the perpendicular from C on to AB. Prove that CE is equal to the geometric mean of AB and CD. Solution: Since ABCD has incircle, we have AB + CD = AD + BC. We alos know that AD = BC and ∠A = ∠B. Draw DF ⊥ AB. Then △DF C ∼= △CEB. Hence F E = CD, and AF = EB. Now CE2 = BC2 − BE2. Observe 2BC = BC + AD = AB + CD = 2F E + 2EB. Hence BC = F E + EB. Thus CE2 = (F E + EB)2 − BE2 = (F E + 2EB)F E = AB · CD. This shows that CE is the geometric mean of AB and CD. 2. If x and y are positive real numbers, prove that 4x4 + 4y3 + 5x2 + y + 1 ≥ 12xy. Solution: We have from AM-GM inequality, 4x4 + 1 ≥ 4x2, 4y3 + y = y(4y2 + 1) ≥ 4y2. Hence 4x4 + 4y3 + 5x2 + y + 1 ≥ 4x2 + 4y2 + 5x2 = 9x2 + 4y2 ≥ 2( √9 × 4)xy = 12xy. 3. Determine all pairs m > n of positive integers such that 1 = gcd(n + 1, m + 1) = gcd(n + 2, m + 2) = · · · = gcd(m, 2m − n). Solution: Observe that 1 = gcd(n + r, m + r) = gcd(n + r, m − n). Thus each of the m − n consecutive positive integers n + 1, n + 2, . . . , m is coprime to m − n. Since one of these is necessarily a multiple of m − n, this is possible only when m − n = 1. Hence each pair is of the form (n, n + 1), where n ∈ N. 4. What is the minimal area of a right-angled triangle whose inradius is 1 unit? Solution: Let ABC be the right-angled tri- angle with ∠B = 90◦. Let I be its incentre and D be the point where the incircle touches AB. Then s − b = AD = r = 1. We also know that [ABC] = rs = r(a + b + c)/2 and [ABC] = ac/2. Thus ac 2 = a + b + c 2 = (a+c)−a + c − b 2 = (a+c)−1. Using AM-GM inequality, we get ac 2 = a + c − 1 ≥ 2 √ac − 1. Taking √ac = x, we get x2 − 4x + 2 ≥ 0. Hence x ≥ 4 + 2√2 2 = 2 + √2. Finally, [ABC] = ac 2 ≥ (2 + √2)2 2 = 3 + 2√ 2. Thus the least area of such a triangle is 3 + 2 √ 2. 5. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and let I be its incentre. Let the incircle of triangle ABC touch BC in D. The incircle of the triangle ABD touches AB in E; the incircle of the triangle ACD touches BC in F . Prove that B, E, I, F are concyclic. Solution: We know BD = s − b and DC = s−c, where s is the semiperimeter of △ABC. Let the incircle of △ABD touch BC in P and let AD = l. Then DP = l + BD − c 2 = l + s − c − b 2 . Similarly, we can compute DF = l + s − c − b 2 . Therefore DP = DF . But ID ⊥ BC. Hence I is on the per- pendicular bisector of P F . This gives IP = IF . Draw IQ ⊥ AB. Then B, Q, I, D are concyclic so that ∠QID = 180◦ − ∠B. Since DP = DF and IP = IF , the triangles IDP and IDF are congruent. But IDP is congruent to IQE. It follows that △IDF ∼= △IQE. This shows that ∠QIE = ∠DIF . Therefore ∠QID = ∠EIF . But ∠QID = 180◦ − ∠B. Hence ∠EIF = 180◦ − ∠B. Therefore B, E, I, F are concyclic. 2 6. In the adjacent ﬁgure, can the num- bers 1, 2, 3, 4, · · · , 18 be placed, one on each line segment, such that the sum of the numbers on the three line segments meeting at each point is divisible by 3? Solution: We group the numbers 1 to 18 in to 3 groups: those leaving remainder 0 when divided by 3; those leaving remainder 1; and those leaving remainder 2. Thus the groups are: {3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18}, {1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16}, {2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17} Now we put the numbers in such a way that each of the three line segments con- verging to a vertex gets one number from each set.
