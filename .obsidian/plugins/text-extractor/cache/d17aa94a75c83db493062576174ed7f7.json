An infection spreads among the squares of an n×n grid in the following manner: every second any square adjacent to at least two infected squares becomes infected itself. (Two squares are called adjacent if they share a common edge.) Prove that the whole board cannot be infected if initially there are at most n-1 many infected squares. Can it be done beginning with exactly n infected squares? Solution If initially n squares are infected, then it is possible that the infection spreads over the whole grid. For instance, consider the situation where the diagonal squares are infected initially. Next we shall show that the whole grid can’t be affected if initially there are at most n-1 many infected squares. Our invariant here is the total perimeter of the infected squares (not counting borders between two adjacent infected squares). When a square is infected by the given rules, the total perimeter cannot increase: the newly infected square is adjacent to at least 2 already infected squares, so we lose at least 2 borders and gain at most 2. Initially, this perimeter is at most 4(n − 1). Hence we cannot end with the entire grid being infected, because for that the total perimeter needs to be increased to 4n, which cannot happen. The above diagram shows what will be the possible contributions of one particular newly affected square (the central one). Note that for none of them the newly affected central square increases the perimeter of the infected region. Example. Five hundred people attend a party in a mansion with many rooms. Each minute somebody walks from one room into a different room with at least as many people. Prove that eventually all the people will be gathered in one room. This result seems intuitively plausible. The heavily populated rooms will get even more popular, while the rooms with few people will come to have even fewer, so we should expect that the outcome is for all people to be in one room. But how to make this rigorous? A numerical monovariant is the key. Solution For each room, consider the square of the number of people in that room. Let the sum of these squares be S. We claim that S increases with each move. To see this, suppose that a person from a room with n people walks into a room with m ≥ n people. Then the squares of the populations of these rooms change from n^2 and m^2 to (n−1)^2 and (m+1)^2, respectively, while all the other rooms remain passive, so the net change in S is [(n − 1)^2 + (m + 1)^2] − [n^2 + m^2] = 2(m − n) + 2 > 0. Thus S always increases. Page of 1 4 Now, there are ﬁnitely many possible distributions of the 500 people among the various rooms, so there are ﬁnitely many possible values of S. This means that S cannot increase forever. But as long as at least two rooms have people in them, our operation can be performed and S will increase. Therefore the process must terminate, implying all the people will be in the same room. Example. The integers 1, ... , n are arranged in any order. In one step, you may switch any two neighbouring integers. Prove that you can never reach the initial order after an odd number of steps. Solution Let us label the integers as a_1, a_2, …, a_n. For each pair (i, j) where 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n, we deﬁne d_{i, j} to be 1 if a_i < a_j and 0 otherwise. Thus, S = ∑ d_{i, j} equals the sum of all ordered pairs of indices such that i < j and a_i < a_j. Now observe what happens if you switch two neighbouring integers, say a_k and a_(k+1). Consider all possible scenario: i. If neither among i, j equal k or k+1 then d_{i, j} does not change. ii. If i=k and j=k+1 then d_{i, j} switches its value (0 to 1 or 1 to 0) When exactly one among i, j equal to k or k+1, we shall use the idea that the role of a_i and a_j in the sum ∑ d_{i, j} has been swapped. iii. If i=k+1, and j>k+1 then new d_{i, j} = old d_{k, j}. Better write d’_{k+1, j} = d_{k, j}. iv. If i=k, and j>k+1 then d’_{i, j} = d’_{k, j} = d_{k+1, j}. v. If i<k and j=k then d’_{i, j} = d’_{i, k} = d_{i, k+1} vi. If i<k and j=k+1 then d’_{i, j} = d’_{i, k+1} = d_{i, k}. Thus, ∑ d’{i, j} − ∑ d_{i, j} = d’_{k, k+1} − d_{k, k+1} = 1 − 0 or 0 − 1 = ±1. So the sum ∑ d_{i, j} changes its parity for every swap. Hence we cannot reach the initial conﬁguration after an odd number of swaps. Example. To each vertex of a regular pentagon an integer is assigned, such that the sum of all ﬁve numbers is positive. If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers x, y, z respectively, and y < 0, then the following operation is allowed: x, y, z are replaced by x+y, -y, z+y respectively. Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as at least one of the ﬁve numbers is negative. Determine whether this procedure necessarily comes to an end after a ﬁnite number of steps. Solution Consider f(x_1, …, x_5) = ∑ (x_(i+1) − x_(i-1))^2. (Indices are mod 5, i.e. x_0=x_5, x_6 = x_1.) Suppose x_3 < 0 and hence we change the numbers X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5) to Y = (x_1, x_2+x_3, −x_3, x_4+x_3, x_5). Note that S = x_1+…+x_5 is invariant, and hence positive at every step. Now observe that f(Y) − f(X) = … = 2x_3(x_1+…+x_5) = 2x_3 S < 0. Thus f strictly decreases at each step, and it takes only non-negative integer values. So the number of steps must be ﬁnite. Alternate Solution Consider the scary monovariant given in Arthur Engel’s book. Page of 2 4 Example. Let S be a set of points in the plane such that each point in S is a midpoint of two other points in S. Show that S must be an inﬁnite set. Solution. Let, if possible, S be ﬁnite. Setup a coordinate system. Now consider the points which are rightmost (i.e. those points which have a maximal x-coordinate). Among these, consider the topmost point (which have the largest y-coordinate among these points), let us call this P. Now P must be the midpoint of a segment joining two points, say A and B. Since P has a maximal x-coordinate, it follows that none of A and B can lie on its right side. This forces A and B to lie on the line where c is the x-coordinate of P. But then one of these points A and B will lie above P, contradicting the maximality of the y-coordinate of P (among all points of S lying on that line ). Example. Show that for every n > 1, the number 2^n -1 is not a multiple of n. Solution. Let, if possible, let > 1divide Note that cannot be even, since then it won’t divide the odd number Consider a prime that divides . Since is odd, Fermat’s theorem tells us that . Thus, and , which implies . (Not familiar with this result? see below.) So for any prime dividing , we have shown that . Now among all prime divisors of , take to be the minimum one. The minimality of implies that gcd( , ) = 1, because each prime that divides is less than and hence cannot divide n. Therefore, divides which is a contradiction. Why ? Let Then Write (say, ) Then Now repeat the above with and so on. Notice that we have Euclidean division algorithm running on the exponents of 2. It follows that at the last step we would get On the other hand, since is a common divisor of it must divide their gcd, .

Page of 3 4 Example. Rooks are placed on the chessboard satisfying the following condition: If the square (i, j) is free, then at least rooks are on the i-th row and j-th column together. Show that there are at least rooks on the board. Solution. The board has n rows and n columns. Among the rows and columns combined, consider one with the minimal number of rooks. W.l.o.g. suppose that it is a row. Now if this minimal row has at least /2 rooks, then the conclusion follows (why?). Suppose not. Let, if possible, this row have rooks where < /2. Consider the empty squares in this row. In each of their column, we must have at least rooks (due to the given condition). What about the remaining columns? Each of them must have at least rooks (since is the minimal number of rooks in any row/column). Therefore, the total number of rooks in the board is at least It remains to show that It follows from the inequality Example. We call a polynomial having integer coefﬁcients to be primitive if the gcd of the coefﬁcients of is 1. Show that product of two primitive polynomials is also a primitive polynomial. Solution. Let and be two primitive polynomials. If the product is not primitive, there must be a prime which is a common divisor of all its coefﬁcients. But can not divide all the coefﬁcients of either or (otherwise they would not be primitive). Let be the minimum index such that is not divisible by and let be the minimum index such that is not divisible by . Now consider the term in the product. Its coefﬁcient (which can be 0 as well) must be of the form: . Note that the ﬁrst term in the above sum is not divisible by , while each of the remaining terms are, so the entire sum cannot be divisible by . But by our assumption all the coefﬁcients in the product must be divisible by . Thus we get a contradiction. n × n n n 2 /2 n k k n n − k n − k k k (n − k) 2 + k 2 .
