Find all values of n for which we can partition A into two subsets B and C such that the product of the elements of B equals the product of the elements of C. 2. Let ABCD be a parallelogram. Let M and N be points on sides AB and BC respectively such that AM = CN . Lines AN and CM meet at Q. Prove that line DQ bisects angle ADC. 3. The incircle of triangle ABC is tangent to sides AB, BC, CA at P , Q, R respectively. Prove that BC 12. Let G be a graph with n vertices containing no triangles. Suppose that for every partition of the vertices of G into two sets A and B, either A or B contains two adjacent vertices. Prove that there exists a vertex of G with degree at most 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
