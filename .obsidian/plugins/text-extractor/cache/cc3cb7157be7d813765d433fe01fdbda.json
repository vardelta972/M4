Although this can be done by expressing this number as a sum/product and evaluating it, it is almost always more illuminating to count the elements in a set by establishing a bijection. A bijection between two sets A and B is a function f which is both one-to-one and onto – that is, it is a one-to-one correspondence between elements of A and elements of B. If there exists a bijection between A and B, then A and B have the same cardinality. The canonical example of this method is counting how many solutions there are to a1+a2+· · ·+ak = n in nonnegative integers a1, a2, · · · , ak. This is done by establishing a bijection between solutions to this equation and arrangements of n “stars” and k − 1 “bars” in a line. 2 Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion The principle of Inclusion-Exclusion states that if F is a ﬁnite family of ﬁnite sets, then | ∪ F| = ∑ S⊆F , S̸=∅(−1) |S|+1| ∩ S|. Here, ∪F denotes the union of all the sets in F, and ∩S the intersection of all the sets in S. Written out in full form, it looks like this: |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An| = (|A1| + |A2| + · · · + |An|) − (|A1 ∩ A2| + |A1 ∩ A3| + · · · + |An−1 ∩ An|) + (|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| + |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A4| + · · · + |An−2 ∩ An−1 ∩ An|) ... ± (|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ · · · ∩ An|). This is often used in proving combinatorial identities. The simpler statements |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An| ≤ |A1| + |A2| + · · · + |An| or |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ · · · ∪ An| ≥ (|A1| + |A2| + · · · + |An|) − (|A1 ∩ A2| + |A1 ∩ A3| + · · · + |An−1 ∩ An|) will often suﬃce in other contexts. 3 Identities Combinatorial identities involving sums can be solved by evaluating the sums algebraically. How- ever, it is almost always more illuminating to prove them combinatorially, using the method of “casework via summation”. The canonical example of proving identities combinatorially is found in the evaluation of the sum n∑ k=0 (x + k k ) = (x + n + 1 n ). To prove this, we consider x + 1-element sets of {1, 2, · · · , x + n + 1}, using casework on the largest element of the set. 1 4 The Pigeonhole Principle Sometimes, once you count what you’ve needed to, you can simply write down the result (with proof, of course) and move on to the next problem. Far more often, however, you will need to take an extra (sometimes trivial) step. The pigeonhole principle states that if n pigeons are placed into k holes, then one hole must have at least n/k pigeons in it. (that is, it must have at least ⌈n/k⌉ pigeons in it.) Applying this can be somewhat tricky, because it isn’t always obvious what to choose as “holes”. For example, see problem below. 5 Probability and Expected Value Let X be a random variable which takes values in some ﬁnite set S. Then the expected value of X, denoted E[X], is E[X] = ∑ x∈S x P[X = x] Also, we have X ≥ E[X] with nonzero probability. The pigeonhole principle is a special case of this. 6 Problems 1. Let S and T be disjoint one-element sets. Find the number of elements of their union S ∪ T . 2. In how many ways can you select two disjoint subsets from the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}? 3.

Some checkers placed on an n × n checkerboard satisfy the following conditions: (1) every square that does not contain a checker shares a side with one that does; (2) given any pair of squares that contain checkers, there is a sequence of squares containing checkers, starting and ending with the given squares, such that every two consecutive squares of the sequence share a side.

Each point (x, y) in the plane, where x and y are non-negative integers with x + y < n, is colored red or blue, subject to the following condition: if a point (x, y) is red, then so are all points (x ′, y′) with x ′ ≤ x and y′ ≤ y. Let A be the number of ways to choose n blue points with distinct x-coordinates, and let B be the number of ways to choose n blue points with distinct y-coordinates. Prove that A = B. 18. You have n square envelopes of diﬀerent sizes. You may place smaller envelopes inside larger envelopes, and you may place an unlimited number of envelopes inside any one envelope (as long as the envelopes are smaller than their container). (a) How many ways can you arrange your n envelopes? (b) Let ˝n k ˛ be the number of ways in which you can arrange your n envelopes if exactly k envelopes do not contain any other envelope. Find a recurrence for ˝ n k ˛ not involving sums. 19. A square (n − 1) × (n − 1) is divided into (n − 1) 2 unit squares in the usual manner. Each of the n2 vertices of these squares is to be colored red or blue. Find the number of diﬀerent colorings such that each unit square has exactly two red vertices. (Two coloring schemes are regarded as diﬀerent if at least one vertex is colored diﬀerently in the two schemes.) 20.

In an international tennis tournament, n players played against each other participant exactly once. There were no ties; every round had a winner and a loser. Suppose there exist two disjoint sets A and B of X players each such that every player from set A defeated every player from set B. Determine the maximum possible X for that statement to remain true, no matter the results of the tournament. 31. Let n be a positive integer. A sequence of n positive integers (not necessarily distinct) is called full if it satisﬁes the following condition: for each positive integer k ≥ 2, if the number k appears in the sequence then so does the number k − 1, and moreover the ﬁrst occurrence of k − 1 comes before the last occurrence of k. For each n, how many full sequences are there? 32. Prove that the number of trees with n vertices (labeled {1, 2, · · · , n}) is nn−2. 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
