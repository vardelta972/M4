Other useful generating functions include exponential generating functions, and Dirichlet series (used in number theory). 3 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 Problem Solving Session August 1, 2007 1.

(Britain 1994) An increasing sequence of integers is said to be alternating if it starts with an odd term, the second term is even, the third term is odd, the fourth is even, and so on. The empty sequence is counted as alternating. Let An denote the number of alternating sequences involving only the integers 1, 2, . . . , n.

We say that the ai’s are the parts of the partition. For example, p(5) = 7, as the 7 partitions of n = 5 are 5, 4 + 1, 3 + 2, 3 + 1 + 1, 2 + 2 + 1, 2 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1. By convention, p(0) is deﬁned to be 1. 1. Let p(n) denote the number of partitions of n. Show that the generating function for p(n) is ∑ n≥0 p(n)x n = ( 1 1 − x ) ( 1 1 − x2 ) ( 1 1 − x3 ) · · · . 2. Let n be a positive integer. Let f (n) denote the number of partitions of n with distinct parts, and let g(n) denote the number of partitions of n with all parts being odd numbers. Prove that f (n) = g(n). 3. (a) Show that every positive integer can be uniquely written as a sum of distinct powers of 2. (b) Show that every integer can be uniquely written as a sum of the form ∑∞ k=0 ak3k, where ak ∈ {−1, 0, 1}. 4. (Putnam 1957) Let α(n) be the number of representations of a positive integer n as sum of 1’s and 2’s, taking order into account. For example, since 4 = 1 + 1 + 2 = 1 + 2 + 1 = 2 + 1 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, we have α(4) = 5. Let β(n) be the number of representations of n that are sums of integers greater than 1, again taking order into account. For example, since 6 = 4 + 2 = 2 + 4 = 3 + 3 = 2 + 2 + 2, we have β(6) = 5. Show that α(n) = β(n + 2). 5. (IMO Shortlist 1998) Let a0, a1, a2, . . . be an increasing sequence of nonnegative integers such that every nonnegative integer can be expressed uniquely in the form ai + 2aj + 4ak, where i, j, k are not necessarily distinct. Determine a1998. 6. Euler’s Pentagonal Numbers Theorem. Show that ∞∏ n=1 (1 − xn) = 1 + ∞∑ k=1(−1) k (x k(3k−1)/2 + xk(3k+1)/2) = 1 − x − x2 + x5 + x 7 − x12 − x 15 + x22 + x26 − · · · . 5 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 Problem Solving Session August 2, 2007 1.

In how many ways can we ﬁll a bag with n fruits subject to the following constraints? • The number of apples must be even. • The number of bananas must be a multiple of 5. • There can be at most four oranges. • There can be at most one pear. 2. Show that every integer has a unique base (−4) representation. That is, every integer can be written uniquely as ∑∞ k=0 ak(−4)k, where ak ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}. 3. Let n be a positive integer. Show that the number of partitions of n into parts which have at most one of each distinct even part (e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) equals the number of partitions of n in which each part can appear at most three times (e.g. 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 4). 4. Does there exist a subset S of the positive integers satisfying: for each positive integer n, the number of partitions of n, where each part occurs at most twice, equals to the number of partitions of n into parts that are elements of S? 5. Let n be a positive integer. Show that the number of partitions of n, where each part appears at least twice, is equal to the number of partitions of n into parts all of which are divisible by 2 or 3. 6. How many polynomials P with coeﬃcients 0, 1, 2 or 3 have P (2) = n, where n is a given positive integer? 6 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 Lecture 13 : Generating Functions III Yufei Zhao August 3, 2007 1. Suppose the positive integers have been expressed as a disjoint union of arithmetic progres- sions {ai + ndi}∞ n=0, i = 1, 2, . . . , k. (a) Show that 1 d1 + 1 d2 + · · · + 1 dk = 1. (b) Show that a1 d1 + a2 d2 + · · · + ak dk = k + 1 2 . (c) Show that di = dj for some i ̸= j. 2. (Putnam 2000) Let S0 be a ﬁnite set of positive integers. We deﬁne ﬁnite sets S1, S2, . . . of positive integers as follows: the integer a is in Sn+1 if and only if exactly one of a − 1 or a is in Sn. Show that there exist inﬁnitely many integers N for which SN = S0 ∪ {N + a : a ∈ S0}. 3. (Putnam 2003) For a set S of nonnegative integers, let rS(n) denote the number of ordered pairs (s1, s2) such that s1 ∈ S, s2 ∈ S, s1 ̸= s2 and s1 + s2 = n. Is it possible to partition the nonnegative integers into two sets A and B in such a way that rA(n) = rB(n) for all n? 4. Let (a1, a2, . . . , an) and (b1, b2, . . . , bn) be two diﬀerent unordered n-tuples of integers such that the sequences a1 + a2, a1 + a3, . . . , an−1 + an (all pairwise sums ai + aj, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) and b1 + b2, b1 + b3, . . . , bn−1 + bn (all pairwise sums bi + bj, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n) coincide up to a permutation. Prove that n is a power of two. 5. (IMO 1995) Let p be an odd prime number. How many p-element subsets A of {1, 2, . . . , 2p} are there such that the sums of its elements are divisible by p? 7 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 Problem Solving Session August 3, 2007 1. (Putnam 2001) Adrian has the coins C1, C2, . . . , Cn. For each k, Ck is biased so that, when tossed, it has probability 1/(2k + 1) of showing heads. If the n coins are tossed, what is the probability that the number of heads is odd? Express the answer as a rational function of n. 2. Each vertex of a regular polygon is colored with one of a ﬁnite number of colors so that the points of the same color are the vertices of some new regular polygon. Prove that at least two of the polygons obtained are congruent. 3. A standard die is labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (one integer per face). When you roll two standard dice, it is easy to compute the probability of the various sums. For example, the probability of rolling two dice and getting a sum of 2 is just 1/36, while the probability of getting a 7 is 1/6. Is it possible to construct a pair of nonstandard six-sided dice (possibly diﬀerent from one another) with positive integer labels that nevertheless are indistinguishable from a pair of standard dice, if the sum of the dice is all that matters? For example, one of these nonstandard dice may have the label 8 on one of its faces, and two 3’s. But the probability of rolling the two and getting a sum of 2 is still 1/36, and the probability of getting a sum of 7 is still 1/6. 4. Let p be a prime. Compute the number of subsets T of {1, 2, . . . , p} such that p divides the sum of the elements in T . 5. (Putnam 1997) Let am,n denote the coeﬃcient of xn in the expansion of (1 + x + x2)m. Prove that for all k ≥ 0, 0 ≤ ⌊2k/3⌋∑ i=0 (−1) iak−i,i ≤ 1. 6. A ﬁnite sequence a1, a2, . . . , an of real numbers is called k-balanced if am + am+k + am+2k + · · · is the same for any k = 1, 2, . . . , p. Suppose that the sequence a0, a1, . . . , a49 is k-balanced for k = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, and 17. Prove that a0 = a1 = · · · = a49 = 0. 8 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 Lecture 14 : When Worlds Collide—Algebraic Combinatorics Yufei Zhao August 4, 2007 1.

What is the largest possible value of m? 5. (Crux 3037) There are 2007 senators in a senate. Each senator has enemies within the senate. Prove that there is a non-empty subset K of senators such that for every senator in the senate, the number of enemies of that senator in the set K is an even number. 6. Let a1, a2, . . . , a2n+1 be real numbers, such that for any 1 ≤ i ≤ 2n + 1, we can remove ai and separate the remaining 2n numbers into two groups with equal sums. Show that a1 = a2 = · · · = a2n+1. 7. Odd vertex cover. (Iran TST 1996, Germany TST 2004) Let G be a ﬁnite simple graph, and there is a light bulb at each vertex of G. Initially, all the lights are oﬀ. Each step we are allowed to chose a vertex and toggle the light at that vertex as well as all its neighbors’.

Short answer questions: correct answers are worth full points in this problem. (a) [5] Let α, β be complex numbers. Determine the generating function for the sequence (an)∞ n=0 deﬁned by a0 = α, a1 = β, and an = an−1 + an−2, n ≥ 2. Solution: Let A(x) = ∑n≥0 anxn be the generating function. Then A(x) = ∑ n≥0 anxn = α + βx + ∑ n≥2 anxn = α + βx + ∑ n≥2 an−1xn + ∑ n≥2 an−2xn = α + βx + x(A(x) − α) + x2A(x). Solving for A(x) gives A(x) = α + (β − α)x 1 − x − x2 . (b) [5] Determine the generating function for the sequence (bn)∞ n=0 deﬁned by b0 = 0, and bn = 2bn−1 + n for n ≥ 1. Solution: Let B(x) = ∑ n≥0 bnxn be the generating function. Then B(x) = ∑ n≥0 bnxn = ∑ n≥1 bnxn = ∑ n≥1 2bn−1xn + ∑ n≥1 nxn = 2xB(x) + x (1 − x)2 . Solving for B(x) gives B(x) = x (1 − x)2(1 − 2x) . 2. [10] Let n be a positive integer. Show that the number of partitions of n into odd parts greater than 1 is equal to the number of partitions of n into unequal parts none of which is a power of two. Solution: Let an denote the number of partitions of n into odd parts greater than 1. The generating function for (an) is A(x) = 1 (1 − x3)(1 − x5)(1 − x7) · · · . Also, let bn denote the number of partitions of n into unequal parts none of which is a power of two. The generating function for (bn) is B(x) = (1 + x)(1 + x2)(1 + x3)(1 + x4) · · · (1 + x)(1 + x2)(1 + x4)(1 + x8) · · · . Note that we have (1 + x)(1 + x 2)(1 + x4)(1 + x8) · · · = (1 − x2)(1 − x4)(1 − x8) · · · (1 − x)(1 − x2)(1 − x4) · · · = 1 1 − x , 11 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 and (1 + x)(1 + x2)(1 + x3)(1 + x4) · · · = (1 − x2)(1 − x4)(1 − x6) · · · (1 − x)(1 − x2)(1 − x3) · · · = 1 (1 − x)(1 − x3)(1 − x5)(1 − x7) · · · . Combining the two, we ﬁnd that A(x) = B(x). Therefore, an = bn for all n, as desired. 3. [10] Seven students take a mathematical exam. Every problem was solved by at most 3 students. For every pair of students, there is at least one problem that they both solved. Determine, with proof, the minimum number of problems on this exam. Solution: Assume that there are n problems. Let T denote the number of pairs (P, S), where P is a problem, and S is a pair of students who both solved P . On one hand, since every problem was solved at at most 3 students, we have T ≤ (3 2 )n = 3n. On the other hand, since there is such a pair (P, S) for every pair of students, we have T ≥ (7 2 ) = 21. Thus, 3n ≥ 21, so n ≥ 7. Let us show that n = 7 can be attained. Label the problems 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and the let each of the following set denote the set of problems that an individual a student has solved: {1, 2, 3}, {1, 4, 7}, {1, 5, 6}, {2, 5, 7}, {2, 4, 6}, {3, 4, 5}, {3, 6, 7}. Therefore, the minimum number of problems on this exam is 7. Remarks: Although the construction can be found by trial and error, it can be motivated by the Fano plane, which is depicted below. Each vertex represents a problem, and each line (including the center circle) represents a student who solved the problems that the line passes through. 1 2 345 6 7 4. [10] Find the number of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , 2007} (including the empty set) the sum of whose elements is divisible by 17. Solution: Consider the polynomial f (x) = (1 + x)(1 + x 2)(1 + x3) · · · (1 + x2007). Every subset {a1, a2, . . . , ak} ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , 2007} corresponds to a term in the expansion of f (x), namely xa1+a2+···+ak . Therefore, for each m, the coeﬃcient of xm is f (x) equals to the number of subsets of {1, 2, . . . , 2007} the sum of whose elements is m. Therefore, we need the 12 AwesomeMath 2007 Track 1 — Combinatorics Week 3 ﬁnd the sum of the coeﬃcients of x0, x17, x34, . . . , x2006. This can be done using the roots of unity. Let ζ = e2πi/17. Then, the answer equals to 1 17 (f (1) + f (ζ) + f (ζ 2) + · · · + f (ζ 16)) . We must evaluate this expression. First, notice that since the zeros of x17 − 1 are 1, ζ, ζ 2, . . . , ζ 16, so x17 − 1 = (x − 1)(x − ζ)(x − ζ 2) · · · (x − ζ 16). Setting x = −1 yields the identity (1 + 1)(1 + ζ)(1 + ζ 2) · · · (1 + ζ 16) = 2. Note that for 1 ≤ k ≤ 16, {0, k, 2k, 3k, . . . , 16k} is a permutation of {0, 1, 2, 3, . . . , 16} as residues in mod 17. It follows that (1 + 1)(1 + ζ k)(1 + ζ 2k) · · · (1 + ζ 16k) = 2. Consequently, since 2007 = 17 · 118 + 1, we have f (ζ k) = (1 + ζ k)(1 + ζ 2k) · · · (1 + ζ 2007k) = [(1 + 1)(1 + ζ k)(1 + ζ 2k) · · · (1 + ζ 16k) ]118 (1 + ζ k) = 2 118(1 + ζ k). Also, f (1) = 22007. Therefore, 1 17 (f (1) + f (ζ) + f (ζ 2) + · · · + f (ζ 16) ) = 1 17 (2 2007 + 2118(16 + ζ + ζ 2 + ζ 3 + · · · + ζ 16)) = 1 17 2118 (2 1889 + 15) . Thus, the answer is 2118(21889+15) 17 . 13","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
