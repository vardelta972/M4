Then a ϕ(m) = 1 for all a ∈ Z ∗ m. • (Sun Tzu) Suppose pk1 1 · · · pkn n is the prime factorization of m. Then Zm = Z p k1 1 × · · · × Zp kn n . • (Primitive Root) Let p and k be an odd prime and a positive integer. Then the group Z ∗ pk is cyclic. • (Quadratic Residues) When p is an odd prime number and a is an integer, the Legendre symbol ( a p ) is deﬁned to be 0 if p | a, 1 if a is a square modulo p, and −1 otherwise. It has many properties: ( a p ) ≡ a (p−1)/2 (mod p), ( ab p ) = ( a p ) ( b p ) ( −1 p ) = (−1) (p−1)/2, ( 2 p ) = (−1) (p 2−1)/8 ( q p ) = (−1) (p−1)(q−1)/4 ( p q ) (Quadratic Reciprocity) • (Pythagorean Triples) The primitive triples a, b, c of positive integers such that a 2 + b2 = c 2 can be expressed as m2 − n2, 2mn, m 2 + n2 where m and n are positive integers. • (Pell’s Equation) Let D be positive integer that is not a perfect square. Then the equation m2 − Dn 2 = 1 has the following solutions (m, n) in nonnegative integers: the trivial solution (1, 0) and an inﬁnite fam- ily {(mi, ni)}i≥1 generated as mi + ni√D = (m1 + n1√D) i where (m1, n1) is the fundamental solution, i.e. the one with the minimal positive n. The related equation m2 − Dn 2 = −1 may not have nontrivial solutions; if it does, inﬁnitely many (but not necessarily all) solutions can be generated in a similar fashion. • (Dirichlet) An arithmetic progression of integers contains inﬁnitely many primes, unless all of its terms share a common divisor greater than 1. • (Lucas) (a b) ≡ (ak bk) · · · (a0 b0) (mod p), where akak−1 · · · a0 and bkbk−1 · · · b0 are the base p representa- tions of a and b. • (Wolstenholme) (ap bp) ≡ (a b) (mod p3) for any prime p ≥ 5. Suppose the positive integers are partitioned into k subsets N1, . . . , Nk. • (Van der Waerden) There exist arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions in some subset Ni. • (Folkman) There exist arbitrarily large sets S such that the sum of every nonempty subset of S belongs to some Ni. 1 Problems All of the following problems are from 2000-2007 IMO short lists, so you should already know how to solve them. 1.
