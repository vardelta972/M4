This arti- cle is centered around two very powerful tools for solving polynomial-type inequalities: the SOS technique and Chinese Dumbass Notation. 1 Introducing SOS The whole point of SOS is so that you can use AM-GM backwards. –MOP 2012 1.1 A Motivating Example Example 1. For a, b, c ≥ 0, prove that 2 3 (a2 + b 2 + c 2)2 ≥ a3(b + c) + b 3(c + a) + c 3(a + b). Solution. Schurhead is not suﬃcient here. Thinking wishfully, we can write down the two inequalities 1 2 (a4 + b 4) ≥ 1 2 (a 3b + ab 3) 2a 2b 2 ≤ a 3b + ab 3 The cyclic sum of these two inequalities will yield the desired quantity. Unfortunately, we’re not allowed to add two diﬀerent inequalities in diﬀerent directions. Or can we? Rewrite the two inequalities as: 1 2 (a2 + ab + b 2) (a − b)2 ≥ 0 (−ab)(a − b)2 ≤ 0 Now their “sum” is: 1 2 (a2 − ab + b 2)(a − b) 2 ≥ 0 which is true! So our attempt to add two inequalities pointing in diﬀerent directions has led to the identity: 1 2 ∑ cyc (a2 − ab + b 2)(a − b)2 ≥ 0 and the problem is solved. 1 Supersums of Square-Weights 1 Introducing SOS This is a strong way to motivate the method: by factoring out a square (a − b)2, we can “measure” the strength of an inequality that we are trying to apply, and thus we may add and subtract these square weights without regards to direction. 1.2 The SOS Theorem The basic idea is to write an inequality in the form Sa(b − c) 2 + Sb(c − a)2 + Sc(a − b) 2 ≥ 0. If it so happens that Sa, Sb and Sc are nonnegative, then we are done. For sharper inequalities this may not be the case; however, most of the time we can still ﬁnish using some minor adjustments. Some of the nicer estimates are provided below. They are drawn from [1]. Theorem 1 (Pham Kim Hung). Consider the sum S = Sa(b−c)2+Sb(c−a)2+Sc(a−b)2. Then S ≥ 0 if any of the following take place: (i) Sa, Sc, Sa + 2Sb, Sc + 2Sb are all nonnegative. (ii) Sb, Sa + Sb and Sb + Sc are all nonnegative when b is the median of {a, b, c}. (iii) Sb, Sc and b2Sa + a2Sb are all nonnegative when a ≥ b ≥ c. Proof. For the ﬁrst part, the AM-GM (a + c)2 + (2b)2 ≥ 4b(a + c) yields (a − c)2 ≤ 2(a − b)2 + 2(b − c)2. If Sb ≥ 0 we are already done; else make the estimate S ≥ Sc(a − b) 2 + Sa(c − b) 2 + (2(a − b)2 + 2(b − c)2) Sb = (Sc + 2Sb)(a − b)2 + (Sa + 2Sb)(c − b)2 ≥ 0. For the second part, we have (b − a)(b − c) ≤ 0 ⇒ (a − c)2 ≥ (a − b)2 + (b − c)2, so we make the estimate S ≥ Sa(b − c)2 + Sc(a − c) 2 + Sb ((b − c) 2 + (a − c) 2) = (Sa + Sb)(b − c) 2 + (Sb + Sc)(a − c)2 ≥ 0. The third part follows from observing that when a ≥ b ≥ c we have a−c b−c ≥ a b , so that (a − c)2 ≥ a2 b2 (b − c)2. Hence, we drop the Sc(a − b)2 term to obtain S ≥ Sa(b − c) 2 + Sb(a − c) 2 ≥ Sa(b − c) 2 + Sb ( a2(b − c)2 b2 ) = ( b − c b )2 (b 2Sa + a 2Sb) ≥ 0. 2 Supersums of Square-Weights 2 Chinese Dumbass Notation 2 Chinese Dumbass Notation Before proceeding further I would like to make sure the reader is acquainted with the extremely useful Chinese Dumbass Notation, as described in [2]. Chinese Dumbass No- tation is a convenient way of presenting a polynomial inequality, making it signiﬁcantly easier to ﬁnd the suitable applications. The idea is that the coeﬃcients of an inequality of the form P (a, b, c) ≥ 0 are held in a triangle of side length deg P + 1, where the coeﬃcient of the axbycz term are located at the point with barycentric coordinates (x : y : z). Explicitly for, say, the third degree: [a3] [a2b] [ab2] [ab2] [abc] [ac2] [b3] [b2c] [bc2] [c3] To further illustrate the point, here are some common inequalities: 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 -1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 -1 -1 -1 3 -1 1 -1 -1 1 1 -2 0 1 0 0 2 -3 -3 4 0 4 -3 0 0 -3 2 -3 4 -3 2 1 -1 -1 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 -1 1 0 1 -1 1 -1 0 0 -1 1 Figure 1: First row: b3 + c3 ≥ bc(b + c), a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca and 3rd degree Schur. Second row: (a − b)2 ≥ 0, our ﬁrst example, and 5th degree Schur. What makes this notation powerful? Once one recognizes Schur and AM-GM, then it is visually very easy to see how strong1 the inequality is. Furthermore, if one is using SOS, then they can pull out things like {1, −2, 1} and {1, −1, −1, 1} from rows (things like the upper-left diagram). One may also recognize {1, −4, 6, −4, 1} as (a − b)4. Finally, one can often use the identity a3 + b3 + c3 − 3abc = 1 2 ∑ cyc(a + b + c)(b − c)2 to convert a 3-variable application of AM-GM to SOS form. But it is usually suﬃcient to just add/subtract things which are parallel to the sides of the triangle. 2.1 Chinese Dumbass Notation: An Example To impress the usefulness of this notation, we provide an instructive example. The unfamiliar reader is strongly encouraged to try and solve this problem (via expansion) before reading the solution below. Example 2 (MOP 2011). Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 3. Show that 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≥ 1 + 2 √ a2 + b2 + c2 3abc . 1In particular, if the last row sums to zero then equality holds at b = c, a = 0. 3 Supersums of Square-Weights 3 Some Examples Solution. Homogenizing and rearranging, this becomes ( (a + b + c) ( 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ) − 3)2 ≥ 4 ( (a + b + c)(a2 + b2 + c2) abc ) Expanding and clearing denominators, this reduces to ∑ sym a4b 2 + 2 ∑ cyc a 3b 3 + 6a 2b 2c 2 ≥ 2 ∑ cyc a 4bc + 2 ∑ sym a 3b 2c. Trying to ﬁght with this mess is no easy task. But watch how easy the problem once we put in a triangle: 0 0 0 1 -2 1 2 -2 -2 2 1 -2 6 -2 1 0 -2 -2 -2 -2 0 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 Figure 2: K4.1 expanded It’s hard to see without the triangle, but now we notice that third-degree Schur appears upside-down! The {1, −2, 1} on each side also die oﬀ: so this problem is merely the identity ∑ cyc a4(b − c) 2 + ∑ cyc ab(ab − bc)(ab − ac) ≥ 0. which is evident. 3 Some Examples 3.1 SOS vs Schur Example 3. Let a, b, c be nonnegative reals. Show that a3 + b3 + c3 + 3abc ≥ a2(b + c) + b2(c + a) + c2(a + b). Solution. Double both sides and write the inequality in the triangle: 2 -2 -2 -2 6 -2 2 -2 -2 2 Figure 3: Third-degree Schur We can take out ∑cyc a3 + b3 − a2b − ab2 = ∑ cyc(a + b)(a − b)2 which will leave us a hexagon in the center; which we break up − ∑cyc a(b − c)2. Hence the original problem is equivalent to 1 2 ∑ cyc (b + c − a)(b − c) 2 ≥ 0. If a ≥ b ≥ c then it is trivial to see Sb, Sb + Sa and Sb + Sc are all nonnegative; hence we are done. 4 Supersums of Square-Weights 4 Too Lazy to Expand Exercise. Put fourth-degree Schur in SOS form. In fact, upon discovering (b−c)(b−a) = 1 2 ((b − c)2 + (b − a)2 − (a − c)2) for arbitrary r the inequality may be written as 1 2 ∑ cyc b r ((b − c) 2 + (b − a) 2 − (a − c) 2) = 1 2 ∑ cyc (b r + c r − ar)(b − c) 2. which is obviously nonnegative by the SOS criteria. 3.2 An Asymmetric Inequality Example 4 (Ukraine 2006). Let a, b, c be positive reals. Prove that 3(a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + abc) ≥ 4(a 2b + b 2c + c 2a). Solution. Seeking symmetry, we multiply both sides by six and write it as the sum 8 -16 8 8 0 -16 8 -16 8 8 10 -8 -8 -8 18 -8 10 -8 -8 10 Figure 4: Trying to get symmetry The left triangle is contrived using a multiple of the form ∑ cyc a(a − b)2 to get the second addend to be symmetric. Now, we can express it as 5 ∑ cyc(b + c)(b − c)2 − 3 ∑ cyc a(b − c)2. All in all, the total is ∑ cyc (13b + 5c − 3a)(b − c) 2 ≥ 0 which is not hard. To be fair, the two triangles above are already nonnegative as is, meaning that simple AM-GM and Schur was suﬃcient. 4 Too Lazy to Expand Up to now, we have used SOS on an inequality only if it could be written in Chinese Dumbass notation. In fact, with a bit more precision, one can use SOS on inequalities with fractions without expanding. An extremely useful fact is as follows: Fact. If a polynomial expression f (a, b, c) is (i) symmetric in a and b (that is, f (a, b, c) = f (b, a, c)), and (ii) zero when a = b (that is, f (a, a, c) = 0) then it is divisible by (a − b)2. This means that, for example, the expression a2 b+c + b2 c+a − 4ab a+b+2c is divisible by (a−b)2: it’s just a matter of computation to extract the factor. 5 Supersums of Square-Weights 4 Too Lazy to Expand 4.1 A Perfect Example Example 5 (Calvin Deng, ELMO Shortlist 2010). Let a, b, c be positive reals. Prove that (a − b)(a − c) 2a2 + (b + c)2 + (b − c)(b − a) 2b2 + (c + a)2 + (c − a)(c − b) 2c2 + (a + b)2 ≥ 0. Solution. We could not have asked for more here: the ﬁrst two fractions are symmetric in a and b, but even better, it’s downright obvious that it becomes zero at a = b. The rest is just courage: (a − b)(a − c) 2a2 + (b + c)2 + (b − c)(b − a) 2b2 + (c + a)2 = (a − b) ( a − c 2a2 + (b + c)2 − b − c 2b2 + (c + a)2 ) = (a − b) · (a − c)(2b2 + (c + a)2) − (b − c)(2b2 + (c + a)2) (2a2 + (b + c)2)(2b2 + (c + a)2) = (a − b) · (a3+a2c+2ab2−ac2−2b2c−c3)−(b3+b2c+2a2b−bc2−2a2c−c3) (2a2+(b+c)2)(2b2+(c+a)2) = (a − b) · (a3−b3)+c(a2−b2)+2ab(b−a)+c2(b−a)+2c(a2−b2) (2a2+(b+c)2)(2b2+(c+a)2) = (a − b) 2 · a2 + ab + b2 + c(a + b) − 2ab − c2 + 2c(a + b) (2a2 + (b + c)2)(2b2 + (c + a)2) = (a − b) 2 · a2 − ab + b2 + 3c(a + b) − c2 (2a2 + (b + c)2)(2b2 + (c + a)2) Taking the cyclic sum of this quantity and dividing by two will yield the left-hand side of the inequality. At this point we deﬁnitely do not want to try and apply one of the criteria; even clearing denominators doesn’t look too terrible, since we’ve already done a good chunk of the work.2 But we’ve actually chosen the addends here in a good way; assume that c = min{a, b, c}. Then we can drop the rightmost term (c−a)(c−b) 2c2+(a+b)2 ≥ 0, and this is what remains of the left-hand side. But when c = min{a, b, c} this is clearly nonnegative! Second Solution. We invoke the powerful identity we discovered earlier with Schur: 2(a − b)(a − c) = (a − b)2 + (a − c)2 − (b − c) 2. Upon letting Xa = 1 2a2+(b+c)2 the inequality rewrites as 1 2 ∑ cyc (Xb + Xc − Xa) (b − c)2 ≥ 0 If a ≥ b ≥ c then Xa +Xc −Xb is evidently nonnegative. (In fact, check that Xc ≥ Xb). But now Sb, Sb + Sa and Sb + Sc are all nonnegative, so once again we are done. 4.2 Much Sharper Example 6 (Darij Grinberg). Show that for any positive reals a, b, c, (b + c)2 a2 + bc + (c + a)2 b2 + ca + (a + b)2 c2 + ab ≥ 6. 2And in general, if SOS it’s not obvious how to proceed from here, you’re still in a very good position to complete the expansion: you have only one extra denominator to deal with, and whatever you get will already be in SOS form. I suppose you can view this as a “safety net”. 6 Supersums of Square-Weights 5 The Ravi Substitution Solution. Begin again with algebra ∑ cyc −2 + (b + c)2 a2 + bc = ∑ cyc b2 + c2 − 2a2 a2 + bc = ∑ cyc b2 − a2 + c2 − a2 a2 + bc = ∑ cyc b2 − a2 a2 + bc + a2 − b2 b2 + ca At which point our lemma applies! = ∑ cyc (a 2 − b 2) ( 1 b2 + ca − 1 a2 + bc ) = ∑ cyc (a 2 − b 2) ( (a2 + bc) − (b2 + ca) (a2 + bc)(b2 + ca) ) = ∑ cyc (a − b)2(a + b) · a + b − c (a2 + bc)(b2 + ca) = 1 ∏cyc(a2 + bc) ∑ cyc (a − b)2(a + b)(a + b − c)(c 2 + ab) The equality case (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 0) appears, so we must be precise. Assume that a ≥ b ≥ c, and further that a ≥ b + c (otherwise the result is obvious). By the fourth criterion3 of Theorem 1 it suﬃces to prove that b 2(b + c)(b + c − a)(a2 + bc) + a 2(a + c)(a + c − b)(b 2 + ca) ≥ 0 ⇔ a 2(a + c)(a − b + c)(b 2 + ca) ≥ b 2(b + c)(a − b − c)(a 2 + bc). Again, keeping close in mind the equality case, we write a − b + c ≥ a − b − c, reducing the inequality to a2(a + c)(b2 + ca) ≥ b2(b + c)(a2 + bc). But this follows writing the inequalities a + c ≥ b + c and a2(b2 + ca) ≥ b2(a2 + bc) and multiplying them! 5 The Ravi Substitution When attacking a problem involving the sides of a triangle, it is often beneﬁcial to delay the Ravi substitution until after the inequality has been written in SOS form. Often by that point it is no longer necessary; especially with the following lemma: Lemma 2. Let a ≥ b ≥ c be the sides of a triangle. Then Sa(b−c)2+Sb(c−a)2+Sc(a−b)2 is nonnegative whenever Sa, Sb ≥ 0 and b 2Sb + c 2Sc ≥ 0. Proof. Drop the Sa(b − c)2 term. It suﬃces to show that Sb · ( a − c a − b )2 + Sc ≥ 0 Note that a−c a−b = 1 + b−c a−b is a decreasing function in a, so the inequality is sharpest when a = b + c (since of course a ≤ b + c). This is precisely the condition in the problem. 3We are motivated to choose this criterion for two reasons. First, it is tight at the equality case; secondly, this weights the positive Sb by a 2, which is “large” since a ≥ b + c. 7 Supersums of Square-Weights 5 The Ravi Substitution If worst comes to worst, we can still use the Ravi substitution with the added comfort that the degree will be two less, and the result will already be in SOS format. 5.1 A Small Example Example 7. Let a, b, c be the sides of a triangle. Prove that a3(b − c) + b 3(c − a) + c 3(a − b) + 2(a 2b 2 + b 2c 2 + c 2a 2) ≥ 2abc(a + b + c). 0 1 -1 2 -2 2 -1 -2 -2 1 0 1 2 -1 0 Figure 5: The corresponding triangle Solution. Of course one can simply perform the Ravi substitution and simply expand, but that’s too much work. After moving everything to one side, we can consider our given as the sum of the two triangles: 0 0 -2 0 2 0 -2 2 2 0 0 0 0 -2 0 0 1 1 2 -4 2 1 -4 -4 1 0 1 2 1 0 Figure 6: Forcing symmetry unto our inequality. The ﬁrst triangle is chosen so that the second is symmetric, and so that it can also be written as the sum: −2 ∑ cyc ab(b − c)2 The second triangle can then be simpliﬁed using standard techniques as ∑ cyc a(b + c)(b − c) 2 + ∑ cyc a2(b − c) 2 So the quantity in question is ∑ cyc (ab + ac − 2ab + a 2)(b − c) 2 = ∑ cyc a(c + a − b)(b − c) 2 ≥ 0. 5.2 Iran 1996 Finally, to top oﬀ this article we have the infamous Iran TST 1996 inequality. Example 8 (Iran TST 1996). Let x, y, z be positive reals. Prove that (xy + yz + zx) ( 1 (x + y)2 + 1 (y + z)2 + 1 (z + x)2 ) ≥ 9 4 . 8 Supersums of Square-Weights 6 Summary Solution. Rather than expanding directly, we apply the Ravi Substitution in reverse; that is, a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y. This yields (2ab + 2bc + 2ca − a 2 − b 2 − c 2) ( 1 a2 + 1 b2 + 1 c2 ) ≥ 9. This is much easier to expand! We get: ∑ cyc b 2c 2(2ab + 2bc + 2ca − a 2 − b 2 − c 2) ≥ 9a 2b 2c 2 Putting this in triangle form gives: 0 0 0 -1 0 -1 2 2 2 2 -1 2 -12 2 -1 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 -1 2 -1 0 0 Figure 7: Iran, expanded Taking out the {−1, 2, −1} on the edges and then knocking out the hexagon, we see that we may write this as − ∑ cyc b 2c 2(b − c) 2 + 2 ∑ cyc a2bc(b − c)2 = ∑ cyc bc(2a 2 − bc)(b − c) 2 Now applying Lemma 2, it suﬃces to prove that b 2 · ca(2b 2 − ca) + c 2 · ab(2c 2 − ab) ≥ 0 ⇔ 2abc (b 3 + c 3 − abc ) ≥ 0 and this is trivial. 6 Summary Some subset of the main ideas: • A polynomial inequality can be written in Chinese Dumbass notation, making it visually easy to see how sharp the inequality is. • If a polynomial inequality does not succumb to Schur and Muirhead, then SOS can yield a solution. • Cyclic (as opposed to symmetric) inequalities are no harder to put in SOS form. • With enough skill, SOS can be used without, before, or to simplify expansion. • SOS provides an alternative to the Ravi substitution in triangle-side inequalities. Often I will expand an inequality with the hope of applying Schurhead, and upon failing, fall back on SOS to provide stronger estimates. But as we have seen, this is far from the only way to use SOS. 9 Supersums of Square-Weights References 7 Exercises 1.
