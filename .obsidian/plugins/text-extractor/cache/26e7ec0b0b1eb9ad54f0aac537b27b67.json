Find all prime numbers p for which there exists a natural number 0 ≤ x < p, such that both f (x) and g(x) are divisible by p. Also ﬁnd all such x. (2) Prove that a polynomial of degree n that takes integer values at n + 1 con- secutive integers is an integer polynomial, i.e. it takes integer values at all integers. (3) Suppose that a natural number m and a real polynomial P (x) with degree n and leading coeﬃcient an is given such that P (x) is an integer divisible by m whenever x is an integer. Prove that n!an is divisible by m. (4) If a1, ..., an are integers, prove that the polynomial P (x) = (x − a1)(x − a2)...(x − an) − 1 is irreducible. (5) Let m, n and a be natural numbers and p < a − 1 a prime number. Prove that the polynomial P (x) = xm(x − a) n + p is irreducible. (6) Suppose that all zeros of a monic polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients have norm 1. Prove that all the roots are roots of unity. (7) (Romania-97) Let P (x) and Q(x) be monic irreducible polynomials over the rational numbers. Suppose that P and Q have respective roots α and β such that α + β is rational. Prove that the polynomial P (x) 2 − Q(x)2 has a rational root. (8) (Romania-97) Let n ≥ 2 be an integer and P (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + ... + a1x + 1 be a polynomial with positive integer coeﬃcients satisfying ak = an−k for k = 1, 2, ..., n − 1. Prove that there exists inﬁnitely many pairs x, y of positive integers such that x|P (y) and y|P (x). 1 2 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-I AL˙I G ¨UREL Problem 1, Solution by Sergei Bernstein: p|f (x) and p|g(x) ⇒ p|f (x) + g(x) = 2x5 + 10x4 + 8x3. Since x = 0 doesn’t work, 0 < x < p and p doesn’t divide x. So p|2x3 + 10x 2 + 8x = 2x(x + 4)(x + 1). On the other hand, p|f (x) − g(x) = 2x 3 + 10x2 + 2. Combining these, we get p|(2x3 + 10x2 + 8x) − (2x3 + 10x2 + 2) = 8x − 2. From before, we know that p|2 or p|x + 4 or p|x + 1. It is easily checked that p ̸= 2. Using Euclidean algorithm, we get p|17 or p|5, so the only possible answers are (x, p) = (13, 17) and (4, 5). Finally, plugging these in show that they both work □ Problem 2, Solution by Taylor and Toan Phan: We proceed by using induc- tion on the degree of P . If the degree is 0, the result is clear. Let’s assume the result for polynomials with degree at most k and let P have degree k + 1. Then, observe that Q(x) = P (x + 1) − P (x) takes integer values at k consecutive integers and has degree less than k, hence by our induction hypothesis Q takes integer values at all the integers. So does P □ Problem 3, Solution by Justin Brereton: For any number x, consider the ﬁnite diﬀerences of P (x), P (x + 1), ..., P (n + x). We know that the k-th order of ﬁnite diﬀerences is a degree n − k polynomial. Furthermore, P (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + ... + a0 ⇒ P (x + 1) − P (x) = nanxn−1 + ... We need only consider the leading coeﬃcient which is clearly n(n − 1)(n − 2)...(n − k + 1)an for the k-th order, therefore the constant term of the n-th order ﬁnite diﬀerence is n!an. Since all the values of P (x) are divisible by m, clearly any com- bination of their sums and diﬀerences is too, so m|n!an □ Problem 4, Solution by John Berman: Write P (x) = Q(x)R(x) with 0 < deg(Q), deg(R) < n for the sake of contradiction. Then Q(ai)R(ai) = −1 implies Q(ai) = ±1 and R(ai) = ∓1 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and in particular R(x) = −Q(x) for n values of x: {a1, a2, ..., an}. Since deg(Q + R) < n, this means that Q = −R. But then the leading term of P (x) = Q(x)R(x) would be negative. We deduce that P is irreducible, indeed □ Problem 5, Solution by Nicholas Triantaﬁllou: Suppose P is reducible and let P (x) = xm(a − a)n + p = Q(x)R(x). Q(0)R(0) = Q(a)R(a) = p. Without loss of generality, let Q(0) = ±1. Now, a|Q(a) − Q(0) and p < a − 1 so we cannot have Q(a) = ±p. Hence Q(a) = ±1, as well. Let α1, ..., αk be the roots of Q. Then α1...αk = ±1 and (a − α1)...(a − αk) = ±1. Also |αm j (αj − a) n| = p. Multiplying this from j = 1 through j = k we get 1 = p k, which is a contradiction unless degQ = 0. We conclude that P is irreducible, as desired □ 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-I AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 6, Solution by David B. Rush: Let {λ1, ..., λn} be the roots of a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Then observe that the polynomial with roots {λ m 1 , ..., λm n }, call it Pm(x), have integer coeﬃcients for all positive integers m which can be proved by induction on m using Vieta’s relations. Note that |λm j | = 1 for all j so the norm of the coeﬃcient of xk in Pm(x) is at most (n k). Hence the set P = {Pm(x) | m ∈ Z +} is ﬁnite. Thus λm j for m = 1, 2, ... take only ﬁnitely many values and we deduce that λj is a root of unity for all j □ Problem 7, Solution by Sergei Bernstein: Let R(x) := Q(α + β − x). Note that R(x) is monic-irreducible and that it has α as a root. P and R are both divisible by the minimal polynomial with α as a root but they are irreducible so P (x) = ±R(x). Finally, observe that P 2 ( α + β 2 ) = R2 ( α + β 2 ) = Q 2 ( α + β 2 ) with α+β 2 being the desired rational number □ Problem 8, Solution by Zhifan Zang: A trivial example is (x, y) = (1, 1). We will show that if a pair (x, y) satisﬁes the conditions with x ≤ y, then so does the pair (y, P (y) x ) where y ≤ P (y) x . To do this, we need to show that y|P ( P (y) x ). Now, P (y) ≡ 1 (mod y) and observe that since ak = an−k, P (x) = xnP ( 1 x ). So P ( P (y) x ) = ( P (y) x )n P ( x P (y) ) ≡ 1 xn P ( x 1 ) ≡ 0 (mod y) Finally, P (y) > y2 > xy so P (y) x > y □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
