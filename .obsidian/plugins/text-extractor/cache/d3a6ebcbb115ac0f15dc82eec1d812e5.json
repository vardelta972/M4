Many techniques, including Cauchy, H¨older, isolated fudging, Jensen, and smoothing exist and lead to simple, short solutions. That is not the purpose of the technique that I will be describing below. This technique is very straightforward, widely (but not universally) applicable, and can lead to a solution quickly, although it is almost never the nicest one. This technique is known as dumbassing, and is quite aptly named, as very little creativity is required. The crux of this method is homogenizing, clearing denominators, multiplying everything out, then ﬁnding the correct applications of Schur and/or AM-GM. Occaisionally, more advanced techniques may be required. 2 Chinese Dumbass Notation The ﬁrst and foremost purpose of this lecture is to introduce a relatively obscure but extremely useful notation. Before I describe it, I want you to be sure to realize that this notation is not standard. If you are going to use it on a contest, be sure to deﬁne it. With that warning in mind, allow me to describe the notation. Chinese Dumbass Notation is a concise and convenient way to write down three variable homogeneous expressions. Additionally, it provides a convenient way to multiply out two expressions with very little chance of dropping terms. Unlike cyclic and symmetric sum notation, Chinese Dumbass Notation allows one to keep like terms combined while not requiring any sort of symmetry from the expression. However, let’s ﬁrst look at an example that is symmetric. 0 8 8 20 28 20 8 28 28 8 0 8 20 8 0 The ﬁrst thing that one should note about this notation is that it is not linear. Chinese Dumbass Notation uses a triangle to hold the coeﬃcients of a three variable symmetric inequality in a way that is easy to visualize. The above triangle represents the expression ∑ sym 8a3b + ∑ sym 10a2b2 + ∑ sym 14a2bc. In general, a fourth degree expression would be written as follows. [a4] [a3b] [a3c] [a2b2] [a2bc] [a2c2] [ab3] [ab2c] [abc2] [ac3] [b4] [b3c] [b2c2] [bc3] [c4] Here [x] represents the coeﬃcient of x. In general, a degree d expression is represented by a triangle with side length d + 1 and the coeﬃcient of aαbβcγ is placed at Barycentric coordinates (α, β, γ). Multiplying these triangles is much like multiplying polynomials: you do so by shifting and adding. For example, 1 ( 1 1 2 ) ( 1 2 1 ) = 1   1 1 2 0 0 0   + 2   0 1 0 1 2 0   + 1   0 0 1 0 1 2   = 1 3 3 2 5 2 It is possible to shortcut this process much like how you shortcut polynomial multiplications. The main idea is that when you want to compute a coeﬃcient in the answer triangle, you look at all the ways it can be made in the factor triangles. Practicing this method will allow you to learn what form of multiplication works best for you. Now that we have the notation down, let’s look at some basic inequalities. 3 AM-GM The AM-GM inequality for two variables states that a2 +b2 ≥ 2ab. In other words, 1 −2 0 1 0 0 ≥ 0. Of course, this works anywhere in the triangle, even for spaces that aren’t consecutive. In general, weighted AM-GM allows us to take some positive coeﬃcients and, thinking of them as weights, “slide” them to their center of mass while not increasing the total sum of the expression. One extremely important application of this is to take a symmetric distribution of weights and slide them inward to another symmetric distribution of weights. The fact that these inequalities follow from AM-GM is known as Muirhead’s Inequality. For example, 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 ≥ 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 follows easily from Muirhead’s Inequality. We can see that in this case it also follows from a symmetric sum of the following application of weighted AM-GM: 0 2 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 ≥ 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 In general, citing Muirhead’s inequality is looked down upon, but it simpliﬁes many dumbassing argu- ments considerably as they are often a sum of many applications of AM-GM and ﬁnding the weights for each one takes considerable time. 4 Schur’s Inequality Schur’s inequality states that ∑ cyc ar(a−b)(a−c) ≥ 0 for all nonnegative numbers a, b, c, r. The prototypical application of Schur’s inequality looks as follows: 2 1 −1 −1 0 1 0 −1 1 1 −1 1 −1 0 −1 1 ≥ 0 As with AM-GM, the variables can be tweaked so that Schur’s inequality gives us ∑ cyc ar(as − bs)(as − cs) ≥ 0. In Chinese Dumbass Notation, this corresponds to manipulating the characteristic diamonds shown above, with r controlling the distance from the center and s controlling the size of each of the diamonds. The inequality shown above is with r = 2 and s = 1. 5 Examples Example 1. Prove that bc 2a + b + c + ac a + 2b + c + ab a + b + 2c ≤ 1 4 (a + b + c). Proof. We clear denominators to obtain that this is equivalent to 4 ∑ cyc bc(a + 2b + c)(a + b + 2c) ≤ (a + 2b + c)(a + b + 2c)(2a + b + c)(a + b + c) ⇔ 4 ∑ cyc   0 0 0 0 1 0   ( 1 1 2 ) ( 1 2 1 ) ≤ ( 1 1 2 ) ( 1 2 1 ) ( 2 1 1 ) ( 1 1 1 ) We’ll expand the left hand side as 4 ∑ cyc   0 0 0 0 1 0   ( 1 1 2 ) ( 1 2 1 ) = 4 ∑ cyc   0 0 0 0 1 0     1 3 3 2 5 2   = 4 ∑ cyc       0 0 0 0 1 0 0 3 3 0 0 2 5 2 0  | | | |  = 4       0 2 2 5 7 5 2 7 7 2 0 2 5 2 0  | | | |  = 0 8 8 20 28 20 8 28 28 8 0 8 20 8 0 3 We then expand the right hand side as ( 1 1 2 ) ( 1 2 1 ) ( 2 1 1 ) ( 1 1 1 ) =   1 3 3 2 5 2   ( 2 1 1 ) ( 1 1 1 ) =     2 7 7 7 16 7 2 7 7 2  | |  ( 1 1 1 ) = 2 9 9 14 30 14 9 30 30 9 2 9 14 9 2 The inequality is thus equivalent to showing that the diﬀerence is nonnegative. But the diﬀerence is 2 1 1 −6 2 −6 1 2 2 1 2 1 −6 1 2 ≥ 0 3 3 −6 0 −6 3 0 0 3 0 3 −6 3 0 ≥ 0 by Schur and AM-GM. Example 2. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that 1 a + 1 b + 1 c = a + b + c. Show that 1 (2a + b + c)2 + 1 (2b + c + a)2 + 1 (2c + a + b)2 ≤ 3 16. Proof. Notice that the condition is equivalent to ab + ac + bc = a2bc + ab2c + abc2. Additionally, by multiplying our desired inequality through by 16(2a + b + c) 2(2b + a + c) 2(2c + a + b) 2, we see that it is equivalent to 16 ∑ cyc (2b + c + a)2(2c + a + b)2 ≤ 3(2b + c + a)2(2c + a + b) 2(2a + b + c) 2 which is equivalent to 16 ∑ cyc (2b + c + a) 2(2c + a + b) 2(a2bc + ab2c + abc2) ≤ 3(2b + c + a) 2(2c + a + b)2(2a + b + c) 2(ab + bc + ac). 4 We will prove this inequality for all positive reals a, b, c. First, we rewrite the left hand side as 16 (∑ cyc ( 1 2 1 )2 ( 1 1 2 )2)       0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  | | | |  = 16  ∑ cyc   1 4 2 4 4 1     1 2 4 1 4 4           0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  | | | |  = 16       ∑ cyc 1 6 6 13 28 13 12 42 42 12 4 20 33 20 4  | | | |        0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  | | | |  = 16       9 38 38 59 112 59 38 112 112 38 9 38 59 38 9  | | | |        0 0 0 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0  | | | |  = 16               0 0 0 0 9 0 0 47 47 0 0 97 188 97 0 0 97 283 283 97 0 0 47 188 283 188 47 0 0 9 47 97 97 47 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  | | | | | | | | | | | |  = 0 0 0 0 144 0 0 752 752 0 0 1552 3008 1552 0 0 1552 4528 4528 1552 0 0 752 3008 4528 3008 752 0 0 144 752 1552 1552 752 144 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 Now we will rewrite the right hand side as 3 ( 1 2 1 )2 ( 1 1 2 )2 ( 2 1 1 )2   0 1 1 0 1 0   = 3   1 4 2 4 4 1     1 2 4 1 4 4     4 4 4 1 2 1     0 1 1 0 1 0   = 3       1 6 6 13 28 13 12 42 42 12 4 20 33 20 4  | | | |    4 4 4 1 2 1     0 1 1 0 1 0   = 3           4 28 28 77 162 77 106 350 350 106 77 350 550 350 77 28 162 350 350 162 28 4 28 77 106 77 28 4  | | | | | | | |    0 1 1 0 1 0   = 3               0 4 4 28 60 28 77 267 267 77 106 533 862 533 106 77 533 1250 1250 533 77 28 267 862 1250 862 267 28 4 60 267 533 533 267 60 4 0 4 28 77 106 77 28 4 0  | | | | | | | | | | | |  = 0 12 12 84 180 84 231 801 801 231 318 1599 2586 1599 318 231 1599 3750 3750 1599 231 84 801 2586 3750 2586 801 84 12 180 801 1599 1599 801 180 12 0 12 84 231 318 231 84 12 0 We want to show that the diﬀerence between the right hand side and the left hand side is nonnegative, but the diﬀerence is 0 12 12 84 36 84 231 49 49 231 318 47 −422 47 318 231 47 −778 −778 47 231 84 49 −422 −778 −422 49 84 12 36 49 47 47 49 36 12 0 12 84 231 318 231 84 12 0 6 which is clearly nonnegative by Muirhead’s inequality. Example 3. Let a, b, c be real numbers such that a2 +b2 +c2 = 1. Show that 1 1 − ab + 1 1 − bc + 1 1 − ca ≤ 9 2. Proof. We use the condition to obtain the equivalent inequality ∑ cyc a2 + b2 + c2 a2 + b2 + c2 − ab ≤ 9 2 . Clearing denominators, this is equivalent to 2 ∑ cyc (a2 + b2 + c2)(a2 + b2 + c2 − ab)(a2 + b2 + c2 − ac) ≤ 9(a2 + b2 + c2 − ab)(a2 + b2 + c2 − ac)(a2 + b2 + c2 − bc). We write the left hand side as 2 ∑ cyc   1 0 0 1 0 1     1 −1 0 1 0 1     1 0 −1 1 0 1   = 2 ∑ cyc   1 0 0 1 0 1         1 −1 −1 2 1 2 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 0 2 0 1  | | | |  = 2 ∑ cyc           1 −1 −1 3 1 3 −2 −2 −2 −2 3 1 6 1 3 −1 −1 −2 = 2 −1 −1 1 0 3 0 3 0 1  | | | | | | | |  = 2           3 −2 −2 9 −1 9 −4 −3 −3 −4 9 −3 18 −3 9 −2 −1 −3 −3 −1 −2 3 −2 9 −4 9 −2 3  | | | | | | | |  = 6 −4 −4 18 −2 18 −8 −6 −6 −8 18 −6 36 −6 18 −4 −2 −6 −6 −2 −4 6 −4 18 −8 18 −4 6 7 We now write the right hand side as 9   1 0 0 1 −1 1     1 −1 0 1 0 1     1 0 −1 1 0 1   = 9   1 0 0 1 −1 1         1 −1 −1 2 1 2 −1 −1 −1 −1 1 0 2 0 1  | | | |  = 9           1 −1 −1 3 0 3 −2 −1 −1 −2 3 −1 5 −1 3 −1 0 −1 −1 0 −1 1 −1 3 −2 3 −1 1  | | | | | | | |  = 9 −9 −9 27 0 27 −18 −9 −9 −18 27 −9 45 −9 27 −9 0 −9 −9 0 −9 9 −9 27 −18 27 −9 9 We now want to show that the diﬀerence between the right hand side and the left hand side is nonnegative. The diﬀerence is 3 −5 −5 9 2 9 −10 −3 −3 −10 9 −3 9 −3 9 −5 2 −3 −3 −5 3 −5 9 −10 9 −5 3 Here we have a bit of a sticky situation. Neither AM-GM nor Schur are strong enough to eliminate the −5a5b terms, so we need to be a bit smarter. Let’s look at the expansion of (a − b) 4. This is a4−4a3b+6a2b2−4ab3+b4. This might be strong enough to help us out here. We have that ∑ sym a2(a−b) 4 ≥ 0, or 2 −4 −4 7 0 7 −8 0 0 −8 7 0 0 0 7 −4 0 0 0 0 −4 2 −4 7 −8 7 −4 2 ≥ 0 Subtracting this from the expression above, we see that it suﬃces to show that the following expression is 8 nonnegative: 1 −1 −1 2 2 2 −2 −3 −3 −2 2 −3 9 −3 2 −1 2 −3 −3 2 −1 1 −1 2 −2 2 −1 1 By AM-GM we have 1 −1 −1 2 2 2 −2 −3 −3 −2 2 −3 9 −3 2 −1 2 −3 −3 2 −1 1 −1 2 −2 2 −1 1 ≥ 0 0 0 3 2 2 3 2 −2 −3 −3 −2 3 2 −3 9 −3 3 2 0 2 −3 −3 2 0 0 0 3 2 −2 3 2 0 0 ≥ 0 0 0 1 2 2 1 2 0 −3 −3 0 1 2 −3 9 −3 1 2 0 2 −3 −3 2 0 0 0 1 2 0 1 2 0 0 ≥ 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 −3 −3 0 0 −3 9 −3 0 0 3 −3 −3 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 which is nonnegative by Schur’s inequality. 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
