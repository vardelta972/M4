There are 8 CCTV cameras in a shop. Find the number of ON-OFF patterns of the cameras if at least three cameras have to be ON all the times. Solution: Total number of ON-OFF patterns is (because for each of the 8 places we have 2 options: ON or OFF). Now we shall ﬁnd the number of patterns where at least three cameras are not ON, i.e., where at most 2 cameras are ON. At most 2 means either 0, 1 or 2. The number of ways in which exactly k cameras are ON equals . Hence the number of ways in which at most 2 cameras are ON is found to be Ans: Comment: In this problem, we observed that, More generally, for every positive integer n, it holds that P2. In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘MISSISSIPPI’? In how many of them no two S’s are adjacent? Solution: (a) Since there are 4 S’s, 4 I’s and 2 P’s, so the count will be 11!/4!4! 2!. (b) First permute M,4 I’s, and 2 P’s, which can be done in 7!/4!2! ways and then put the 4 S’s between their 8 gaps, which can be done 8C4 ways. Hence the ﬁnal answer is 7!/4!2! 8C4. P3. Find the number of 6-digit natural numbers whose digits are chosen from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and each digit (that appears) appears at least twice. For instance, 123213, 111144 are valid, but 111223 is not. Solution: Depending on the composition of the digits, we divide the problem into the following cases: Case 1: The digits are {a, a, b, b, c, c} (a, b, c distinct, and unordered) and the number is a permutation of these digits. Here a, b, c can be chosen in 5C3 ways. Then permute the digits a, a, b, b, c, c in 6!/2!2!2! ways. 2 8 8 C k ( 8 0 ) + ( 8 1 ) + ( 8 2 ) = 1 + 8 + 8(8 − 1) 2 = 37. 2 8 − 37. ( 8 0 ) + ( 8 1 ) + ( 8 2 ) + ⋯ + ( 8 8 ) = 2 8 . ( n 0 ) + ( n 1 ) + ( n 2 ) + ⋯ + ( n n ) = 2 n . × Page of 1 2 Case 2: The digits are {a, a, a, a, b, b} (a, b distinct, and unordered) and the number is a permutation of these digits. Here a, b play different role, so they can be chosen in 5 4 ways.Then permute the digits a, a, a, a, b, b in 6!/4!2! ways. Why 5P2, not 5C2? Ans: {1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2} is different from {2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1}. Whereas {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3} is same as {1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 2}. Case 3: The digits are {a, a, a, b, b, b} (a, b distinct, and unordered). Here a, b can be chosen in 5C2 ways. Then permute the digits a, a, a, b, b, b in 6!/3!3! ways. Case 4: The digits are {a, a, a, a, a, a}. There are 5C1 such numbers. Final count: 5C3 6!/2!2!2! + 5 4 6!/4!2! + 5C2 6!/3!3! + 5C1. P4. Suppose 5 friends go to a shop to buy ice-cream cups. The shop has ice- cream cups of 4 ﬂavours, say {Chocolate, Mango, Vanilla, Strawberry}. In how many ways can they buy 5 ice-cream cups (1 for each)? Note that the cups of same ﬂavour are identical. Solution: For each friend, there are 4 options and the choice of each person is independent of the choice for the others. Hence the count should be .
