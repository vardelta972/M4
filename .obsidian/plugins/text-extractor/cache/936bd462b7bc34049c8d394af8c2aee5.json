Ironically, this is precisely what makes them diﬃcult: there are so many possible approaches. While many problems have somewhat ad hoc solutions, there are a few (very) general methods to keep in mind. • Extremal arguments. A good example is Sylvester’s theorem: Given a ﬁnite number of points in the plane, either (1) all the points are collinear; or (2) there is a line which contains exactly two of the points. • The convex hull. For any ﬁnite set of points in the plane, there exists a subset forming a convex polygon that contains all the points. • Helly’s theorem. Suppose that X1, X2, . . . , Xn is a ﬁnite collection of convex subsets of Rd, where n > d. If the intersection of every d + 1 of these sets is nonempty, then the whole collection has a nonempty intersection. (This theorem is used somewhat infrequently but worth knowing.) Puzzling Problems 1. True or false? If convex polygon A contains convex polygon B, then the perimeter of A is at least the perimeter of B. 2. Let S be the set of all polygonal areas in the plane. Prove that there is a function f : S → (0, 1) which satisﬁes f (S1 ∪ S2) = f (S1) + f (S2) for any S1, S2 ∈ S which have common points only on their borders. 3. A unit square is dissected into n > 1 rectangles such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the square. Any line, parallel to a side of the square and intersecting its interior, also intersects the interior of some rectangle. Prove that in this dissection, there exists a rectangle having no point on the boundary of the square. 4. A set of 101 points no three of which are collinear are chosen inside a unit square. Prove that some three of them form a triangle with area less than 1 for every integer n. Assume that each strip Sn is colored either red or blue, and let a and b be two distinct positive integers. Prove that there exists a rectangle with side lengths a and b such that its vertices have the same color. 6. Let k and n be integers with 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 2. Consider a set L of n lines in the plane such that no two of them are parallel and no three have a common point. Denote by I the set of intersection points of lines in L. Let O be a point in the plane not lying on any line of L. A point X ∈ I is colored red if the open line segment OX intersects at most k lines in L. Prove that I contains at least 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
