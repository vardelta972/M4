All answers must be expressed in sim- plest form unless speciﬁed otherwise. Only answers written on the answer sheet will be considered for grading. No calculators. 1. What is ∫ 10 0 (x − 5) + (x − 5)2 + (x − 5)3 dx? 2. Find the maximum value of ∫ 3π/2 −π/2 sin(x)f (x) dx subject to the constraint |f (x)| ≤ 5. 3. Calculate ∫ 35 25 1 x − x3/5 dx. 4. Compute the x-coordinate of the point on the curve y = √x that is closest to the point (2, 1). 5. Let f (x) = x + x2 2 + x3 3 + x4 4 + x5 5 , and set g(x) = f −1(x). Compute g(3)(0). 6. Compute lim x→0 ( sin x x ) 1 1−cos x . 7. A diﬀerentiable function g satisﬁes ∫ x 0 (x − t + 1)g(t) dt = x 4 + x 2 for all x ≥ 0. Find g(x). 8. Compute ∫ ∞ 0 ln x x2 + 4 dx. 9. Find the ordered pair (α, β) with non-inﬁnite β ̸= 0 such that lim n→∞ n2√1!2! · · · n! nα = β holds. 10. Find the maximum of ∫ 1 0 f (x) 3 dx given the constraints −1 ≤ f (x) ≤ 1, ∫ 1 0 f (x) dx = 0.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
