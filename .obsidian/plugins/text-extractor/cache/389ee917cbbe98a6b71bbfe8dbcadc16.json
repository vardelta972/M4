Let AOB be a given angle less than 180 ◦ and let P be an interior point of the angular region determined by ∠AOB. Show, with proof, how to construct, using only ruler and compasses, a line segment CD passing through P such that C lies on the ray OA and D lies on the ray OB, and CP : P D = 1 : 2. Solution: Draw a line parallel to OA through P . Let it intersect OB in M . Using compasses, draw an arc of a circle with centre M and radius M O to cut OB in L, L ̸= O. Again with L as centre and with the same radius OM draw one more arc of a circle to cut OB in D, D ̸= M . Join DP and extend it to meet OA in C. Then CD is the required line segment such that CP : P D = 1 : 2. This follows from similar triangles OCD and M P D. 2. Show that the equation a 3 + (a + 1) 3 + (a + 2) 3 + (a + 3) 3 + (a + 4) 3 + (a + 5) 3 + (a + 6) 3 = b4 + (b + 1) 4 has no solutions in integers a, b. Solution: We use divisibility argument by 7. Observe that the remainders of seven consecutive cubes modulo 7 are 0, 1, 1, 6, 1, 6, 6 in some (cyclic) order. Hence the sum of seven consecutive cubes is 0 modulo 7. On the other hand the remainders of two consecutive fourth powers modulo 7 is one of the sets {0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 4}, {4, 4}. Hence the sum of two fourth powers is never divisible by 7. It follows that the given equation has no solution in integers. 3. Let P (x) = x2 + 1 2 x + b and Q(x) = x2 + cx + d be two polynomials with real coeﬃcients such that P (x)Q(x) = Q (P (x) ) for all real x. Find all the real roots of P (Q(x) ) = 0. Solution: Observe that P (x)Q(x) = x4 + (c + 1 2 ) x3 + (b + c 2 + d ) x2 + ( d 2 + bc ) x + bd. Similarly, Q (P (x)) = ( x2 + 1 2 x + b)2 + c (x 2 + 1 2 x + b) + d = x4 + x3 + (2b + 1 4 + c) x2 + (b + c 2 ) x + b 2 + bc + d. Equating coeﬃcients of corresponding powers of x, we obtain c + 1 2 = 1, b + c 2 + d = 2b + 1 4 + c, d 2 + bc = b + c 2 , b 2 + bc + d = bd. Solving these, we obtain c = 1 2 , d = 0, b = −1 2 . Thus the polynomials are P (x) = x 2 + 1 2 x − 1 2 , Q(x) = x2 + 1 2 x. Therefore, P (Q(x) ) = (x2 + 1 2 x)2 + 1 2 (x2 + 1 2 x) − 1 2 = x 4 + x3 + 3 4 x2 + 1 4 x − 1 2 . It is easy to see that P (Q(−1)) = 0, P (Q(1/2)) = 0. Thus (x + 1) and (x − 1/2) are factors of P (Q(x)). The remaining factor is h(x) = x2 + 1 2 x + 1. The discriminant of h(x) is D = (1/4) − 4 < 0. Hence h(x) = 0 has no real roots. Therefore the only real roots of P (Q(x)) = 0 are −1 and 1/2. 2 4. Consider n2 unit squares in the xy-plane centred at point (i, j) with integer coordinates, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ n. It is required to colour each unit square in such a way that whenever 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and 1 ≤ k < l ≤ n, the three squares with centres at (i, k), (j, k), (j, l) have distinct colours. What is the least possible number of colours needed? Solution: We ﬁrst show that at least 2n − 1 colours are needed. Observe that squares with centres (i, 1) must all have diﬀrent colours for 1 ≤ i ≤ n; let us call them C1, C2, . . . , Cn. Besides, the squares with centres (n, j), for 2 ≤ j ≤ n must have diﬀerent colours and these must be diﬀerent from C1, C2, . . . , Cn. Thus we need at least n + (n − 1) = 2n − 1 colours. The following diagram shows that 2n − 1 colours will suﬃce. 5. Let Ω be a circle with a chord AB which is not a diameter. Let Γ1 be a circle on one side of AB such that it is tangent to AB at C and internally tangent to Ω at D. Likewise, let Γ2 be a circle on the other side of AB such that it is tangent to AB at E and internally tangent to Ω at F . Suppose the line DC intersects Ω at X ̸= D and the line F E intersects Ω at Y ̸= F . Prove that XY is a diameter of Ω. Solution: Draw the tangent P Q at D such that D is between P and Q. Join D to A, B and C. Let L = DA ∩ Γ1 and M = DB ∩ Γ1. Join C to L and M . Observe that ∠ADP = ∠LM D = ∠ABD. (1) Therefore LM is parallel to AB and hence ∠LM C = ∠M CB (alternate angles). Again observe that ∠ADC = ∠LDC = ∠LM C = ∠M CB = ∠M DC = ∠BDC. (2) 3 Thus CD bisects ∠ADB. Hence X is the midpoint of the arc AB not containing D. Similarly Y is the midpoint of the arc AB not containing F . Thus the arc XY is half of the sum of two arcs that together constitute the circumference of Ω and hence it is a diameter. 6. Let x, y, z be real numbers, each greater than 1. Prove that x + 1 y + 1 + y + 1 z + 1 + z + 1 x + 1 ≤ x − 1 y − 1 + y − 1 z − 1 + z − 1 x − 1 . Solution: We may assume that x = max{x, y, z}. There are two cases: x ≥ y ≥ z and x ≥ z ≥ y. We consider both these cases. The inequality is equivalent to { x − 1 y − 1 − x + 1 y + 1 } + { y − 1 z − 1 − y + 1 z + 1 } + { z − 1 x − 1 − z + 1 x + 1 } ≥ 0. This is further equivalent to x − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − x x2 − 1 ≥ 0. Suppose x ≥ y ≥ z. We write x − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − x x2 − 1 = x − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − y + y − x x2 − 1 . This reduces to (x − y) (x 2 − y2) (x2 − 1)(y2 − 1) + (y − z) (x2 − z2) (x2 − 1)(z2 − 1) . 4 Since x ≥ y and x ≥ z, this sum is nonnegative. Suppose x ≥ z ≥ y. We write x − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − x x2 − 1 = x − z + z − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − x x2 − 1 . This reduces to (x − z) (x2 − y2) (x2 − 1)(y2 − 1) + (z − y) (z2 − y2) (y2 − 1)(z2 − 1) . Since x ≥ z and z ≥ y, this sum is nonnegative. Thus x − y y2 − 1 + y − z z2 − 1 + z − x x2 − 1 ≥ 0 in both the cases. This completes the proof. ———-0———- 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
