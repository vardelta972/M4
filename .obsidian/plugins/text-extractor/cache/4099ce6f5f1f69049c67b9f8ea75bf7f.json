Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and suppose ∠ABC is the largest angle of the triangle. Let R be its circumcentre. Suppose the circumcircle of triangle ARB cuts AC again in X. Prove that RX is pependicular to BC. Solution: Extend RX to meet BC in E. We show that ∠XEC = 90◦. Join RA, RB and BX. Observe that ∠AXB = ∠ARB = 2∠C and ∠BXR = ∠BAR = 90◦ − ∠C. Hence ∠EXC = 180◦ − 2∠C − (90◦ − ∠C) = 90◦ − ∠C. This shows that ∠CEX = 90◦. 2. Find all real numbers x and y such that x2 + 2y2 + 1 2 ≤ x(2y + 1). Solution: We write the inequality in the form 2x2 + 4y2 + 1 − 4xy − 2x ≤ 0. Thus (x2 − 4xy + 4y2) + (x2 − 2x + 1) ≤ 0. Hence (x − 2y)2 + (x − 1)2 ≤ 0. Since x, y are real, we know that (x − 2y)2 ≥ 0 and (x − 1)2 ≥ 0. Hence it follows that (x − 2y)2 = 0 and (x − 1)2 = 0. Therefore x = 1 and y = 1/2. 3. Prove that there does not exist any positive integer n < 2310 such that n(2310 − n) is a multiple of 2310. Solution: Suppose there exists n such that 0 < n < 2310 and n(2310 − n) = 2310k. Then n2 = 2310(n − k). But 2310 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 11, the product of primes. Hence n − k = 2310l2 for some l. But n < 2310 and hence n − k < 2310. Hence l = 0. This forces n = k and hence n2 = 2310(n − k) = 0. Thus n = 0 and we have a contradiction. 4. Find all positive real numbers x, y, z such that 2x − 2y + 1 z = 1 2014, 2y − 2z + 1 x = 1 2014, 2z − 2x + 1 y = 1 2014. Solution: Adding the three equations, we get 1 x + 1 y + 1 z = 3 2014. We can also write the equations in the form 2zx − 2zy + 1 = z 2014, 2xy − 2xz + 1 = x 2014, 2yz − 2yx + 1 = y 2014. Adding these, we also get 2014 × 3 = x + y + z. Therefore ( 1 x + 1 y + 1 z ) (x + y + z) = 3 2014 × (2014 × 3) = 9. Using AM-GM inequality, we therefore obtain 9 = ( 1 x + 1 y + 1 z ) (x + y + z) ≥ 9 × (xyz)1/3 ( 1 xyz )1/3 = 9. Hence equality holds in AM-GM inequality and we conclude x = y = z. Thus 1 x = 1 2014 which gives x = 2014. We conclude x = 2014, y = 2014, z = 2014. 5. Let ABC be a triangle. Let X be on the segment BC such that AB = AX. Let AX meet the circumcircle Γ of triangle ABC again at D. Show that the circumcentre of △BDX lies on Γ. Solution: Draw perpendicular from A to BC and extend it to meet Γ in F . We show that F is the circumcentre of △BDX. Since AB = AX, we observe that F lies on the perpendicular bisector of BX. Join CF and CD. We observe that ∠ABX = ∠CDX and ∠AXB = ∠CXD. Hence △ABX is similar to △CDX. In particular △CDX is isosceles. Moreover, ∠BCF = ∠BAF and ∠DCF = ∠DAF . Since AF is the perpendicular bisector of BX, it also bisects ∠BAX. It follows that CF bisects ∠DCX and hence F lies on the perpendicular bisector of DX. Together F is the circumcentre of △BXD. 6. For any natural number n, let S(n) denote the sum of the digits of n. Find the number of all 3-digit numbers n such that S(S(n)) = 2. Solution: Observe that S(S(n)) = 2 implies that S(n) = 2, 11 or 20. Hence we have to ﬁnd the number of all all 3 digit numbers abc such that a + b + c = 2, 11 2 and 20. In fact we can enumerate all these: a + b + c = 2: abc = 101, 110, 200; a + b + c = 11; abc = 902, 920, 290, 209, 911, 191, 119, 803, 830, 308, 380, 812, 821, 182, 128, 218, 281, 731, 713, 317, 371, 137, 173, 722, 272, 227, 740, 704, 407, 470, 650, 605, 560, 506, 641, 614, 416, 461, 164, 146, 623, 632, 362, 326, 263, 236; a + b + c = 20; abc = 992, 929, 299, 983, 938, 398, 389, 839, 893, 974, 947, 794, 749, 479, 497, 965, 956, 659, 695, 596, 569, 884, 848, 488, 875, 875, 785, 758, 578, 587, 866, 686, 668, 776, 767, 677. There are totally 85 three digit numbers having second digital sum equal to 2. ———-00———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
