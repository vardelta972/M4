Let x and y be non-negative real numbers. Prove that (x + y3)(x3 + y) ≥ 4x2y2. When does equality hold? Solution: Applying the AM-GM inequality to each factor on the LHS we have x + y3 2 x3 + y 2 ≥ √xy3√ x3y = x2y2. The inequality follows. For equality we must have equality in each application of the AM-GM, so x = y3 and y = x3. This gives x = x9, with non-negative solutions x = 0, x = 1. So equality holds if and only if (x, y) equals (0, 0) or (1, 1). 2. Find all functions f : N → N that satisfy the following two conditions: (a) f (n) is a perfect square for all n ∈ N; (b) f (m + n) = f (m) + f (n) + 2mn for all m, n ∈ N. (For the purposes of this problem we will consider N to be the set {1,2,3,. . . }, i.e., 0 is not considered to be a natural number.) Solution: By condition (a) we must have f (1) = a2 for some positive integer a. We will prove by induction that f (n) = na 2 + n(n − 1) for all n. The base case n = 1 is true, by the deﬁnition of a, so suppose that f (n) = na 2 + n(n − 1) for some n ≥ 1, and consider f (n + 1). By condition (b) with m = 1 we have f (n + 1) = f (n) + f (1) + 2n = na 2 + n(n − 1) + a2 + 2n = (n + 1)a2 + (n + 1)n, which establishes the inductive step. We now aim to show that a = 1. Suppose then that a > 1, and let p be a prime factor of a. Then f (p) = pa2 + p(p − 1), and since it is divisible by p, it must be divisible by p2. Hence a2 + p − 1 is divisible by p. But this is a contradiction, as a and p are both divisible by p, so a must equal 1. Therefore f (n) = n 2 for all n is the only remaining possibility for f . This does indeed satisfy the conditions, and so is the only solution. 1 3. Consider two ordered sequences of real numbers a1 < a2 < · · · < an and b1 < b2 < · · · < bm, where n, m ∈ N, n, m ≥ 2. Prove that the set {ai + bj|1 ≤ i ≤ n, 1 ≤ j ≤ m} contains exactly n + m − 1 elements if and only if both sequences are arithmetic, with the same increment. Solution: Suppose ﬁrst that the sequences are both arithmetic, with the same increment d. Then ai = a1 + (i − 1)d and bj = b1 + (j − 1)d, giving ai + bj = a1 + b1 + (i + j − 2). This gives a total of n + m − 1 distinct values. To prove the opposite direction, place the sum ai + bj at the point (i, j) in the plane, and consider paths from (0, 0) to (n, m) that take steps of either (0, 1) or (1, 0) at each stage. Any such path requires exactly n + m − 2 steps and visits n + m − 1 sums; moreover, the sums visited increase monotonically along the path, because ai + bj < ai+1 + bj and ai + bj < ai + bj+1. The n + m − 1 sums visited along any such path must therefore be distinct; and since there are exactly n + m − 1 distinct sums, every such path visits all n + m − 1 distinct sums, in increasing order. The previous paragraph implies that ai + bj = ak + bl whenever i + j = k + l (consider the (i + j + 1)th sum visited along a path that begins with i steps left, followed by j steps up). For 1 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, 1 ≤ j ≤ m − 1 we therefore have ai+1 + bj = ai + bj+1, or ai+1 − ai = bj+1 − bj. The result follows. Alternate solution. The reverse implication may also be proved by induction on n + m, as follows. The base case is n + m = 4 (when n = m = 2), and here we have a1 + b1 < a2 + b1 < a2 + b2, a1 + b1 < a1 + b2 < a2 + b2. Since there are only three distinct sums we must have a1 + b2 = a2 + b1, from which we obtain a2 − a1 = b2 − b1. For the inductive step, we begin by observing (similarly to above) that a1 + b1 < a2 + b1 < · · · < an + b1 < an + b2 < · · · < an + bm, so there are necessarily at least n + m − 1 distinct values. Suppose now that n + m > 4, and without loss of generality assume that m > 2. Consider the set of sums obtained by eliminating bm from the sequence {bi}. This eliminates at least the sum an + bm, which is maximal, so it contains at most n + m − 2 values; but by the observation above it must also contain at least n + m − 2 values. It therefore contains exactly n + m − 2 values, and by the induction hypothesis, the sequences a1 < a2 < · · · < an and b1 < b2 < · · · < bm−1 are arithmetical with the same increment. We now apply the same argument to the sequences obtained by eliminating b1. This removes at least the sum a1 + b1, which is minimal, and as in the previous paragraph we conclude that the sequences a1 < a2 < · · · < an and b2 < b3 < · · · < bm are arithmetical with the same increment. The result now follows. 2 4. Determine the largest subset M ⊆ R+ such that the inequality √ab + √ cd ≥ √a + b + √c + d holds for all a, b, c, d ∈ M . Determine whether the inequality √ab + √ cd ≥ √a + c + √ b + d also holds for all a, b, c, d ∈ M . (Note that R + denotes the set of all positive real numbers.) Solution: If the inequality is to hold for all a, b, c, d in M , it must certainly hold when a = b = c = d ∈ M . In this case the inequality becomes 2a ≥ 2 √2a, which is equivalent to a 2 ≥ 2a ⇔ a2 − 2a ≥ 0 ⇔ a(a − 2) ≥ 0. For a > 0 this is equivalent to a ≥ 2, and therefore M ⊆ [2, ∞). If a, b ∈ [2, ∞) then a − 1, b − 1 ≥ 1, so (a − 1)(b − 1) ≥ 1. This gives ab ≥ a + b, and taking the square root we get √ ab ≥ √a + b. Since the same holds for c and d in [2, ∞) it follows that √ab + √ cd ≥ √a + b + √c + d for all a, b, c, d ∈ [2, ∞). Therefore M = [2, ∞). We now consider the second inequality √ ab + √ cd ≥ √a + c + √b + d, which is equivalent to ab + cd + 2√abcd ≥ a + b + c + d + 2√ (a + c)(b + d). Since we already know that ab ≥ a + b and cd ≥ c + d for a, b, c, d ∈ M , we need only show that √abcd ≥ √ (a + c)(b + d). This is equivalent to (ac)(bd) ≥ (a + c)(b + d), and since we have ac ≥ a + c, bd ≥ b + d for a, b, c, d ∈ M , we see that the second inequality holds also. 5. Let a, b, c be positive real numbers such that a + b + c ≥ abc. Prove that a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ √3abc. Solution: First of all note that a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca, by the rearrangement inequality, and hence 3(a 2 + b2 + c2) ≥ (a + b + c) 2. By the AM-GM inequality we have a + b + c ≥ 3(abc)1/3, and by the given condition we have a + b + c ≥ abc; taking each of these together with the inequality 3(a2 + b2 + c2) ≥ (a + b + c) 2 we get the two inequalities a2 + b2 + c 2 ≥ 1 3 (a + b + c)2 ≥ 3(abc)2/3 a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ 1 3 (a + b + c)2 ≥ 1 3(abc)2. 3 Since everything is positive we may raise the ﬁrst of these to the 3/4-th power, and the second to the 1/4-th, to get a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ 3 3/4(abc) 1/2 a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ 3 −1/4(abc) 1/2. Taking the product of these two expressions gives the desired result. 6. Find all functions f : Z → Z satisfying f (m + n) + f (mn − 1) = f (m)f (n) + 2 for all m, n ∈ Z. Solution: Suppose there exists c ∈ Z such that f (n) = c for all n. Then 2c = c2 + 2, so c is a root of the quadratic c2 − 2c + 2 = (c − 1) 2 + 1 = 0. This has no real solutions, so f cannot be constant. Now substitute m = 0. This yields the equation f (n) + f (−1) = f (0)f (n) + 2, from which we deduce that f (n)(1 − f (0)) is constant. Since f (n) is not constant, we must have f (0) = 1. The same equation then gives f (−1) = 2. We now substitute m = n = −1 to get f (−2) + f (0) = f (−1) 2 + 2, from which we obtain f (−2) = 5; and then substitute m = 1, n = −1, to get f (0) + f (−2) = f (1)f (−1) + 2, giving f (1) = 2. Now that we have f (1) = 2 we may substitute m = 1 to get f (n+1)+f (n−1) = 2f (n)+2, or equivalently, f (n + 1) = 2f (n) − f (n − 1) + 2. This is a nonhomogeneous second order linear recurrence relation, which may be solved for positive n using standard techniques (see for example Recurrence Relations, on the NZMOC site), or the solution f (n) = n 2 + 1 may be guessed and checked for n ≥ 1 by induction. A second induction using f (n − 1) = 2f (n) − f (n + 1) + 2 shows that f (n) = n2 + 1 for n < 0 also (alternately, it is possible to show that f must be even). We’ve now shown that if the functional equation has a solution at all, it must be f (n) = n2 + 1. It remains to check that this function is in fact a solution — afterall, in our work above we always had m or n equal to 0 or 1, so we need to make sure the functional equation is satisﬁed for all possible values of m and n. This is easily done by substitution. 7. Let (an)∞ n=1 be a sequence of positive integers such that an < an+1 for all n ≥ 1. Suppose that for all 4-tuples of indices (i, j, k, l) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k < l and i + l = j + k, the inequality ai + al > aj + ak is satisﬁed. Determined the least possible value of a2010. Solution: Applying the inequality to the 4-tuple (i, j, k, l) = (n − 1, n, n, n + 1) we obtain an−1 + an+1 > 2an, 4 or an+1 − an > an − an−1. Hence an+1 − an ≥ an − an−1 + 1. Now a2 > a1, so a2 − a1 ≥ 1, and induction gives an ≥ an−1 + n. A second induction using a1 ≥ 1 gives an ≥ n(n + 1) 2 + 1. We now show that the sequence an = n(n+1)/2+1 satisﬁes the conditions in the problem. The inequality ai + al > aj + ak is equivalent to (i2 + i + 2) + (l2 + l + 2) > (j2 + j + 2) + (k2 + k + 2), and when i + l = j + k this is simply i2 + l2 > j2 + k2. Let i = d − y, l = d + y, j = d − x, k = d + x, with 0 ≥ x < y. Then i 2 + l2 = 2(d2 + y2), j2 + k2 = 2(d2 + x2), and the desired inequality follows from y2 > x 2. The smallest possible value of a2010 is therefore 2010 · 2009 2 + 1 = 2, 019, 046. 8. Find the least positive number x with the following property: if a, b, c, d are arbitrary positive numbers whose product is 1, then ax + bx + cx + dx ≥ 1 a + 1 b + 1 c + 1 d . Solution: Putting the righthand side over the common denominator abcd, and using the condition that abcd = 1, we need to ﬁnd the smallest x such that ax + bx + cx + dx ≥ bcd + acd + abd + abc. The righthand side is now degree 3 in a, b, c, d; for the lefthand side to surpass this we might expect that it must have degree at least 3 as well, or else the inequality will fail when the variables take large values. This suggests that the answer might be x = 3, and we will show that this is indeed the case. We ﬁrst show that x = 3 works. Applying the AM-GM inequality to the numbers a3, b3, c3 we obtain a3 + b3 + c3 3 ≥ 3√a3b3c3 = abc; similarly a3 + b3 + d 3 3 ≥ abd, a3 + c3 + d 3 3 ≥ acd, a3 + b3 + d 3 3 ≥ abd. 5 Adding these four inequalities we obtain a3 + b3 + c3 + d3 ≥ bcd + acd + abd + abc, as desired. We now show that if x < 3 then we may ﬁnd (a, b, c, d) such that abcd = 1 and the inequality is violated. To do this we will try to realise our intuition above that the inequality will fail when the variables are large. We may only choose three of the variables independently, so we will look for a quadruple of the form a = b = c = t, d = 1/t 3, with t > 1. For such quadruples we certainly have abcd = 1, while ax + bx + cx + dx = 3t x + 1 t3x < 4t x, and 1 a + 1 b + 1 c + 1 d = 3 t + t 3 > t 3. Thus, if we can choose t such that 4t x < t3, then the desired inequality will be violated. In view of the condition x < 3, the inequality 4t x < t 3 is equivalent to t > 4 1 3−x , which is certainly fulﬁlled for t large enough.
