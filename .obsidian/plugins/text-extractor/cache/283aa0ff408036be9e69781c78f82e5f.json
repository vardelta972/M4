Carroll MOP 2000 Estimating Sums The objective of this lecture is to give some level of organization to an area of study on the border of algebra and combinatorics that currently is not generally recognized, and to survey the techniques that are useful in this area. I hereby denote this \feld of study \\sum-estimation.\" In the typical sum-estimation scenario, you have a bunch of very loosely constrained real numbers (or vectors) and you want to bound the magnitude of some linear combination of them. The most general sum-estimating technique is, of course, the pigeonhole principle. In particular, if one wants small sums or di\u000berences, a standard technique is to construct a bunch of sums, pigeonhole to \fnd two that are close together, and subtract them. 1. (a) Given \u000b > 0 and integer n > 0, prove that there exists an integer 0 < k < n such that either fk\u000bg \u0014 1=n or fk\u000bg \u0015 1 \u0000 1=n. (The braces denote fractional part.) (b) Given positive real numbers x1; x2; : : : ; xn whose sum is an integer, prove that one can choose a nonempty proper sublist of the xi such that the fractional part of the sum of this sublist is at most 1=n. 2. (IMO, 1987) Let x1; x2; : : : ; xn be real numbers satisfying x2 + x2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x2 = 1: Prove that for every integer k \u0015 2 there are integers a1; a2; : : : ; an, not all zero, such that jaij \u0014 k \u0000 1 for all i, and ja1x1 + a2x2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anxnj \u0014 (k \u0000 1)p 7. Let n \u0015 3 be odd. Given numbers a1; : : : ; an; b1; : : : ; bn from the interval [0; 1], show that there exist distinct indices i; j such that 0 \u0014 aibj \u0000 biaj \u0014 2=(n \u0000 1). Another technique, which might be used in conjunction with the pigeonhole, is \\cross- ing a line\": one constructs a sequence of sums which change gradually and shows that some such sum lies within a speci\fed interval (or has some other desired property). 8. (Hungary, 1997) We are given 111 unit vectors in the plane whose sum is zero. Show that there exist 55 of the vectors whose sum has length less than 1. 9. (IMO, 1997) Let x1; x2; : : : ; xn be real numbers satisfying jx1 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + xnj = 1 and jxij \u0014 (n + 1)=2 for all i. Show that there exists a permutation (yi) of (xi) such that jy1 + 2y2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + nynj \u0014 (n + 1)=2. Induction is also an extremely useful tool for constructing sums or di\u000berences of objects, since you can often just add or subtract some objects and then work with the new, smaller set. 10. (Spain, 1997, adapted) The real numbers x1; : : : ; xn have a sum of 0. Prove that there exists an index i such that xi + xi+1 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + xj \u0015 0 for all i \u0014 j < i + n, where the indices are de\fned modulo n. 11. (Austria-Poland, 1995) Let v1; v2; : : : ; v95 be three-dimensional vectors with all coordi- nates in the interval [\u00001; 1]. Show that among all vectors of the form s1v1 + s2v2 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + s95v95, where si 2 f\u00001; 1g for each i, there exists a vector (a; b; c) satisfying a2 + b2 + c2 \u0014 48. Can the bound of 48 be improved? 12. Let n \u0015 1, and let aij (i = 1; 2; : : : ; n; j = 1; 2; : : : ; n + 2) be n(n + 2) arbitrary real numbers. Prove that there exist distinct j; j 0 such that a1ja1j0 + a2ja2j0 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + anjanj0 \u0015 0: Sometimes it is necessary to discriminate among the numbers or vectors given { on the basis of size, sign, proximity to other numbers, etc { in order to establish an explicit method for constructing the desired sums. Deciding how to distinguish these objects can be tricky. 13. (Iran, 1999) Suppose that r1; r2; : : : ; rn are real numbers. Prove that there exists S \u0012 f1; 2; : : : ; ng such that 1 \u0014 jS \\ fi; i + 1; i + 2gj \u0014 2 for 1 \u0014 i \u0014 n \u0000 2, and \f X i2S ri \f \u0015 1 14. (USA, 1996) For any nonempty set S of real numbers, let ˙(S) denote the sum of the elements of S. Given a set A of n positive numbers, consider the collection of all distinct sums ˙(S) as S ranges over the nonempty subsets of A. Prove that this collection of sums can be partitioned into n classes so that, in each class, the ratio of the largest sum to the smallest sum does not exceed 2. 15. (Russia, 1997) 300 apples are given, no one of which weighs more than 3 times any other. Show that the apples may be divided into groups of 4 such that no group weighs more than 3=2 times any other group. 16. (Iran, 1999) Suppose that \u00001 \u0014 x1; : : : ; xn \u0014 1 are real numbers such that x1 + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + xn = 0. Prove that there exists a permutation ˙ such that, for every 1 \u0014 p \u0014 q \u0014 n, jx˙(p) + \u0001 \u0001 \u0001 + x˙(q)j \u0014 2 \u0000 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
