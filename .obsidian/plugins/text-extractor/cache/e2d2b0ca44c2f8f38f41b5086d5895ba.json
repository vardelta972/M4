Let G be the graph of Figure 6.14 (which has no multiple edges), and let R be the equivalence relation on V defined by the partition {{A, E, I}, (B, F,J},|{C, G, K)},{D, H, L}}. Then G is shown in Figure 6.15. If S is also an equivalence relation on V defined by the partition {{1,/, K, L}, (A, E}, {F, B, C},{D},{G), {H}} then the quotient graph G* is shown in Figure 6.16. .
