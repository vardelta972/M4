Trigonometric Function (a) Sine function Here, f x x( ) sin= can be discussed in two ways i.e., Graph diagram and Circle diagram where Domain of sine function is “R” and range is [–1, 1]. Graph diagram (On x-axis and y-axis) f x x( ) sin= , increases strictly from –1 to 1 as x increases from − π 2 to π 2 , decreases strictly from 1 to –1 as x increases from π 2 to 3 2 π and so on. We have graph as; Here, the height is same after every interval of 2π. (i.e., In above figure, AB CD= after every interval of 2π). ∴ sin x is called periodic function with period 2π. Circle diagram (On trigonometric plane or using quadrants). Let a circle of radius ‘1’, i.e., unit circle. Then, sin ,α = a 1 sin ,β = b 1 sin ,γ = − c 1 sin , ,δ = − … d 1 shown as. ∴ sin x generates a circle of radius ‘1’. (b) Cosine function Here, f x x( ) cos= The domain of cosine function is R and the range is [–1, 1]. Graph diagram (on x-axis and y-axis) As discussed, cos x decreases strictly from 1 to –1 as x increases from 0 to π, increases strictly from –1 to 1 as x increases from π to 2 π and so on. Also, cos x is periodic with period 2 π. 8 y O A π 2 π 3 2 π3 2 π 2ππ 2 2π y = 1 π B C h1 h1 , 1π 2 , 13 2 π – , –13 2 π, –1π 2 1 –1 x y = –1 D Fig. 1.21 y = 1 π/2 b c d a y = 0 0 = y x = 0, 2 ,π π4 ,… y = –1 3 /2, 7 /2, …π π …, 5 , 3 ,π π π O α β 2 –π δ 1 1 γ 3 2 π π 2 , 1 = 5 2 π , 1 … Fig. 1.22 y O x (0, 1)(–2 , 1)π –2π –3 /2π –π – /2π π/2 π 3 /2π 2π (2 , 1)π ( , –1)π(– , –1)π Fig. 1.23IntroductionofGraphs Function Domain Range Principal value branch 1. sin −1 x [ , ]−1 1 −     π π 2 2 , − ≤ ≤ π π 2 2 y , where y x= −sin 1 2. cos−1 x [ , – ]−1 1 [ , ]0 π 0 ≤ ≤y π, where y x= −cos 1 3. tan −1 x R −      | π π 2 2 , − < < π π 2 2 y , where y x= −tan 1 4. cosec –1 x ( , ] [ , )−∞ − ∪ ∞1 1 −     π π 2 2 , – {0} − ≤ ≤ ≠ π π 2 2 0y y; , where y x= −cosec 1 5. sec –1 x ( , ] [ , )−∞ − ∪ ∞1 1 [ , ]0 2 π π −     ‖  0 2 ≤ ≤ ≠     ‖  y yπ π ; , where y x= −sec 1 6. cot −1 x R ( , )0 π 0 < <y π ; where y x= −cot 1 . 1.3 TRIGONOMETRIC INEQUALITIES To solve trigonometric inequalities including trigonometric functions, it is good to practice periodicity and monotonicity of functions. Thus, first solve the inequality for the periodicity and then get the set of all solutions by adding numbers of the form 2n n zπ ; ∈ , to each of the solutions obtained on that interval. E X A M P L E 1 Solve the inequality; sin x > − 1 2 . SOLUTION As the function sin x has least positive period 2 π. {That is why it is sufficient to solve inequality of the form sin , sin , sin , sinx a x a x a x a> ≥ < ≤ first on the interval of length 2 π, and then get the solution set by adding numbers of the form 2 πn n z, ∈ , to each of the solutions obtained on that interval}.

Consider a curve and a point P on it and let Q be a point near P. Let A be a point on the curve. arc AP s= , arc AQ s s= + δ ∴ arc PQ s= δ Let ψ and ψ δψ+ be angles which the tangents at P and Q makes with x-axis. ∴ δψ is called the total curvature of the arc PQ. δψ δs is called the average curvature of the arc PQ. lim δ δψ δ ψ s s d ds→ = = 0 curvature of the curve at P. Note To study curvature we shall define d ds ψ or d y dx 2 2 . 2.2 CONCAVITY, CONVEXITY AND POINTS OF INFLEXION (a) Concave upwards If in the neighbourhood of a point P on a curve is above the tangent at P, it is said to be concave upwards.

OR A straight line A is called an asymptote to a curve, if the distance δ from the variable point M of the curve to this straight line approaches zero as the point M tends to infinity.

(i) Now if A = 1 and x have same sign ⇒ >x 0, then the curve lies above the asymptote. (ii) Now if A = 1 and x have opposite sign ⇒ <x 0, then the curve lies below the asymptote. 3.2 SINGULAR POINTS Here, we shall discuss the following (i) Multiple points (ii) Double points Types of double points : (a) Node (b) Cusp (c) Isolated point (iii) Tangent at the origin. (iv) Necessary conditions for existence of double points. (v) Types of cusps. 3.2 (i) Multiple points A point on a curve is said to be a multiple point of order r, if r branches of the curve pass through this point. If P is the multiple point of order r, then there will be r tangents at P, one of each of the r branches. These r tangents may be real, imaginary, distinct, coincident. 3.2 (ii) Double points A point on a curve is said to be a double point of the curve, if two branches of the curve pass through this point. Double points have two tangents, they may be real, imaginary, distinct or coincident. Types of Double points (a) Node If the two branches of a curve pass through the double point and the tangents to them at the point are real and distinct, then the double point is called a node as shown in Fig. 3.7. (b) Cusp If the two branches of the curve pass through the double point and the tangent to them are the point is real and coincident, then the double point is called cusp as shown in Fig. 3.8. 148 O Node Tangent Tangent y x P O Cusp y x T angent CurveCurve Fig. 3.7 Fig. 3.8Asymptotes,SingularPointsandCurveTracing 3.3 REMEMBER FOR TRACING CARTESIAN EQUATION 1. Check symmetry (a) A curve is symmetrical about x-axis, i.e., y is replaced by – y and curve remains same. (b) A curve is symmetrical about y-axis, i.e., f x f x(– ) ( )= . (c) A curve is symmetrical about y x= , i.e., on interchanging x and y curve remains same. (d) A curve is symmetrical about y x= – . i.e., on interchanging x by – y and y by – x curve remains same. (e) The curve is symmetrical in opposite quadrants, i.e., f x f x(– ) – ( )= . 2. Check for origin Find whether origin lies on the curve or not. If yes, check for multiple points (See Art. 3.2). 3. Point of intersection with x-axis and y-axis Put x = 0 and find y, put y = 0 and find x. Also obtain the tangents at such points. 4. Asymptotes Find the point at which asymptote meets the curve and equation of asymptote (see Art. 3.1) 5. Domain and range To check in which part the curve lies. 6. Monotonicity and maxima minima Find dy dx and check the interval in which y increases or decreases and the point at which it attains maximum or minimum. 7. Concavity and convexity The interval in which, d y dx 2 2 0> and d y dx 2 2 0< Using all the above results we can sketch the curve y f x= ( ). 155","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
