This time it’s easier to guess the solution. The polynomial Q(x) = n∑ i=0 ( x i )(r − 1)i has degree n and by the Binomial Theorem, satisﬁes the given conditions. Since P (x) = Q(x) for n + 1 values of x, actually P, Q are the same polynomial, and P (n + 1) = Q(n + 1) = (n+1∑ i=0 ( n + 1 i ) (r − 1) i) − (r − 1)n+1 = rn+1 − (r − 1) n+1. 2. Letting ray OQ1 be the positive real axis, Qi represent the nth roots of unity ωi in the complex plane. Hence P Qi equals |2 − ωi|. The roots of xn − 1 = 0 are just the nth roots of unity, so xn − 1 = ∏n−1 i=0 (x − ωi). Plugging in x = 2 gives∏n k=1 |P Qi| = 2 n − 1. 3. The given condition says f (x)2 = x(x − 1) · · · (x − n)Q(x) + x2 + 1 (1) for some polynomial f (x) of degree at most n. Plugging x = 0, 1, . . . , n into (1) gives f (x) = ± √x2 + 1, when x = 0, 1, . . . , n. (2) The following is key: Given n + 1 points (x0, y0), . . . , (xn, yn) with distinct x- coordinates, there exists exactly one polynomial f of degree at most n so that f (xi) = yi for i = 0, 1, . . . , n. Applying this to (2) we get 2 n+1 possibilities for f (x) since we have 2 choices of sign for each of x = 0, 1, . . . , n. If f (x) is a solution to (2) then so is −f (x); we get 2 n possibilities for f (x)2. Solve (1) to get 2n possibilities for Q(x): Q(x) = f (x) 2 − x2 − 1 x(x − 1) · · · (x − n) Each such polynomial is a valid solution because f (x) 2 − x2 − 1 is zero at x = 0, 1, . . . , n and hence is divisible by x(x − 1) · · · (x − n). OMC 2011 Polynomials Lecture 8 4. Clearing denominators, 5∑ i=1 [ aix ∏ i̸=j,1≤j≤5 (x + j) ] − (x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4)(x + 5) = 0 for x = 1, 4, 9, 16, 25. Let f (x) denote the LHS. Since f (x) = 0 has the roots x = 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, we conclude that (x − 1)(x − 4) · · · (x − 25) divides f (x). Since f (x) has degree at most 5, f (x) = k(x − 1)(x − 4)(x − 9)(x − 16)(x − 25) for some constant k. However, equating f (0) = [−(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4)(x + 5)]x=0 = −5! and f (0) = −k · 5! 2 gives k = 1 5!. Thus f (x) = 1 5!(x − 1)(x − 4)(x − 9)(x − 16)(x − 25). Then 5∑ i=1 ai 62 + i = f (6 2) x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3)(x + 4)(x + 5)|x=62 − 1 62 = 187465 6744582. 5. Given two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) the equation y − y1 y2 − y1 = x − x1 x2 − x1 =⇒ (y − y1)(x2 − x1) = (x − x1)(y2 − y1) represents the line passing through these two points (it is a linear equation satisﬁed by the coordinares of the two points). It follows that three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) lie on the same line if and only if the condition (y3 − y1)(x2 − x1) = (x3 − x1)(y2 − y1) (3) holds. Now suppose that (x1, y1), (x2, y2) and (x3, y3) represent the (changing) coordinates of the three ducks as they waddle along their paths. Each coordinate is a linear function of time t, so (3) is an equation in t of degree at most 2 (i.e., is a quadratic). If such an equation has more than 2 solutions then it must reduce to an identity and thus hold true for all values of t. That is, if the ducks are in a row at more than two times, then they are always in a row. 6. Note that g(x) is one of the 16 integer divisors of 2008 for each of the 81 integer roots. There must be at least 6 roots of f (x) for which g(x) has the same value. Since g(x) is nonconstant, its degree must be greater than 5. 2 OMC 2011 Polynomials Lecture 8 7. (Oﬃcial solution) Let p(x) be the monic real polynomial of degree n. If n = 1, then p(r) = r + a for some real number a, and p(x) is the average of x and x + 2a, each of which has 1 real root. Now we assume that n > 1. Let g(x) = (x − 2)(x − 4) · · · (x − 2(n − 1)). The degree of g(x) is n − 1. Consider the polynomials q(x) = xn − kg(x), r(x) = 2p(x) − q(x) = 2p(x) − xn + kg(x). We will show that for large enough k these two polynomials have n real roots. Since they are monic and their average is clearly p(x), this will solve the problem. Consider the values of the polynomial g(x) at n points x = 1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n − 1. These values alternate in sign and are at least 1 (since at most two of the factors have magnitude 1 and the others have magnitude at least 2). On the other hand, there is a constant c > 0 such that for 0 ≤ x ≤ n, we have |xn| < c and |2p(x)−xn| < c. Take k > c. Then we see that q(x) and r(x) evaluated at n points x = 1, 3, 5, . . . , 2n − 1 alternate in sign. Thus q(x) and r(x) each has at least n − 1 real roots. However since they are polynomials of degree n, they must have n real roots, as desired. 8. Without loss of generality, suppose deg(f ) < deg(g). Let r1, . . . , rk be the distinct roots of f and let s1, . . . , sl be the distinct roots of f − 1. We claim that k + l ≥ deg(n) + 1. Indeed, suppose f (x) = (x − r1) p1 · · · (x − rk) pk. Then (x − r1)p1−1 · · · (x − rk)pk−1 | f ′. Similarly, if f (x) − 1 = (x − s1) q1 · · · (x − sl)ql, then (x − s1)q1−1 · · · (x − sl)ql−1 | f ′. Since the roots of f and f − 1 are distinct, (x − r1) p1−1 · · · (x − rk)pk−1(x − s1) q1−1 · · · (x − sl)ql−1 | f ′. Since f ′ has degree n − 1, (p1 − 1) + . . . + (pk − 1) + (q1 − 1) + . . . (ql − 1) ≤ n − 1. Since p1 + . . . + pk = q1 + . . . + ql = n, this gives (n − k) + (n − l) ≤ n − 1, or k + l ≥ n + 1. Now f −g has degree at most n and has at least n+1 distinct roots r1, r2, . . . , rk, s1, . . . , sl, so it must be identically 0, and f = g. 3 OMC 2011 Polynomials Lecture 8 2 Symmetric Polynomials and Vieta’s Formulas 1. Note the polynomial has degree 2000 since the x2001 terms cancel out. By the Binomial Theorem, the coeﬃcients of x2000 and x1999 are 2001 ( 1 2) and − (2001 2 ) ( 1 2)2, respectively. By Vieta’s formula the sum of the roots is −−( 2001 2 ) ( 1 2)2 2001 ( 1 2) = 500. 2. Using Vieta’s formulas with the roots ri, (∑ 1 r2 1 ) = (∑ 1 r1 )2 − 2 (∑ 1 r1r2 ) = ( ∑ r1r2r3r4 r1r2r3r4r5 )2 − 2 ( ∑ r1r2r3 r1r2r3r4r5 ) = 9 2 (−11)2 − 2(−7) −11 = − 73 121 3. (a) The roots r1, r2, r3 satisfy the equation ( 1 x)3 + a ( 1 x)2 + b ( 1 x ) + c = 0. Clearing denominators, they are roots to cx3 + bx2 + ax + 1, and hence to x3 + b cx2 + a c x + 1 c . (b) By Vieta’s formula, r1 + r2 + r3 = −a, r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1 = b, and r1r2r3 = −c. We calculate the elementary symmetric sums in r1 + r2, r2 + r3, r3 + r1: (r1 + r2) + (r2 + r3) + (r3 + r1) = −2a (r1 + r2)(r2 + r3) + (r2 + r3)(r3 + r1) +(r3 + r1)(r1 + r2) = (r1 + r2 + r3) 2 + (r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1) = a2 + b (r1 + r2)(r2 + r3)(r3 + r1) = (r1 + r2 + r3)(r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1) − r1r2r3 = −ab + c Hence by Vieta’s formulas (using the roots to get the coeﬃcients), r1 + r2, r2 + r3, r3 + r1 are roots of x3 + 2ax2 + (a2 + b)x + (ab − c). (c) We calculate the elementary symmetric sums in r2 1, r2 2, r2 3: r2 1 + r2 2 + r2 3 = (r1 + r2 + r3) 2 − 2(r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1) = a2 − 2b r2 1r2 2 + r2 2r2 3 + r2 3r2 1 = (r1r2 + r2r3 + r3r1) 2 − 2r1r2r3(r1 + r2 + r3) = b2 − 2ac r2 1r2 2r2 3 = c2 Hence by Vieta’s formulas, r2 1, r2 2, r2 3 are roots of x3 + (2b − a2)x2 + (b2 − ac)x − c2. 4 OMC 2011 Polynomials Lecture 8 4. The coeﬃcient of x2 is 0 so r + s + t = 0. Using rst = −2008 8 , we get (r + s)3 + (s + t)3 + (t + r) 3 = 2(r + s + t) 3 − 3(r + s + t)(rs + st + tr) − 3rst = −3 ( −2008 8 ) = −753. 5. Let y = 2 111x; the equation becomes 1 4y3 + 4y = 2y2 + 1 which rearranges to y3 − 8y2 + 16y − 4 = 0. Let y1, y2, y3 be the roots of this equation and x1, x2, x3 be the solutions to the original equation. Then 2 111(x1+x2+x3) = y1y2y3 = 4 by Vieta’s formula so x1 + x2 + x3 = 1 111 log2 4 = 2 111 and the answer is 113. 6. To simplify the calculation, we ﬁrst divide P (x) by Q(x) to obtain P (x) = Q(x)(x2 + 1) + x2 − x + 1. Thus 4∑ i=1 P (zi) = 4∑ i=1 Q(zi)(z2 i + 1) + 4∑ i=1 (z2 i − zi + 4) = 4∑ i=1 (z2 i − zi + 4). The ﬁrst and second elementary symmetric sums equal 1 and −1 by Vieta. Hence the above sum equals ( 4∑ i=1 zi )2 − 2 ∑ 1≤i<j≤4 zizj − 4∑ i=1 zi + 4 = 1 + 2 − 1 + 4 = 6. 3 Fundamental Theorem of Algebra 1. Write the equation as (g(x) + ih(x))(g(x) − ih(x)) = x20 − 1 x2 − 1 . Counting the number of possibilities for (f (x), g(x)) is the same as counting the number of possibilities for f (x) = g(x) + ih(x). Thus we need to count the number of complex polynomials f (x) such that f (x) ¯f (x) = x20 − 1 x2 − 1 . The zeros of x20−1 x2−1 can be split in complex conjugate pairs P1, . . . , P9, since they are the nonreal 20th roots of unity. If r is a zero of f (x) then ¯r is a zero of ¯f (x). Thus f (x) must have as a zero one number in each pair Pi, and ¯f (x) has as its zeros the other number in each pair Pi. There are 2 9 = 512 choices for which zeros in each pair to choose as zeros of f (x). The answer is 512. 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
