Let x1 and x2 be the distinct roots of the equation 2x2 − 3x + 4 = 0. Compute the value of 1 x3 1 + 1 x3 2 . Solution: If α and β are the roots of the quadratic x2 − ax + b = 0 then x2 − ax + b = (x − α)(x − β) = x2 − (α + β)x + αβ, so α + β = a and αβ = b. In our case this gives x1 + x2 = 3/2 and x1x2 = 2. Now also x2 = 3 2x − 2, so x3 = 3 2x2 − 2x = 3 2( 3 2x − 2) − 2x = 1 4x − 3. We then get 1 x3 1 + 1 x3 2 = x3 1 + x3 2 x3 1x3 2 = 1 4(x1 + x2) − 6 (x1x2)3 = 3 8 − 6 8 = −45 64. 2. Six points are given inside a square of side-length 10, such that the distance between any two of them is an integer. Prove that at least two of these distances are the same. Solution: The maximum possible distance between two points in the square is 10 √2, when the points are placed at diagonally opposite vertices. Since 10 √ 2 ≈ 14.14, the maximum possible integer distance between two points in the square is 14. So there are fourteen possible integer distances between two points in the square, namely 1, 2, . . . , 14. However, six points gives a total of ( 6 2 ) = 6·5 2 = 15 pairs of points, so there are a total of ﬁfteen distances. By the pigeonhole principle two of them must be the same. 3. Find all possible ways of expressing 2010 as a sum of (one or more) consecutive positive integers. Solution: Suppose that 2010 = n∑ j=k+1 j. Then 2010 = n∑ j=1 j − k∑ j=1 j = n(n + 1) 2 − k(k + 1) 2 = n2 − k2 + n − k 2 = (n − k)(n + k + 1) 2 . 1 Hence (n−k)(n+k +1) = 4020, so we are interested in factorisations of 4020 = 2 2 ·3·5·67. Now n − k and n + k + 1 diﬀer by 2k + 1, and so have opposite parities; thus, one is divisible by 4, and of course n − k must be the smaller of the two factors. This gives the following possibilities: n − k 1 3 4 5 12 15 20 60 n + k + 1 4020 2010 1005 804 335 268 201 67 n 2010 671 504 404 173 141 110 63 k 2009 668 500 399 161 126 90 3 (here we have used n = ((n − k) + (n + k + 1) − 1)/2, k = ((n + k + 1) − (n − k) − 1)/2). Hence 2010 = 2010 = 669 + 670 + 671 = 501 + 502 + 503 + 504 = 400 + 401 + 402 + 403 + 404 = 162 + 163 + 164 + · · · + 172 + 173 (twelve terms) = 127 + 128 + 129 + · · · + 141 (ﬁfteen terms) = 91 + 92 + · · · + 110 (twenty terms) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + · · · + 63 (sixty terms) as a sum of consecutive positive integers. 4. In a right triangle the median and bisector of the right angle divide the hypotenuse in three parts. The lengths of these parts, in a certain order, from an arithmetic sequence. Find all possible ratios of the lengths of the legs of the triangle (i.e., of the sides adjacent to the right angle). Solution: Let the legs of the triangle have lengths a and b, with a ≤ b, and let the hypotenuse have length c. Then the median divides the hypotenuse into two segments of length c/2, and the bisector then divides one of these into two segments of lengths s and t (see diagram). So the longest of the three segments has length c/2, and either s, t, c/2 or t, s, c/2 is an arithmetic progression, depending on which of s and t is the larger. \b \b\b\b \b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 H HHH HHH HHH HHH HHHHHHHHHH c/2 s t a bC A B D 2 Suppose for the moment that t < s, as in the diagram. Then s + t = c/2, and also c/2 = t + 2(s − t); solving, we ﬁnd that s = 2t. So t, s and c/2 are in the ratio 1 : 2 : 3 or 2 : 1 : 3. We now apply the angle bisector theorem, to obtain a/b = BD/AD. If t < s then a/b = 2/4 = 1/2; and if s < t then a/b = 1/5. So the possible ratios of the smaller leg over the longer are 1/2 and 1/5. Note that the problem can be completed without the angle bisector theorem, essentially by proving it in this special case. Use the sine rule to obtain a/ sin(BDC) = BD/ sin(45 ◦) and b/ sin(CDA) = DA/ sin(45 ◦), and then note that sin(CDA) = sin(180 ◦ − CDB) = sin(CDB).
