Because the transform is invertible, no information is lost and it is reasonable to think of a function f (t) and its Laplace transform F (s) as two views of the same phe- nomenon. Each view has its uses and some features of the phenomenon are easier to understand in one view or the other. We can use the Laplace transform to transform a linear time invariant system from the time domain to the s-domain. This leads to the system function G(s) for the system –this is the same system function used in the Nyquist criterion for stability. One important feature of the Laplace transform is that it can transform analytic problems to algebraic problems. We will see examples of this for diﬀerential equations. 12.2 A brief introduction to linear time invariant systems Let’s start by deﬁning our terms. Signal. A signal is any function of time. System. A system is some machine or procedure that takes one signal as input does something with it and produces another signal as output. Linear system. A linear system is one that acts linearly on inputs. That is, f1(t) and f2(t) are inputs to the system with outputs y1(t) and y2(t) respectively, then the input f1 + f2 produces the output y1 + y2 and, for any constant c, the input cf1 produces output cy1. This is often phrased in one sentence as input c1f1 + c2f2 produces output c1y1 + c2y2, i.e. linear combinations of inputs produces a linear combination of the corresponding outputs. Time invariance. Suppose a system takes input signal f (t) and produces output signal y(t). The system is called time invariant if the input signal g(t) = f (t − a) produces output signal y(t − a). LTI. We will call a linear time invariant system an LTI system. Example 12.1. Consider the constant coeﬃcient diﬀerential equation 3y′′ + 8y′ + 7y = f (t) This equation models a damped harmonic oscillator, say a mass on a spring with a damper, where f (t) is the force on the mass and y(t) is its displacement from equilibrium. If we consider f to be the input and y the output, then this is a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Example 12.2. There are many variations on this theme. For example, we might have the LTI system 3y′′ + 8y′ + 7y = f ′(t), 1 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 2 where we call f (t) the input signal and y(t) the output signal. 12.3 Laplace transform Deﬁnition. The Laplace transform of a function f (t) is deﬁned by the integral L(f ; s) = ∫ ∞ 0 e −stf (t) dt, for those s where the integral converges. Here s is allowed to take complex values. Important note. The Laplace transform is only concerned with f (t) for t ≥ 0. Generally, speaking we can require f (t) = 0 for t < 0. Standard notation. Where the notation is clear, we will use an upper case letter to indicate the Laplace transform, e.g, L(f ; s) = F (s). The Laplace transform we deﬁned is sometimes called the one-sided Laplace transform. There is a two-sided version where the integral goes from −∞ to ∞. 12.3.1 First examples Let’s compute a few examples. We will also put these results in the Laplace transform table at the end of these notes. Example 12.3. Let f (t) = eat. Compute F (s) = L(f ; s) directly. Give the region in the complex s-plane where the integral converges. L(eat; s) = ∫ ∞ 0 eate−st dt = ∫ ∞ 0 e (a−s)t dt = e(a−s)t a − s \f \f \f \f \f ∞ 0 = { 1 s−a if Re(s) > Re(a) divergent otherwise The last formula comes from plugging ∞ into the exponential. This is 0 if Re(a − s) < 0 and undeﬁned otherwise. Example 12.4. Let f (t) = b. Compute F (s) = L(f ; s) directly. Give the region in the complex s-plane where the integral converges. L(b; s) = ∫ ∞ 0 be −st dt = be−st −s \f \f \f \f ∞ 0 = { b s if Re(s) > 0 divergent otherwise The last formula comes from plugging ∞ into the exponential. This is 0 if Re(−s) < 0 and undeﬁned otherwise. Example 12.5. Let f (t) = t. Compute F (s) = L(f ; s) directly. Give the region in the 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 3 complex s-plane where the integral converges. L(t; s) = ∫ ∞ 0 te −st dt = te−st −s − e−st s2 \f \f \f \f ∞ 0 = { 1 s2 if Re(s) > 0 divergent otherwise Example 12.6. Compute L(cos(ωt)). Solution: We use the formula cos(ωt) = eiωt + e−iωt 2 . So, L(cos(ωt); s) = 1/(s − iω) + 1/(s + iω) 2 = s s2 + ω2 . 12.3.2 Connection to Fourier transform The Laplace and Fourier transforms are intimately connected. In fact, the Laplace transform is often called the Fourier-Laplace transform. To see the connection we’ll start with the Fourier transform of a function f (t). ˆf (ω) = ∫ ∞ −∞ f (t)e−iωt dt. If we assume f (t) = 0 for t < 0, this becomes ˆf (ω) = ∫ ∞ 0 f (t)e−iωt dt. (1) Now if s = iω then the Laplace transform is L(f ; s) = L(f ; iω) = ∫ ∞ 0 f (t)e−iωt dt (2) Comparing these two equations we see that ˆf (ω) = L(f ; iω). We see the transforms are basically the same things using diﬀerent notation –at least for functions that are 0 for t < 0. 12.4 Exponential type The Laplace transform is deﬁned when the integral for it converges. Functions of exponential type are a class of functions for which the integral converges for all s with Re(s) large enough. Deﬁnition. We say that f (t) has exponential type a if there exists an M such that |f (t)| < M eat for all t ≥ 0. Note. As we’ve deﬁned it, the exponential type of a function is not unique. For example, a function of exponential type 2 is clearly also of exponential type 3. It’s nice, but not always necessary, to ﬁnd the smallest exponential type for a function. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 4 Theorem. If f has exponential type a then L(f ) converges absolutely for Re(s) > a. Proof. We prove absolute convergence by bounding |f (t)e−st|. The key here is that Re(s) > a implies Re(a − s) < 0. So, we can write ∫ ∞ 0 |f (t)e−st| dt ≤ ∫ ∞ 0 |M e(a−s)t| dt = ∫ ∞ 0 M e Re(a−s)t dt The last integral clearly converges when Re(a − s) < 0. QED Example 12.7. Here is a list of some functions of exponential type. f (t) = eat : |f (t)| < 2eRe(a)t (exponential type Re(a)) f (t) = 1 : |f (t)| < 2 = 2e 0·t (exponential type 0) f (t) = cos(ωt) : |f (t)| ≤ 1 (exponential type 0) In the above, all of the inequalities are for t ≥ 0. For f (t) = t, it is clear that for any a > 0 there is an M depending on a such that |f (t)| ≤ M eat for t ≥ 0. In fact, it is a simple calculus exercise to show M = 1/(ae) works. So, f (t) = t has exponential type a for any a > 0. The same is true of tn. It’s worth pointing out that this follows because, if f has exponential type a and g has exponential type b then f g has exponential type a + b. So, if t has exponential type a then tn has exponential type na. 12.5 Properties of Laplace transform We have already used the linearity of Laplace transform when we computed L(cos(ωt)). Let’s oﬃcially record it as a property. Property 1. The Laplace transform is linear. That is, if a and b are constants and f and g are functions then L(af + bg) = aL(f ) + bL(g). (3) (The proof is trivial –integration is linear.) Property 2. A key property of the Laplace transform is that, with some technical details, Laplace transform transforms derivatives in t to multiplication by s (plus some details). This is proved in the following theorem. Theorem. If f (t) has exponential type a and Laplace transform F (s) then L(f ′(t); s) = sF (s) − f (0), valid for Re(s) > a. (4) Proof. We prove this using integration by parts. L(f ′; s) = ∫ ∞ 0 f ′(t)e−st dt = f (t)e−st\f \f∞ 0 + ∫ ∞ 0 sf (t)e−st dt = −f (0) + sF (s). 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 5 In the last step we used the fact that at t = ∞, f (t)e−st = 0, which follows from the assumption about exponential type. Equation 4 gives us formulas for all derivatives of f . L(f ′′; s) = s 2F (s) − sf (0) − f ′(0) (5) L(f ′′′; s) = s 3F (s) − s 2f (0) − sf ′(0) − f ′′(0) (6) Proof. For Equation 5: L(f ′′; s) = L((f ′)′; s) = sL(f ′; s)−f ′(0) = s (sF (s) − f (0))−f ′(0) = s2F (s)−sf (0)−f ′(0). QED The proof Equation 6 is similar. Also, similar statements hold for higher order derivatives. Note. There is a further complication if we want to consider functions that are discontin- uous at the origin or if we want to allow f (t) to be a generalized function like δ(t). In these cases f (0) is not deﬁned, so our formulas are undeﬁned. The technical ﬁx is to replace 0 by 0− in the deﬁnition and all of the formulas for Laplace transform. You can learn more about this by taking 18.031. Property 3. Theorem. If f (t) has exponential type a, then F (s) is an analytic function for Re(s) > a and F ′(s) = −L(tf (t); s). (7) Proof. We take the derivative of F (s). The absolute convergence for Re(s) large guarantees that we can interchange the order of integration and taking the derivative. F ′(s) = d ds ∫ ∞ 0 f (t)e−st dt = ∫ ∞ 0 −tf (t)e−st dt = L(−tf (t); s). This proves Equation 7. Equation 7 is called the s-derivative rule. We can extend it to more derivatives in s: Suppose L(f ; s) = F (s). Then, L(tf (t); s) = −F ′(s) (8) L(t nf (t); s) = (−1) nF (n)(s) (9) Equation 8 is the same as Equation 7 above. Equation 9 follows from this. Example 12.8. Use the s-derivative rule and the formula L(1; s) = 1/s to compute the Laplace transform of tn for n a positive integer. Solution: Let f (t) = 1 and F (s) = L(f ; s). Using the s-derivative rule we get L(t; s) = L(tf ; s) = −F ′(s) = 1 s2 L(t2; s) = L(t 2f ; s) = (−1) 2F ′′(s) = 2 s3 L(tn; s) = L(t nf ; s) = (−1) nF n(s) = n! sn+1 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 6 Property 4. t-shift rule. As usual, assume f (t) = 0 for t < 0. Suppose a > 0. Then, L(f (t − a); s) = e −asF (s) (10) Proof. We go back to the deﬁnition of the Laplace transform and make the change of variables τ = t − a. L(f (t − a); s) = ∫ ∞ 0 f (t − a)e −st dt = ∫ ∞ a f (t − a)e−st dt = ∫ ∞ 0 f (τ )e−s(τ +a) dτ = e −sa ∫ ∞ 0 f (τ )e−sτ dτ = e −saF (s). The properties in Equations 3-10 will be used in examples below. They are also in the table at the end of these notes. 12.6 Diﬀerential equations Coverup method. We are going to use partial fractions and the coverup method. We will assume you have seen partial fractions. If you don’t remember them well or have never seen the coverup method, you should read the note Partial fractions and the coverup method posted with the class notes. Example 12.9. Solve y′′ − y = e2t, y(0) = 1, y′(0) = 1 using Laplace transform. Solution: Call L(y) = Y . Apply the Laplace transform to the equation gives (s 2Y − sy(0) − y′(0)) − Y = 1 s − 2 A little bit of algebra now gives (s 2 − 1)Y = 1 s − 2 + s + 1. So Y = 1 (s − 2)(s2 − 1) + s + 1 s2 − 1 = 1 (s − 2)(s2 − 1) + 1 s − 1 Use partial fractions to write Y = A s − 2 + B s − 1 + C s + 1 + 1 s − 1 . The coverup method gives A = 1/3, B = −1/2, C = 1/6. We recognize 1 s − a as the Laplace transform of eat, so y(t) = Ae 2t + Be t + Ce−t + et = 1 3 e2t − 1 2 e t + 1 6 e−t + et. Example 12.10. Solve y′′ − y = 1, y(0) = 0, y′(0) = 0. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 7 Solution: The rest (zero) initial conditions are nice because they will not add any terms to the algebra. As in the previous example we apply the Laplace transform to the entire equation. s 2Y − Y = 1 s , so Y = 1 s(s2 − 1) = 1 s(s − 1)(s + 1) = A s + B s − 1 + C s + 1 The coverup method gives A = −1, B = 1/2, C = 1/2. So, y = A + Be t + Ce −t = −1 + 1 2 e t + 1 2 e−t. 12.7 System functions and the Laplace transform When we introduced the Nyquist criterion for stability we stated without any justiﬁcation that the system was stable if all the poles of the system function G(s)were in the left half- plane. We also asserted that the poles corresponded to exponential modes of the system. In this section we’ll use the Laplace transform to more fully develop these ideas for diﬀerential equations. 12.7.1 Lightning review of 18.03 Deﬁnitions. 1. D = d dt is called a diﬀerential operator. Applied to a function f (t) we have Df = df dt . We read Df as ‘D applied to f .’ Example 12.11. If f (t) = t3 + 2 then Df = 3t2, D2f = 6t. 2. If P (s) is a polynomial then P (D) is called a polynomial diﬀerential operator. Example 12.12. Suppose P (s) = s2 + 8s + 7. What is P (D)? Compute P (D) applied to f (t) = t3 + 2t + 5. Compute P (D) applied to g(t) = e2t. Solution: P (D) = D2 + 8D + 7I. (The I in 7I is the identity operator.) To compute P (D)f we compute all the terms and sum them up: f (t) = t 3 + 2t + 5 Df (t) = 3t2 + 2 D2f (t) = 6t Therefore: (D2 + 8D + 7I)f = 6t + 8(3t2 + 2) + 7(t3 + 2t + 5) = 7t3 + 24t2 + 20t + 51. g(t) = e 2t Dg(t) = 2e 2t D2g(t) = 4e 2t 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 8 Therefore: (D2 + 8D + 7I)g = 4e2t + 8(2)e2t + 7e2t = (4 + 16 + 7)e2t = P (2)e2t. The substitution rule is a straightforward statement about the derivatives of exponentials. Theorem 12.13. (Substitution rule) For a polynomial diﬀerential operator P (D) we have P (D)est = P (s)est. (11) Proof. This is obvious. We ‘prove it’ by example. Let P (D) = D2 + 8D + 7I. Then P (D)eat = a2eat + 8aeat + 7eat = (a 2 + 8a + 7)eat = P (a)eat. Let’s continue to work from this speciﬁc example. From it we’ll be able to remind you of the general approach to solving constant coeﬃcient diﬀerential equations. Example 12.14. Suppose P (s) = s2 + 8s + 7. Find the exponential modes of the equation P (D)y = 0. Solution: The exponential modes are solutions of the form y(t) = es0t. Using the substiti- tution rule P (D)es0t = 0 ⇔ P (s0) = 0. That is, y(t) = es0t is a mode exactly when s0 is a root of P (s). The roots of P (s) are −1, −7. So the modal solutions are y1(t) = e−t and y2(t) = e −7t. Example 12.15. Redo the previous example using the Laplace transform. Solution: For this we solve the diﬀerential equation with arbitrary initial conditions: P (D)y = y′′ + 8y′ + 7y = 0; y(0) = c1, y′(0) = c2. Let Y (s) = L(y; s). Applying the Laplace transform to the equation we get (s 2Y (s) − sy(0) − y′(0)) + 8(sY (s) − y(0)) + 7Y (s) = 0 Algebra: (s2 + 8s + 7)Y (s) − sc1 − c2 − 8c1 = 0 ⇔ Y = sc1 + 8c1 + c2 s2 + 8s + 7 Factoring the denominator and using partial fractions, we get Y (s) = sc1 + 8c1 + c2 s2 + 8s + 7 = sc1 + 8c1 + c2 (s + 1)(s + 7) = A s + 1 + B s + 7 . We are unconcerned with the exact values of A and B. Taking the Laplace inverse we get y(t) = Ae −t + Be−7t. That is, y(t) is a linear combination of the exponential modes. You should notice that the denominator in the expression for Y (s) is none other than the characteristic polynomial P (s). 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 9 12.7.2 The system function Example 12.16. With the same P (s) as in Example 12.12 solve the inhomogeneous DE with rest initial conditions: P (D)y = f (t), y(0) = 0, y′(0) = 0. Solution: Taking the Laplace transform of the equation we get P (s)Y (s) = F (s). Therefore Y (s) = 1 P (s) F (s) We can’t ﬁnd y(t) explicitly because f (t) isn’t speciﬁed. But, we can make the following deﬁnitions and observations. Let G(s) = 1/P (s). If we declare f to be the input and y the output of this linear time invariant system, then G(s) is called the system function. So, we have Y (s) = G(s) · F (s). (12) The formula Y = G · F can be phrased as output = system function × input. Note well, the roots of P (s) correspond to the exponential modes of the system, i.e. the poles of G(s) correspond to the exponential modes. The system is called stable if the modes all decay to 0 as t goes to inﬁnity. That is, if all the poles have negative real part. Example 12.17. This example is to emphasize that not all system functions are of the form 1/P (s). Consider the system modeled by the diﬀerential equation P (D)x = Q(D)f, where P and Q are polynomials. Suppose we consider f to be the input and x to be the ouput. Find the system function. Solution: If we start with rest initial conditions for x and f then the Laplace transform gives P (s)X(s) = Q(s)F (s) or X(s) = Q(s) P (s) · F (s) Using the formulation output = system function × input, we see that the system function is G(s) = Q(s) P (s) . Note that when f (t) = 0 the diﬀerential equation becomes P (D)x = 0. If we make the assumption that the Q(s)/P (s) is in reduced form, i.e. P and Q have no common zeros, then the modes of the system (which correspond to the roots of P (s)) are still the poles of the system function. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 10 Comments. All LTI systems have system functions. They are not even all of the form Q(s)/P (s). But, in the s-domain, the output is always the system function times the input. If the system function is not rational then it may have an inﬁnite number of poles. Stability is harder to characterize, but under some reasonable assumptions the system will be stable if all the poles are in the left half-plane. The system function is also called the transfer function. You can think of it as describing how the system transfers the input to the output. 12.8 Laplace inverse Up to now we have computed the inverse Laplace transform by table lookup. For example, L−1(1/(s − a)) = eat. To do this properly we should ﬁrst check that the Laplace transform has an inverse. We start with the bad news: Unfortunately this is not strictly true. There are many functions with the same Laplace transform. We list some of the ways this can happen. 1. If f (t) = g(t) for t ≥ 0, then clearly F (s) = G(s). Since the Laplace transform only concerns t ≥ 0, the functions can diﬀer completely for t < 0. 2. Suppose f (t) = eat and g(t) = { f (t) for t ̸= 1 0 for t = 1. . That is, f and g are the same except we arbitrarily assigned them diﬀerent values at t = 1. Then, since the integrals won’t notice the diﬀerence at one point, F (s) = G(s) = 1/(s − a). In this sense it is impossible to deﬁne L−1(F ) uniquely. The good news is that the inverse exists as long as we consider two functions that only diﬀer on a negligible set of points the same. In particular, we can make the following claim. Theorem. Suppose f and g are continuous and F (s) = G(s) for all s with Re(s) > a for some a. Then f (t) = g(t) for t ≥ 0. This theorem can be stated in a way that includes piecewise continuous functions. Such a statement takes more care, which would obscure the basic point that the Laplace transform has a unique inverse up to some, for us, trivial diﬀerences. We start with a few examples that we can compute directly. Example 12.18. Let f (t) = e at. So, F (s) = 1 s − a . Show f (t) = ∑ Res(F (s)est) (13) f (t) = 1 2πi ∫ c+i∞ c−i∞ F (s)est ds (14) The sum is over all poles of est/(s − a). As usual, we only consider t > 0. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 11 Here, c > Re(a) and the integral means the path integral along the vertical line x = c. Solution: Proving Equation 13 is straightforward: It is clear that est s − a has only one pole which is at s = a. Since, ∑ Res ( est s − a , a ) = e at we have proved Equation 13. Proving Equation 14 is more involved. We should ﬁrst check the convergence of the integral. In this case, s = c + iy, so the integral is 1 2πi ∫ c+i∞ c−i∞ F (s)est ds = 1 2πi ∫ ∞ −∞ e(c+iy)t c + iy − a i dy = ect 2π ∫ ∞ −∞ eiyt c + iy − a dy. The (conditional) convergence of this integral follows using exactly the same argument as in the example near the end of Topic 9 on the Fourier inversion formula for f (t) = eat. That is, the integrand is a decaying oscillation, around 0, so its integral is also a decaying oscillation around some limiting value. Now we use the contour shown below. Re(z) Im(z) C1 −C2 −C3 C4 c − Ri c + Ri−R + Ri −R − Ri c x a We will let R go to inﬁnity and use the following steps to prove Equation 14. 1. The residue theorem guarantees that if the curve is large enough to contain a then 1 2πi ∫ C1−C2−C3+C4 est s − a ds = ∑ Res ( est s − a , a ) = e at. 2. In a moment we will show that the integrals over C2, C3, C4 all go to 0 as R → ∞. 3. Clearly as R goes to inﬁnity, the integral over C1 goes to the integral in Equation 14 Putting these steps together we have e at = lim R→∞ ∫ C1−C2−C3+C4 est s − a ds = ∫ c+i∞ c−i∞ est s − a ds. Except for proving the claims in step 2, this proves Equation 14. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 12 To verify step 2 we look at one side at a time. C2: C2 is parametrized by s = γ(u) = u + iR, with −R ≤ u ≤ c. So, \f \f \f \f ∫ C2 est s − a ds\f \f \f \f = ∫ c −R \f \f \f \f \f e(u+iR)t u + iR − a \f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∫ c −R eut R du = ect − e−Rt tR . Since c and t are ﬁxed, it’s clear this goes to 0 as R goes to inﬁnity. The bottom C4 is handled in exactly the same manner as the top C2. C3: C3 is parametrized by s = γ(u) = −R + iu, with −R ≤ u ≤ R. So, \f \f \f \f ∫ C3 est s − a ds \f \f \f \f = ∫ R −R \f \f \f \f \f e(−R+iu)t −R + iu − a \f \f \f \f \f ≤ ∫ R −R e−Rt R + a du = e−Rt R + a ∫ R −R du = 2Re−Rt R + a . Since a and t > 0 are ﬁxed, it’s clear this goes to 0 as R goes to inﬁnity. Example 12.19. Repeat the previous example with f (t) = t for t > 0, F (s) = 1/s2. This is similar to the previous example. Since F decays like 1/s2 we can actually allow t ≥ 0 Theorem 12.20. Laplace inversion 1. Assume f is continuous and of exponential type a. Then for c > a we have f (t) = 1 2πi ∫ c+i∞ c−i∞ F (s)est ds. (15) As usual, this formula holds for t > 0. Proof. The proof uses the Fourier inversion formula. We will just accept this theorem for now. Example 12.18 above illustrates the theorem. Theorem 12.21. Laplace inversion 2. Suppose F (s) has a ﬁnite number of poles and decays like 1/s (or faster). Deﬁne f (t) = ∑ Res(F (s)est, pk), where the sum is over all the poles pk. (16) Then L(f ; s) = F (s) Proof. Proof given in class. To be added here. The basic ideas are present in the examples above, though it requires a fairly clever choice of contours. The integral inversion formula in Equation 15 can be viewed as writing f (t) as a ‘sum’ of exponentials. This is extremely useful. For example, for a linear system if we know how the system responds to input f (t) = eat for all a, then we know how it responds to any input by writing it as a ‘sum’ of exponentials. 12.9 Delay and feedback. Let f (t) = 0 for t < 0. Fix a > 0 and let h(t) = f (t − a). So, h(t) is a delayed version of the signal f (t). The Laplace property Equation 10 says H(s) = e −asF (s), where H and F are the Laplace transforms of h and f respectively. 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 13 Now, suppose we have a system with system function G(s). (Again, called the open loop system.) As before, can feed the output back through the system. But, instead of just multiplying the output by a scalar we can delay it also. This is captured by the feedback factor ke−as. The system function for the closed loop system is GCL(s) = G 1 + ke−asG Note even if you start with a rational function the system function of the closed loop with delay is not rational. Usually it has an inﬁnite number of poles. Example 12.22. Suppose G(s) = 1, a = 1 and k = 1 ﬁnd the poles of GCL(s). Solution: GCL(s) = 1 1 + e−s . So the poles occur where e−s = −1, i.e. at inπ, where n is an odd integer. There are an inﬁnite number of poles on the imaginary axis. Example 12.23. Suppose G(s) = 1, a = 1 and k = 1/2 ﬁnd the poles of GCL(s). Is the closed loop system stable? Solution: GCL(s) = 1 1 + e−s/2 . So the poles occur where e−s = −2, i.e. at − log(2) + inπ, where n is an odd integer. Since − log(2) < 0, there are an inﬁnite number of poles in the left half-plane. With all poles in the left half-plane, the system is stable. Example 12.24. Suppose G(s) = 1, a = 1 and k = 2 ﬁnd the poles of GCL(s). Is the closed loop system stable? Solution: GCL(s) = 1 1 + 2e−s . So the poles occur where e−s = −1/2, i.e. at log(2) + inπ, where n is an odd integer. Since log(2) > 0, there are an inﬁnite number of poles in the right half-plane. With poles in the right half-plane, the system is not stable. Remark. If Re(s) is large enough we can express the system function G(s) = 1 1 + ke−as as a geometric series 1 1 + ke−as = 1 − ke −as + k2e−2as − k3e −3as + . . . So, for input F (s), we have output X(s) = G(s)F (s) = F (s) − ke −asF (s) + k2e −2asF (s) − k3e−3asF (s) + . . . 12 LAPLACE TRANSFORM 14 Using the shift formula Equation 10, we have x(t) = f (t) − kf (t − a) + k2f (t − 2a) − k3f (t − 3a) + . . . (This is not really an inﬁnite series because f (t) = 0 for t < 0.) If the input is bounded and k < 1 then even for large t the series is bounded. So bounded input produces bounded output –this is also what is meant by stability. On the other hand if k > 1, then bounded input can lead to unbounded output –this is instability. 12.10 Table of Laplace transforms Properties and Rules We assume that f (t) = 0 for t < 0.
