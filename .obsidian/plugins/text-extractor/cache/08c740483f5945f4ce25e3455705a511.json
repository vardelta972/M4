(Russia 2000/9) Find all functions f : R → R which satisfy f (x+y)+f (y+z)+f (z+x) ≥ 3f (x+2y+3z) for all x, y, z. Solution: Answer: f constant. Solution: Put x = a, y = z = 0, then 2f (a) + f (0) ≥ 3f (a), so f (0) ≥ f (a). Put x = a/2, y = a/2, z = −a/2. Then f (a) + f (0) + f (0) ≥ 3f (0), so f (a) ≥ f (0). Hence f (a) = f (0) for all a. But any constant function obviously satisﬁes the given relation. 2. (MOP97/2/1) Let f be a real-valued function which satisﬁes (a) for all real x, y, f (x + y) + f (x − y) = 2f (x)f (y). (b) there exists a real number x0 such that f (x0) = −1. Prove that f is periodic. Solution: Swapping x and y yields that function is even. Yet plugging in x = y = 0 we get f (0) = 0 or 1. If it is 0, then plugging in y = 0 yields f ≡ 0, done. Otherwise, f (0) = 1, and plug in x = y = x0/2 to get f (x0)+1 = 2f (x0/2) 2, implying that f (x0/2) = 0. Now plugging in y = x0/2, we get that f (x + x0/2) = −f (x − x0/2), so function inverts sign every x0. Hence periodic with period 2x0. 3. (Balkan 1987/1) f is a real valued function on the reals satisfying (1) f (0) = 1/2, (2) for some real a we have f (x + y) = f (x)f (a − y) + f (y)f (a − x) for all x, y. Prove that f is constant. Solution: Put x = y = 0. We get f (0) = 2f (0)f (a), so f (a) = 1/2. Put y = 0, we get f (x) = f (x)f (a) + f (0)f (a − x), so f (x) = f (a − x). Put y = a − x, we get f (a) = f (x) 2 + f (a − x) 2, so f (x) = 1/2 or −1/2. Now take any x. We have f (x/2) = 1/2 or −1/2 and f (a−x/2) = f (x/2). Hence f (x) = f (x/2+x/2) = 2f (x)f (a − x/2) = 1/2. Problems 1. (IMO 2002/5) Find all real-valued functions f on the reals such that [f (x) + f (y)][f (u) + f (v)] = f (xu − yv) + f (xv + yu) for all x, y, u, v. Solution: Plug in all 0; then f (0) = 0 or 1/2. If 1/2, then plug in x = y = 0 and get f (u) + f (v) = 1 implying that constant at 1/2. Now suppose f (0) = 0. Plug in x = v = 0. Then f (y)f (u) = f (yu). So f (1) 2 = f (1) implying that f (1) = 0 or 1. If 0, then multiplicativity implies that constant at 0. Else: Plug in x = y = 1. Now 2[f (u) + f (v)] = f (u − v) + f (u + v). Using u = 0, v = 1, get f (−1) = 1. Multiplicativity implies f is even. 1 Plug in x = y, u = v. Then 4f (x)f (u) = f (2xu). Multiplicativity implies that f (2) = 4. More multiplicativity gives that f (x) = x 2 for all powers of 2. Inductively using 2[f (u) + f (v)] = f (u − v) + f (u + v), get that f (z) = z2 for all integers. Reverse multiplicativity implies that f (q) = q2 for all rationals. Multiplicativity implies f (x 2) = f (x) 2 so f ≥ 0. Yet plug in x = v, y = u and get f (x 2 + y2) = [f (x) + f (y)] 2 ≥ f (x) 2 by nonnegativity, so increasing function. 2. (IMO 1999/6) Determine all functions f : R → R such that f (x − f (y)) = f (f (y)) + xf (y) + f (x) − 1 for all x, y ∈ R. Solution: Let c = f (0) and A be the image f (R). If a is in A, then it is straightforward to ﬁnd f (a): putting a = f (y) and x = a, we get f (a − a) = f (a) + a 2 + f (a) − 1, so f (a) = (1 + c)/2 − a 2/2 (*). The next step is to show that A − A = R. Note ﬁrst that c cannot be zero, for if it were, then putting y = 0, we get: f (x − c) = f (c) + xc + f (x) − 1 (**) and hence f (0) = f (c) = 1. Contradiction. But (**) also shows that f (x − c) − f (x) = xc + (f (c) − 1). Here x is free to vary over R, so xc + (f (c) − 1) can take any value in R. Thus given any x in R, we may ﬁnd a, b ∈ A such that x = a − b. Hence f (x) = f (a − b) = f (b) + ab + f (a) − 1. So, using (*): f (x) = c − b2/2 + ab − a 2/2 = c − x 2/2. In particular, this is true for x ∈ A. Comparing with (*) we deduce that c = 1. So for all x ∈ R we must have f (x) = 1 − x 2/2. Finally, it is easy to check that this satisﬁes the original relation and hence is the unique solution. 3. Let f (x) be a continuous function with f (0) = 1. Suppose that for every n ∈ Z + and any t ∈ R: (f (t)) n = f (√nt) . Prove that there exists a constant c such that on R+, f (t) = e ct2. Solution: Suppose there exists t > 0 such that f (t) ≤ 0. Then there exists a minimal s0 > 0 such that f (s0) = 0. But then f (s0) = f (s0/√2) 2, contradicting minimality. Same holds for t < 0. Therefore, this function exists: L(t) = log f (t). But then for any m, n ∈ Z +, we have L((n/m)t) = (n/m) 2L(t). Continuity tells us that L(r) = r2L(1) for any r ∈ R+. 4. (IMO 1996/3) Let S be the set of non-negative integers. Find all functions f : S → S such that f (m + f (n)) = f (f (m)) + f (n) for all m, n. Solution: Setting m = n = 0, the given relation becomes: f (f (0)) = f (f (0)) + f (0). Hence f (0) = 0. Hence also f (f (0)) = 0. Setting m = 0, now gives f (f (n)) = f (n), so we may write the original relation as f (m + f (n)) = f (m) + f (n). So f (n) is a ﬁxed point. Let k be the smallest non-zero ﬁxed point. If k does not exist, then f (n) is zero for all n, which is a possible solution. If k does exist, then an easy induction shows that f (qk) = qk for all non-negative integers q. Now if n is another ﬁxed point, write n = kq + r, with 0 ≤ r < k. Then f (n) = f (r + f (kq)) = f (r) + f (kq) = kq + f (r). Hence f (r) = r, so r must be zero. Hence the ﬁxed points are precisely the multiples of k. But f (n) is a ﬁxed point for any n, so f (n) is a multiple of k for any n. Let us take n1, n2, . . . , nk−1 to be arbitrary non-negative integers and set n0 = 0. Then the most general function satisfying the conditions we have established so far is: f (qk + r) = qk + nrk for 0 ≤ r < k. We can check that this satisﬁes the functional equation. Let m = ak + r, n = bk + s, with 0 ≤ r, s < k. Then f (f (m)) = f (m) = ak + nrk, and f (n) = bk + nsk, so f (m + f (n)) = ak + bk + nrk + nsk, and f (f (m)) + f (n) = ak + bk + nrk + nsk. So this is a solution and hence the most general solution. 2 5. (IMO 1994/2) Let S be the set of all real numbers greater than −1. Find all functions f : S → S such that f (x + f (y) + xf (y)) = y + f (x) + yf (x) for all x and y, and f (x)/x is strictly increasing on each of the intervals −1 < x < 0 and 0 < x. Solution: Suppose f (a) = a. Then putting x = y = a in the relation given, we get f (b) = b, where b = 2a + a 2. If −1 < a < 0, then −1 < b < a. But f (a)/a = f (b)/b. Contradiction. Similarly, if a > 0, then b > a, but f (a)/a = f (b)/b. Contradiction. So we must have a = 0. But putting x = y in the relation given we get f (k) = k for k = x + f (x) + xf (x). Hence for any x we have x + f (x) + xf (x) = 0 and hence f (x) = −x/(x + 1). Finally, it is straightforward to check that f (x) = −x/(x + 1) satisﬁes the two conditions. 6. (IMO 1992/2) Find all functions f deﬁned on the set of all real numbers with real values, such that f (x 2 + f (y)) = y + f (x) 2 for all x, y. Solution: The ﬁrst step is to establish that f (0) = 0. Putting x = y = 0, and f (0) = t, we get f (t) = t2. Also, f (x 2 + t) = f (x) 2, and f (f (x)) = x + t2. We now evaluate f (t2 + f (1) 2) two ways. First, it is f (f (1) 2 + f (t)) = t + f (f (1)) 2 = t + (1 + t2) 2 = 1 + t + 2t2 + t4. Second, it is f (t2 + f (1 + t)) = 1 + t + f (t) 2 = 1 + t + t4. So t = 0, as required. It follows immediately that f (f (x)) = x, and f (x 2) = f (x) 2. Given any y, let z = f (y). Then y = f (z), so f (x 2 + y) = z + f (x) 2 = f (y) + f (x) 2. Now given any positive x, take z so that x = z2. Then f (x + y) = f (z2 + y) = f (y) + f (z) 2 = f (y) + f (z2) = f (x) + f (y). Putting y = −x, we get 0 = f (0) = f (x + −x) = f (x) + f (−x). Hence f (−x) = −f (x). It follows that f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) and f (x − y) = f (x) − f (y) hold for all x, y. Take any x. Let f (x) = y. If y > x, then let z = y − x. f (z) = f (y − x) = f (y) − f (x) = x − y = −z. If y < x, then let z = x − y and f (z) = f (x − y) = f (x) − f (y) = y − x. In either case we get some z > 0 with f (z) = −z < 0. But now take w so that w2 = z, then f (z) = f (w2) = f (w) 2 ≥ 0. Contradiction. So we must have f (x) = x. 7. (Balkan 2000/1) Find all real-valued functions on the reals which satisfy f (xf (x) + f (y)) = f (x) 2 + y for all x, y. Solution: Answer: (1) f (x) = x for all x; (2) f (x) = −x for all x. Put x = 0, then f (f (y)) = f (0) 2 + y. Put y = −f (0) 2 and k = f (y). Then f (k) = 0. Now put x = y = k. Then f (0) = 0 + k, so k = f (0). Put y = k, x = 0, then f (0) = f (0) 2 + k, so k = 0. Hence f (0) = 0. Put x = 0, f (f (y)) = y (*). Put y = 0, f (xf (x)) = f (x) 2 (**). Put x = f (z) in (**), then using f (z) = x, we have f (zf (z)) = z2. Hence z2 = f (z) 2 for all z (***). In particular, f (1) = 1 or −1. Suppose f (1) = 1. Then putting x = 1 in the original relation we get f (1 + f (y)) = 1 + y. Hence (1 + f (y)) 2 = (1 + y) 2. Hence f (y) = y for all y. Similarly if f (1) = −1, then putting x = 1 in the original relation we get f (−1 + f (y)) = 1 + y. Hence (−1 + f (y)) 2 = (1 + y) 2, so f (y) = −y for all y. Finally, it is easy to check that f (x) = x does indeed satisfy the original relation, as does f (x) = −x. 8. (IMO 1990/1) Construct a function from the set of positive rational numbers into itself such that f (xf (y)) = f (x)/y for all x, y. Solution: We show ﬁrst that f (1) = 1. Taking x = y = 1, we have f (f (1)) = f (1). Hence f (1) = f (f (1)) = f (1f (f (1))) = f (1)/f (1) = 1. Next we show that f (xy) = f (x)f (y). For any y we have 1 = f (1) = f (1/f (y)f (y)) = f (1/f (y))/y, so if z = 1/f (y) then f (z) = y. Hence f (xy) = f (xf (z)) = f (x)/z = f (x)f (y). Finally, f (f (x)) = f (1f (x)) = f (1)/x = 1/x. We are not required to ﬁnd all functions, just one. So divide the primes into two inﬁnite sets S = {p1, p2, . . .} and T = {q1, q2, . . .}. Deﬁne f (pn) = qn, and f (qn) = 1/pn. We extend this deﬁnition to all rationals using f (xy) = f (x)f (y): f (pi1pi2 · · · qj1qj2 · · · /(pk1 · · · qm1 · · ·)) = pm1 · · · qi1 · · · /(pj1 · · · qk1 · · ·). It is now trivial to verify that f (xf (y)) = f (x)/y. 3 9. (IMO Shortlist 1995/A5) Does there exist a real-valued function f on the reals such that f (x) is bounded, f (1) = 1 and f (x + 1/x 2) = f (x) + f (1/x) 2 for all non-zero x? Solution: Answer: no. Suppose there is such a function. Let c be the least upper bound of the set of values f (x). We have f (2) = f (1 + 1/12) = f (1) + f (1/1) 2 = 2. So c ≥ 2. But deﬁnition we can ﬁnd y such that f (y) > c − 1/4. So c ≥ f (y + 1/y2) = f (y) + f (1/y) 2 > c − 1/4 + f (1/y) 2. So f (1/y) 2 < 1/4 and hence f (1/y) > −1/2. We also have c ≥ f (1/y+y2) = f (1/y)+f (y) 2 > −1/2+(c−1/4) 2 = c 2−c/2−7/16. So c 2−3c/2−7/16 < 0, or (c − 3/4) 2 < 1. But c ≥ 2, so that is false. Contradiction. So there cannot be any such function. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
