Don’t forget about the weighted AM-GM inequality. Let α1, · · · , αn > 0 and α = α1 + · · · + αn. Then α1x1 + · · · + αnxn α ≥ α √xα1 1 · · · xαn n . Cauchy Schwarz Inequality: Let x1, · · · , xn, y1, · · · , yn ∈ R. (x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n)(y2 1 + y2 2 + · · · + y2 n) ≥ (x1y1 + · · · + xnyn) 2. and the following corollaries, x2 1 + x2 2 + · · · + x2 n ≥ (x1 + · · · + xn)2 n . x2 1 y1 + · · · + x2 n yn ≥ (x1 + · · · + xn)2 y1 + · · · + yn . Jensen’s Inequality: Let f be a convex function on a closed interval I and x1, x2, · · · , xn ∈ I. Let a1, · · · , an be non-negative numbers such that a1 + a2 + · · · + an = 1. Then f (a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn) ≤ a1f (x1) + a2f (x2) + · · · + anf (xn). Of course, there is always the special case: f ( x1 + · · · + xn n ) ≤ f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) n . If f is concave, then f (a1x1 + a2x2 + · · · + anxn) ≥ a1f (x1) + a2f (x2) + · · · + anf (xn). Of course, there is always the special case: f ( x1 + · · · + xn n ) ≥ f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) n . Muirhead’s Inequality: Let a1, a2, a3, b1, b2, b3 ≥ 0 such that a1 + a2 + a3 = b1 + b2 + b3, a1 ≥ a2 ≥ a3 and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ b3. The triple (a1, a2, a3) is said to majorize (b1, b2, b3) if a1 ≥ b1 and a1 + a2 ≥ b1 + b2. Then for all x, y, z ≥ 0, ∑ sym xa1 ya2za3 ≥ ∑ sym xb1 yb2 zb3 . The following are the equality cases of Muirhead’s Inequality: 1 2010 IMO Summer Training: Inequalities 2 1. If (a, b, c) = (a ′, b ′, c ′), then clearly equality always holds. 2. Else if c, c ′ > 0, then equality holds if and only if x = y = z or at least one of x, y, z is 0. 3. Else if c = c ′ = 0 and b > 0, then equality holds if and only if x = y = z or if two of x, y, z are equal and the third is equal to 0. 4. Otherwise, equality holds if and only if x = y = z. Solving an inequality requires experience, trial and error. Sometimes, even if I tell you that the problem can be solved using AM-GM, it can be tricky to see how the AM-GM can be applied. It is not likely that the n terms to apply the AM-GM inequality will just be gift-wrapped and handed to you. 1 Example 1: Let x, y, z be any positive real numbers such that x + y + z = 3. Prove that x3 (y + 2z)2 + y3 (z + 2x)2 + z3 (x + 2y)2 ≥ 1 3 . Proof: By AM-GM Inequality, x3 (y + 2z)2 + y + 2z 27 + y + 2z 27 ≥ 3x/9 = x/3. Therefore, x3 (y + 2z)2 ≥ 9x − 2y − 4z 27 . Hence, ∑ cyc x3 (y + 2z)2 ≥ ∑ cyc 9x − 2y − 4z 27 = 3(x + y + z) 27 = 1 3 , as desired. □ Why did I pick the denominator 27? The equality case of AM − GM is when all terms applied are equal. Note that x = y = z is an equality case of the whole inequality. Therefore, I want to use AM-GM to clear the denominator (y + 2z) in a way so that all three terms in x3 (y+2z)2 + y+2z 27 + y+2z 27 are equal. This occurs when the denominator of the latter two terms is 27. Example 2: Let x, y, z > 0. Find the minimum possible value of x y + √ y z + 3 √ z x . Proof: Let S = x y + √ y z + 3√ z x . Note that S = x y + 1 2 √ y z + 1 2 √ y z + 1 3 √ z x + 1 3 √ z x + 1 3 √ z x . 1Seriously, do you expect your ﬁrst problem to be proving x + 1 x ≥ 2 for all x > 0? 2 2010 IMO Summer Training: Inequalities 3 Therefore, S ≥ 6 6 √ 1 22 · 1 33 · x y · y z · z x = 6 21/3 · 31/2 . Equality holds when x y = 1 2 · √ y z = 1 3 √ z x . Some algebra yields that x = 1, y = 21/331/2, z = 3√3/2 is an equality case. Therefore, 6 21/3·31/2 is indeed the minimum of S. □ Weighted AM-GM is very powerful when dealing with terms that are not symmetric and do not multiply ”nicely”. Example 3: If a, b, c are positive real numbers such that 1 a2 + 1 + 1 b2 + 1 + 1 c2 + 1 = 2. Prove that ab + bc + ca ≤ 3 2 . Solution: Rewriting the initial conditions yield ∑ cyc a 2 a2 + 1 = 1. By Cauchy Schwarz’s Inequality, we have ( ∑ cyc a2 a2 + 1 ) ( ∑ cyc (a 2 + 1) ) ≥ (a + b + c) 2. Hence, (a + b + c)2 ≤ a 2 + b2 + c 2 + 3. This is equivalent to ab + bc + ca ≤ 3 2 . □ It is important to interpret and use the initial conditions of an inequality in as many ways as possible to yield a solution to the inequality. Example 4: Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers such that a + b + c = 1. Prove that a √b + b √c + c√a ≤ 1 √3 . Solution: Since f (x) = √x is concave on [0, ∞) and a + b + c = 1, by (weighted) Jensen’s Inequality, a √b + b √c + c√a ≤ √ab + bc + ca ≤ √ (a + b + c)2 3 = 1 √3 , as desired. □ The direct use of Jensen’s inequality is straight forward. Applying a weighted version can be tricky. Example 5: Let a, b, c ≥ 0 such that ab + bc + ca = 1. Prove that 1 a + b + 1 b + c + 1 c + a ≥ 5 2 . 3 2010 IMO Summer Training: Inequalities 4 Remember that other equality cases hold for Muirhead’s inequality aside from a = b = c. Solution Beginning: Assuming your strategy is using Muirhead’s Inequality, you simply need to homogenize the inequality, i.e. make all the terms have the same degree. Since the left hand side has degree −1 and the right hand side has degree 0, and our initial condition has degree 2, we need to square both sides of our inequality before homogenizing. In the end, it suﬃces to prove that (ab + bc + ca) ( 1 a + b + 1 b + c + 1 c + a )2 ≥ 25 4 . Now both sides of degree zero. It’s bashing time. :) Exercises: 1. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers such that xyz = 1. Prove that x3 (1 + y)(1 + z) + y3 (1 + z)(1 + x) + z3 (1 + x)(1 + y) ≥ 3 4 . 2. Let a, b, c > 0 such that abc ≤ 1.

If a, b, c are positive real numbers such that a + b + c = 3, show that 1 2 + a2 + b2 + 1 2 + b2 + c2 + 1 2 + c2 + a2 ≤ 3 4 4 2010 IMO Summer Training: Inequalities 5 8. Let a, b, c be non-negative real numbers such that a + b + c = 3. Prove that (a 2 − ab + b2)(b 2 − bc + c 2)(c2 − ca + a 2) ≤ 12. 9. Let n be a positive integer and x1, x2, · · · , xn ∈ R such that |xi| ≤ 1 for each i ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n} and x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = 0. a.) Prove that there exists k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n} such that |x1 + 2x2 + · · · + kxk| ≤ 2k + 1 4 . b.) For n > 2, prove that the bound in (a) is the best possible. i.e. there exists x1, x2, · · · , xn satisfying the initial conditions such that for all k ∈ {1, 2, · · · , n}. |x1 + 2x2 + · · · + kxk| ≥ 2k + 1 4 . 10. Let u, v, w be positive real numbers such that u + v + w + √uvw = 4. Prove that √ uv w + √ vw u + √ wu v ≥ u + v + w. 5 2010 IMO Summer Training: Inequalities 6 Hints 1. Use the same technique as Example 1. 2. Try to use weighted AM-GM inequality. Can you assume that abc = 1? 3. Try to use weighted AM-GM inequality. 4. Let (u, v, w) = ( 1 a+1 , 1 b+1 , 1 c+1 ). Then apply Jensen’s inequality on a natural function. 5. Apply inequalites to the right-hand side to result in something that look close to the left-hand side. Use QM-AM. 6. Use the same technique as Example 4. 7. Use the same technique as Example 3, plus a few more clever inequalities. 8. WLOG, suppose a ≥ b ≥ c. Even an inequality as weak as b2 − bc + c 2 = b2 − c(b − c) ≤ b2 can solve this inequality. 9. (a) Suppose there exists a minimum k where the inequality fails. (b) should not be too hard. Consider the cases when n is odd and even separately. 10. Remember that if u, v, w ≥ 0, then u 2 + v2 + w2 + 2uvw = 1 if and only if u = cos A, v = cos B, w = cos C for some triangle ABC. 6","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
