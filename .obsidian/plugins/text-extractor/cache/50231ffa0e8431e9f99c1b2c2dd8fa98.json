Harun Siljak (Bosnia and Herzegovina) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Chapter 2 Articles 2.1 Three Ways to Attack a Functional Equation Alexander Remorov 1 PEN K11 (Canada 2002) Find all functions f : N0 → N0 such that for all m, n ∈ N0: mf (n) + nf (m) = (m + n)f (m2 + n 2). (2.1) First Solution. We claim that the only function satisfying the conditions is the constant function. Assume there exists a, b ∈ N : f (a) > f (b). Take a, b such that f (a) − f (b) is minimal. Then: (a + b)f (b) < af (b) + bf (a) < (a + b)f (a) (2.2) From the given functional equation, af (b) + bf (a) = (a + b)f (a 2 + b2). Substituting this into (1) gives: (a + b)f (b) < (a + b)f (a 2 + b2) < (a + b)f (a) ⇒ f (b) < f (a 2 + b2) < f (a) (2.3) Then f (a 2 + b2) − f (b) < f (a) − f (b), contradicting the choice of a and b. Hence the existence of a, b ∈ N: f (a) ̸= f (b) is impossible. Hence there exists t ∈ N0 : ∀x ∈ N : f (x) = t. Finally, substituting m = 0, n = 1 into the original functional equation, we obtain that f (0) = f (1). Hence there exists t ∈ N0 : ∀x ∈ N0 : f (x) = t. It is clear that that any t ∈ N0 woks. Therefore the only solution is ∀x ∈ N0 : f (x) = t for any ﬁxed t ∈ N0. In the above solution, the key idea was using the extremal principle and arriving at a contra- diction because of (2). This technique is applicable to this problem because of the discreteness of integers and is often used in solving many equations related to integers, including diophantine equations, where very often the ﬁrst step is taking the minimal solution and then trying to ﬁnd a smaller one. 3 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Second Solution. Let f (0) = z. Let S be the set of all non-negative integers such that ∀x ∈ S : f (x) = z. Clearly 0 ∈ S. We note that: 1. Plugging into the functional equation m = 0, n = t ∈ N0, we get tf (0) = tf (t 2) ⇒ f (t 2) = f (0), so: ∀t ∈ N : t 2 ∈ S (2.4) 2. If a, b ∈ S, then substituting m = a, n = b into the functional equation, we get af (b) + bf (a) = (a + b)f (a 2 + b2). But a, b ∈ S, so f (b) = f (a) = z, so we get: (a + b)f (a 2 + b2) = af (0) + bf (0) ⇒ f (a 2 + b2) = z (2.5) Therefore: ∀a, b ∈ S : a 2 + b 2 ∈ S (2.6) 3. If a, b, c, d ∈ N, a, b, c ∈ S, a 2 + b 2 = c 2 + d 2 then from (2), a, b ∈ S ⇒ a 2 + b2 ∈ S. Also substituting m = c, n = d into the functional equation, we get: cf (d) + df (c) = (c + d)f (c 2 + d2). But c ∈ S, c 2 + d 2 = a 2 + b 2 ∈ S ⇒ f (c) = z, f (c 2 + d 2) = z, so cf (d) + dz = (c + d)z ⇒ f (d) = z (2.7) Hence: ∀a, b, c, d ∈ N, a, b, c ∈ S, a 2 + b 2 = c2 + d2 : d ∈ S. (2.8) Now we can use the properties (3), (5), (7) of the function to solve the problem. Let us ﬁrst prove x ∈ S for small positive integers x. 1 = 1 2,so by (3), we get 1 ∈ S. 2 = 1 2 + 12, 1 ∈ S so by (5), we get 2 ∈ S. 4 = 2 2, so by (3), we get 4 ∈ S. Substituting m = 3, n = 4 into the functional equation we obtain 4f (3) + 3f (4) = 7f (25); 25 = 5 2 ∈ S, 4 ∈ S, so 4f (3) + 3z = 7z ⇒ f (3) = z ⇒ 3 ∈ S. 5 = 2 2 + 12; 1, 2 ∈ S, so by (5), we get 5 ∈ S. Therefore, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ∈ S. Let us now use mathematical induction on t to prove that ∀t ∈ N, t ≥ 5 : 1, 2, 3, . . . , t ∈ S (2.9) Base Step We have proved (8) for t = 5 in the previous paragraph. Induction Step Assume (8) holds for t = r − 1 ∈ N, r ≥ 5. We need to prove (8) for t = r. We consider two cases: Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Case 1 r is odd. Then we need to prove r ∈ S. It is quite natural to try to use (7) in or- der to prove r ∈ S. Let us look for integers a, b, c ∈ S, such that a 2 + b2 = c 2 + r2. Note 1, 2, . . . , r − 1 ∈ S, so it is enough to ﬁnd a, b, c ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1}. Take a = r − 2, then: a 2 + b 2 = c2 + r2 ⇔ (r − 2)2 + b2 = c 2 + r2 ⇔ b2 − c 2 = 4(r − 1) (2.10) Now r is odd, so r − 1 is even, so r − 1 = 2s, hence we just need to ﬁnd b, c ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1} so that b2 − c2 = 8s, and then r ∈ S by (7). If we set b − c = 4, b + c = 2s, we get b = s + 2, c = s − 2, and as r − 1 is even and is greater than or equal to 5, r −1 ≥ 6 ⇒ 2s ≥ 6 ⇒ s ≥ 3. But then s+2 < 2s ⇔ s > 2, which is true for s ≥ 3. Also s ≥ 3 ⇒ s−2 ≥ 1. So b = s+2, c = s−2 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r −1}, hence a = r −2, b = s+2, c = s−2 ∈ S and a2 + b2 = c 2 + r2, so by (7), r ∈ S, so (8) holds for t = r if r is odd. Case 2 r is even. We will try to use the same technique as in case 1. However, this time taking a = r − 2 will not work, as we would then get b2 − c 2 = 4(r − 1), but now r − 1 is odd and can be prime, and then we would not ﬁnd the desired b, c ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1}. But we can take a = r − 4, because then: b2 − c2 = r2 − (r − 4)2 = 8(r − 2) = 16u (2.11) where r − 2 = 2u, as it is even, because r is even. Then we set b − c = 8, b + c = 2u ⇒ b = u + 4, c = u − 4. Then b = u + 4 < 2u + 1 = r − 1 ⇔ u > 3, c = u − 4 ≥ 1 ⇔ u ≥ 5 (2.12) So if u ≥ 5, the desired a, b, c exist, as then a = r − 4, b = u + 4, c = u − 4 ∈ {1, 2, . . . , r − 1}, a 2 + b 2 = c 2 + r2, so by (7), r ∈ S and (8) holds for t = r if r is even and 2u = r − 2 ≥ 10 ⇔ r ≥ 12. Hence it remains to prove the result for r = 6, 8, 10. From case 1, we get that for x odd, x ≥ 5, x ∈ S. Then 7 ∈ S, 9 ∈ S. Now 4, 7, 9 ∈ S; 6 2 + 7 2 = 92 + 4 2, so by (7), 6 ∈ S. Also 8 = 2 2 + 2 2; 2 ∈ S ⇒ 8 ∈ S by (5). Finally 10 = 3 2 + 12; 1, 3 ∈ S ⇒ 10 ∈ S by (5). By mathematical induction it follows that (8) holds for all t ∈ N, and it immediately follows that the only solution is ∀x ∈ N0 : f (x) = t for any ﬁxed t ∈ N0. Note that we did not use the original functional equation in the solution after establishing (3), (5) and (7). However, (3), (5) and (7) give us less freedom than the original functional equation, but these three relations allow to transform the problem of solving a functional equation into the problem of proving that the set of non-negative integers satisfying (3), (5), (7) is the set of all non- negative integers, and problems like this are very often solved using mathematical induction. Third Solution. A very standard technique for solving functional equations with a unique solution is to consider the function g(x) = f (x) − h(x), where f (x) is the original function, and h(x) is Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com the solution. This is useful because g(x) must be 0 for all x in the domain, which often makes it easier to prove that g(x) is always 0, especially when there are no expressions of the form f (f (x)), f (f (f (x))), etc. In this problem, we can see that f (x) = f (0) is a solution and probably is the only solution. So, let us consider g(x) = f (x) − f (0). Substituting f (x) = g(x) + f (0) into the original functional equation, we get: mg(n) + ng(m) = (m + n)g(m 2 + n2) (2.13) Now, g(0) = 0. Substituting m = 0, n = t ∈ N into (12), we obtain tg(0) = tg(t2) ⇒ g(t2) = g(0) = 0. Therefore ∀t ∈ N : g(t 2) = 0 (2.14) Substituting into (12) m = a, n = b, a, b ∈ N, a > b such that there exists c ∈ N : a2 + b2 = c2, we get: ag(b) + bg(a) = (a + b)g(a 2 + b2) = (a + b)g(c 2) = 0 = g(a 2 + b 2) (2.15) Therefore: g(a) = − a b g(b), a > b ⇒ |g(a)| > |g(b)| (2.16) This is very powerful, as we notice that g(x) = f (x) − f (0) is bounded from below, because f : N0 → N0. Assume there exists r ∈ N : g(r) ̸= 0. Clearly r ̸= 0. We just now need to construct an inﬁnite sequence of positive integers r = x0 < x1 < x2 . . . such that for i = 1, 2, 3 . . ., there exist yi ∈ Z : x2 i−1 + x2 i = y2 i , because then from (15), |g(x0)| < |g(x1)| < |g(x2)| < . . ., and the signs of g(xi), g(xi+1) will be diﬀerent. But ∀x ∈ N : f (x), f (0) ∈ N0 ⇒ g(x) ∈ Z. Then |g(x0)| < |g(x1)| < |g(x2)| < . . . ⇒ |g(xz)| ≥ |g(xz−1)| + 1 ≥ |g(xz−1)| + 2 ≥ . . . ≥ |g(x0)| + z (2.17) Then for z suﬃciently large, |g(xz)| > f (0). But then |g(xz+1)| > f (0), and one of g(xz), g(xz+1) is negative and is less than −f (0), but this is impossible as ∀x ∈ N : g(x) = f (x) − f (0) ≥ −f (0). Therefore the existence of r ∈ N : g(r) ̸= 0 is impossible, so ∀x ∈ N0 : f (x) = f (0), and we would be done as long as we can construct the sequence r = x0 < x1 < x2 . . . From the second solution, we proved that f (1) = f (2) = f (3) = f (4) = f (0) so g(1) = g(2) = g(3) = g(4) = 0. Hence the r ∈ N for which g(r) ̸= 0 must be greater than 4. Let us prove that ∀k ∈ N, k > 4 we can ﬁnd l ∈ N, l > k : ∃p ∈ N : k2 + l2 = p 2. If k is even, let k = 2h, then we can take l = h 2 − 1, then l2 + k2 = (k2 + 1) 2. Also l > k as h2 − 1 > 2h ⇔ h 2 − 2h + 1 ≥ 2 ⇔ (h − 1)2 ≥ 2, which is true because k = 2h > 4. Hence if xi = 2g is an even term in the sequence r = x0 < x1 < x2 . . ., we set xi+1 = g2 + 1, then xi+1 satisﬁes all of the properties of the sequence. If k is odd, let k = 2h + 1, then it is more diﬃcult to ﬁnd l. It would be convenient for us to take l so that l2 + k2 = Q(h) is a fourth degree polynomial in h, which is a perfect square for all h. We see that k2 = 4h 2 + 4h + 1, then if l = P (h) has a free term q ∈ Z, then Q(h) has a free Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com term q2 + 1, which must be a perfect square, so q = 0. Now as Q(h) is a fourth degree polynomial, P (h) is a second degree polynomial with free term of 0, so it has the form wh 2 + vh. In this case, Q(h) = (w2)h 4 + (2vw)h 3 + (v2 + 4)h 2 + 4h + 1 = (R(h))2 (2.18) for some polynomial R(h) with integer coeﬃcients. This polynomial is also second degree, and because in Q(h) the leading coeﬃcient is w2 and the free coeﬃcient is 1, R(h) = wh 2 + sh + 1 for some s ∈ Z. But the coeﬃcient in Q(h) for h is 4, which is equal to the coeﬃcient for h in (R(h))2, which is 2s, hence s = 2. Then the coeﬃcient for h 3 in (R(h))2 is 4w, which must be equal to the coeﬃcient for h 3 in Q(h), which is 2vw, hence we have v = 2. Also the coeﬃcient for h 2 in (R(h)) 2 is 2w+4, which must be equal to the coeﬃcient for h 2 in Q(h), which is v2 + 4, hence we have 2w = v2 = 2 2 ⇒ w = 2. So v = w = 2, so l = 2h 2 + 2h. It is easy to check that l2 + k2 = (2h 2 + 2h) 2 + (2h + 1)2 = (2h2 + 2h + 1)2, and so l = 2h 2 + 2h > 2h + 1 = k. Hence if xi = 2g + 1 is an odd term in the sequence r = x0 < x1 < x2 . . ., we set xi+1 = 2g2 + 2g, then xi+1 satisﬁes all of the properties of the sequence. Therefore, starting with r, we can always construct the next term in the sequence depending on the parity of the current term, and as a result, the required inﬁnite sequence r = x0 < x1 < x2 . . . exists, from where it follows that ∀x ∈ N : g(x) = 0, so the only solution is ∀x ∈ N0 : f (x) = t for any ﬁxed t ∈ N0.

First Solution. For 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 1, we have k3 ̸≡ 0 mod p and (p − k) 3 ≡ −(k3) mod p, and therefore ( k3 p − ⌊ k3 p ⌋) + ( (p − k)3 p − ⌊ (p − k)3 p ⌋) = 1. Hence, p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ k3 p ⌋ = p−1∑ k=1 k3 p − p−1∑ k=1 ( k3 p − ⌊ k3 p ⌋) = 1 p (p−1∑ k=1 k3) − 1 2 p−1∑ k=1 [( k3 p − ⌊ k3 p ⌋) + ( (p − k)3 p − ⌊ (p − k) 3 p ⌋)] = 1 p ( p(p − 1) 2 )2 − p − 1 2 = (p − 2)(p − 1)(p + 1) 4 . Second Solution. Motivated by this solution, we show a natural generalization: Proposition 2.2.1. Let p be an odd prime and let q be an integer that is not divisible by p. If f : Z ∗ + → R is a function such that: i) f (k) p is not an integer, for any k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1; ii) f (k) + f (p − k) is an integer divisible by p, for any k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1, then p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ qf (k) p ⌋ = q p · p−1∑ k=1 f (k) − p − 1 2 . Proof. From ii) it follows that qf (k) p + qf (p − k) p ∈ Z. From i) we obtain that qf (k) p ̸∈ Z and qf (p−k) p ̸∈ Z, for any k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1, and hence 0 < { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } < 2. On other hand, { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } = ( qf (k) p + qf (p − k) p ) − (⌊ qf (k) p ⌋ + ⌊ qf (k) p ⌋) , Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com and thus, because qf (k) p + qf (p−k) p ∈ Z, we deduce that { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } ∈ Z. It now follows that { qf (k) p } + { qf (p − k) p } = 1, for any k = 1, 2, . . . , p − 1. Summing up and dividing by 2 yields p−1∑ k=1 { qf (k) p } = p − 1 2 , and therefore, p−1∑ k=1 qf (k) p − p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ qf (k) p ⌋ = p − 1 2 . This proves Proposition 1. Obviously, the function f (x) = x3 satisﬁes both conditions from Proposition 2.2.1. Hence, p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ k3 p ⌋ = q p · p−1∑ k=1 k3 − p − 1 2 = q p · ( (p − 1)p 2 )2 − p − 1 2 = (p − 2)(p − 1)(p + 1) 4 . We now proceed with another two applications of Proposition 2.2.1. We begin with Gauss’ celebrated formula. Proposition 2.2.2. (Gauss) Let p and q be two relatively prime integers. The following identity holds: p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ qk p ⌋ = (p − 1)(q − 1) 2 . Proof. The function f (x) = x satisﬁes both conditions in Proposition 2.2.1. Hence, p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ qk p ⌋ = q p · p−1∑ k=1 k − p − 1 2 = q p · (p − 1)p 2 − p − 1 2 = (p − 1)(q − 1) 2 . Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Proposition 2.2.3. (MathLinks, some olympiad - to add source) Let p be an odd prime. Show that p−1∑ k=1 kp − k p ≡ p + 1 2 ( mod p) . Proof. The function f (x) = xp p satisﬁes both conditions in Proposition 2.2.1. Thus, by setting q = 1 (note that we are allowed to do that), we get p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ kp p2 ⌋ = 1 p · p−1∑ k=1 kp p − p − 1 2 = 1 p · p−1∑ k=1 kp p − 1 p2 · p−1∑ k=1 k + 1 p2 · (p − 1)p 2 − p − 1 2 = 1 p · p−1∑ k=1 kp − k p − 1 p · (p − 1) 2 2 . Thus, p−1∑ k=1 kp − k p − (p − 1)2 2 = p · p−1∑ k=1 ⌊ kp p2 ⌋ , and therefore p−1∑ k=1 kp − k p ≡ (p − 1)2 2 ( mod p) ≡ p 2 + 1 2 ( mod p) ≡ p + 1 2 ( mod p) . Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com 2.3 Minimum prime divisors Daniel Kohen 3 PEN A14 A71 A14 Let n > 1 be an integer. Show that n does not divide 2 n − 1 (2.19) A71 Determine all integers n > 1 such that 2 n + 1 n2 (2.20) is an integer. Proof. First we will introduce some deﬁnitions and we will provide the proof of an elementary fact. Let d be the least natural number that satisﬁes a d ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.21) Then we write ordpa = d (2.22) Lemma 1: a k ≡ 1 (mod p) ⇐⇒ k ≡ 0 (mod ordpa) (2.23) Proof: ordpa = d (2.24) Let k = dt + r, d > r ≥ 0 (which is valid by the division algorithm) So we get that a dt+r ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.25) Since a d ≡ 1 (mod p) =⇒ a dt ≡ 1 (mod p) =⇒ a r ≡ 1 (mod p) but d > r (2.26) If r = 0 the claims follows and if r > 0 we are contradicting the minimality of d, so we see that this is not possible. It is worthy to stop here and analyze the importance of the deﬁnition we have just introduced. It not only uses elementary number theory but also relies on a very powerful principle that states that every set of natural numbers has an element which is less than the others.Clearly the idea of a least-element allows us to ﬁnd contradictions about minimality after supposing a number satisﬁes a given condition and is the smallest of the sort. This is a key concept in maths; especially in number theory. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Now we are ready to begin our proof of A14 Since n > 1, n has a prime divisor, then we can choose it so that it is minimal. Clearly if n is even we get that 2n − 1 is odd. An even number can’t divide an odd number so n is odd. Let p be the minimal prime that divides n (p > 2) We can write n = pk 2 pk ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.27) Because 2 p ≡ 2 (mod p) by Fermat’s little theorem, we get that 2k ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.28) Let d = ordp2 (2.29) So k = dt for some integer t Clearly d > 1 Since 2p−1 ≡ 1 (mod p) by Fermat’s little theorem , we obtain p − 1 ≡ 0 (mod d) (2.30) so 1 < d ≤ p − 1 < p (2.31) We obtain that d is a divisor of k,and it follows it is also a divisor of n. Because p > d > 1, we are contradicting the minimality of p; it follows that this is not possible, so there are not any solutions for n > 1, as we wished to prove. A71 Proof: Clearly n is odd.Again we deﬁne p as the least prime divisor of n. We have that 2n ≡ −1 (mod p) (2.32) squaring both sides 2 2n ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.33) Again we put n = pk and we have, reasoning in the same way as the previous problem, that 2 2k ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.34) Let d = ordp2 (2.35) Then 2k ≡ 0 (mod d) and p − 1 ≡ 0 (mod d) If gcd(k, d) > 1 , as exposed before, gcd(d, n) > 1 and d is smaller than p, which is absurd. So the only possibility is that d divides 2. d = 1 is not possible d = 2 we have that 2 2 ≡ 1 (mod p) =⇒ p = 3 (2.36) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Hensel Lemma (Lifting the exponent): Let p be an odd prime. Suppose that a ≡ b (mod p) (gcd(ab, p) = 1) Let’s deﬁne X as the maximum exponent of p dividing a − b and Y the maximum exponent of p dividing the positive number m. Then X + Y (2.37) is the maximum exponent of p dividing a m − bm (2.38) Now,back to the problem, let X be the exponent of 3 in n Since n2 divides 2 2n − 1 Then we get: 2X is the exponent of 3 in n2 Since the exponent of 3 in 22 − 1 is 1 we have that the exponent of 3 in 2 2n − 1 is X + 1 So we must have X + 1 ≥ 2X =⇒ X = 1 (2.39) Then we may write n = 3t with gcd(3, t) = 1 Now we will continue with our reasoning, as shown before. Let q be the least prime divisor of t t = ql (2.40) Again we get that 26l ≡ 1 (mod q) (2.41) Then if c = ordq2 (2.42) easily we conclude that c divides 6l and if gcd(l, c) > 1 we will get a similar contradiction as in previous lines. So c divides 6 the cases c = 1 and c = 2 lead to q = 1 implying n = 3 which works and q = 3 which doesn’t make any sense If c = 3 or c = 6 replacing in 2 c ≡ 1 (mod q) =⇒ q = 7 (2.43) We must have 2 n ≡ −1 (mod 7) (2.44) It is easy to check that 21 ≡ 2 (mod 7) 22 ≡ 4 (mod 7) 23 ≡ 1 (mod 7) But 2 k+3 ≡ 2 32 k ≡ 2 k (mod 7) So for all k , 2 k ̸≡ −1 (mod 7) As a corollary the only posibility is that n = 3 which indeed satisﬁes the equation. The proof is ﬁnished.

Show that a and b are integers. First Solution. Let xn = an − b n. We are given that xn ∈ Z for all n ∈ N. We can easily deduce that a, b are rational: x2 x1 ±x1 2 = a+b±(a−b) 2 = a, b. Assume, for contradiction’s sake, that a is not an integer. We’ll have a = p q , (p, q) = 1, and |q| > 1. There exist m ∈ N0 such that qm | a − b, qm+1 ∤ a − b. We have (x1 + p q )n − ( p q )n = xn, or equivalently: (x′qm+1 + p )n − pn = qnxn (2.46) For a suitable integer x′. Now we’ll use the binomial theorem and divide by qm+1: n−1∑ i=0 (n i )p ix′n−iq(m+1)(n−i−1) = qn−m−1xn. (2.47) Looking (mod q), for n > m + 1, we see that: x′p n−1n ≡ 0 (mod q). Exploiting the fact that (q, p) = 1 and taking n = (m + 2) |q| + 1, yields q|x′, a contradiction. Hence, q = ±1 and a is an integer. b = a − x1 is thus also an integer, Q.E.D. Remark: notice the similarities to the proof of the Rational root theorem. Second Solution. Notice the following identity: x2 n+1 − xnxn+2 = (ab) n x2 1 (2.48) It can be proved directly for every natural n: xnxn+2 −x2 n+1 = (a n − bn) (a n+2 − bn+2)−(a n+1 − bn+1)2 = a 2n+2 −b 2 (ab)n −a 2 (ab) n +b 2n+2 − a 2n+2 + 2 (ab) n+1 − b2n+2 = − (ab) n (a − b) 2 = − (ab) n x2 1. The motivation for it is the known identity F 2 n+1 − FnFn+2 = (−1)n satisﬁed by the Fibonacci sequence: F0 = 0, F1 = 1, Fn+2 = Fn+1 + Fn for all n ∈ N0. xn is a linear recurrence sequence, with its ﬁrst term being 0 (if we consider x0), like Fn. From its form we deduce that the roots of its characteristic equation are a and b. Thus, given that a ̸= b, the equation is x2 − (a + b) x + ab = 0, hence xn follows that recursion xn+2 = (a + b) xn+1 − abxn. Assume to the contrary that ab is not an integer. It can be represented in the form p q , where p, q are relatively prime integers and |q| > 1. From (2.22), we have: qn|x2 1p n For all n (because the expression on the left is an integer). From the fact that (p, q) = 1 it follows that qn|x2 1. x1 is non-zero, hence x2 1 ≥ qn ≥ 2 n. This is true for all n ∈ N and it’s a contradiction. Hence |q| = 1 Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com and ab is an integer. a − b = x1 is an integer also. Let a = p1 q , b = p2 q (p1,2, q ∈ Z). We know that q2|p1p2, q|p1 − p2. We’ll manipulate it as follows: q2 | (p1 − p2) 2 + 4p1p2 = (p1 + p2) 2 =⇒ q | p1 ± p2 =⇒ q | 2p1,2 (2.49) We have 2 options: either a and b are both integers, or are half-integers, i.e. take the form k1,2 +0.5 for some integers k1,2. We can see that the 2nd option is not valid in two diﬀerent ways: 1. a n − bn ∈ Z is equivalent to 2n | (2k1 + 1)n − (2k2 + 1)n. For n = 2 l We can factor it as follows: (2k1 + 1)2 l − (2k2 + 1)2l = 2 (k1 − k2) l−1∏ i=0 ((2k1 + 1)2 i + (2k2 + 1)2 i) (2.50) An expression of the form a 2 i + b 2i, where a, b are odd and i is positive, is never divisible by 4. This is a direct consequence of t2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) for t ≡ 1 (mod 2) (choose t = a 2 i−1, b 2i−1). Hence: ord2 ((2k1 + 1)2 l − (2k2 + 1)2 l ) = l + ord2 ((k1 − k2) ((2k1 + 1)2 + (2k2 + 1)2)) (2.51) For all l ∈ N. This fact contradicts ord2 ((2k1 + 1)n − (2k2 + 1)n) ≥ n for all n ∈ N: just take n = 2 l large enough. 2. We get that ab = k1k2 + 2k1+2k2+1 4 is an integer, which is impossible (shorter, huh?). Third Solution. We’ll prove 3 lemmas. Lemma 1: For any odd prime p, and distinct a, b satisfying a − b ≡ 0 (mod p), (ab, p) = 1, one has ordp (a n − bn) = ordp (n) + ordp (a − b). Proof: it is equivalent to the identity (a + bp k)pst − apst ≡ a pst−1btps+k (mod ps+k+1) (2.52) for k > 0. It can be proved either by induction on s ≥ 0, or by direct expanding: (a + bp k)pst − ap st = a pst−1btps+t + pst∑ i=2 (p st i )a pst−ipkibi (2.53) It is enough to show that ordp (p ki(pst i )) ≥ k + s for i > 1. Notice the following identity: i( pst i ) = p st (p st − 1 i − 1 ) (2.54) which implies: ordp (p ki(pst i )) ≥ ki + s − ordpi. If we put i = pjl > 1, (p, l) = 1, we get: ki + s − ordpi = kpjl + s − j ≥ k3 jl + s − j. What we want to show is: k (3jl − 1 ) ≥ j + 1. We have k ≥ 1 as a condition. For j = 0: k (3jl − 1 ) ≥ 3 jl − 1 = l − 1 ≥ 1 = j + 1, because i = l > 1. If j > 0: k (3 jl − 1 ) ≥ 3 j −1 ≥ j +1 (follows from 3 j ≥ j +2 for j ∈ N - straightforward induction). The result follows. Lemma 2: For any distinct odd integers a, b we have ord2 (a n − bn) = ord2 ( a 2−b 2 2 ) + ord2 (n) for even n ∈ N, and ord2 (an − bn) = ord2 (a − b) for odd n ∈ N. Proof: Both results follow directly from our work in the previous solution, and from the congruence Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com an−bn a−b = ∑n−1 i=0 a ib n−i−1 ≡ n ≡ 1 (mod 2) for odd n. Lemma 3: For any positive number x, any real number y, and any prime p, the inequality ordp (n) ≥ xn + y holds only for ﬁnitely many n′s. Proof: First step - let l be a non-negative integer. There are ﬁnitely many values of n that satisfy the inequality when p l||n, namely: n ≤ l−y x . Second step - pl ≥ l1.5 (induction). Third and last step - there are ﬁnitely many values of l that satisfy the inequality when p l||n: ordp (n) ≥ xn + y =⇒ l ≥ xl1.5 + y, or: 1 ≥ x√l + y l . When l tends to inﬁnity, the last expression tends to ∞, which yields the result. Combining the 3 steps, we get the result stated by the lemma. Now, as before, we let a = x z , b = y z (x ̸= y). xn is an integer for all n ∈ N is equivalent to: ∀n ∈ N, zn | xn − yn (2.55) We’ll prove that z | (x, y), and it will solve the problem. Set g = (x, y) , x ′ = x g , y′ = y g . Let p be an odd prime dividing z and set k = ordp (z). x − y is divisible by z and hence by p. Also, denote op as the order of x′y′−1 in the multiplicative group (Z/nZ) × (in the case when (x′, p) = (y′, p) = 1), i.e. the minimal number such that p|x′op − y′op . If op ∤ n, or one of x′, y′ is divisible by p: because ordp (z) reduces multiplication to addition, ordp (xn − yn) = ordp (x′n − y′n) + ordp (gn) = n ordp (g) (2.56) If op | n: from the ﬁrst lemma - ordp (x n − yn) = ordp (x ′n − y′n) + ordp (gn) = ordp (x ′op − y′op ) + ordp ( n op ) + n ordp (g) = C + ordp (n) + n ordp (g) Combining those, we get the inequality: nk = ordp (zn) ≤ ordp (xn − yn) ≤ n ordp (g) + |C| + ordp (n), where C is suitable constant. By the 3rd lemma, it is possible for all n only if ordp (g) ≥ k. The treatment of p = 2 is exactly the same using the 2nd lemma, except for the value of C, and we get ord2 (xn − yn) ≤ n ord2 (g) + ordp (n) + |C| for a suitable constant C. By the 3rd lemma, it is possible only if ord2 (g) ≥ k. The result follows. Generalizations: Proposition 2.4.1. Suppose that a and b are distinct real numbers such that: a n − b n ∈ Z for any n ∈ N divisible by s or t, where s, t are relatively prime positive integers. Then a, b are integers. Proof. It follows from the original problem: apply our result, once with a = a ′s, b = b′s and once with a = a ′t, b = b ′t. We get that a s, b s, a t, b t are integers. In the case where both a and b are non-zero, by Bzout’s lemma there are integers k1,2 such that sk1 + tk2 = 1. We get: a = (a s)k1 (a t) k2 =⇒ a ∈ Q. Together with a s ∈ Z we get that a ∈ Z. In the same way, b ∈ Z. If Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com a = b = 0, we’re done. If exactly one of a = 0, b = 0 is true, WLOG a = 0, as before we conclude that b s, b t ∈ Z, and then b ∈ Z. Proposition 2.4.2. Suppose that a and b are distinct rational numbers such that: a n − bn ∈ Z for inﬁnitely many n ∈ N. Then a, b are integers. Proof. We could actually show this already in the third solution. We again reformulate the problem as follows - zn | xn − yn for inﬁnitely many n’s implies z | (x, y) (when x ̸= y). As before, we use the 3rd lemma and get ordp ((x, y)) ≥ ordpz, for all primes p dividing z, and the result follows.

(2.57) D6 Show that, for any ﬁxed integer n ≥ 1 the sequence 2, 2 2, 22 2, 2 2 22 , · · · (mod n) (2.58) is eventually constant. The ﬁrst solution of problem M16 we’ll present here is in a traditionalized, brute-force manner (which is rather straightforward): Solution 1 (M16). First, we note that a1 ≡ 3 (mod 100) and a2 ≡ 27 (mod 100). Using square- and-multiply algorithm, we get: 3 6 ≡ 272 ≡ 29 (mod 100), 312 ≡ 29 2 ≡ 41 (mod 100), 324 ≡ 41 2 ≡ 81 (mod 100), 3 27 ≡ 27 × 81 ≡ 87 (mod 100). So, we have a3 ≡ 87 (mod 100). What about a4? 3 81 ≡ 873 ≡ 3 (mod 100), 3 87 ≡ 29 × 3 ≡ 87 (mod 100). So a4 ≡ 3 100k87 (mod 100). This takes us to an interesting hypothesis: if 3100 ≡ 1 (mod 100), then for every next m, m ≥ 3, am ≡ 87 (mod 100). It follows that the answer to the question in the problem would be 87. Why? am = 100k + 87, am+1 = 3100k+87 = 3100k3 87 and if the assumption about 3100 is true, it is congruent to 3 87 ≡ 87 (mod 100) and so on for next m. 3 100 = 3 1 × 3 12 × 3 87 ≡ 3 × 41 × 87 ≡ 1 (mod 100), so the assumption is proven: 87 is the desired number. Logical question arises now: can the calculation be simpliﬁed in any manner? As we shall see, introducing few basic concepts will reduce the calculation to smaller numbers-such calculation would be far more worthwhile than the one we introduced: what if the desired residue appeared in tenth, and not in third iteration as in our case? The calculations would have been tedious and the following algorithm will make it fairly easy (also note that the ﬁrst solution, unlike second, cannot be considered algorithmized, as algorithms exclude intuition and ’experimenting’). Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Solution 2 (M16). First, we’ll introduce (without a proof) a very well known fact in number theory: Proposition 2.5.1 (Euler’s Theorem). If a and n are relatively prime, then a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) (2.59) where ϕ(n) is Euler’s function: number of positive integers smaller than n which are relatively prime to n (which can be calculated as ϕ(n) = ∏k i=1 ϕ(pici) = ∏k i=1 pici−1(pi − 1) if n = ∏k i=1 pici represents the prime factorization of n). Now, note that ai ≡ 3ai−1 ≡ 3 mod (ai−1,ϕ(100)) (mod 100), so this congruence is determined by ai−1 taken (mod ϕ(100) = 40). Analoguously, the latter congruence is determined by ai−2 taken (mod ϕ(40) = 16). Now, next one is ai−3 taken (mod ϕ(16) = 8), determined by ai−4 (mod ϕ(8) = 4) and ﬁnally ai−5 (mod ϕ(4) = 2). Now, noting that 3 ≡ 1 (mod 2) ai−4 ≡ 3ai−5 ≡ 31 ≡ 3 (mod 4), ai−3 ≡ 3ai−4 ≡ 33 ≡ 3 (mod 8), ai−2 ≡ 3ai−3 ≡ 3 3 ≡ 11 (mod 16), ai−1 ≡ 3 ai−2 ≡ 3 11 ≡ 27 (mod 40), ai ≡ 3 ai−1 ≡ 3 27 ≡ 87 (mod 100), Euler function in general case doesn’t represent least value we’re looking for. Using its reduced form (so-called Carmichael function), we can oﬀer even shorter solution: Solution 3 (M16). Deﬁnition 2.5.1 (Carmichael function). If a and n are relatively prime, then Carmichael function λ(n) represents the least positive integer for which a λ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n) (2.60) holds. It can be calculated as λ(n) = lcm(λ(p1c1), . . . , λ(pncn )) where λ(p c) =    ϕ(p c) = p c−1(p − 1) if p > 2 or p = 2, c < 3 pc−2 if p = 2, c ≥ 3 if n = ∏k i=1 pici represents the prime factorization of n. Now, using this fact, our iteration procedure from Solution 2 reduces to the chain 100 → 20 → 4 → 2, and as ai−3 ≡ 1 (mod 2): ai−2 ≡ 3ai−3 ≡ 31 ≡ 3 (mod 4), ai−1 ≡ 3 ai−2 ≡ 3 3 ≡ 27 (mod 20), ai ≡ 3ai−1 ≡ 37 ≡ 87 (mod 100), with the same conclusion as in Solution 2. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com It is quite natural to ask: is this sequence of threes ’special’ ? Can the numbers 3, 100 be replaced with other integer constants? The answer to the latter question is yes, i.e. the following generalization holds: Proposition 2.5.2 (Generalization). For arbitrary integers k, m, sequence deﬁned by a1 = k, an = kan−1 becomes eventually constant (mod m). Proof 1. Let’s suppose the opposite, i.e. the Proposition is wrong for some positive integer m. Then there is a least such number (denote it with c). Obviously, c ̸= 1. For all integers c, the sequence an (mod c) eventually becomes cyclic (reader may try to prove this claim). We will denote the period of this cycle with t. The deﬁnition of t implies that there are t − 1 nonzero residues modulo c, so t ≤ c − 1 < c. Since (an) ∞ n=1 does not become constant (mod c), it follows the sequence of exponents of these terms, i.e., the sequence (bn), deﬁned as b1 = 1, bn = kbn−1 does not become constant (mod t). Then the problem statement is false for m = t. Since t < c, this yields a contradiction. Therefore the Proposition is true. Proof 2-outline. It is enough to prove the claim for m = pc where p is prime (and c is a positive integer). Why? By Chinese Remainder Theorem, if the Proposition holds for relatively prime modulii p and q, then it also holds for modulo pq (proof is straightforward). Now, if p divides c, the proof is trivial. If p isn’t a divisor of c, then we can do the do the proof using strong induction on m, using Euler’s Theorem. This technique will be eﬃciently used in the Solution (D5), so we will not go into details in this outline. Notice that this generalization yields also the proof for D6 (in fact, this is generalized D6). We have shown that these sequeces do converge, and what do they converge to in one particular case (M16). Now we will see when do they become constant, in case a1 = 2 (D5). Solution (D5). We can prove stronger statement by induction over n. First, write an = 22..2 |{z} ntimes Proposition 2.5.3. am (mod n) is constant for all m ≥ n − 1. Proof. Base case n = 1 is obvious. If n is even, write n = 2 st. Then the sequence is clearly constant after n − 1 modulo 2s. It is also true for modulo t by the induction hypothesis. So we can suppose that n is odd. Then there is a constant c satisfying am ≡ c (mod ϕ(n)) (2.61) for all m after ϕ(n) − 1(≤ n − 2). Thus am ≡ 2 c (mod n)(m ≤ n − 1) by Euler Theorem, as desired. This can prove a following corollary. Corollary 2.5.1. 22 ···2 | {z } n terms − 22 ···2 | {z } n−1 terms is divisible by all positive integer less or equal than n. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com The form 2an = an+1 looks like ISL2006 N9. This can also lead to a little bit diﬀerent problem. Proposition 2.5.4. Prove that for arbitrary positive integer n, there exists an integer m such that 2 m − m n (2.62) is integer. Proof. Using the previous proposition, there is a constant c satisfying 2 2···2 | {z } n terms ≡ c (mod nϕ(n)). (2.63) By the deﬁnition, 2 c ≡ 2 2···2 | {z } n+1 terms ≡ c (mod n). So c can be a desired m. We can replace ”2” in this problem into any positive integer. And this proof works on other equations such as an = 3 · 2 an−1 or an = 2 an−1 + 3an−1 or an = 2 2 an−1 (replace ϕ(n) into ϕ(ϕ(n))). From this, we get a generalized corollary. Corollary 2.5.2. For an arbitrary positive integer n, there exists an integer m such that f (m) is integer, where f (n) is a · bm − m n (2.64) or a m 1 + · · · + a m k − m n (2.65) or 2 2m − m n (2.66) for integers a, b, a1, · · · , ak. Proof is same as the one for the last Proposition. However, this method doesn’t work for Original Shortlisted problem. First 50 constants for an = 2 an−1 are 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 4, 2, 0, 7, 6, 9, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, 1, 16, 5, 16, 16, 20, 6, 16, 11, 16, 7, 16, 25, 16, 2, 0, 31, 18, 16, 16, 9, 24, 16, 16, 18, 16, 4, 20, 16, 6, 17, 16, 23, 36. Notice that 16 appears very often in ﬁrst 200 constants and the trend continues. If we return to the problem D5, following question may be of some interest: what is the smallest integer k for which ak ≡ ak+1 ≡ . . . (mod 100)? According to D5 problem statement, k ≤ n − 1 (and clearly, k is a function of n). As shown in [1], bound can be improved to k ≤ ⌈log2 n⌉. In the same book, reader can ﬁnd further analysis concerning these lower bounds. Remark 2.5.1 (Numerical data). Numerical examples of this congruences convergence are avail- able in [3] sequences A133612-A133619 (submitted by Daniel Geisler). Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Remark 2.5.2 (Ackermann function). In the theory of hyper-operators, power towers (iterated exponentials like those in problems we observed) are often regarded as the fourth hyperoperator (more precisely, ﬁrst hyper-operator after exponentiation) and called tetration. Inductively, nth hyper-operator is deﬁned as iterated (n − 1) st hyper-operator . The theory of hyper-operators is closely related to so-called Ackermann function, which is deﬁned in the following manner: Deﬁnition 2.5.2. For positive integers i, j, Ackermann function A(i, j) is deﬁned as A(i, j) =  ||| ||| j + 1 if i = 0 A(i − 1, 1) if i > 0, j = 0 A(i − 1, A(i, j − 1)) if i > 0, j > 0 (2.67) Froemke and Grossman in their paper [2] deﬁne (standard) mod-n Ackermann function as: Deﬁnition 2.5.3. For positive integers i, j, standard mod-n Ackermann function An(i, j) is de- ﬁned as An(i, j) =  ||| ||| j + 1 (mod n) if i = 0 An(i − 1, 1) if i > 0, j = 0 An(i − 1, A(i, j − 1)) if i > 0, j > 0 (2.68) where n is a positive integer. Close relations between Ackermann’s function and hyper-operators (Ackermann function can be represented in hyper-operator form as A(m, n) = hyper(2, m, n + 3) − 3 - we will not go into details, more information can be found in specialised literature) lead to interesting questions: do the sequences of pentations, hexations, etc. eventually become constant? Does the mod-n Acker- mann function eventually become constant? The latter question has been analyzed in [2], with an interesting result: the conjecture that the mod-n Ackermann eventually becomes constant for each n holds for all n < 4, 000, 000 with a surprising unique exception: n = 1969.

What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares? First Solution. Suppose 15a + 16b = x2 and 16a − 15b = y2, where x, y are positive integers. Solving this system of equations, we have a = 15x2 + 16y2 152 + 162 = 15x2 + 16y2 13 · 37 , b = 16x2 − 15y2 152 + 162 = 16x2 − 15y2 13 · 37 . which implies that 15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13 · 37) and 16x2 − 15y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13 · 37) This is equivalent to    15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13) 16x2 − 15y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13) and    15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 37) 16x2 − 15y2 ≡ 0 (mod 37) Claim 2.6.1. x, y ≡ 0 (mod 13 · 37) Once we have this claim, we see that 481 | x and 481 | y (Note that 481 = 13 · 37). Let us try to see if there is any solution for a,b if x = y = 481. It suﬃces to plug in the formula for x,y above. In this case, we are lucky that (x, y) = (481, 481) yields a solution (a, b) = (14911, 481). Therefore the answer for this question is 4812 . It now suﬃces to show the claim. We will provide several methods: Method 1. We ﬁrst use Brahmagupta-Fibonacci Identity: (A2 + B2) ( X 2 + Y 2) = (AX + BY ) 2 + (AY − BX) 2 . From the identity we obtain: (152 + 162) ( a 2 + b 2) = (15a + 16b)2 + (16a − 15b)2 = x 4 + y4. Since 152 +16 2 = 13·37, we have 13·37 | x 4 +y4. It then suﬃces to apply the following proposition for p = 13 and p = 37 to conclude that x, y ≡ 0 (mod 13) and x, y ≡ 0 (mod 37). Since 13 and 37 are relatively prime, we conclude that x, y ≡ 0 (mod 13 · 37). Proposition 2.6.1. Let p be a prime with p ≡ 5 (mod 8). Suppose that x4 + y4 is divisible by p for some integers x and y. Then both x, y are divisible by p. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Proof. Assume for contrary that at least one of them are not divisible by p. Since p divides x4 +y4, we see that none of them are divisible by p. Fermat’s Little Theorem yields that xp−1 ≡ yp−1 ≡ 1 (mod p). Since p ≡ 5 (mod 8), we have that p−1 4 is odd, so (−1) p−1 4 = −1. Since p divides x4 + y4, we obtain x4 ≡ −y4 (mod p). Raise both sides of the congruence to the power p−1 4 to obtain xp−1 ≡ (−1) p−1 4 yp−1 ≡ −yp−1 (mod p). or 1 ≡ xp−1 ≡ −yp−1 ≡ −1 (mod p). which is a contradiction since p is an odd prime. Therefore both x and y are divisible by p. Method 2. This method is similar to Method 1, except that we use a diﬀerent way to conclude 13 · 37 | x4 + y4 We ﬁrst work on the ﬁeld Z/13Z (This is a ﬁeld since 13 is a prime). Then the system of congruence 15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13) and 16x2 − 15y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13) becomes [ x2 y2 −y2 x2 ] [ 15 16 ] = [ 0 0 ] . Since the vector [ 15 16 ] is nonzero in Z/13Z, this implies that [ x2 y2 −y2 x2 ] has zero determinant so that x4 + y4 = 0 in Z/13Z, or equivalently x4 + y4 ≡ 0 (mod 13). Similarly, we can work on the ﬁeld Z/37Z, and repeat the argument above. We can then obtain x4 + y4 ≡ 0 (mod 37). We can then proceed as in Method 1, using Fermat’s Little Theorem. Method 3. Another method is to use the quadratic reciprocity law. We ﬁrst recall some of the results that are going to be used here: Proposition 2.6.2. Let p, q be odd primes. Then we have the following properties of Legendre symbols: 1. ( ab p ) = ( a p ) ( b p ) for integers a,b. 2. ( −1 p ) = (−1) p−1 2 3. ( 2 p ) = (−1) p2−1 8 Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com 4. ( p q ) ( q p ) = (−1) p−1 2 q−1 2 We ﬁrst work with modulo 13. We have the congruence 15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13) or equiva- lently, (4y) 2 ≡ −15x 2 (mod 13) If x is not divisible by 13, there exists an integer x′ such that x′x ≡ 1 (mod 13). Multiplying x′2 to both sides of the congruence above, we get (4yx ′)2 ≡ −15 ≡ −2 (mod 13) This means that -2 is a quadratic residue of 13. However if we compute the Legendre symbol, ( −2 13 ) = ( −1 13 ) ( 2 13 ) = (−1) 13−1 2 (−1) 132−1 8 = −1 Contradiction. Therefore x ≡ 0 (mod 13). Since 15x2 + 16y2 ≡ 0 (mod 13), this immediately implies that y ≡ 0 (mod 13) too. We may apply the same method to the case modulo 37. Then again we proved the claim.

Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com 2.7 A Hidden Divisibility Cosmin Pohoata 7 PEN A13 (AMM, Problem E2510, Saul Singer) Show that for all prime numbers p, Q(p) = p−1∏ k=1 k2k−p−1 is an integer. First Solution. It is natural to search for a closed form for Q(p). We see immediately that Q(p) = p−1∏ k=1 k2k−p−1 = ( ∏p−1 k=1 kk [(p − 1)!](p+1)/2 )2 . Now, the procedure is standard. Using, for example, Legendre’s formula (though often atributed to De Polignac; see http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LegendresFormula.html) we can now evaluate the exponent of an arbitrary prime number p in ((p − 1)!)p+1 and prove that it is smaller than the exponent of the same prime p in ∏p−1 k=1 k2k. For a more detailed explanation, we invite the reader to read the second post from [1]. Though the problem appeared in the Monthly, as indicated in the cited source, the nice result presented here was given also as a contest problem in the Romanian IMO Team Selection Tests from 1988. It was then suggested by Laurent¸iu Panaitopol, who had up is sleeve a magical solution. Second Solution. We look again (more carefully though) at Q(p) = p−1∏ k=1 k2k−p−1 = ( ∏p−1 k=1 kk [(p − 1)!](p+1)/2 )2 . We see lots of factorials, but apparently there’s nothing we can do with them. So, let’s try to avoid them. Here comes the idea. Let’s look at Q ′(p) = p−1∏ k=1 (p k) p . What do we have here? Note that by developing the binomials we get Q ′(p) = p−1∏ k=1 (p k) p = [(p − 1)!]p−1 (∏p−1 k=1 k!) (∏p−1 k=1 (p − k)! ) = [(p − 1)!] p−1 (∏p−1 k=1 k!)2 . Now we can see the light. Doesn’t this last expression look like Q(p)? Yes, it does. Just note that the exponents of each k ∈ 1, p − 1 in [(p − 1)!]p−1, (∏p−1 k=1 k! )2 are p − 1 and 2(p − k), respectively. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com This means that Q ′(p) = [(p − 1)!]p−1 (∏p−1 k=1 k!)2 = p−1∏ k=1 k2k−p−1 = Q(p). Thus, we have settled that Q(p) = p−1∏ k=1 (p k) p , which is obviously an integer, according to the fact that p divides (p k), for all k ∈ 1, p − 1.

A23. First we will prove some easy elementary facts that will allow us to work with fractions modp. This is very useful in some problems but it’s not well known. Sometimes, when students are taught congruences they don’t think of things such as k ≡ 1 2 (mod p), because it doesn’t seem quite natural. But in fact we will see that this makes pefect sense, as long as we are careful that the denominators are relatively prime to the modulus (it’s equivalent to the fact that we cannot divide by zero in usual fractions). Deﬁnition 1: Let b and m be integers such that gcd(b, m) = 1 k ≡ 1 b (mod m) ⇐⇒ bk ≡ 1 (mod m) (2.69) This notation makes perfect sense because k, which is the multplicative inverse of b modm ex- ists,since gcd(b, m) = 1 and it’s trivial to see that k is uniquely determined. Moreover the equiv- alency between both equations is clear when multypling or dividing by b (it can be done since gcd(b, m) = 1) When we see something like a b modm with (b, m) = 1 we can think of the fraction like an integer k which satisﬁes bk ≡ a (mod m) Now we will present the proof of A23 First of all, we can see that that all the denominators are not multiple of p so, as previously showed, we can treat them as integers, so we are left to prove that for p > 3 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ≡ 0 (mod p 2) (2.70) Since p > 3 is odd, there are an even number of terms in the summation. An useful idea in this kind of problems is to make pairs of numbers in the summation. A natural way of doing this is to sum up the pair of number of the form 1 i and 1 p−i Then 1 i + 1 p−i = p−i+i (p−i)i = p (p−i)i (I) Since p > 2 our problem is equivalent to prove that 2(1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ) ≡ 0 (mod p 2) (2.71) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Using (I) we have to prove that p−1∑ i=1 p (p − i)i ≡ 0 (mod p 2) (2.72) Now we get the p factor out;the expression we have to prove is: p−1∑ i=1 1 (p − i)i ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.73) Now we use that p − i ≡ −i (mod p) =⇒ p−1∑ i=1 1 −i2 ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.74) Since p > 3 we can clearly multiply this expression by −1 (We have added a −2 factor to the original equation). Now we have to show that p−1∑ i=1 1 i2 ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.75) Now we are going to replace 1 i by its inverse modp If a number is the same as its inverse then we have i 2 ≡ 1 (mod p) (2.76) So i ≡ 1 (mod p) or i ≡ −1 (mod p) Now if we consider the numbers 1 i with i between 2 and p − 2 we have an even amount of numbers, each of whom has an inverse in that interval. As a conclusion the equation (6) can be rewritten as: p−1∑ i=1 i 2 ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.77) Luckily there is a closed form for calculating the sum of the ﬁrst n squares, which can be easily proved by straightforward induction. p−1∑ i=1 i 2 = p(p + 1)(2p + 1) 6 ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.78) (Since p > 3, 6 is relatively prime to p) That ﬁnishes the proof of the problem. This theorem, and the technique used to solve them,is very useful in lots of problems,for exam- ple, Iberoamerican 2005 problem 3 and APMO 2006 problem 3. The reader might be interested in solving this problems without this ideas and ﬁnd how diﬃcult they are. However, using fractions modp and the ideas used to solve A23, they will ﬁnd that they are not so diﬄcult problems. In addition problem 4 of IMO 2005 was a lot easier if the contestant was used to fractions modp. This examples shows that this idea, despite the fact that it is very simple, allows to us to tackle some tough problems. Now we will provide a proof for A24, and in the way we will ﬁnd an easy generalization for A32 (IMO 1979 problem 1) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com A 24. First we state A32 [IMO 1979/1] Let a and b be natural numbers such that a b = 1 − 1 2 + 1 3 − 1 4 + · · · − 1 1318 + 1 1319 (2.79) Prove that a is divisible by 1979 We will rewrite the statement of A24 as k∑ i=1 (p − 1)!p (p − i)!i! ≡ 0 (mod p2) (2.80) We get rid of the p in the summation and we have to prove that k∑ i=1 (p − 1)! (p − i)!i! ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.81) Now we compute (p − 1)! (p − i)! = (p − i + 1)(p − i + 2) · · · (p − 1) (2.82) And p − i + j ≡ (−1)(i − j) (mod p) (2.83) Putting (13) and (14) into (12) =⇒ k∑ i=1 ((−1)i−1)(i − 1)! i! ≡ 0 (mod p) =⇒ k∑ i=1 (−1)i−1 i ≡ 0 (mod p) (2.84) Since 1979 is a prime, and in this case k = 1319, we ﬁnd that the statement of A32 is equivalent to showing the generalization provided by (15) Now we will continue our proof. Since p > 3, p = 6l + 1 or p = 6l − 1 Case 1) p = 6l + 1 =⇒ k = 4l k∑ i=1 (−1)i−1 i = ( 4l∑ i=1 1 i ) − 2( 2l∑ i=1 1 2i ) = ( 4l∑ i=1 1 i ) − ( 2l∑ i=1 1 i ) = ( 4l∑ i=2l+1 1 i ) (2.85) Now, as previosuly done in A23, we will make pair of numbers of the form 1 2l+t and 1 4l+1−t =⇒ 1 2l + t + 1 4l + 1 − t = 2l + t + 4l + 1 − t (4l + 1 − t)(2l + t) = 6l + 1 (4l + 1 − t)(2l + t) = p (4l + 1 − t)(2l + t) (2.86) Since the range of t is the numbers between 1 and l, the denominators are relatively prime to p. Moreover, each term of the form 1 2l+t has a pair which forms a multiple of p in equation (16), so 16 can be rewritten as 4l∑ i=2l+1 1 i = ( 1 2l + 1 + 1 4l ) + ( 1 2l + 2 + 1 4l − 1 ) + · · · + ( 1 3l + 1 3l + 1 ) (2.87) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Every pair of number in the parenthesis have a sum ≡ 0 (mod p) so the whole summation is a multiple of p, ﬁnishing the proof. Case 2) p = 6l − 1 =⇒ k = 4l − 1 k∑ i=1 (−1)i−1 i = ( 4l−1∑ i=1 1 i ) − 2( 2l−1∑ i=1 1 2i ) = ( 4l−1∑ i=1 1 i ) − ( 2l−1∑ i=1 1 i ) = ( 4l−1∑ i=2l 1 i ) (2.88) Again we rewrite this as 4l−1∑ i=2l 1 i = ( 1 2l + 1 4l − 1 ) + ( 1 2l + 1 + 1 4l − 2 ) + · · · + ( 1 3l − 1 + 1 3l ) (2.89) Each of the pairs between parenthesis is a multiple of p because 1 2l − 1 + t + 1 4l − t = 2l − 1 + t + 4l − t (2l − 1 + t)(4l − t) = 6l − 1 (2l − 1 + t)(4l − t) = p (2l − 1 + t)(4l − t) (2.90) This hold for t between 1 and l, and the denominators are clearly relatively prime to p Since all the terms between parenthesis are a multiple of p the whole summation is a multiple of p and the problem is ﬁnished.

The problem can be vastly generalized: Theorem 1. Let ℓ be a positive integer. If n1, n2, ..., nℓ are positive integers and p is a prime such that (ℓ − 1) (p − 1) < ℓ∑ i=1 ni and ni < p for every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ}, then p | p−1∑ j=0 (−1) ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ). Before we prove this, we ﬁrst show some basic facts about binomial coeﬃcients and remainders modulo primes. We recall how we deﬁne binomial coeﬃcients: Deﬁnition. The binomial coeﬃcient (x u ) is deﬁned for all reals x and for all integers u as follows: (x u ) = x · (x − 1) · ... · (x − u + 1) u! if u ≥ 0, and (x u ) = 0 if u < 0. Note that the empty product evaluates to 1, and 0! = 1, so this yields (x 0 ) = x · (x − 1) · ... · (x − 0 + 1) 0! = empty product 0! = 1 1 = 1 for every x ∈ Z. Theorem 2, the upper negation identity. If n is a real, and r is an integer, then( −n r ) = (−1)r (n + r − 1 r ). Proof of Theorem 2. We distinguish two cases: the case r < 0 and the case r ≥ 0. If r < 0, then (−n r ) = 0 and (n + r − 1 r ) = 0, so that (−n r ) = (−1)r (n + r − 1 r ) ensues. If r ≥ 0, then, using the deﬁnition of binomial coeﬃcients, we have ( −n r ) = (−n) · (−n − 1) · ... · (−n − r + 1) r! = (−1)r · n · (n + 1) · ... · (n + r − 1) r! = (−1)r · (n + r − 1) · ... · (n + 1) · n r! = (−1)r · (n + r − 1 r ) . Hence, in both cases r < 0 and r ≥ 0, we have established ( −n r ) = (−1)r (n + r − 1 r ). Thus, (−n r ) = (−1) r (n + r − 1 r ) always holds. This proves Theorem 2. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Theorem 3. If p is a prime, if u and v are two integers such that u ≡ v mod p, and if k is an integer such that k < p, then (u k ) ≡ (v k ) mod p. Proof of Theorem 3. If k < 0, then (u k ) = (v k ) (because (u k ) = 0 and (v k ) = 0), so that Theorem 3 is trivial. Thus, it remains to consider the case k ≥ 0 only. In this case, k! is coprime with p (since k! = 1 · 2 · ... · k, and all numbers 1, 2, ..., k are coprime with p, since p is a prime and k < p). Now, u ≡ v mod p yields k! · ( u k ) = k! · u · (u − 1) · ... · (u − k + 1) k! = u · (u − 1) · ... · (u − k + 1) ≡ v · (v − 1) · ... · (v − k + 1) = k! · v · (v − 1) · ... · (v − k + 1) k! = k! · (v k ) mod p. Since k! is coprime with p, we can divide this congruence by k!, and thus we get ( u k ) ≡ (v k ) mod p. Hence, Theorem 3 is proven. Finally, a basic property of binomial coeﬃcients: Theorem 4. For every nonnegative integer n and any integer k, we have (n k ) = ( n n − k ). This is known, but it is important not to forget the condition that n is nonnegative (Theorem 4 would not hold without it!). Now we will reprove an important fact: Theorem 5. If p is a prime, and f ∈ Q [X] is a polynomial of degree < p − 1 such that f (j) ∈ Z for all j ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1} , then p−1∑ j=0 f (j) ≡ 0 mod p. Before we prove Theorem 5, we recall two lemmata: Theorem 6. If p is a prime and i is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ i ≤ p − 1, then( p − 1 i ) ≡ (−1)i mod p. Theorem 7. If N is a positive integer, and f is a polynomial of degree < N, then N∑ j=0 (−1)j (N j ) f (j) = 0. Theorem 6 appeared as Lemma 1 in [2], post #2. Theorem 7 is a standard result from ﬁnite diﬀerences theory. Proof of Theorem 5. Let N = p−1. Then, f is a polynomial of degree < N (since f is a polynomial of degree < p − 1). Thus, Theorem 7 yields N∑ j=0 (−1)j (N j ) f (j) = 0. Hence, 0 = N∑ j=0 (−1)j ( N j )f (j) = p−1∑ j=0 (−1)j ( p − 1 j ) | {z } ≡(−1)j mod p by Theorem 6 f (j) ≡ p−1∑ j=0 (−1) j (−1)j | {z } =((−1)j) 2=((−1) 2) j =1j =1 f (j) = p−1∑ j=0 f (j) mod p. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com This proves Theorem 5. Proof of Theorem 1. The condition (ℓ − 1) (p − 1) < ℓ∑ i=1 ni rewrites as ℓ (p − 1) − (p − 1) < ℓ∑ i=1 ni. Equivalently, ℓ (p − 1) − ℓ∑ i=1 ni < p − 1. For every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ} , we have p − ni − 1 ≥ 0, since ni < p yields ni + 1 ≤ p. For every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ} and every integer j with 0 ≤ j < p, we have (ni j ) = ( − (−ni) j ) = (−1)j ( (−ni) + j − 1 j ) (after Theorem 2) ≡ (−1)j ( p − ni + j − 1 j ) (by Theorem 3, since (−ni) + j − 1 ≡ p − ni + j − 1 mod p and j < p) = (−1)j ( p − ni + j − 1 (p − ni + j − 1) − j ) (by Theorem 4, since p − ni + j − 1 is nonnegative, since p − ni − 1 ≥ 0 and j ≥ 0) = (−1)j (p − ni + j − 1 p − ni − 1 ) = (−1) j (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) (p − ni − 1)! mod p. Hence, for every integer j with 0 ≤ j < p, we have ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) ≡ ℓ∏ i=1 (−1)j (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) (p − ni − 1)! = ((−1)j)ℓ ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) (p − ni − 1)! = ((−1)j)ℓ ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! mod p, so that ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) ≡ ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · (−1)ℓj · ((−1)j)ℓ | {z } =(−1)ℓj ·(−1) ℓj =(−1) 2ℓj =1, since 2ℓj is even ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! = ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! = ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) mod p. (2.91) Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Now, deﬁne a polynomial f in one variable X by f (X) = ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + X − 1) − u) . (2.92) Then, deg f = deg   ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + X − 1) − u)   = ℓ∑ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∑ u=0 deg ((p − ni + X − 1) − u) | {z } =1 = ℓ∑ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∑ u=0 1 | {z } =(p−ni−1)·1 =p−ni−1 =p−1−ni = ℓ∑ i=1 (p − 1 − ni) = ℓ∑ i=1 (p − 1) | {z } =ℓ(p−1) − ℓ∑ i=1 ni = ℓ (p − 1) − ℓ∑ i=1 ni < p − 1. In other words, f is a polynomial of degree < p − 1. Besides, obviously, f ∈ Q [X] , and we have f (j) ∈ Z for all j ∈ {0, 1, ..., p − 1} (since f ∈ Z [X]). Thus, Theorem 5 yields p−1∑ j=0 f (j) ≡ 0 mod p. Thus, 0 ≡ p−1∑ j=0 f (j) = p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) (by (2)) = p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j )  since ℓ∏ i=1 (p−ni−1)−1∏ u=0 ((p − ni + j − 1) − u) = ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) by (1)   = ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · p−1∑ j=0 (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) mod p. In other words, p | ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! · p−1∑ j=0 (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ). (2.93) For every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ} , the integer (p − ni − 1)! is coprime with p (since (p − ni − 1)! = 1 · 2 · ... · (p − ni − 1), and all numbers 1, 2, ..., p − ni − 1 are coprime with p because p is a prime and p − ni − 1 < p). Hence, the product ℓ∏ i=1 (p − ni − 1)! is also coprime with p. Thus, (3) yields p | p−1∑ j=0 (−1) ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ). Thus, Theorem 1 is proven. Theorem 1 is a rather general result; we can repeatedly specialize it and still get substantial assertions. Here is a quite strong particular case of Theorem 1: Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com Theorem 8. Let ℓ be an even positive integer. If n1, n2, ..., nℓ are positive integers and p is a prime such that (ℓ − 1) (p − 1) < ℓ∑ i=1 ni and ni < p for every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ}, then p | p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ). Proof of Theorem 8. Theorem 1 yields p | p−1∑ j=0 (−1)ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ). But ℓ is even, so that ℓj is even for any j ∈ Z, and thus p−1∑ j=0 (−1)ℓj | {z } =1, since ℓj is even ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) = p−1∑ j=0 1 ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) = p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) . Hence, p | p−1∑ j=0 (−1) ℓj ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ) becomes p | p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ). Therefore, Theorem 8 is proven. Specializing further, we arrive at the following result (which is proved in [1], post #2): Theorem 9. If n and k are positive integers and p is a prime such that 2k − 1 2k (p − 1) < n < p, then p | n∑ j=0 (n j )2k. Proof of Theorem 9. Let ℓ = 2k. Deﬁne positive integers n1, n2, ..., nℓ by ni = n for every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ} . Then, ni < p for every i ∈ {1, 2, ..., ℓ} (since ni = n < p) and (ℓ − 1) (p − 1) = (2k − 1) (p − 1) = 2k · 2k − 1 2k (p − 1) | {z } <n < 2kn = ℓn = ℓ∑ i=1 n = ℓ∑ i=1 ni. Hence, Theorem 8 yields p | p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) . But ℓ∏ i=1 (ni j ) = ℓ∏ i=1 ( n j ) = (n j )ℓ = (n j )2k, and thus p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ) = p−1∑ j=0 (n j )2k = n∑ j=0 ( n j )2k + p−1∑ j=n+1 (n j )2k | {z } =0, since n≥0 and j>n (since n < p) = n∑ j=0 (n j )2k + p−1∑ j=n+1 0 2k | {z } =0 = n∑ j=0 (n j )2k. Therefore, p | p−1∑ j=0 ℓ∏ i=1 ( ni j ) becomes p | n∑ j=0 ( n j )2k. Hence, Theorem 9 is proven. The problem quickly follows from Theorem 9 in the particular case k = 2.

In the ﬁrst part of this article, we shall show solutions for the problems. After that, historical background and connection between these problems will be shown. In the end, their generalizations and known results will be given. Solution-A37. We will assume the contrary, i.e. this product (denote it with A) can be a square. Amongst the numbers n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + 10 at most 4 numbers are divisible by 5 or 7. Among the observed integers there are also at least 6 numbers of the form 2 α3 βc where all prime factors of c are greater than 10. It implies that c is a perfect square, so these 6 numbers have the form 2 α3 βk2. Now, the possible parity combinations of α, β are 1. α even, β even 2. α even, β odd 3. α odd, β even 4. α odd, β odd Pigeonhole principle implies that at least two of these numbers have the same parity scheme: 1. In this case two of observed numbers have to be perfect squares, and since (x +1)2 − x2 = 2x +1 one of these squares has to be 22, 32 or 42. In each case A is not a perfect square. 2. In this case among the numbers n + 1, n + 2, . . . , n + 10 two have the form 3x2 and 3y2, and since for x > y inequality |3x2 − 3y2| ≥ 3(y + 1)2 − 3y2 = 3(2y + 1) holds, so y = 1 which does not make A a perfect square. Solution-A9 Tom Lovering [TL. ] Clearly the only common prime factors amongst 10 consecutive positive integers will be 2, 3, 5, 7. 5 of them will be divisible by 2, at least one of which must also be divisible by 3 and at least one of which must also be divisible by 5, and, if two of the numbers are divisible by 7, one of them will be even. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com This leaves two multiples of 3, one multiple of 5, and one multiple of 7 unaccounted for, which makes 4 more of our integers. But this still leaves one integer not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, and therefore coprime with all other integers of the set, and so coprime with their product. Solution-O51 Tomek Kobos [TK. ] Let A be the arbitrary set of 16 consecutive integers. It is clear that if p is a common prime factor of two elements of A then p ∈ {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}. Thus, it is enough to show that we can ﬁnd an element of A which is not divisible by any number from this set. Consider the following residues mod 30: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. They are coprime with 30 and note that no matter how we choose the 16 consecutive residues there are always 4 of them belonging to this set. The diﬀerence between two of this numbers is never divisible by 7 and 13 and the only diﬀerences divisible by 11 are 23 − 1 = 22 = 29 − 7 but this numbers are too far of each other to be in the same set of 16 consecutive integers. Hence among those 4 numbers there is at most one number divisible by 7, at most one number divisible by 11 and at most one number divisible by 13, so we can choose a number which is not divisible by any of them and since this number is also coprime to 30 we are done. It is not hard to see the connection between A9 and O51, but how are they related to A37? Well, some of our readers may be tempted to use the result proven in A9 to prove the claim in problem A37. That is one of the methods Indian number theorist Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai used in his eﬀorts to prove this general result: Proposition 2.10.1 (Erdos-Selfridge Theorem). Product of consecutive integers is never a power. Pillai made some progress in that ﬁeld, and the reader can see his conclusions in [P2] (remark: many interesting facts, theorems and their proofs can be found in the papers listed at the end of this article, and the reader is strongly encouraged to study them-it is trully wonderful to ﬁnd such pearls of number theory available online as public domain- to paraphrase Newton, it really helps us keep our balance on the giants’ shoulders). Still, Pillai’s methods shown in the article mentioned above aren’t eﬃcient in this case. However, in that time it was already proven that a product of at most 202 consecutive integers is not a square (proof given by Seimatsu Narumi in 1917). In 1939, Erdos proved the general claim that product of an arbitrary number of consecutive integers is not a perfect square. We ommited this proof here, but not due to its complexity, but rather due to its length. Still, the most general claim wasn’t proven. Pillai’s work on relative primality of consecutive integers had some interesting results apart from the ’product-power problem’. Pillai has ﬁrst shown that the least number k for which a sequence of k consecutive integers without a number relatively prime to all others exists is 17. The least example of such a sequence is 2184, 2185, . . . , 2200, and an inﬁnite number of those sequences can be obtained by adding all numbers in the sequence a multiple of 2 · 3 · 5 · 7 · 11 · 13 = 30030. Pillai conjectured ([P2]) that the following theorem holds: Proposition 2.10.2. For every integer k > 16 there exists a sequence of k consecutive integers without a number relatively prime to all others. Problems in Elementary Number Theory 2(2009) No. 1 Project PEN http://projectpen.wordpress.com The conjecture was later proven by both Alfred Brauer in [AB] and Pillai in [P3]. Both Pillai’s and Brauer’s proof are interesting as an introduction for a young number theorist to prime number distributions. For more information about ﬁnding such sequences, see [SS]. In 1975, Erdos and Selfridge ﬁnally published a proof that product of consecutive integers is never a power in [E3]. Due to its complexity, this proof has been omitted here. The reader may ﬁnd useful the proofs of certain special cases of this theorem, as they are given in [TT]. It seems like the story about these sequences is over, but that is not true. Propositions 1 and 2 have been generalized in various ways, and the mathematicians still seek for proofs of such generalizations. For instance in the work of Yair Caro, the relative primality in sequence 2 was replaced by a condition gcd(a, b) = d, so the Proposition 2 (and its bound 17) was just made a special case for d = 1 (more about it in [S1], [S2], [IG]). Proposition 2 has been generalized for arbitrary arythmetical progressions a + nd, which made the original theorem a special case sof d = 1. Another variation was made by replacing ’powers’ with the so-called ’almost perfect powers’. More about it can be found in T.N. Shorey’s papers, available from [SB].
