I have not gone into deep details on the concepts that are too easy in practice (eg: long division, synthetic division). I want you to be able to understand these ideas yourself. If you have any problems on anything in this set of notes, let me know (or pester your teacher!) Deﬁnition 1 A polynomial of degree n is a function f (x) of the form f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a2x2 + a1x + a0, where an, an−1, . . . , a1, a0 are constants and an ̸= 0. For each i, 0 ≤ i ≤ n, ai is the coeﬃcient of xi, and an is the leading coeﬃcient of f (x). The ais may be in Z, Q, R or C. We denote the set of all polynomials in the variable x whose coeﬃcients are in Z by Z[x]. If f (x) ∈ Z[x], then we say that f (x) is a polynomial over Z. Similar deﬁnitions hold when Z is replaced by Q, R or C. Note that Z[x] ⊂ Q[x] ⊂ R[x] ⊂ C[x]. The variable x is usually taken in R or C (if x is taken to be in C, then z may be used instead of x). f (x) is called monic if an = 1. We write deg(f (x)) for the degree of f (x). f (x) is a constant polynomial if n = 0, a linear polynomial if n = 1, a quadratic if n = 2, a cubic if n = 3, a quartic if n = 4, and a quintic if n = 5. Polynomial Division If f (x) and g(x) are polynomials and deg(g(x)) ≤ deg(f (x)), then we may divide g(x) into f (x) and get a remainder polynomial r(x) with deg(r(x)) < deg(g(x)). This works quite like dividing an integer into another integer to get a remainder. More precisely, if deg(g(x)) ≤ deg(f (x)) and g(x) ̸= 0, then we can ﬁnd polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that f (x) = q(x)g(x) + r(x), where deg(r(x)) < deg(g(x)). g(x) is the divisor, q(x) is the quotient and r(x) is the remainder. If r(x) ≡ 0, then f (x) = q(x)g(x), and we say that g(x) divides f (x), or that f (x) is 1 divisible by g(x). We can usually ﬁnd q(x) and r(x) by long division. Example. Divide g(x) = x2 − 1 into f (x) = x5 + 3x4 + 2x3 + x2 + x − 3. Using long division, x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 4 x2 − 1 x5 + 3x4 + 2x3 + x2 + x − 3 x5 − x3 3x4 + 3x3 + x2 3x4 − 3x2 3x3 + 4x2 + x 3x3 − 3x 4x2 + 4x − 3 4x2 − 4 4x + 1 The quotient is q(x) = x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 4 and the remainder is r(x) = 4x + 1. So we have f (x) = (x3 + 3x2 + 3x + 4)(x2 − 1) + (4x + 1). The algorithm goes as follows. We ﬁnd whatever we need to multiply x2 (the leading term of g(x)) by to get x5 (the leading term of f (x)). That is x3. We get x3(x2 − 1) = x5 − x3. Put this below f (x), aligning the same powers. Put x3 on the top, aligning it with the −x3 term of x5 − x3. Then, subtract x5 − x3 from x5 + 3x4 + 2x3 (the part of f (x) that sits above x5 − x3) to get 3x4 + 3x3. Then, bring down +x2 from f (x). Repeat the whole procedure until we get a remainder term (4x + 1 in this example) which has degree less than g(x) (= 2 in this example). Note that if f (x) misses some powers, then we should put a coeﬃcient of 0 for the missing powers before carrying out the long division. For example, we should write 3x4 − 2x + 3 as 3x4 + 0x3 + 0x2 − 2x + 3. This helps us to preserve the alignment of the terms with the same powers. Also, sometimes we may have to bring down more than one term of f (x) in one step. Now try exercises 1 and 2. The Remainder Theorem Now, when we want to divide g(x) = x − a into f (x), then the remainder must have degree at most 1, ie: it is a constant. We have the following very useful theorem. 2 Theorem 1 (The Remainder Theorem) Let f (x) ∈ C[x] and deg(f (x)) = n. Then we have f (x) = q(x)(x − a) + r, where deg(q(x)) = n − 1 and r = f (a). Deﬁnition 2 If f (x) is a function (not necessarily a polynomial in this deﬁnition) and f (a) = 0, then we say that a is a zero, or a root of f (x). Corollary 2 Let f (x) ∈ C[x]. Then a is a zero of f (x) if and only if x − a divides f (x). Proof. If a is a zero of f (x), then by the Remainder Theorem, f (x) = q(x)(x − a) + r = q(x)(x − a), since r = f (a) = 0. So x − a divides f (x). Conversely, If x − a divides f (x), then f (x) = q(x)(x − a) for some polynomial q(x). But then f (a) = 0. □ Corollary 2 itself may also be called the Remainder Theorem. It is a very useful and simple result that can be extremely useful in many Olympiad problems. This is because if we know that a is a zero of a polynomial f (x), then we may immediately conclude that f (x) = q(x)(x − a) for some polynomial q(x). The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra and Synthetic Division What do we know about the zeros of a polynomial f (x)? The following theorem is the most important result. Theorem 3 (The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Every polynomial f (x) ∈ C[x] has a zero in C. Theorem 3 is diﬃcult to prove. There is more than one way to prove Theorem 3, but every known proof uses advanced techniques which we will not go into here. By an easy induction argument on the degree of f (x), and using the Remainder Theorem, we have: Corollary 4 If f (x) ∈ C[x] and deg(f (x)) = n, then f (x) may be factorized into the form f (x) = a(x − α1)(x − α2) · · · (x − αn), where a is the leading coeﬃcient of f (x), and α1, . . . , αn ∈ C are the zeros of f (x), not necessarily distinct. So, Corollary 4 tells us the following. (a) If deg(f (x)) = n, then f (x) can have at most n distinct zeros in C. 3 (b) If f (x) is a polynomial and has inﬁnitely many zeros, then f (x) ≡ 0. Corollary 4 also tells us that any polynomial can be factorized into a product of linear polynomials in C[x]. But if f (x) ∈ R[x], and we want to only factorize f (x) into a product of polynomials, each in R[x], then, we may have factors which are not linear. For example, we know that, if f (x) is a quadratic over R, then we may not even be able to factorize f (x) into two linear factors in R[x] if the discriminant of f (x) is less than 0. In particular, factorizing a polynomial f (x) ∈ Z[x] into a product of polynomials, each over Z, R or C, as far as possible (ie: the factors may not be factorized further; these factors are called irreducible), is something very standard, and very important to know. A very useful method in doing so is synthetic division. Example. Factorize f (x) = x3 − 5x2 − 2x + 24 into a product of polynomials over Z. We do the following. If x − a is a factor of f (x), then, by considering the constant terms, we see that a divides 24. We make a guess that a = 3 is a zero, and do the following. 3 1 −5 −2 24 3 −6 −24 1 −2 −8 0 The algorithm goes as follows. Place the 3 and the coeﬃcients of f (x) along the top row as shown. Then, bring the 1 down to the third row. Then, multiply the 3 by the 1 in the bottom to get 3, and place this 3 under the −5. Then, add the −5 and 3 to get −2 and place this under the 3. Then multiply −2 by 3 to get −6, and repeat the previous procedure until we get to the bottom right. If we used a in place of 3, then the number in the bottom right is actually f (a). We see that when we use 3, we get f (3) = 0. So, this means that 3 is a zero of f (x), and x − 3 is a factor of f (x). Furthermore, the numbers 1, −2, −8 that we have along the bottom row are the coeﬃ- cients of the quotient polynomial. So, we have f (x) = (x − 3)(x2 − 2x − 8). We can factorize the quotient easily. The full factorization is f (x) = (x − 3)(x − 4)(x + 2). Note that using 4 or −2 instead of 3 at the start would work as well, but for example, if we used 1, then it would not have worked, since we would have f (1) ̸= 0. It is a trial and error procedure. Example. Factorize f (x) = x3 − 2x2 + 5x + 26 into a product of polynomials (a) over Z, 4 and (b) over C. We try synthetic division several times, using factors of 26 as possible zeros each time, until we ﬁnd one. We have 1 1 −2 5 26 1 −1 4 1 −1 4 30 −1 1 −2 5 26 −1 3 −8 1 −3 8 18 2 1 −2 5 26 2 0 10 1 0 5 36 −2 1 −2 5 26 −2 8 −26 1 −4 13 0 We see that 1, −1 and 2 are not zeros of f (x), but −2 is. We have f (x) = (x + 2)(x2 − 4x + 13). Now, we want to try and factorize x2 − 4x + 13. By the quadratic formula, the solutions of x2 − 4x + 13 = 0 are x = 4 ± √16 − 4 · 13 2 = 2 ± 3i. So, x2 − 4x + 13 = (x − (2 + 3i))(x − (2 − 3i)), and x2 − 4x + 13 does not factorize over Z. So the answers are: (a) f (x) = (x + 2)(x2 − 4x + 13), and (b) f (x) = (x + 2)(x − (2 + 3i))(x − (2 − 3i)). Now, try exercises 3 and 4. Relations between the zeros of a polynomial If α1, α2 are the solutions of x2 + a1x + a0 = 0, then x2 + a1x + a0 = (x − α1)(x − α2) = x2 − (α1 + α2)x + α1α2, so a1 = −(α1 + α2) and a0 = α1α2. Similarly, if α1, α2, α3 are the solutions of x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 = 0, then x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 = (x − α1)(x − α2)(x − α3) = x3 − (α1 + α2 + α3)x2 + (α1α2 + α2α3 + α3α1)x − α1α2α3, 5 so a2 = −(α1 + α2 + α3), a1 = α1α2 + α2α3 + α3α1, and a0 = −α1α2α3. In general, if the solutions of xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 = 0 are α1, . . . , αn, then: an−1 = − ∑ i αi, an−2 = ∑ i<j αiαj, an−3 = − ∑ i<j<k αiαjαk, ... a0 = (−1) nα1 · · · αn. To get an−i, we sum the products of the i-tuples of the αjs, and multiply by (−1) i. Example. If α, β, γ are the zeros of f (x) = 2x3 + x2 − 5x − 3, ﬁnd a polynomial whose zeros are α2, β2, γ2. If f (x) = 0, then x3 + 1 2 x2 − 5 2 x − 3 2 = 0. So we have −(α + β + γ) = 1 2 , αβ + βγ + γα = − 5 2 and −αβγ = − 3 2 . So α2 + β2 + γ2 = (α + β + γ) 2 − 2(αβ + βγ + γα) = ( − 1 2 )2 − 2 ( − 5 2 ) = 21 4 , α2β2 + β2γ2 + γ2α2 = (αβ + βγ + γα) 2 − 2αβγ(α + β + γ) = ( − 5 2 )2 − 2 · 3 2 ( − 1 2 ) = 31 4 , α2β2γ2 = ( 3 2 )2 = 9 4. So a possible polynomial is g(x) = 4x3 − 21x2 + 31x − 9. Now try exercise 5. Some algebraic identities The following identities are useful when we deal with polynomials, and also in other areas as well. (a) xn − yn = (x − y)(xn−1 + xn−2y + · · · + xyn−2 + yn−1), (b) xn + yn = (x + y)(xn−1 − xn−2y + · · · − xyn−2 + yn−1) if n is odd, (c) x3 + y3 + z3 − 3xyz = (x + y + z)(x2 + y2 + z2 − yz − zx − xy) = 1 2 (x + y + z)((y − z) 2 + (z − x) 2 + (x − y) 2). So, for example, (a) gives xn − 1 = (x − 1)(xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + x + 1). 6 Roots of Unity The complex number Re iθ has modulus R and argument θ. It has real part R cos θ and imaginary part R sin θ. So, we have Re iθ = R cos θ + iR sin θ. If ω = e 2πi/n, then the polynomial f (x) = xn − 1 has (complex) zeros 1, ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1. These are the nth roots of unity. So over C, f (x) factorizes into f (x) = (x − 1)(x − ω)(x − ω2) · · · (x − ωn−1). Since xn − 1 = (x − 1)(xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + x + 1), it follows that xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + x + 1 = (x − ω)(x − ω2) · · · (x − ωn−1), that is, the zeros of g(x) = xn−1 + xn−2 + · · · + x + 1 are ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1. On the Argand diagram, the complex numbers 1, ω, ω2, . . . , ωn−1 are the vertices of a regular n-gon. We have the relation 1 + ω + ω2 + · · · + ωn−1 = 0. Also, note that ωn = 1, and hence ωj = ωk ⇐⇒ j − k ≡ 0(mod n). Exercises and Problems Standard exercises. 1. Use long division to divide f (x) = x5 + 2x3 − 3x2 − 5 by g(x) = x3 + 3x.
