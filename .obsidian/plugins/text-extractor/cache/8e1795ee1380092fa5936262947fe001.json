Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. In an acute-angled triangle ABC, ∠ABC is the largest angle. The perpen- dicular bisectors of BC and BA intersect AC at X and Y respectively. Prove that circumcentre of triangle ABC is incentre of triangle BXY . 2. Let x, y, z be positive real numbers. Prove that y2 + z2 x + z2 + x2 y + x2 + y2 z ≥ 2(x + y + z). 3. Find all pairs of (x, y) of positive integers such that 2x + 7y divides 7x + 2y. 4. For any positive integer n > 1, let P (n) denote the largest prime not ex- ceeding n. Let N (n) denote the next prime larger than P (n). (For example P (10) = 7 and N (10) = 11, while P (11) = 11 and N (11) = 13.) If n + 1 is a prime number, prove that the value of the sum 1 P (2)N (2) + 1 P (3)N (3) + 1 P (4)N (4) + · · · + 1 P (n)N (n) = n − 1 2n + 2 . 5. Let ABC be a triangle with AB > AC. Let P be a point on the line AB beyond A such that AP + P C = AB. Let M be the mid-point of BC and let Q be the point on the side AB such that CQ ⊥ AM . Prove that BQ = 2AP . 6. Let n be an odd positive integer and suppose that each square of an n × n grid is arbitrarily ﬁlled with either by 1 or by −1. Let rj and ck denote the product of all numbers in j-th row and k-th column respectively, 1 ≤ j, k ≤ n. Prove that n∑ j=1 rj + n∑ k=1 ck ̸= 0. ———-00———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
