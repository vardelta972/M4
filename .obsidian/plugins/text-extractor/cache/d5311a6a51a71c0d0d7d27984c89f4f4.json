Sep. 16, start of class Reading Stillwell goes pretty quickly through the material on groups, as will we. Therefore, if you are not familiar with them already, you may want to do a little reading on your own (say pickup a book on algebra from the library that looks nice, or google introduction to group theory) to see more examples. Written assignment 3.2 Congruence classes and their arithmetic Exercise 3.1. Exercises 3.1.3, 3.1.4 (no proof needed for 3.1.4). Exercise 3.2. Write a = ak · 10k + ak−1 · 10k−1 + · · · + a1 · 10 + a0. Prove that a is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of the odd digits (ak where k odd) minus the sum of the even digits (ak where k even) is. (Hint: see Exercises 3.2.2, 3.2.3.) (Optional, i.e., 0 points) There are several methods for testing divisibility by 7, though they are more complicated. Can you ﬁgure any out? Exercise 3.3. Write down addition and multiplication tables for Z/6Z. 3.3 Inverses mod p Deﬁnition 3.1. Let G be a set with a binary operation · . , i.e., · is a function from G × G → G, expressed as (g, h) 7→ g · h. If G satisﬁes the following properties, (i) · is associative: (g · h) · k = g · (h · k) for all g, h, k ∈ G; (ii) there is an identity 1 ∈ G such that 1 · g = g · 1 = g for all g ∈ G; (iii) every g ∈ G has an inverse g−1 such that g−1 · g = g · g−1 = 1; then we say (G, ·) (or just G) is a group. If (i) through (iii) and (iv) · is commutative: g · h = h · g for all g, h ∈ G also hold, we say (G, ·) (or just G) is an abelian group. When the operation is understood, we typically write gh for g · h. Exercise 3.4. Rewrite what properties (i) through (iv) mean when our operation is written as + (called additive) and not · (called multiplicative). Which properties fail for (N, +)? What is the (additive) inverse of 8Z + 5 in the group (Z/8Z, +)? Exercise 3.5. Prove (Z/nZ)× is a ﬁnite abelian group. You may take for granted that multiplication is well deﬁned on Z/nZ (from the previous section) and associative, though you should say a sentence about why it is well deﬁned on (Z/nZ)×. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
