EDITORIAL POLICY THE FIBONACCI QUARTERLY seeks articles that are intelligible yet stimulating to its readers, most of whom are university teachers and students. These articles should be lively and well motivated, with new ideas that develop enthusiasm for number sequences or the exploration of number facts. Illustrations and tables should be wisely used to clarify the ideas of the manuscript. Unanswered ques- tions are encouraged, and a complete list of references is absolutely necessary. SUBMITTING AN ARTICLE Articles should be submitted using the format of articles in any current issues of THE FIBONACCI QUARTERLY, They should be typewritten or reproduced typewritten copies, that are clearly readable, double spaced with wide margins and on only one side of the paper. The full name and address of the author must appear at the beginning of the paper directly under the title. Illustrations should be carefully drawn in India ink on separate sheets of bond paper or vellum, approximately twice the size they are to appear in print. Since the Fibonacci Association has adopted ¥{ = F2 = 1, F« +;= F« +F«-;, n>2 and L ^ l , L2 =3, L/2+/ = Ln+Ln-i, n>2 as the standard definitions for The Fibonacci and Lucas sequences, these definitions should not be a part of future papers.

Boase Trinity College, Cambridge CB2 1TQ, England {Submitted March 1998-Final Revision February 2001) 1. INTRODUCTION The following theorem arose from my correspondence with Dr. Peter Neumann of Queen's College, Oxford, concerning the number of ways of writing an integer of the form FnFn ...Fn as a sum of two squares. Theorem LI: If m>3, then with the exception of m = 6 and m = \\2, Fm is divisible by some primep which does not divide any Fk9 k<m. Theorem 1.1 is similar to a theorem proved by K. Zsigmondy in 1892 (see [4]), which states that, for any natural number a and any m, there is a prime that divides am - 1 but does not divide a k - 1 for k < m with a small number of explicitly stated exceptions. A summary of Zsigmondy's article can be found in [2, Vol. 1, p. 195]. Since the arithmetic behavior of the sequence of Fibo- nacci numbers Fn is very similar to that of the sequences an -hn (for fixed a and h\\ Theorem 1.1 can be regarded as an analog of Zsigmondy's theorem for the Fibonacci sequence. 2. PRELIMINARY LEMMAS This section includes a few lemmas that are required for the proof of Theorem 1.1. Lemma 2.1: Let m, n be positive integers and let (a, b) denote the highest common factor of a and h. Then F 37 ' n m. Proof: First, we prove by induction on m that F A mn _ M./ |7 \\m-\\ p - ^ i r (modFJ. The result holds for m = 1. Suppose the result holds for m = k. Then ^^Wn-if-1 (modi*,).

Similarly, F(k_l)n+l » F^^F^ (modF„) giving us 4 f i = ^(^1)^1^-1 s ^(^2)w+i(^-i)2 = • •' = (^-i)* (mod F J . Therefore, ^^^KF^HF^i) k^{^lXF^ (modFJ. This completes the inductive step. Let us define d = ^,F„y (m(F„_ir1 + tF„, F„), where t is some integer. Then we have d\\Fn and d\\m{Fn_)) m~ l. However, {Fn,Fn_^) = 1, so d divides m and the lemma is proved. • Lemma 2.2: P\\ Pi ~-Pn P P- P- n<*l jfi na„ _ fcodd ^h^h-'-^k Pi Pi —Fn - ^axa2 ^an ' kevm \"h\"h '\"Pik where the numerator is the product of all numbers of the form ffipfi 2 ..-PS* divided by an odd number of distinct primes and the denominator is the product of all numbers of the form Pi lp% 2... p® n divided by an even nonzero number of distinct primes. Proof; The exponent of pr on the left-hand side is ar. The exponent of pr in the numerator of the right-hand side is £«*)-(*--!)> as there are (1) ways of choosing il9 ...9ik and, if is - r for some s, there are (j[_j) ways of choos- ing the other ij. Similarly, the exponent of pr in the denominator of the right-hand side is £M0-(r-i)> so the exponent of pr on the right-hand side is = ar(l - (1 -1)\")-(1-1)\"\" 1 = ar as required. • Lemma 2.3: If 0 < a < 1, then rC, ( l - a\") > (1 - a)&. 2001] 387 A RESULT ABOUT THE PRIMES DIVIDING FIBONACCI NUMBERS Proof; Equivalently, we must prove that f>(l-a«)>MiziO. «=i l a If |xI< 1, then the Taylor series expansion for Inx about x = 1 is ln(l + jnr) = jc--y-+-y----«.

D Lemma 2.5: Ifm = p^p® 1 -.p% n, then the only solutions m,m>3, to the inequality /(w) = ( 1y 5-J * 2 f l . . . A = s0it) (2) are at = 3,4,5,6,10,12,14, and 30. We first prove the following three easy facts: (i) If f(m) > Cg(m); C> 1, and nt is formed from m by replacing pi in the prime factorization \"of m by $ , where ^ > pt and ^ ^ pk for any A, then f(nf) > Cg{m'). (ii) If f(m) > g(m) and/?is an odd prime, then f(pm) > g(pm). (Hi) If f(m) > g(m) and m \\s even, then f(2m) > g(2m). If f(m) > 2g(m) and m is odd, then f(2m)>g(2my Proof of (i): f(m) > Cg(m) > 4C so, in particular, f(m) > exp(l). Now ft >Pi=>%Pi -Pi>%Pt \"ft = > f 3 ? > f \" ? SO 388 [NOV.

If m is odd and f(m) > 2g(m), then f(2m) = f(m) > 2g(m) = g(2m). Proof of Lemma 2.5: We call m \"good\" if f(m)> 2g(m) or if m is even and /(m) > ^(^i). Note that, by (ii) and (iii), if m is good, then no multiple of m may satisfy inequality (2). Standard calculations show that m = 11 is good. It then follows from (i) that every prime greater than 11 is good, so any solution m of (2) must only have 2, 3, 5, and 7 as prime divisors. It is easy to show that m = 3 2 and m = (3)(7) are good. So, by (i), except for m = (3)(5), m = j? 2 and wi = /?,-/^ are good for odd primes pi9 pj. Hence, the only odd numbers whose multi- ples may satisfy inequality (2) are 3, 5, 7, and 15. Now m = 2 3 is good, as is m = 2 2(5). Thus, m = 2 2(pi) is good for odd primes pi9 p >5. Therefore, the only possible solutions to inequality (2) are 2, 3, 5, 7, (3)(5), (2)(3), (2)(5), (2)(7), (2)(3)(5), 2 2, and 22(3). Of these, 7 and (3)(5) are not solutions and 2 < 3, so we obtain the list as stated in the lemma. D 3. PROOF OF THE MAIN THEOREM Suppose we choose a Fibonacci number Fm, with m > 3 and m = Pi lp% 2 ---P% ny such that all prime factors of Fm divide some previous Fibonacci number. Then every prime dividing Fm must divide one of Fm[l],Fml2],-.-,Fm[n], where m[i] = m/pi, making use of the well-known fact that (Fm,Fn) = Fimny Now Fm< p&2...pJ?m{l]Fm[2]...Fm[n], for the left-hand side divides the right-hand side, using Lemma 2.1. However, some of the factors of Fm are being double counted, such as Fpai-\\pa2-\\ ^n% which divides both Fm^ and Fm[2y To remove repeats, the same Inclusion-Exclusion Principle idea of Lemma 2.2 can be used. This gives 1 1 ^m[iui2*-»ik] ^ , ^ f t A - P » - w - 5 , (3) 1 1 rm[iui2l...Jk] A: even where m[il9 i2,...,ik] = m/ptp^ ...pik and the ij are all distinct. In fact, the left-hand side divides the right-hand side, but the inequality is sufficient for our purposes. It is now necessary to simplify (3) to obtain a weaker inequality that is easier to handle. Multiplying by the denominator in (3), n ^ ^ M -A n ^ ,^ (4> fceven A: odd where we have absorbed Fm into the product on the left-hand side. 2001] 389 A RESULT ABOUT THE PRIMES DIVIDING FIBONACCI NUMBERS Let us define F„ to equal By Binefs formula, \\m -ffl) so, as n - » oo, i ^ - » /?'. Furthermore, Fn>F£ for w odd and Fn<F„ for w even. All the Fibonacci numbers on the left-hand side of (4) are of the form Fmlk, k a product of an even number of distinct primes, and they are all distinct since, if Fmlk = FmIk,, then k = k f or a t / * and mlk' are 1 and 2 in some order, contradicting the fact that k and k f are both products of an even number of distinct primes. Let us define yx to equal n(£ where the product is taken over all even integers.n. The left-hand side of (4) would therefore be made even smaller, if all the Fn in it were replaced by F£ and the result were multiplied by y x . Similarly, the right-hand side of (4) would be made even larger if all the Fn in it were replaced by F£ and the result were multiplied by y 2 , where y 2 is equal to nfl nodd\\ xn Thus, if we define s = y 2 ly\\, we obtain from (4) the weaker inequality, f t F+h.h.-.h\\ * £PlP2 ''Pn H Fki.h.-.ikY < 5> k even, £0 k odd The number of terms in the product on the left-hand side of (5) is In-C^ + CD*'\" and on the right-hand side is (\") + (3) + (5)+• • •, and these numbers are equal as their difference is (1 -1)\" = 0.

A RESULT ABOUT THE PRIMES DIVIDING FIBONACCI NUMBERS Therefore, by Lemma 2.4, s = r2/ri<2. Now Lemma 2.5 gives us a list of possible m which may satisfy inequality (6). Thus, it only remains for us to check which of these m give rise to Fm, all of whose prime factors divide some previous Fibonacci number. The possible solutions, m, to (6), with m> 3, are 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 14, and 30. Note that 2\\F3, 3|F4, 5\\F5, 11|F10, 29|F14, and 31\\F30 and the respective primes do not divide any previous Fibonacci numbers. Thus, the only exceptions to the result are F6 = 8 and Fl2 = 144. Therefore, Theorem 1.1 is proved. • A similar result can also be proved for the Lucas numbers. Corollary 3.1: If m > 2, then, with the exception of m = 3 and m = 6, Lm is divisible by some prime p that does not divide any Lk, 0 < k < m. Proof: Suppose m>2 and m does not equal 3 or 6. Then, since 2m>3 and 2m does not equal 6 or 12, Theorem 1.1 implies the existence of a prime p such that/? divides F2m, but does not divide any smaller Fibonacci number. Now F2m = FmLm (see [3]), so p must divide Lm. We claim that|? does not divide any Lk for k < m, for p\\Lk would imply p\\F2k, and since 2k <2m, this contradicts our choice of p. Hence, the corollary. '• We end with the following conjecture for the general Fibonacci-type sequence. Conjecture 3.2: Suppose that Kt and K^ are positive integers and that Kn is defined recursively for n > 3 by Kn = Kn_x :+Kn_2. Then, for all sufficiently large m9 there exists a primep that divides Km but does not divide any Kr,r < m.

INTRODUCTION We are interested in the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers defined by U„(P, q) = ^ = | ^ , V„{p, q) = a\" +/?\", where a = £ ^ , P = ^ - , A = p>-4q,p>0, and*<0. It is well known that {Un(l, -1)} and {Vn(l, -1)} are the classical Fibonacci sequence \\Fn} and the Lucas sequence {Ln}. There are many publications dealing with summation of reciprocal series related to the classical Fibonacci and Lucas numbers (see, e.g., [2]-[5]). Backstrom [3] obtained S ^ - i T p = # <^dd) (1) and Andre-Jeannin [2] proved that Are there results similar to (1) or (2) for the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers? In this paper we will discuss the summation of reciprocal series related to the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. We will establish a series of identities involving the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers and some identities of [2] and [3] will emerge as special cases of our results. In the final section, following the method introduced by Almkvist, we express four reciprocal series related to the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas numbers in terms of the theta functions and give their estimates. Some of the estimates obtained generalize the results of [1] and [2], respectively. 2. MAIN RESULTS The following lemmas will be used later on.

INTRODUCTION A dynamical system is taken here to mean a homeomorphism f:X->X- of a compact metric space X (though the observations here apply equally well to any bijection on a set). The number of points with period n under/is J>er„(f) = #{xeX\\f\"x = x}, and the number of points with least period n under/is U>er„(f) = #{xeX\\#{f kx}keI=n}. There are two basic properties that the resulting sequences (PerB(/)) and (LPer„(/)) must satisfy if they are finite. First, the set of points with period n is the disjoint union of the sets of points with least period d for each divisor d ofn, so Per„(/) = l L P e r , ( / ) . (1) d\\n Second, if x is a point with least period d, then the d distinct points x, f(x), f 2(x),...,f d~ l(x) are all points with least period d, so 0<LPer^(/) = 0 modrf. (2) Equation (1) may be inverted via the Mobius inversion formula to give LPer„C/) = £M«/<OPerdC/-), d\\n where ju( •) is the Mobius function defined by ju(n) = 1 if/i = l, 0 if n has a squared factor, and (-i) r if n is a product of r distinct primes. A short proof of the inversion formula may be found in Section 2.6 of [6], Equation (2) therefore implies that 0<^/i(n/rf)Per^(/) = 0 mod* (3) d\\n Indeed, (3) is the only condition on periodic points in dynamical systems: define a given sequence of nonnegative integers (Un) to be exactly realizable if there is a dynamical system / : X -> X with Un = Perw(/) for all n > 1. Then (Un) is exactly realizable if and only if 0 < Y, fKn/d)Ud s 0 mod n for all n > 1, d\\n 398 [NOV. A DYNAMICAL PROPERTY UNIQUE TO THE LUCAS SEQUENCE since the realizing map may be constructed as an infinite permutation using the quantities J-L*nld)Ud d\\n to determine the number of cycles of length n. Our purpose here is to study sequences of the form U n+2 = Un+l+Urt,n>\\, Ut = a, U2=b, a,b>0 (4) with the distinguished Fibonacci sequence denoted (Fn), so Un=aF^2+bF^x for«>3. (5) Theorem 1: The sequence (Un) defined by (4) is exactly realizable if and only if b = 3a. This result has two parts: the existence of the realizing dynamical system is described first, which gives many modular corollaries concerning the Fibonacci numbers. One of these is used later on in the obstruction part of the result. The realizing system is (essentially) a very familiar and well-known system, the golden-mean shift. The fact that (up to scalar multiples) the Lucas sequence (Ln) is the only exactly realizable sequence satisfying the Fibonacci recurrence relation to some extent explains the familiar observa- tion that (L„) satisfies a great array of congruences. Throughout, n will denote a positive integer andp, q distinct prime numbers. 2. EXISTENCE An excellent introduction to the family of dynamical systems from which the example comes is the recent book by Lind and Marcus [4]. Let J!T = {x = (x^)G{0,l} z|x i k = l=>JcJt+1 = O f o r . a n * e Z } . The set AT is a compact metric space in a natural metric (see [4], Ch. 6, for the details). The set X may also be thought of as the set of all (infinitely long in both past and future) itineraries of a jour- ney involving two locations (0 and 1), obeying the rule that from 1 you must travel to 0, and from 0 you must travel to either 0 or 1. Define the homeomorphism / : X -» X to be the left shift, (/(*))* = * w for all k eZ. The dynamical system / : X -» X is a simple example of a subshift of finite type. It is easy to check that the number of points of period n under this map is given by Perw(/)= t r a c e d ) , (6) where A = [} o] ( s e e t4L ProP- 2.2.12; the 0-1 entries in the matrix A correspond to the allowed transitions 0 -» 0 or 1; 1 -> 0 in the elements of X'thought of as infinitely long journeys in a graph with vertices 0 and 1). Lemma. 2: If b = 3a in (4), then the corresponding sequence is exactly realizable. Proof: A simple induction argument shows that (6) reduces to Perw(/) = Ln for n > 1, so the case a == 1 is realized using the golden mean shift itself. For the general case, let X = X x B, 2001] 399 A DYNAMICAL PROPERTY UNIQUE TO THE LUCAS SEQUENCE where B is a set with a elements, and define / : X -» X by / ( x , y) = (/(x), y). Then Perw(/) = a x Perw(/), so we are done. • The relation (3) must as a result hold for (Ln). Corollary 3: \"Ld\\n fi{n ld)Ld = 0 mod n for all n > 1. This has many consequences, a sample of which we list here. Many of these are, of course, well known (see [5], §2.IV) or follow easily from well-known congruences. (a) Taking n = p gives Lp = Fp_2 + 3Fp_l^lmodp. (7) (b) It follows from (a) that Fp_x = 1 mod p o Fp_2 = -2 modp, (8) which will be used below. (c) Taking n = p k gives lpk ^Lph-i modp h (9) for all primes/? and k > 1. (d) Taking n = pq (a product of distinct primes) gives Lpq + l = Lp + Lg modpq. 3. OBSTRUCTION The negative part of Theorem 1 is proved as follows. Using some simple modular results on the Fibonacci numbers, we show that, if the sequence (Un) defined by (4) is exactly realizable, then the property (3) forces the congruence b = 3a modp to hold for infinitely many primes/?, so (Un) is a multiple of (1^). Lemma 4: For any prime/?, F^ = 1 modp if p = 5m±2. Proof: From Hardy and Wright (see [2], Theorem 180), we have that Fp+t = 0 modp if p = 5m±2. The identities i*p+1 = 2Jy_1 + i y . 2 - 0 modp and (7) imply that Fp_i&lmodp. D Assume now that the sequence (E/J defined by (4) is exactly realizable. Applying (3) for n a prime/? shows that t/^ - t/j = 0 mod/?, so by (5), ai^_2 +Wp-i = @ mod/?. If/? is 2 or 3 mod 5, Lemma 4 implies that ( F H - 1 ) « + * B 0 mod/?. (10) On the other hand, for such/?, (8) implies that iy_2 = -2 mod/?, so (10) gives b = 3a mod/?. By Dirichlet's theorem (or simpler arguments), there are infinitely many primes/? with/? equal to 2 or 3 mod 5, so b = 3a modp for arbitrarily large values of/?. We deduce that b = 3a, as required. 4. MEMAKKS (a) Notice that the example of the golden mean shift plays a vital role here. If it were not to hand, exhibiting a dynamical system with the required properties would require proving Corollary 400 [NOV. A DYNAMICAL PROPERTY UNIQUE TO THE LUCAS SEQUENCE 3, and a priori we have no way of guessing or proving this congruence without using the dynami- cal system. (b) The congruence (7) gives a different proof that Fp_x EO or 1 mod p for p * 2,5. If Fp_i = a mod p, then (7) shows that Fp_2 = 1 - 3a modp, so Fp = 1 - 2a. On the other hand, the recurrence relation gives the well-known equality Fp-iFp^Fp-i + l (since p is odd), so 1 - 5a + 6a2 = a 2 +1, hence 5(a 2 - a) = 0 mod p. Since p&5, this requires that a 2 == a modp, so a = 0 or 1. (c) The general picture of conditions on linear recurrence sequences that allow exact realiza- tion is not clear, but a simple first step in the Fibonacci spirit is the following question: For each k > 1, define a recurrence sequence Qiffi) by with specified initial conditions Uf* = aj for 1 < j < k. The subshift of finite type associated to the 0-1 k x k matrix A^ = shows that the sequence (U^) is exactly realizable if a- = 2 J -1 for 1 < j < k. If the sequence is exactly realizable, does it follow that a;. = C(2 J -1) for 1 < j < k and some constant CI The spe- cial case k = 1 is trivial, and k = 2 is the argument above. Just as in Corollary 3, an infinite family of congruences follows for each of these multiple Fibonacci sequences from the existence of the exact realization. (d) We are grateful to an anonymous referee for suggesting the following questions. Given a dynamical system / : X —» X for which the quantities Perw(/) are all finite, it is conventional to define the dynamical zeta function 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 . 0 ... 1 ... 0 ... 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 ^ ( z ) = e x p ^ | ; ^ P e r n C / ) j , which defines a complex function on the disc of radius l/limsupPer„(/)1/n. ft->00 It is a remarkable fact that for many dynamical systems—indeed, all \"hyperbolic 11 ones—the zeta function is a rational function. For example, the golden mean subshift of finite type used above has zeta function x_l_zl • There are also sharp results that determine exactly what rational func- tions can arise as zeta functions of irreducible subshifts of finite type or of finitely presented systems—these are expansive quotients of subshifts of finite type. A simple application of Theo- rem 6.1 in [1], which describes the possible shape of zeta functions for finitely presented systems 2001] 401 A DYNAMICAL PROPERTY UNIQUE TO THE LUCAS SEQUENCE shows that the sequence a, 3a, 4a, 7 a,... can be exactly realized by an irreducible subshift of finite type if and only if a - 1. It is possible that the recent deep results of Kim, Ormes, and Roush [3] may eventually pro- vide a complete description of linear recurrence sequences that are exactly realized by subshifts of finite type.

ANALYTIC CONTINUATION OF THE FIBONACCI DIRICHLET SERIES Luis Navas Departmento de Matematicas, Universidad de Salamanca Plaza de la Merced, 1-4, 37008 Salamanca, Spain e-mail: navas@gugu.usal.es (Submitted August 1999-Final Revision February 2000) L INTRODUCTION Functions defined by Dirichlet series J^=l a/f s are Interesting because they often code and link properties of an algebraic nature in analytic terms. This is most often the case when the coef- ficients an are multiplicative arithmetic functions, such as the number or sum of the divisors of w, or group characters. Such series were the first to be studied, and are fundamental in many aspects of number theory. The most famous example of these is undoubtedly g(s) = S*=i n~ s (Re(s) > 1), the Riemann zeta function. Initially studied by Euler, who wanted to know the values at the posi- tive integers, it achieved prominence with Riemann, who clarified its intimate connection with the distribution of primes, and gave it lasting notoriety with his hypothesis about the location of its zeros. Another class of Dirichlet series arises in problems of Diophantine approximation, taking an to be the fractional part ofnO, where 0 is an irrational number. Their properties depend on how well one can approximate 9 by rational numbers, and how these fractional parts are distributed modulo 1. The latter is also a dynamical question about the Iterative behavior of the rotation by angle 0 of the unit circle. Such functions were defined and studied by Hardy and Littlewood in [3], and also by Hecke [5], Ostrowski and others. A Dirichlet series typically converges In a half-plane Re(s) > a0. The first step in retrieving the information contained In It Is to study Its possible analytic continuation. Even its existence is not usually something that can be deduced Immediately from the form of the coefficients, however simple their algebraic or analytic nature may be. For Instance, as Is well known, g(s) extends meromorphically to the whole complex plane, with only a simple pole at s = 1. In addition, it has an important symmetry around Re(s) = 1/2, in the form of a functional equation, a hallmark of many arithmetical Dirichlet series. It has \"trivial\" zeros at - 2 , - 4 , - 6 , . . . , and its values at the negative odd Integers are rational, essentially given by the Bernoulli numbers. The Diophantine series described above also extend to meromorphic functions on C, but there Is no reason to expect a symmetric functional equation. Indeed their poles form the half of a lattice in the left half-plane. Other series, more fancifully defined, are likely not to extend at all. For instance, it is known that Y>p~~\\ where p runs over the primes, cannot extend beyond any point on the imaginary axis, even though It Is formed from terms of T^=\\n~s (Chandrasekharan's book [1] Is a nice Introduction to these arithmetical connections, whereas Hardy and RIesz ss book [4] Is a good source for the more analytical aspects of the general theory of Dirichlet series). The function <p(s) we study In this paper, defined by the Dirichlet series HF~ S, where F„ is the w* Fibonacci number, shares properties with both types mentioned above. We will show that It extends to a meromorphic function on all of C and that It has, like the Riemann zeta function, \"trivial 111 zeros at -2, - 6, -10,.... However, it has trivial simple poles at 0, - 4, - 8,.... Again like C(s), we show that at the odd negative Integers Its values are rational numbers, in this case 2001] 409 ANALYTIC CONTINUATION OF THE FIBONACCI DIRICHLET SERIES naturally expressible by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. In addition, we derive arithmetical expres- sions for the values of <p(s) at positive integers. On the other hand, we also show that tp($) is analytically similar to the Diophantine series with the golden ratio as the irrational number 0. Indeed p(s) has the same \"half-lattice\" of poles. More recently, Grabner and Prodinger [2] describe a \"Fibonacci\" stochastic process in which there arise analytic continuations sharing yet again this kind of pole structure, thus adding a third interesting context in which similar analytic behavior arises. This can be explained by a formal similarity in the calculations in each case, but it would be interesting to study further if there are deeper connections between them. 2* FIRST STEPS The Fibonacci numbers grow exponentially, and, in general, if a > 1 and vn are integers with vn > a n, then for a = Re s > 0 we have the estimate I \\y-„' i * I v? £ £ « _OT =(« CT - ir'• n=\\ n—l n=l Hence, the Dirichlet series Z^=1 v~ s defines an analytic function f(s) for a > 0, and furthermore, IsfWllsKa'-lT^ilogar^ + Oia) as a -> 0+, so that sf(s) is bounded in every angular sector with vertex at 0 opening into the half- plane R e s > 0 . Applying this to the Fibonacci numbers Fn, we get an analytic function <p{s) defined for a = Re 5 > 0 by the Dirichlet series Z^Li F~ s. It is interesting to express this as a Mellin transform in the classical manner (see Ch. 4 of [4], for example). This is accomplished by the counting function #(x) =#{n>l:Fn <x}, which counts the number of Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to x, where we start with i*J and count Fl = F2 = l twice. Equivalently, #(x) = max{/i > 0: Fn <x) (but this is not the same as starting from F0 = 0 and counting distinct Fn). Then <p{s) = s\\ ®(x)x~ s~ ldx. Note that #(x) = 0 for 0 < x < 1, so the integral actually starts at x = 1. Let N(x) = [log^ xV5], where log^ means the logarithm in base <p and [x] is the integer part of x. Then it is not hard to see that <l?(x) = N(x) + S(x), where S(x) = 0,1,-1 and, in fact, 8{x) = 1 if and only if x is in an interval of the form [F2n, <p 2n IV5), n > 1, and £(x) = - 1 if and only if x is in an interval of the form [<p 2n+l IV5, F2n+l). Let E c [1, oo) be the union of these intervals. Then m(E) < oo, where m is Lebesgue measure, and thus we have <p{s) = s U M ^ i \\c- s- ldx + s\\ES(x)x- s- ldx. (1) The first integral may be calculated explicitly, and defines a meromorphic function on the whole complex plane. The second integral converges at least for a > - 1 , since for such a, I \\x~ s- l\\dx = J x~ a- ldx <m(E) < oo. 410 [NOV. ANALYTIC CONTINUATION OF THE FIBONACCI DIRICHLET SERIES In fact, we do not need to calculate the first integral once we realize that approximating O by N is equivalent to approximating Fn by <p n I-J5 in the Dirichlet series. Indeed, ><p 2niS Aw=zii\"-*-+r dxT n=l = 5 X ' +^2 n=l 20+1 ' V 5 j ^ V 5 ^ ^ ( 5 ) - l - 5 - s / 2 - ^ -25 \\-9- for a > 0. Thus, p(*) = A(s) + l + - ? tf-V where c = log^(V5) - 1 . This is an analytic continuation of <p($) to a > - 1 , and we see that <p has a simple pole at s = 0 with residue 1 / log <p. In fact, the series expression A(*)=ix j-(p\"/V5n 71=2 converges for a > - 2 , since by the mean value theorem, 0rv5 Note also that A(^)->1 as |s|—> oo and s lies in an angular sector at 0 opening onto Re5>0. This is consistent with <p(s) -> 2 as |5|—> oo in this manner. Now we proceed to determine the analytic continuation of <p(s) to a meromorphic function on C, and determine its poles. From this we will see the reason for this first \"jump\" from a = 0 too-= - 2 . 3.

We already know that 0, - 4 , -8,... are simple poles. Proposition 2: <p($) has \"trivial\" zeros at —m, where m > 0, m = 2 mod 4, and the values at other negative integers are rational numbers, which can be expressed in terms of Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. Proof: Let m > 0 be an integer not a multiple of 4. By (5), fm\\ L (p-m+2k+^k+l-- and since m e Z+, all terms with k >m are 0, so that this is really a finite sum belonging to Q(V5).

If m is odd, then ak if of the form ak4l, where ak e Q, as is also S\"™' 2, so that again <p(-ni) e Q.

For even m, the signs are more of a nuisance. The classes S*, S~ are of divisors d = 0,2 mod 4. We are summing over even /, and we write / = 2 rX with r > 1 and X odd. Then the divisors d\\l with d = 2 mod 4 are of the form d-28 with J|>1.

DIOPHANTINE APPROXIMATION The \"Fibonacci zeta function\" tp(s} has much in common with the meromorphic function obtained by analytic continuation of the Dirichlet series / C ^ E ^ i ^ (where {x} is the fractional part of x) studied by (among others) Hecke in [5] and Hardy and Littlewood in [3] and related papers. Indeed, they show that this function has the same singularities as <p(s), namely, simple poles at -2k + ( j ^ ^ . They work with any reduced quadratic irrational a, and it is easily seen that we have analogous results in that case also. In particular, f(s) and <p(s) differ by an entire function. The function <p(s) is not in those papers, which have in mind the study of the distribution of the fractional parts {no] (see also Lang [8]). Hecke mentions that lLn^s n\" s also has an analytic continuation when S is the set of positive integers satisfying {no} < s for a given £ > 0 . Note that F2n+l eS except for finitely many n, but by Weyl's equidistribution theorem there are infinitely more numbers in S, making these continued functions have an additional pole at 5 = 1. Comparing (5) with formulas in [5] and [3], we find similar summands multiplied by zeta- like functions. It would be interesting to obtain more qualitative information. Further questions about (p(s) might involve finding nontrivial zeros and studying their distribution, and more prop- erties of the values <p(m) at integers m. REFERENCES 1. K. Chandrasekharan.

SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECONB-OMDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES Jack Y0 Lee 280 86th Street, Brooklyn, NY 11209 (Submitted August 1999-Final Revision November 1999) In our previous report [5], we developed some methods ie the study of the line-sequential properties of the polynomial sequences treated in Shannon and Horadam [9]. In this report, we work out the properties for the general case and apply them to the Pell polynomial line-sequence as an example. Some known results are included for completeness, but only new aspects will be presented in some detail. 1. THE BASIC FORMULAS Recall that the linear homogeneous second-order recurrence relation is given by cun+bun+l = un+29 c,b*0, WE Z ; (1.0a) and a general line-sequence is expressed as \\J(cJh):...,u_3,u_2,u_l,[uQ,uJ,u2,u3,u4,...yunGm., (1.0b) where [% t/J denotes the generating pair of the line-sequence. 1. Basis Paii°o The basis pair for the general case, that is, without specifying the parametric coef- ficients b and c, is given by (4.2) and (4.3) in [8]: Gl50(c,*):...?(c + A2)/c2,-6/c,[l,0],c,ci,c(c+fe2),..., (1.1a) G 0 5 l(c,5):...,(c+5 2)/c 3,-&/c 2,l/c,[0,l],6,(c + 62),.... (Lib) Definition 1: Two line-sequences are said to be complementary if they are orthogonal. Obviously, the pair (1.1a) and (Lib) are orthogonal and form a set of basis. When c = b = 1, they reduce to the complementary Fibonacci and the Fibonacci line-sequences, Fl0 and F0tl, respectively. It is clear that all the line-sequential properties of either a number line-sequence or a polynomial line-sequence given by the recurrence relation (1.0a) originate from the properties of this pair. Following are some of the main properties. 2„ Translation* The translational relation between the basic pair is given by: TGl0 = cG0,h (1.2a) where J denotes the translation operation, see (3.1) in [8]. Let gn[i9j] denote the ifi 1 term in the line-sequence Guj9 then, in terms of the elements, (1.2a) becomes «H.A0] = cgl[0,l]. (1.2b) 3. Parity, The parity relation of the elements in Glj0 is found to be g-im = (~lTc-(n+l)gn+2l\\0l (1.3a) 2001] 419 SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES From (4.9) in [8], the parity relation of the elements in G0 x is given by «LjO,l] = (-ir 1c- w&[0,l]. (1.3b) Applying translational relation (1.2b) to (1.3b), we get (1.3a). In the nomenclature of Shannon and Horadam [9], parity relation (1.3b) reduces to (1.7) in [1] for c = - 1 in the case of Morgan- Voyce even Fibonacci polynomials. 4. Cross Relations. Combining the translational and parity relations, we obtain the following set of cross relations among the elements of the two basis polynomial line-sequences: ^ [ l , 0 ] = ( - i r c - ^ + 1 [ 0 , l ] , (1.4a) ^ 0 1 = ^ 4 0 , 1 ] ; (1.4b) or g-JLO, 1] = ( - l r ' c - ^ & N . i t l , 0], (1.4c) ^ n [ 0 ) l ] = c-V-(„-1)[l,0]. (1.4d) 5. Geometrical Line-Sequences. The pair of geometrical iine-sequences relating to Gx 0 is given by: Gha(c,b):..., a 2, a'\\ [1, a], a 2, a3,..., (1.5a) Glfi(c,b):...,p-2,/r\\ll,/]l/]2,p\\..., (1.5b) where a and fi are the roots of the generating equation q2-bq-c = 0 (1.5c) (ref. (1.7) in [4], with # = 0 ) . 6. Binet's Formula. Binet's formula for the G10 basis is given by Gl0 = (-/3Gla+aGlfi)/(<a-P), (1.6a) and for the G0 j basis is given by G^ = (G^a-Ghp)l(a-p) (1.6b) (ref. (4.9) in [7]). 7. (General) Lucas Pain Recall that the line-sequence \"conjugate\" to G0 j is the \"general\" Lucas line-sequence generated by [2, b], see (4.12) in [8]: G2J)(c,b):...,(2c+b2)/c\\-b/c,[2,bl2c + b\\b(3c-hb2X..., (1.7a) which reduces to the Lucas line-sequence L2li(c = b = l. Its complement is ^,_ 2(c,£):...,% + 2 + £ W (1.7b) For c = b = 1, it reduces to the complementary Lucas line-sequence, ^ _ 2 a i ) : . . . ? - 7 ? 4 , - 3 , [ l , - 2 ] , - l , - 3 , - 4 , - 7 , . . . . (1.7c) 420 [NOV. SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES The orthogonal pair (1.7a) and (1.7b) then form a \"(general) Lucas basis\" spanning the same 2D space as does the basis pair G10 and G0 b but with a normalization factor (b 2 +4)~1/2. 8, Decomposition Schemes. Thus, we have the following different ways of decomposing a given line-sequence, G; j(c,b): The first is the \"basic decomposition\" resulting in the basic com- ponent expression, see (2.9) in [8]: GiJ(c,b) = iGl0(c,b)+jG0A(c,by (1.8a) The second is the \"Binet decomposition\" the general formula of which is G,j(c,b) = [-(fii-j)G ha + (ai-j)Gi,fl/(a-fi). (1.8b) Note that the Binet pair Gx a and Gx $ does not form an orthogonal pair unless c = 1, see (2.8) in PL The third is the \"Lucas decomposition,\" which produces the Lucas component expression, the formula of which is given by Gy,/c,6) = [(2/+J/)G2i4 + (W-27)G4f_2]/(ft2+4)) (1.8c) where the denominator accounts for the normalization factor. Since line-sequences Gx^y and Gy^_x are complementary, by repeated application of the vector addition and the scalar multiplication rules, see [8], we obtain the general orthogonal decomposition formula: G,f/c,ft) = [ ( x i > j y ^ (L8d) Putting x - 1 and y - - 1 , and applying the rule for scalar multiplication by - 1, we obtain (1.8a); if we put x = 2 and y = b, we obtain (1.8c). Similarly, for an arbitrary pair of line-sequences Gx%y and Gz?w, we find This is the general decomposition formula. For convenience, we call GXty and GZtW the pair of coordinate line-sequences, and their coefficients the respective components. Putting z = y and w = - x , we get (1.8d); if we put * = z = l, y = a, and w = fi, we get (1.8b). Wang and Zhang [11] adopted a very special pair of coordinates based on their conjugation property: G 0i and G2f£. Putting x - 0, y = 1, z = 2, and w - b, we obtain GUj{cM = {-{hi-2j)G,A+iG2ib\\l2, (1.8Q which is equivalent to equation (2) in [11]. This decomposition scheme is particularly convenient to use in treating products of terms because of the conjugation property. 9. Translations! Representation* By applying the translational relation (1.2a) to (1.8a), we obtain the translational representation of a general line-sequence in terms of the first basis, GUj(c, b) = (U+jc- lT)Gh0(c, 6), (1.9a) where i r denotes the identity translation; or, in terms of the elements, in the second basis: &P,7] = rf&.i[0,l]+7al[0,l]. (1.9b) 2001] 421 SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES 10. Biiiet's Product* Consistent with the multiplication of the corresponding terms in two line- sequences to obtain their product, we present the following definition. Definition 2: The product of two line-sequences is defined as the product of the two respective Binet formulas, and shall be referred to as \"Binet's Product.\" Also, for convenience, exponen- tiation notation is adopted when it applies. Note that, except for some special cases, Binet's product does not, in general, constitute a line-sequence governed by (1.0a). This question will be discussed in a later paper. In the line-sequential format, we then have Gh0G0il = (^Gla+aGl^b(-cf)/(b 2+4c) (1.10a) or, in terms of the elements, ^ a 0 ] g „ [ 0 , l ] = (c<?2„_1[2,*]+*(-^)\")/(*2 + 4c). (1.10c) The conjugation of G0l and G2^ ( r®f- H-7) and (4.8) in [8]) is then given by G0AGXb = (Gla-GlP)l{a-P) (1.10c) or, in terms of the elements, &[0,1]&[2,*] = &II[0,1]. (LlOd) This is the general conjugation formula relating the Fibonacci and the Lucas elements. For c = h = 1, it reduces to the basic conjugation relation, fjn = f2n. The Binet product of G10 and Gb _2 is somewhat more complex, that is, 61.0(^2 = { I W + ^ ^ ( U O e ) or, in terms of the elements, &D,0]sJA,-2] = c { f c ^ ^ (I.IOQ When c = ft = 1, it reduces to the more easily recognizable relation, /„[1,0]/„[l, - 2] = (/2n_2[2,1]- 2/2n_,[2,1]) / 5, (1. lOg) which is a set of even terms in the negative Fibonacci line-sequence, F o ^ ! : . . . ^ , - ^ ^ - ^ ! , - ! , ^ , - ! ] , - ! , - ^ - ^ - ^ - ^ . . . . (l.lOh) 11. Summation. From the recurrence relation, it is easy to show that the general consecutive terms summation formula is given by (ft+c - 1 ) ^ ^=«%+„+«*+w+i + ( * - I K - « i t + i , 0 - l l a ) where i>k,n>0;i,k,n(=Z. We stress that this formula, like (4.3u) in [6], is translationally covariant In the harmonic case, ft = c = 1, it reduces to the latter. In the case of Jacobsthal num- bers, it reduces to (2.7) and (2.8) in [3], respectively; in the case of Jacobsthal polynomials, it reduces to (3.7) and (3.8) in [2], respectively, and so forth. 422 [NOV. SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES A word about the convention. In (4.3u) in [6], the translational degree of freedom is implicit in that the zeroth element uQ may be assigned to any element in the line-sequence. In the current case, however, we want to assign the zero* element in the formula to the zeroth element of the line-sequence in question; for example, in the Pell line-sequence, we want to assign u0 = p0, so the translational degree of freedom lies explicitly in the value of the parameter k chosen. It is easy to show that the following two equations hold: k+n k+n (C - 1 ) £ U 2j + * X M2,-l = C( M2(fc+n) - «2(i-l)X (1.11b) i=k i=k k+n k+n ( c - l ) ^ % + i + ftS M 2, = c(M2(fc+n)+l-\"2fc-l)- 0 -1 1 C ) i~k i=k In the harmonic case, (1.11b) reduces to the odd terms summation formula (4.4u), and (1.11c) reduces to the even terms summation formula (4.5u) in [6], respectively. Combining (1.11b) and (1.11c), we obtain the general even terms summation formula, k+n X % = K C - ^(^(k+ny+l - «2k) - bc&2(k+n)+l ~ *hk-l)\\ ' K C ~ lf ~ b \\ (1.11 d ) i=k and the general odd terms summation formula, k+n X *2/+l = l°2 (^(k+^+l ~ «2*-l) ~ (^2(k+n)+3 ~ *hk+l)\\ ' K C ~ lf ~ b ^ ' (l'llQ) i=k 12. Translational Operators, By the dual relation of Section 4 in [6], corresponding to for- mulas (1.11a) through (l.lle), we have the following set of covariant equations of the transla- tional operators: k+n (6+c-i)X^ = crt+„ + rt+„+I+(*-i)r,-rfc+1, (1.12a) i=k k+n k+n (p- i ) I T 2i +*>£ 4-i = c(T2(k+n) - V D ) , 0- 12b) i=k i=k k+n k+n ( c - l ) Z ^ + i + 6 Z r a , = c ( T 2 i k + n ) + l - r 2 H ) , (1.12c) i—k i=k k+n E ^-K c-ix^^-^j-M V ^-ui/K c-i) 2^ 2], (i.i2d) i=k k+n E T2M = [c2(T2{k+n)+l - T2k_x) - (T2(k+n)+3 - Tu+1)] I [(c -1) 2 - b 2]. (1.12e) 13. Sirasonfs Formula. The general Simson formula is found to be gn^j}g n-ilhj]-{g n[i,j])2=(-cy-\\bij+ci2-f). (1.13) In particular, for the general Fibonacci and the general Lucas pairs, & +iD,0]^,[l,0]-(g B[l,0]) 2 = ^ ) V (113a) g„+i[0,11&J0, l]-(&[0, l])2 = -{-cT\\ (1.13b) 2001] 423 SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES gn+l[2, b]gn_x[2, * ] - ( & P , h]f = (-cy-l(b2 + 4c\\ (1.13c) gn¥l[b, -2]gn_x[h, -2]-(gn[b, -2]) 2 = -{-cy~\\2b 2 -b2c + 4). (1.13d) In the case of Jacobsthal numbers, (1.13b) and (1.13c) above reduce to (2.5) and (2.6) in [3], respectively. In the case of Jacobsthal polynomials, they reduce to (3.5) and (3.6) in [2], respec- tively, and so forth. From (1.13), it is clear that the significance of Simson's formula lies in its independence of the index n, apart from a sign correction. 2. THE GENERAL LUCAS PAIR The general Lucas line-sequence G2b is particularly interesting, mainly owing to its being conjugate to the second basis line-sequence G 0 1. In addition to the aforementioned properties, a few more basic properties are given below. The basis component expression of G2b, according to (1.8a), is given by G2,b = 2Gl0+bG0tl (2.1a) or, in terms of the elements, &[2,ft] = 2 &[l,0]+A &[0,l]. (2.1b) Substitution of the translational relation (1.2a) into (2.1a) produces the translational representa- tion of G2b m terms of the first basis, G2fb = (2I+bc- lT)Gl0, (2.1c) which can also be obtained from (1.9a) by putting i = 2 and j = b. The basis component expression of Gb _2 is given by Gb,-2 = bGi,o-2GOA (2.2a) or, in terms of the elements, &[*, - 2 ] = bg„[l, 0]-2 &[0,1]. (2.2b) The translational representation in terms of the first basis is then given by Gbt_2 = (bI-2c- lT)GU0, (2.2c) which can again be obtained from (1.9a) by putting i-b and J = - 2 . Binet's formula for G2tb, according to (1.8b), is G2.fab) = Gla + Gufi9 (2.3a) and Binet's formula for its complement is ^,_ 2(c,*) = h0ffft+2)G1>a + ( a f t + 2 ) G ^ ] / ( a - ^ . (2.3b) Substituting the geometrical line-sequences (1.5a) and (1.5b) into (2.3a) and noting that afi = -c, we obtain the parity relation of the elements in G2tb, that is, g-n[2,b] = (-crgn[2,b]. Again in the nomenclature of Shannon and Horadam [9], the parity relation (2.4) reduces to (1.9) in [1] for c = - 1 in the case of Morgan-Voyce even Lucas polynomials. 424 [NOV. SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES Applying the cross relation (1.4a) and the parity relation (1.3b) to the component expression (1.13b), using the parity relation (2.4), we obtain gn[2,b] = 2gn+llQ,l]-bgn[0M (2.5) which is the general version of the basis representation of the Lucas elements (for c = h = l): *„ — 4/«+l ~ Jn- Similarly, from the component expression (2.2b), we obtain gm[b, - 2] = bcg^JO, 1] - 2&[0,1], (2.6a) which is the basis representation of the complementary Lucas elements in terms of the second basis. Note that if we choose to express the elements in terms of the first basis, using the trans- lational relation (1.2b), we would obtain gn[b,-2] = -2c-V„+1[l, 0]+bgn[l, 0], (2.6b) which is more symmetrical with (2.5). 3. THE PELL POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES We now apply the formulas obtained in the previous sections to the Pell polynomials and, for the sake of checking, we also calculate the results independently, that is, without using those formulas. The results are found to agree in each and every case. The order of development fol- lows largely that of the previous sections with some minor variations. The Pell polynomials line-sequence is defined by b = 2x, c = l. The basic pair is given by P1)0(l,2x):...,-4x(H-2x2),(l + 4x 2),-2x,[l,0],l,2x,(l + 4x2),..., (3.1a) P0J(1,2x):..., -4x(l + 2x2), l + 4x2, -2x, 1, [0,1], 2x, (l + 4x2),..., (3.1b) where the first one is referred to as the complementary P-Fibonacci line-sequence, or the P10 line- sequence for short; the second is referred to as the P-Fibonacci line-sequence, or the P0l line- sequence for short. Obviously, they are translationally related, in agreement with (1.2a), that is, 2Plf0 = P0fi. (3-2a) In terms of the elements, this becomes /WiP.0] = />n[0,l]. (3.2b) The parity relation of the elements in Pl0 is given by (1.3 a), P-ntt,0] = (-l)\"p„+2[l,0], (3.3a) and the parity relation of the elements in P0l is given by (1.3b), /'-„[0,l] = ( - i r 1 A [ 0 J l ] . (3.3b) Or, by applying (3.2b) to (3.3b), we also obtain (3.3a). Combining the translational relations with the parity ones, we obtain the following set of cross relations among the elements of the two basis polynomial line-sequences, in agreement with relations (1.4a) through (1.4d): 2001] 425 SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES / a i , 0 ] = (-l)V„+1[0,l] (3.4a) P-J},0] = p<n¥l)[0,ll (3.4b) or \\n+l P-„[0,l] = ( - i r W l , 0 ] , (3.4c) P-niO,i\\ = P^y^O]. (3.4d) From (1.5 a) and (1.5b), the pair of geometrical line-sequences relating to Pl 0 is given by Pla(l,2xy....,a- 2,a-\\[l,a],a 2,a 3,..., (3.5a) Px,p{\\2xy...,pr\\p-\\\\\\,p\\f?,f}\\..., (3.5b) respectively, where a and fi are the roots of the generating equation q 2-2xq-l = Q. (3.5c) By formulas (1.6a) and (1.6b), Binet's formula for Pl0 is PXQ = {-pPha + aPh(3)l(a-p), (3.6a) and for the P0l is Po.i = (Pua-Pifi)Ka-fi)- (3-6b) From (1.7a) and (1.7b), the P-Lucas line-sequence is given by Pi, 2*0,2x): - 2x(3 + 4x2), 2(1 + 2x2), - 2x, [2,2x], 2(1 + 2x2), 2x(3 + 4x2),.... (3.7a) Its complement is then P2,5_2(l, 2x):..., 2x(3 + 4x2), - 2(1-f 2x2), [2x, - 2 ] , -2x, ~2(l + 2x2),.... (3.7b) These two line-sequences are clearly orthogonal, with a normalization factor [2(l + x2)1/2]_1. The basis component expression for an arbitrary Pell polynomial line-sequence, according to (1.8a), is given by PUJ{\\ 2x) =iPl0(l, 2x) +jP0J(l, 2x), (3.8) so we have, for the P-Lucas pair: PlixQ* 2x) = 2^i,oO? 2x) + 2xP0>1(l, 2x), (3.8a) P2*.-2<X 2x) = 2xPl0(l3 2x) - 2P(U(1, 2x). (3.8b) It can be easily shown that the general formula of Binet decomposition, in the simpler appli- cable form for the Pell polynomial line-sequences, is given by PiJ(l,2x) = [-i(pPha-aP1^) + j(Pla-Pl^)]/(a-P). (3.9) Thus, we have P22x(l,2x) = 2 [ - ( / ^ (3.9a) ^ , - 2 a 2 x ) = 2 [ - x ( / ? P ^ (3.9b) The formula for the Lucas decomposition of an arbitrary Pell polynomial line-sequence, according to (1.8c), is given by 4 2 6 [NOV. SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES Pi,J(l,2x) = [(i + xj)P2,2x + (xi-j)P2x,_2]/2(l + x 2), (3.10) so the component formulas of the basis pair with respect to the Lucas bases are Pi,oQ,2x) = [P2,2x+xP2x>_2]/2(l + x 2), (3.10a) P0,1(l,2x) = [xPX2x-P2x_2]/2(l + x 2). (3.10b) The conjugation of P0l and P2b, by (1.10c), produces Po.A2x = (fua-fup)Ka-fi). (3.11a) In terms of the elements, this becomes pn[0,l]pn[2,2x] = p2„[0,l], (3.11b) which is the P-version of the conjugation relation fjn = f2n. The Binet product of P^ 0 and P2Xt _2? by (1. lOe), is found to be P1,oP2X,-2 = 2[fi(fix + l)P'a + a(ax + l)P^]/(a-^2. (3.12a) In terms of the elements, with afi = -l, this becomes pn[l,0]pr![2x,-2] = (xp2„_2[2,2x]-p2„_1[2,2x])/2(l + x 2). (3.12b) From Binet's formula (3.9a), we obtain the following parity relation between the elements of the P-Lucas line-sequence (3. 7a), p^[292x] = (riypn[292xl (3.13) which apparently holds true. The component expression of the P-Lucas line-sequence is given by ^2.2, = 2/lo + 2xP0tl. (3.14a) In terms of the elements, this becomes pn[2,2x]=2p„[l,0]+2xp„[0,l]. (3.14b) Applying (3.3b) and (3.4a) and using the parity relation (3.13), we obtain Pr}[2,2x} = 2pn+l[0,l]-2xpn[0,ll (3.14c) which is the P-version of the relation ln = 2fn+l - fn. Substituting the translation relation (3.2a) to the component expression (3.14a), we obtain the translational representation of the P-Lucas line-sequence, PX2x=2(I + xT)Pl0. (3.15) The component expression of the complementary P-Lucas line-sequence is ^ - 2 = ^ 0 - 2 ^ , 1 . (3.16a) In terms of the elements, this becomes pn[2x, - 2 ] = 2xpn[l, 0]-2pn[0,1]. (3.16b) Applying parity relation (3.3b) and cross relation (3.4a), we obtain 2001] 427 SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES pn[2x, - 2] = -2p„[0,1] + 2xpn_l[0,1], (3.16c) which is the complement of the relation (3.14c) in terms of the second basis. Its equivalence in terms of the first basis is obtained by applying the translational relation (3.2b), pn[2x, - 2 ] = -2Pn¥l[\\0]+2x#,[l, 0], (3.16d) which is more symmetrical with (3.14c). Substituting the translation relation (3.2a) into the component expression (3.16a), we obtain the translational representation of the complementary P-Lucas line-sequence, P2x,-2 = 2(xI-T)Pl0. (3.17) The following summation formulas can be verified easily: k+n Z f l = [ A + » » + A + I I + I + ( 2 X \" 1 ) A - A + I ] / 2 X , (3.18a) i=k k+n X A/-i = (ftoH-n) - A(*-i))/2x, (3.18b) i=k k+n Z PH = (P2(k+n)+l ~ Plk-l) / 2X. (3.18C) Formulas (1.11b) and (1.11 c) in the general case reduce to (3.18b) and (3.18c), respectively. The dual relation then gives the corresponding operators equations of translation: k+n HTl=[Tk+n + Tk+n+l+(2x-i)Tk-Tk+l]/2x, (3.19a) i=k k+n I? /-I = ( V ) - V D ) / 2 * ' < 3-19b) i=k k+n Z 4 = ( ^ + n ) + i - ^ - i ) / 2 x . (3.19c) For example, let k = -3 and n = 5, then the left-hand side (l.h.s.) of (3.19a) gives (k+n \\ \\i=k J and its right-hand side (r.h.s.) gives [T2 + T 3 + (2x - l)T_3 - ZL2] fl[0,1]/ 2x = 3 + 4x 2; hence, l.h.s. = r.h.s. Simson's formulas for the Pell polynomial line-sequence are found to be: fl»iP, OJ/ViU 0]-(pn[l, 0])2 = ( - l r 1 , (3.20a) /WifO, 1]/Vi[<>, 1]-(PJP, l])2 = (-1)\", (3.20b) pn+l[2,2x]pn_l{2,2x] - (p„[2,2x]) 2 = (-l)\"-x(4)(l + x 2), (3.20c) pn+l[2x, -2-\\Vn_i2x, -2]-(p„[2x, -2]) 2 =(-l)\"(4)(l + x2). (3.20d) For example, let n = - 1 in (3.20d), then l.h.s. = r.h.s. = -4(1 + x 2). 428 [NOV. SOME GENERAL FORMULAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECOND-ORDER HOMOGENEOUS POLYNOMIAL LINE-SEQUENCES Remark: A number of specific problems in this work need to be addressed. For example, as of this writing, we have not yet found the parity relation of the elements in Gb^_2, as compared to those in G2tb, see (2.4). Also, as far as this author is aware of, the relation (3.12b) does not seem to relate to any known line-sequential relation, in contradistinguishing to relation (3.11b), which relates to the well-known conjugation relation fnln - f2n. It is also interesting to see, as is pointed out by the referee, that viewing from the bigger picture, so to say, how this piece of 2D work relates to the work in the 3D case, as, for example, in the context of [10].

INTRODUCTION We study certain paths In the first quadrant from (0,0) to (/', j). These paths consist of segments from (x0, y0) = (0,0) to (xl3 yt) to ... to {xk, yk) = (f, j). If we write then ph > 0, qh > 0, and Thus, the ^ form a composition of/, the % a composition of/. The paths we shaM study will have some restrictions on the ph and qh. For exairole, in Sec- tion 3, we shall enumerate paths for which <*x*>Ph^hx> ay^9h^ by9 *=1,2,...,*, * ^ 1 , where o ^ l , a >\\. 2. COMPOSITIONS A composition of a nonnegative integer n is a vector (p1?..., /^) for which Note that the order in which the ph are listed matters. Each ph is called a, part, and £, the number of parts. Let c(#f, £, a, h) be the number of compositions of n into A parts ph with a<ph<b. It is well known that On subtracting a from each part, it is easy to see that c{n, k,a,oo) = c(n-ka,k,0,») = T ~ * *i \" J- 0 ) With a = 1, this gives the number of compositions of n into k positive parts, c(n,k,l*>) = ^Z 1^ and the number of compositions of n into positive parts, 430 [NOV.

We leave proofs of (A)-(F) to the reader, along with the determination of the position and magni- tude of the maximum number Mn in the rfi\" antidiagonal of T. The first fourteen values of Mn are 1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 48, 112, 272, 688, 1696, 4096, 10496, 26624, 66304. One wonders what can be said about limw_^00 Mn IFln. Initial terms of the sequences in (A)-(F) appear in Figure 1. The T(i9 j) given in Theorem 2 are determined recursively by T(0,0) = 1, 7(0, j) = 0 for j > 1, T(i, 0) = 2'\"1 for i > 1, and iv,j)='tin*>i)- ( 4) To verify (4), note that each path with final segment terminating on (/, j) has penultimate seg- ment terminating on a lattice point (A, s) in the rectangle RiJ:={0,l,...,i-l}x{0,l,...J}. Therefore, the number of relevant paths from (0,0) to (/, j) is the sum of the numbers of such paths from (0,0) to a point in i^;J. More generally, all arrays as in Theorems 1 and 2 are determined recursively by TQJ)= Z r ( M ) f o r / > 2 a n d . / > l , where initial values and lattice point sets % j are determined by (2) or other conditions. 432 [NOV.

INTRODUCTION In this paper, we consider the generalized Fibonacci and Lucas functions, which may be defined by ryX _ pinXOX and V(x) = ax+e?*xflx, (2) where a = (p + -/E)/2, f5=(p-JK)l2> 0, A = p 2-4q,p and q are integers with q> 0, andx is an arbitrary real number. It is clear that U(x) = F(2x) and V(x) = L(2x) when p = 3 and q = 1, where F(x) and L(x) are the Fibonacci and Lucas functions, respectively (see [2]). In [2], R. Andre-Jeannin proved that well-known identities for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers are again true for F(x) and L(x). Basic results regarding these topics can be found in [1]. Some special cases of the functioits U(x) and V(x) are treated in [4] and referred to in the Remark in [8]. The aim of this paper is to establish some identities for U(x) and V(x). We are interested in calculating the summation of reciprocals of products of U(x) and V(x). 2.

A SIMPLE PROOF OF CARMICHAELfS THEOREM ON PRIMITIVE DIVISORS Minora Yabuta 46-35 Senriokanaka Suita-sl, Osaka 565-0812, Japan (Submitted September 1999-Final Revision March 2000) 1. INTRODUCTION For arbitrary positive integer «, numbers of the form Dn = {a n-p n)l{a-fJ) are called the Lucas numbers, where a and fi are distinct roots of the polynomial f(z) = z 2 -Lz + M, and L and Mare integers that are nonzero. The Lucas sequence (D): Dh D2, D3,... is called real when a and ft are real. Throughout this paper, we assume that L and M are coprime. Each Dn is an integer. A prime p is called a primitive divisor of Dn ifp divides Dn but does not divide Dm for 0<m<n. Carmichael [2] calls it a characteristic factor and Ward [9] an intrinsic divisor. As Durst [4] observed, in the study of primitive divisors, it suffices to take L>0. Therefore, we assume L > 0 in this paper. In 1913, Carmichael [2] established the following. Theorem 1 (Carmichael): If a and /} are real and n & 1,2,6, then Dn contains at least one primi- tive divisor except when « = 12, L = \\ M = -l, In 1974, Schinzel [6] proved that if the roots off are complex and their quotient is not a root of unity and if n is sufficiently large then the w* term in the associated Lucas sequence has a primitive divisor. In 1976, Stewart [7] proved that if n - 5 or n > 6 there are only finitely many Lucas sequences that do not have a primitive divisor, and they may be determined. In 1995, Voutier [8] determined all the exceptional Lucas sequences with n at most 30. Finally, Bilu, Hanrot, and Voutier [1] have recently shown that there are no other exceptional sequences that do not have a primitive divisor for the w* term with n larger than 30. The aim of this paper is to give an elementary and simple proof of Theorem 1. To prove that Theorem 1 is true for all real Lucas sequences, it is sufficient to discuss the two special sequences, namely, the Fibonacci sequence and the so-called Fermat sequence. 2* A SUFFICIENT CONDITION THAT Dn HAS A PRIMITIVE DIVISOR Let n > 1 be an integer. Following Ward [9], we call the numbers \\<>r<>n (r,n)=l the cyclotomic numbers associated with the Lucas sequence, where a, fi are the roots of the polynomial f(z) = z 2-Lz + M and the product is extended over all positive integers less than n and prime to n. Each Qn is an integer, and Dn = Hd\\n Qm where the product is extended over all divisors d of n. Hence, p is a primitive divisor of Dn if and only lip is a primitive divisor of Qn. Lemma 1 below was shown by several authors (Carmichael, Durst, Ward, and others). 2001] 439 A SIMPLE PROOF OF CARMICHAEL'S THEOREM ON PRIMITIVE DIVISORS Lemma 1: Let/? be prime and let k be the least positive value of the index i such that/? divides Dr If n ^ 1,2,6 and if/? divides Qn and some Qm with 0<m<n, then /?2 does not divide gw and n~p rk with r >1. Now suppose that n has a prime-power factorization n = p* lp2 2..*Pi l, where Pi,p2,---,Pi a r e distinct primes and £1? e2,...,el are positive integers. Lemma 1 leads us to the following lemma (cf. Halton [5], Ward [9]). Lemma 2: Let n & 1,2,6. A sufficient condition that Dn contains at least one primitive divisor is that \\Qn\\>plp2--Pi- Proof: We prove the contraposition. Suppose that Dn has no primitive divisors. lip is an arbitrary prime factor of Qn, thenp divides some Qm with 0<m<n. Therefore, p divides n and p 2 does not divide Q,. Hence, Qn divides PiP2...ph so \\Qn\\ < p\\P2—Pi- • Our proof of CarmichaePs theorem is based on the following. Theorem 2: If n * 1,2,6 and if both the rfi 1 cyclotornic number associated with z 2 - z -1 and that associated with z 2-3z + 2 are greater than the product of all prime factors of n, then, for every real Lucas sequence, Dn contains at least one primitive divisor. Now assume that n is an integer greater than 2 and that a and fi are real, that is, I? - AM is positive. As Ward observed, Q,(a,fi) =X\\(a-?P){a-C rP) (1) = U((cc+fi) 2-am + Cr + C% (2) where C,-e2mln and the products are extended over all posjtive integers less than nil and prime ton. Since a -\\-p~L and aj3 = M, by putting 0r = 2 + g r + £~ r, we have Qn = Qn(a^) = Il(L 2-M0ry (3) Fix an arbitrary n > 2. Then Qn can be considered as the function of variables L and M. We shall discuss for what values ofZ and M the 71 th cyclotornic number Qn has its least value. Lemma 3: Let /1 > 2 be an arbitrary fixed integer. If a and J3 are real, then gw has its least value either when L = 1 and M = - 1 or when Z = 3 and M = 2. Proof: Take an arbitrary #r and fix it. Since n > 2, we have 0 < 0 r < 4. Thus, if M < 0, we have L 2 - M0r >l + 0r, with equality holding only in the case L = 1, M = - 1 . When M > 0, con- sider the cases M = 1, M > 1. In the first case we have L > 3, so that Z 2 - M 0 r > 9 - 0 r > 9 - 2 l 9 r . Now assume M > 1. Then, since L 2 > 4M+1, we have Z 2 - M ^ r > 4 M + l - M i 9 r = 9 - 2 ^ r + ( M - 2 ) ( 4 - ^ r ) > 9 - 2 ^ r with equality holding only in the case M = 2, L.= 3. Hence, by formula (3), we have completed the proof. D Combining Lemma 2 with Lemma 3, we complete the proof of Theorem 2. 440 [NOV. A SIMPLE PROOF OF CARMICHAEL'S THEOREM ON PRIMITIVE DIVISORS 3, CAMMICHAEL fS THEOREM We call the Lucas sequence generated by z 2~z-l the Fibonacci sequence and that gener- ated by z 2 - 3 z + 2 the Fermat sequence.- Theorem 2 implies that to prove Carmichael's theorem it is sufficient to discuss the Fibonacci sequence and the Fermat sequence. Now we suppose that n has a prime-power factorization n = p* lp* 2 ...p?, and let <b„(x) denote the /2 th cyclotomic polynomial Lemma 4: Ifn>2 and if a is real with \\a\\ < 1/2, then ®„(a) > 1 - \\a\\ - \\a\\2.

We have thus proved the lemma. D Theorem 3: If n & 1,2,6,12, then the /1 th term of the Fibonacci sequence contains at least one primitive divisor. Proof: Assume n>2. We shall determine for what n the inequality \\Qn\\>P\\P2.../*/ is satis- fied, where Qn is the n^ cyclotomic number associated with the Fibonacci sequence. The roots of the polynomial z 2-z-l are a = (1 +V5)/2 and fl = ( 1 - S ) I 2 . Since \\fi/a\\ = ( 3 - S ) I 2 < 1/2, Lemma 4 gives ®n{f}la)>l-\\pia\\-\\pia\\ 2^2S-4>2l5.

We next suppose p* 1 = 24? 3 3 ? 52, or 72 without loss of generality. Therefore, (2/5)(3/2)*rf> >2px is true, and consequently (2/5)(3/2)^(w) > PiPi-' Pi - Hence, inequality (4) is true unless n is of the form n = 2a3b5c7d, (5) 2001] 441 A SIMPLE PROOF OF CARMICHAEL'S THEOREM ON PRIMITIVE DIVISORS where 0 < a < 3, 0<b<2, 0 < c < 1, and 0 < <i < 1. By substituting (5) into (4), we verify that inequality (4) is true for w * 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14,15,18,30. However, by direct compu- tation, we have a=i, a=2, a=3, a=* &=<*, a=13, a=7, a=17, a0=n, a2=6, fi4 = 29, a3 = 61, ft8 = 19, fto = 31. Hence, \\Qn\\> P\\P2 -Pi holds for n * 1,2,3,5,6,12. It follows from Lemma 2 that if n ^ 1,2,3,5, 6,12 then the /1 th Fibonacci number i^ contains at least one primitive divisor. In addition, since Fx-\\9 F2 = l, F3 = 2, F4 = 3, F5 = 5, F6 = 23, Fl2 = 24-32, the numbers F3 and F5 have a primi- tive divisor, and Ft,F2,F6, and Fl2 do not. D Theorem 4: If/i * 1,2,6, then the «* term of the Fermat sequence contains at least one primitive divisor. Proof: The roots of the polynomial z 2-3z + 2 are a = 2 and /? = 1.

As shown in the proof of Theorem3, the inequality (2/S)(3/2)^ n) >plp2...pi is true for n* 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,12,14, 15,18,30. Moreover, by direct computation, we observe that (l/4)-2^ n ) > PiP2-Pi is true for n - 7? 8,9,14,15,18,30, and furthermore, we have •a=7, a=s, a=3i, a=3, ao=n,a2=i3.. Hence, \\Qn\\> P\\P2-Pi holds for n ^ 1,2,6. It follows from Lemma 2 that if n * 1,2,6 then the 72 th term of the Fermat sequence contains at least one primitive divisor. • Now we are ready to prove Carmichael's theorem. Proof of CarmichaeVs Theorem: As observed previously, for n ^ 1,2,3,5,6,12, both the 72 th cyclotomic number associated with the Fibonacci sequence and that associated with the Fermat sequence are greater than pj)2 ...pt. It follows from Theorem 2 that if n ^ 1,2, 3,5,6,12 then Dn contains at least one primitive divisor. In addition, Q3 = L-M> 3 except when L-1, M = - 1 . Moreover, since Q5 = 5 and Ql2 = 6 when L = 1, M = - 1 , and Q5 = 31 and (212 - 13 when Z = 3, M = 2, Lemma 3 gives Q5 > 5 and g12 > 6 except for the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, by Lemma 2, if n * 1,2,6 then DM contains at least one primitive divisor except when L = 1, M - - 1 . Combining with Theorem 3, we complete the proof D 4.

INTRODUCTION We prove that the order of divisibility by prime/? of k\\S(a(p-l)p q, k) does not depend on a and q is sufficiently large and kip is not an odd integer. Here S(n, k) denotes the Stirling num- ber of the second kind; i.e., the number of partitions of a set of n objects into k nonempty subsets. The proof is based on divisibility results for /?-sected alternating binomial coefficient sums. A fairly general criterion is also given to obtain divisibility properties of recurrent sequences when the coefficients follow some divisibility patterns. The motivation of the paper is to generalize the identity [8] v2(k\\S{n,k)) = k-\\ \\<k<n, (1) where S(n, k) denotes the Stirling number of the second kind, and n = alq, a is odd, and q is suf- ficiently large (for example, q>k-2 suffices). Here vp(m) denotes the order of divisibility by prime/? of m, i.e., the greatest integer e such that pe divides m. It is worth noting the remarkable fact that the order of divisibility by 2 does not depend on a and q if q is sufficiently large. We will clarify later what value is large enough. Our objective in this paper is to analyze vp(k\\S(n, k)) for an arbitrary prime/?. It turns out that identity (1) can be generalized to calculate the exact value of v (k! S(n, k)) ifn = a(p - l)pq and k is divisible by /? - 1 . The main result of this paper is Theorem 1: If n = a(p - l)pq, 1 < k < n, a and q are positive integers such that (a, /?) = 1, q is sufficiently large, and kip is not an odd integer, then vp(k\\S(n,k)) = k-l + *„(*), where rp(k) is a nonnegative integer. Moreover, if k is a multiple of/?-1, then rp(k) = 0. Here |_*J denotes the greatest integer function. Note that the order of divisibility by /? of k\\S(a(p-l)p q, k) does not depend on a and q if q is sufficiently large. For instance, we may choose q such that q > -pj- 2 in this case. Numerical evidence suggests that the condition on the magnitude of q may be relaxed and it appears that n > k suffices in many cases (cf. [8]). The case excluded by Theorem 1, in which kip is an odd integer, behaves somewhat differ- ently. * Partially supported by NSF grant DMS-9622456. 444 [Nov. ON THE ORDER OF STIRLING NUMBERS AND ALTERNATING BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT SUMS Theorem 2: For any odd prime p, If kip Is an odd Integer, then vp{k\\S{a{p- l)p q, k)) > q. In Section 2 we prove a fundamental lemma: If n - a(p - l)p q, then (-l)k+lk\\S(n,k) = Gp(k) (mod/^ 1), (2) where G,(*)=iffl(-iy. p\\i ^ J All of our divisibility results for the Stirling numbers are consequences of divisibility results for the alternating binomial coefficient sums Gp(k), which are of independent Interest. Theorem 2 is an immediaite consequence of (2) since, If kip Is an odd integer, the corresponding binomial coeffi- cient sum is 0. To prove Theorem 1, we prove the analogous divisibility result for Gp(k). The proof is pre- sented in Section 2, and it combines number-theoretical, combinatorial, and analytical arguments. By an application of Euler's theorem, we prove (2). We then apply p-section of the binomial expansion of (1 - x) k to express Gp(k) as a sum of p -1 terms involving roots of unity. We take a closer look at this sum from different perspectives In Sections 3 and 4 and give a comprehensive study of the special cases p - 3 and 5. We choose two different approaches in these sections: we illustrate the use of roots of unity In the case In which p = 3, and for p = 5 we use known results relating G5(k) to Fibonacci and Lucas numbers. We outline a generating function based method to analyze the sum In terms of a recurrent sequence in Section 2. A fairly general lemma (Lemma 7) is also given in order to provide the framework for proving divisibility properties. The reader may find it a helpful tool In obtaining divisibility properties of recurrent sequences when the coefficients follow some divisibility pat- terns (e.g., [1]). The lemma complements previous results that can be found, for example, in [11] and [13]. Theorem 1 follows by an application of Lemma 7. A similar approach yields Theorem 3: For any odd prime/? and any integer t, k _ | _J j / k \\ (-l) p- 1 p p~ l (mod/J^M, if k is divisible hyp-1, /s t (mod /?)v'y I o I mod p- 1^J), otherwise. Fleck [4] and Kapferer [7] proved the second part of Theorem 3, and Lundell [10] obtained the first part (Theorem 1.1 (ii)). Lundell has only Indicated that the proof is based on a tedious induction on [-^-J. The case / = 0, k = p(p-l) of Theorem 3 was proposed as an American Mathematical Monthly problem by Evans [3]. The proofs of Lemma 7 and Theorem 3 are given in Section 5 in which an application of Theorem 3 is also presented to prove its generalization. Theorem 4: help be an odd prime and let m be an Integer with 0<m<nin(k,p) such that r = £=a Is an integer. We set r = r p (modp) with l<r f <p.

Here we have m = 7 and r' = r = 8. Theorem 4 is a generalization of Theorem 1.7 of [10]. Note that the conditions of Theorem 4 are always satisfied for rn- 0 and 1 provided p-l\\k-m. The theorem can be generalized to the case in which p = 2 and #f = 0 or 1, also (see [8]), e.g., Some conjectures on T\"p(£) are discussed at the end of the paper. 2.

(4) m]iVJ m tsl where co = exp(2m/m) is a primitive irfi 1 wot of unity.

The ways of improving this lower bound on q have been discussed in [8]. In the general case, we set G.,(*)=s(f)(-iy.

Now we are going to determine the generating function of Gp(k) in identity (8) and deduce recurrence (9). An application of Lemma 7 to this recurrence will imply the required divisibility properties.

We sQtm = p and subtract 1 from both sides of (7), to yield We adopt the usual notation [x k]f(x) to denote the coefficient of x^in the formal power series f(x). If we multiply both sides of (8) by the denominator of the right-hand side and equate coef- ficients, we get a useful recurrence that helps us in deriving divisibility properties. Note that the right side is a polynomial of degree p-\\. For k>p?we obtain that the coefficient of x k is zero; i.e., lx k]((l-xy + xP)fdGp(i)x i=0.

The calculation of Gp(k) is more complicated for p>2. However, we can find a lower bound on vp(Gp(k)) and effectively compute Gp(k) (mod p Vp^ Gp(- k^ +l) if p-l\\k by making some observations about identity (9). We shall need the following general result. Lemma 7: Let p be an arbitrary prime. Assume that the integral sequence ak satisfies the recurrence d ak=lL bi ak-n k>d + l, and that, for some nonnegativem, vp(ad) = m>0 and the initial values ax,, i = 1,2,...,d-1, are all divisible by p m. Let vp(hd) = r>l and suppose that the coefficients &,, i = 1,2,...,d-1, are all divisible by p r. We write ad = ap m and Z^ = ]3p r, and set Then vp(ak) > f(k), and equality holds if d | k. Moreover, for any integer f > 1, we have a^ap^p\"*^ (mod p\"**). According to the lemma, there is a transparent relation between the lower bound f(k) on vp(ak) and the parameters vp(a^), vp(hd), and a? provided vp(at) ^ *w and vp(bt) >r for i = 1,2, ...9d-l. We prove Lemma 7 in Section 5. With its help, we can now prove Theorem 1.

D In the next two sections, we study the cases p = 3 and p = 5 in detail. 3. AN APPLICATION, p = 3 We set m = p = 3 and CD 3 = 1.

S(n, k)) > q by Theorem 2. 4, AN APPLICATION, p = 5 For p = 5, we can use the fact that G5(k) can be expressed explicitly in terms of Fibonacci or Lucas numbers, with the formula depending on k modulo 20, as shown by Howard and Witt [6]. 2001] 449 ON THE ORDER OF STIRLING NUMBERS AND ALTERNATING BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT SUMS (The Fibonacci numbers F„ are given by F0 - 0, Fx = 1, and Fn = Fn_l+Fn_2 for n > 2. The Lucas numbers Ln satisfy the same recurrence, but with the initial conditions L0 = 2 and Lx=l.) The power of 5 dividing a Fibonacci or Lucas number is determined by the following result [9]. Lemma 9: For all n > 0, we have v5(Z^) = v5(ri). On the other hand, Ln is not divisible by 5 for anyw. Theorem 10: If k = 5 (mod 10), then G5{k) = 0.

(13) Proof: From a result of Howard and Witt (see [6], Theorem 3.2), we find that the value of 5-L<*-0 /4J(j5(£) is given by the following table: A; mod 20 5-L<*-i)/4J<s5(]fe) A; mod 20 5-L(*-D/4JG?6(Jb) A; mod 20 5-L(*-D/4JG5(ife) k mod 20 5-L(fc-D/4JG5W 0 2£fc/2 5 0 10 -IFk/2 15 0 1 F(k+l)/2 6 - ^ f e / 2 - l 11 - £ ( f c + l ) / 2 16 £ / e / 2 - l 2 •Ffc/2+1 7 - £ ( f c - l ) / 2 12 - £ f c / 2 + l 17 F ( * - l ) / 2 3 Z/(fc-l)/2 8 - £ f c / 2 + l 13 -F{k-l)/2 18 Fk/2+l 4 £ f c / 2 - l 9 - ^ ( f c + l ) / 2 14 \"•Pfc/2-l 19 L(k+l)/2 The result then follows easily from Lemma 9. • We can now derive our main result on the divisibility of Stirling numbers by powers of 5. Theorem 11: Ifn is divisible by 4-5*, where q is sufficiently large, and k ^ 5 (mod 10), then k-l v5(k\\S(n,k)) = v5(G5(k)): \\ + T5(k), where r5(k) is given by (13). Proof: Apply Lemma 5 to Theorem 10. • Note that in Theorem 11 ony.q exceeding v5(k\\S(n, k))-1 will suffice; for instance, we can select the lower bound [-™ 1] + r5(k) -1. Our proof of Theorem 10 does not generalize to other primes, so we mention another approach that in principle does generalize, though it is not easy to apply it to primes larger than 5. 450 [NOV. ON THE ORDER OF STIRLING NUMBERS AND ALTERNATING BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT SUMS The basic Idea Is to p-sect the generating functions TkGp(k)xk. If A(x) = N(x)/D(x), where N(x) and D(x) are polynomials, then we can determine all of the p-sectlons of A(x) by multiplying the numerator and denominator,of A(x) by D(mx)D(m 2x) • •• D(a) p~ lx), where co is a primitive p^ root of unity; since D(x)D(mx) • • • D(a) p~ lx) is Invariant under substituting cox for x, It must be a polynomial In x p. For example, we find In this way that and £1 5V ' ( l - x ) 5 + x 5 l + 5 V ° + 55x20' V } where ^ 5 ( X ) = JC + X 2 + X 3 + X 4 - 5 X 6 - 2 0 X 7 - 5 5 X 8 - 1 2 5 X 9 - 2 5 0 X 1 0 + 175X11 - lOOx 12 - 375x 13 - 375x 14 + 500x 16 + 625x 17 - 1250* 19 - 2500*20. (16) Of course, once we have found these formulas, by whatever method, they may be Immediately verified. We note that In both of these generating functions the denominator Is actually a polynomial In x 2p rather than just In x p, and It is not difficult to show that this is true In general From (14), we can Immediately derive a formula for G3(k). With somewhat more difficulty, one can use (15) and (16) to determine the exact power of 5 dividing G5(k) and thereby give a different proof of Theorem 10. 5. THE PROOFS OF LEMMA 79 THEOREM 3, AND THEOREM 4 We present the proofs of a lemma and two theorems that were stated In Section 2. Proof of Lemma 7: We prove that the following two assertions hold, by induction on k: (i) vp{ak)>f{k). (ii) lfk = td, where t is a positive integer, then ak = a/?~yt+(/~1)r (mod p m+tr ). Note that (ii) implies that vp{ak) = f(k). If 1 < k <d, then these assertions are consequences of the initial conditions. Now suppose that (i) and (ii) hold for ak_d, ...,ak_l. Then the induction hypothesis implies that bflk_t Is divisi- ble by p r+f(k - j) for i = 1,2,...,d. We have r + f(k-1) >r + f(k~d) = f{k), so bflk^ is divisible by p f(k\\ and thus so is ak = bpkmml + • • • + bdak_d. This proves (i). For (II), suppose that k = td. By the Induction hypothesis, we have %-iw s a^- 2p m^- 2)r (modp m+(t- l)r) \\t-\\)d and / w ,1 td-i-l r = m + (t-l)r forl<i<d. d Thus, b<fl(t-i)d s PPr ' ^~ 2p m+(t~ 2)r = a^ lp m+(t- l)r (mod p m+tr) and 2001] 451 ON THE ORDER OF STIRLING NUMBERS AND ALTERNATING BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT SUMS vpQ )i atd-i)^tn + fr forl'<i<d. Then (ii) follows from the recurrence for ak. D We note that the lemma extends the study of situations discussed in [11] and [13] by relaxing the condition that the coefficient bd be relatively prime to the modulus. We can further generalize identity (10) and obtain the Proof of Theorem 3: Analogously to the definition of (5), we set GJk,t)= £ (/)H)' i = t(modm)^ ' for 0 < t < m-1. In a manner similar to the derivation of identity (7), for every odd in, we obtain that (l-x) m + x m Note that the degree of the numerator is m-1. It is fairly easy to modify identities (8) and (9) for Gm(k, t). An application of Lemma 7 to Gp(k, t) yields Theorem 3. We note that here hence, a = 1 (mod/?). The congruence follows from the two identities ( ? ) . 0 ( m o d „ ) , l £ , S , - l , and ( f H f r J M V ) . (We note that, for every prime/? and positive integer n, ^ _ 1 ) s ( - l ) ' i^dp) also holds.) • The interested reader may try another application of Lemma 7 to prove the following identity (cf. [1]): v2\\^n2ky) = n-l,n = l,2,.... Finally, we note that it would be interesting to find an upper bound on yp(ak)-f(k) as a function of k. The case p = 5 and k = 9, 10, or 18 (mod 20) shows that the difference can be as big as C log k with some positive constant C We conclude this section with the Proof of Theorem 4: Theorem 3 deals with the case in which m = 0, thus we may assume that m>\\. Using the identities r = f**fl(})/l and (?XO-(*X'-0 for / < i < k, we have z A:=0 (mad ni\\ V / i & t (mod m) 452 [NOV.

We shall show that under the conditions of Theorem 4, the term with l = m has the smallest exponent ofp on the right side of (17). If / = 0, then S(m9 /) = 0 in identity (17), so we need only consider the terms in which / > 1. Let xy( x) -1 if and only if y \\ x.

By a well-known formula, we have vMk-l)\\) = k-l . P . + k-l .P 2 . + • The hypotheses of Theorem 4 imply that k-m = r(p-l) = ~r f (mod p\\ where \\<r f <p and m<r f. It follows that [ ^ + / ] is constant for i = 0,1,...,r'-1; i.e., \\^~\\ is constant for l = m, m-l,...,m-r' + l. Since r' > /w, this implies that [-^-J is constant for 1 < / < m. Similarly, I *0-1 is constant for 1 < / < m. Therefore, vp((k - /)!) is constant for 1 < / < /w. Next, we show that * - / .P-1J -XP-i(k-I)> k-m P-IJ •Xp-i(k-m), \\<l<m. (18) Since / ? - l divides £ - / « , A - / is not divisible by p-\\ for l-m-l, tn-2, ..., m-p + 2, and since m < p, this implies all cases of (18) except m = p, 1=1. In this case, we have k-l p-y .Z(k-!) = ! + k-p .P-l. -Zp-itf-p), and thus (18) holds in this case also. The proof is now complete. • We note that the generating function of the sum on the left-hand side of (17) can be derived by binomial inversion [5] in terms of Eulerian polynomials. 6. CONJECTURES Empirical evidence suggests that formulas for rp(k) exist based on the residue of k modulo p(p - 1) . The following conjectures have been proved only in the cases p = 3 and p = S. Conjecture 1: (a) Ifk is divisible by 2p but not by p(p -1), then rp(k) = vp(k). (h) Ifk+'l is divisible by 2p but not by p(p -1), then rp(k) = vp(k +1). 2001] 453 ON THE ORDER OF STIRLING NUMBERS AND ALTERNATING BINOMIAL COEFFICIENT SUMS Conjecture 2: For each odd prime p, there is a set A c {1,2,..., p(p -1) -1} such that, if k ^ 0 or -1 (mod 2p) and k is not an odd multiple of/?, then rp(k) > 0 if and only if k is congruent mod- ulo p(p -1) to an element of A . It usually seems to be true under the conditions of Conjecture 2 that, for each / eAp, there exists some integer w . such that, if k=i (mod p(p-1)), then rp{k) s v (£ + ^ f). For example, Theorem 7 asserts that the conjectures hold for p = 3, with ^43=0, and Theorem 8 asserts that the conjectures hold for p = 5 with A5 = {18} and u518 = 2. Empirical evidence suggests that A1 = {16}, with ull6 = 75. Here are the empirical values of Ap for primes /? from 11 to 23. 4 1 = {14,18,73,81,93}, Al3 = {82,126,148}, Al7 = {37,39,62,121,179,230,234}, Al9 = {85,117,119,156,196,201,203,244,279,295,299,316,320,337}, A23 = {72,128,130,145,148,170,171,188,201,210,211,232,233,234,317,325,378,466}.

THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 331 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS Marjorle Bicknell-Johnson 665 Fairlane Avenue, Santa Clara, CA 95051 Daniel C. Fielder School of Electrical and Computer Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA 30332-0250 (Submitted October 1999-Final Revision February 2000) 1. INTRODUCTION Let 4 be the least number having exactly n representations as a sum of distinct Fibonacci numbers. Let R(N) denote the number of representations of N as sums of distinct Fibonacci numbers., and let Zeck N denote the Zeckendorf representation of N, which is the unique repre- sentation of JVas a sum of distinct, nonconsecutive Fibonacci Numbers. The sequence {4} is sequence A013583 studied earlier [7], [9], where we list the first 330 terms; here, we extend our computer results by pencil and logic to calculate A33l and other \"missing values.\" We list some pertinent background information. Theorem 1: The least integer having Fk representations is (Fk) 2 - 1 , and Fk is the largest value for R(N) for N in the interval F2k_2 < N < F2k_l. Theorem 2: Let iVbe an integer written in Zeckendorf form; if N = Fn+k +K, Fn<K < Fn+l, we can write R(N) by using the appropriate formula: R(N)=R(Fn+2p+K) = pR(K)+R(Fn+l-k-2l k = 2p; (1.1) R(N) = R(Fn+2p+l +K) = (p + l)R(K), k = 2p + l; (1.2) R(N)=R(N-F2w)+R(F2w+l~N-2lF2w<N<F2w+l. (1.3) Theorem 3: Zeck 4 ends in .. .+F2c, c > 2. If Zeck N ends in .. .+F2c+2k+i + F2c, c > 2, then R(N)=R(N -l)R(F2c) = cR(N ~l). If Zeck 4 , = Fm +K, then Fm<An<Fm -f Fm„2. Lemma 1: If {bj is a seqitence of natural numbers such that bn+2 = bn+l +bn9 then R(hr}-i)=R(hn+l-i) = k for all sufficiently large n (see [8]). Lemma 1 and Theorem 3 are usefiil in calculating 4 when n is composite. Theorems 2 and 3 are proved in [2] and [3], while Theorem 1 is the main result of [1]. Theorem 4: If n = R(An) is a prime, then Zeck 4 'M the sum of even-subscripted Fibonacci numbers only. If Zeck 4 begins with /^ + 1, then n - R(AJ cannot be prime. 2001] 455 THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 3 3 1 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS Proof: Theorem 3 and (1.2) show that a change in parity in subscripts indicates that at least one pair of factors exists for R(N). Lemma 2: For integers N such that F2k< A„<N < F2k+l and R(N) - n, F^R^-F^RiF^-N-l^RiF^-An-l)^. (1.4) Proof: The pair of exterior endpoints are a consequence of Theorem 1. The pair of interior endpoints reflect symmetry about the center of the interval, since R(N) is a palindromic sequence within each such interval F2k<N < F2k+l - 2. If Zeck n = Fk+K9 0<K<Fk_2, then 4, >F2k_t, where we note that we are relating the Zeckendorf representations of A^ and of RiA^). In our extensive tables, Zeck An begins with F2k-u F2k> Fik+v o r Fik+2> w h i l e a11 v a l u e s f o r n> l<n = R(N)<Fk, appear for N<F2k+l, but this has not been proved. The first 330 values for An are listed in [7], too long a table to repeat here. Our computer results conclude with A466 = 229971; there are 69 \"missing values' 1 for ri between 330 and 466. We also have complete tables for R(N) for all N <F22, not included here, which shorten the work but are not essential to follow the logic in solving for An given n. 2* THE CALCULATION OF ^3 3 1 Since An '1S known for all n < 330 and, for all n such that An < F2%, and since 331 is prime, we can find A33l by listing successive addends for Zeck An, a nd choosing the smallest possibility at each step. Let N = F2S+lC, for F2%_2q <K<F29_2q. Then R(N) = qR(K)+R(F29„2q-K~2) (2.1) by (1.1), and the maximum possible value for R(N) is max R(N) = qFl5_g+Fl4_g by Theorem 1. Since F2k< A„<F2k + F2k_2,2<q. We summarize in Table 1. <7 = 2: q = 3: q = 4: q = 5: Notice that maximum values for R(N) for q>5 are smaller than 331. For our purposes, the smallest possibility is q = 4, or N = F2g +F20 + K. We write Table 2 to determine the third pos- sible even subscript in Zeck N when q = 4. Start with w = 3 in Table 2, the smallest possibility, with F14 < K < F15. Solve the Diophan- tine equation 14^ + 55 = 331, 1 3 < ^ < 2 1 , which has 14(19) + 5(13) = 331. By Lemma 2, since A19 = F14 + A1,7<B = R(Fl5-K-2)<\\9-7 = 12. Thus, 5 * 1 3 a n d w * 3 .

THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 3 3 1 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS TABLE 2 ^20-2w ^ % < F2l-2w R(N) = (5w-l)R(K) + 5R(F2l_2w-K-2) maxR(Ny(5w-l)Fn_w+5Fl0„w w = 1: 4Fl0 + 5F9 = 220 +170 = 390 w = 2: 9F9+5F8 = 306 + 105 = 411 w = 3: 14F8+5F7 = 294 + 65 = 359 w = 4: 19F7+5F6 = 247 + 40 = 287 Next take w = 2 in Table 2, with Fl6 < K < F17, and solve 9A + 5B = 331, 21 < A < 34, which has 9(34) + 5(5) = 331, but A34 = Fl6 + Al3, so that we must have 13 < B < 21; B = 5 is too small. We also find 9(29)+ 5(14) = 331, which is plausible since A29 = 1050 = F16 + ^ , and 8 < 5 = 14 < 21. However, this combination of values does not appear in the computer printouts; only # = 1050, 1152, 1189 have R(N) = 29 for N<Fl6 + 'Fl4, so B = 8, 21, 18, 11, 17, or 12, but not 14. However, we can verify that 2? ** 14 either by assuming that the next term is Fl4 and calculat- ing one more step, or by noting that we are solving A = R(K) = 29 for some K which also has R(Fl7-K-2) = l4 and R(K~Fl6) = 29-\\4 = l5. We must have K-F16 >Al5 =F 1 3+F 8+F 4 or K = Fl6+Fl4 + K\\ Then, because Fl7-K-2 = Fl3-K f-2< Al4 = Fu + 16, we cannot have R(Fl7 -K-2) = 14 = B, a contradiction. The last viable solution 9(24) + 5(23) = 331 has B too large. Thus, w ^ 2 . Finally, take w = 1, with Fls<K<Fl9. Solve 4.4 + 55 = 331 for 3 4 < ^ < 5 5 , obtaining 4(49)+ 5(27) = 331 and 4(44)+ 5(31) = 331, where 4(39)+ 5(35) = 331 has 5 too large. From the computer printout, A44 = Fls + 4 2 = 2744, but R(Fl9 - 2744 - 2) = 32, not 31. The next occur- rence of R(K) = 44 in our computer table is for K= 2791 for which 31 = R(Fl9 - 2791 - 2); and since 2791 is the smallest integer that satisfies all of the parameters, we have a solution. Without such a table, one could assume that\" Fls is the next term, and compute the term following Fls. We now have 4 3 1 = F28 + F20 + 2791 = 327367. Let us make use of our work thus far. In Table 2, w = 3 has 14Fs + 5F7 = 359, one of the \"missing values.\" Since we cannot write a smaller solution, 4*59 = ^28 + ^ o + 42i = 317811 + 6765 + 440 = 325016. Also, Table 1, q = 4, N = F2S + (F20 + K) has R(N) = 359 for 4(76) + 55 = 359, or for N = F2% + A76 = 317811 + 7205, which gives the same result. 3, THE CALCULATION OF A339 The second missing value on our list is 339. We can find A339 with very little effort, although 339 = 3• 113 is not a prime. Since All3 = F24+K, N = F2B + F23 + • • • has R(N) = 3i?(F23 + • • •), and AU3 is too large to appear as the second factor. Now, taking q = 4, for N = F2S + (F20+K), 4(74) + 43 = 339, and ,474 = 8187 while R(F2l-8187-2) = J?(2757) = 43; in fact, 2757 = A43. Then N=A,39=Fin + A7d = 317811 + 8187 = 325998. lOOl] 457 THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 3 3 1 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS We have also generated ^ = ^ + 4 ^ =317811 + 7920 = 325731 which has i?(JV) = 411 from Table 1, q = 4, while Table 2, w = 2, gives A4ll = F2S + F20 +A34 which is the same result. Just as for 339, while we can factor 411 = 3-137, Al37 is too large! Again from Table 2, w = 2, changing A and B slightly, we find 9F9 + 5F7 = 371, also on our list. If we take K = 1427=F16+F14+F10+F6, then R(K) = 34, R(F21-K-2) = 13; the only other value for K in this interval such that R(K) = 34 is A34 but R(F2l- 434 - 2 ) = 21, so 1427 is the smallest we can take for K. Thus, we write 4m = ^28 + ^20 + 1 4 2 7 = 326003. We next illustrate how to use factoring to find 4* when n is composite, using Lemma 1 and Theorem 3. Let n = 410 = 41-10: 4 0 = 105 = FU + F7+F4, 4 i = 2736 = F18+F12+F6, 41 = R(Fls + Fl2+F6+Fl-l)=R(F2S + F22+Fl6+Fn-l), 4h\\0 = R(F2S + F22+F16 + Al0). N = F2S+F22 +Fl6+Fn+F7 +F4 = 336614 has R(N) = 410. Writing R(N) as 205-2 gives the same solution, while 82 • 5 gives a slightly larger solution. N = A4l0 if there is no smaller solution using the even subscript formula. We can easily see that N^F2S+F2Q+K from our earlier work, so we test out N = F2S + F22 + K in Table 3. TABLES N = F2S+F22+K, F22_2p<K<F23_2p R(N) = (4p-l)R(K)+4R(F23_2p-K-2) tmxR(Ny(4p-l)Fl2_p+4Fn_p p = l: 3Fn + 4F10 = 267 + 220 = 487 p = 2: 7F10 +4F9 = 385 +136 = 521 p = 3: 1LF9 + 4F8 = 374 + 84 = 458 p = 4: 15F8+4F7 = 315 + 52 = 367 p = 5: \\9Fj+4F6 = 247 + 24 = 271 The smallest choice to generate 410 is p-3 for Fl6<K<Fl7 which requires that we solve 114+45 = 410 for ^ < 3 4 which, in turn, gives us 11(30)+ 4(20) = 410; 430 = 1092 = F16 +105 and R(Fl7 - A30 - 2) = 20, so that 4^0=^28+^22+^16+ 105, the same result as by factoring. Note that Table 3 provides more \"missing values\" on our list. Here, p = 4 gives R(N) = 367 for N- F2% + F22 + 4n> which easily demonstrates that N&F2S+F20+K, so 4367 = 335962, the same result as A367 = F2g + A$7 by working with Table 1, q = 3. Furthermore, 458 [NOV. THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 3 3 1 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS ^458 = i 728 + 4 2 3 = 3 1 7 8 1 1 + 1 8 8 6 6 = 3 3 6 6 7 7 comes from q = 3 of Table 1, and A m = F2% + F22 + A34 comes from p = 3 above. We expect to see all \"missing values' 1 n < Fl4 = 377 appearing for N = F2S+K based on our previous experience, but we have been unable to prove that all n=R(N), \\<n<Fk, will appear for N = F2k+K. Generating some of them will take patience, especially for a value such as w = 421 which has no solution for An = F28 +K. One can generate more tables such as Table 4 similarly to Tables 1 through 3, or one can list possible successive subscripts for Zeck An and evaluate each case. Some results, verifiable in other ways, can be read from the tables. From Table 4. below, we have ^610=^28+^24 + ^ 9 a n d 4)42 = ^ 2 8 + ^ 2 4 + 4>5- However, A555 = A6l0 + 5 < ^28 + ^24 + 4 44- Table 1 gives 4*10 = ^28 + 4>33 ( t h e S a m e r e S u l t) a n d 4>21 = -^28 + ^144 • Table 3 gives 4*87 ~ ^ 8 + ^ 2 + AP a n d 42 I ~ ^ 8 + ^ 2 + 4 s ( ^ same result). Table 4 gives R(N) = 333 for N-F2S+ F24 + A2l, where Zeck N uses only even-subscripted Fibonacci numbers, but A333 = 209668<N. One must verify that N is the smallest possible, especially if R(N) is composite. TABLE 4 N = F2% + F24 + K, F24_2p <K<F25_2p R(N) = (3p - l)R(K) + 3R(F25_2p -K-2) maxi?(#): (3p-l)Fl3_p + 3Fl2_p p = l: 2F12+3FU = 288 + 267 = 555 p = 2: 5F1S + 3F10 = 445 + 165 = 610 p = 3: 8F10 + 3F9 = 440 +102 = 542 p = 4: 11F9 +43F8 = 374 + 63 = 437 p = 5: 14F8 + 3F7 = 294 + 39 = 333 By constructing N taking one even-subscripted Fibonacci number at a time, one can find A n for n prime, ?i<466; some solutions are very short, while others take patience. Prime values for n in Table 5 can be found for N = F2$ + K except for n = 421, 439, and 461, which need N = F30+K. The composites n for which An >F2% + K, found by considering factors of n, need N = F29+K. Note that only the subscripts in Zeck An are listed in Table 5. The calculations of An for n prime and of An9 where Zeck An has even subscripts only agree with D. Englund [4], [5], and with computations using \"Microsoft Excel\" by M. Johnson. Of the composites n = R(A„), where An contains an odd-subscripted term, there are very many cases to consider and thus checking is more difficult. Each composite n starred in the table can be com- puted from its factors and has An<N, where R(N) = n and Zeck N contains even-subscripted Fibonacci numbers only. 2001] 459 THE LEAST NUMBER HAVING 3 3 1 REPRESENTATIONS AS A SUM OF DISTINCT FIBONACCI NUMBERS TABLE 5. \"Missing Values\" for JI, 331 < n = R(N) < 465 n prime n composite n 331 347 349 353 359 367 373 379 383 389 397 401 409 419 421 431 433 439 443 449 457 461 463 An 327367 336067 339528 338185 325016 335962 336588 338690 338638 336944 342688 338648 343476 338656 839994 343714 343426 841557 343447 367292 367923 851181 338562 ZeckAn 28,20,18,12,10,6 28,22,14,12,8,4 28,22,18,16,14,10,4 28,22,18,10,8,4 28,20,14,10,6 28,22,14,10,6 28,22,16,10,8,4 28,22,18,14,12,10,6 28,22,18,14,12,6,4 28,22,16,14,10,4 28,22,20,14,8,4 28,22,18,14,12,8 28,22,20,16,12,10,4 28,22,18,14,12,8,6 30,20,16,12,10,4 28,22,20,16,14,10,8 28,22,20,16,12,6 30,20,18,12,8,4 28,22,20,16,12,8,6 28,24,18,14,12,6 28,24,18,16,12,8,6 30,22,16,14,10,6,4 28,22,18,14,10,8,4 n 339 371 381 391 394 396* 402* 404* 406 407 410* 411 412* 413 415 417 422 423* 425 426 427 428* 429* 430 434 435* 436* 437 438 444* 446 447* 448* 450* 451* 452* 453 454* 455* 456* 458 459* 460* 462* 464* 465 4. 325998 326003 339533 336674 343709 337224 336690 343722 336661 338258 336614 325731 365326 336716 339300 336682 371960 338580 338279 336949 372015 372468 337287 338635 339156 338363 338266 343337 338512 339253 367957 530063 338643 338829 544635 527110 371350 526877 340426 338520 336677 544580 343434 337389 338376 338274 ZeckAn 28,20,16,14,10,4 28,20,16,14,10,6 28,22,18,16,14,10,6 28,22,16,12,8 28,22,20,16,14,10,4 28,22,17,11,7,4 28,22,16,12,9,4 28,22,20,16,14,10,7,4 28,22,16,12,6 28,22,18,12,6 28,22,16,11,7,4 28,20,16,12,8,4 28,24,16,12,7,4 28,22,16,12,10,6 28,22,18,16,12,10,6 28,22,16,12,8,6 28,24,20,16,8,6 28,22,18,14,11,6 28,22,18,12,8,6 28,22,16,14,10,6 28,24,20,16,10,8,6 28,24,20,16,14,12,7,4 28,22,17,12,8,4 28,22,18,14,12,6 28,22,18,16,10,6 28,22,18,13,8,4 28,22,18,12,7,4 28,22,20,16,10,6 28,22,18,14,8,6 28,22,18,16,12,7,4 28,24,18,16,12,10,6 29,21,19,15,11,6 28,22,18,14,12,7,4 28,22,18,15,11,8,4 29,23,17,12,6 29,21,17,13,11,7,4 28,24,20,14,8,6 29,21,17,11,7,4 28,22,19,15,11,8,4 28,22,18,14,9,4 28,22,16,12,8,4 29,23,17,11,6 28,22,20,16,12,7,4 28,22,17,13,9,4 28,22,18,13,9,4 28,22,18,12,8,4 460 [NOV.

HAPPY NUMBERS Let S2 : Z + -> Z + denote the function that takes a positive integer to the sum of the squares of its digits. More generally, for e > 2 and 0 < at < 9, define Se by ( n \\ n V/=o / /=o A positive integer a is a happy number if, when 82 is applied to a iteratively, the resulting sequence of integers (which we will call the S2-sequence of a) eventually reaches 1. Thus a is a happy number if and only if there exists some m>0 such that S2(a) = 1. For example, 13 is a happy number since *Sf (13) = 1. Notice that 4 is not a happy number. Its S2 -sequence is periodic with 5f (4) = 4. It is simple to verify that every positive integer less than 100 either is a happy number or has an $2-sequence that enters the cyclic £2-sequence of 4. It can further be shown that, for each positive integer a> 100, S2(a) <a. This leads to the following well-known theorem. (See [2] for a complete proof.) Theorem 1: Given a e Z +, there exists n > 0 such that S2(a) = 1 or 4. Generalizing the concept of a happy number, we say that a positive integer a is a cubic happy number if its ^-sequence eventually reaches 1. We note that a positive integer can be a cubic happy number only if it is congruent to 1 modulo 3. This follows immediately from the following lemma. Lemma 2: Given a e Z +, for all m, $3 m(a) = a (mod 3). Proof: Let a - Zf=0a|.10 /, 0 < at < 9. Using the fact that, for each i, af = at (mod 3) and Iff = 1 (mod 3), we get V=o J /=o /=o /=o Thus, by a simple induction argument, we get that, for all M G Z + , S™(a) = a (mod 3). • The fixed points and cycles of S3 are characterized in Theorem 3, which can be found without proof in [1]. Theorem 3: The fixed points of ^3 are 1, 153, 370, 371, and 407; the cycles are 136 -> 244 -» 136, 919-> 1459 -> 919, 55 -> 250 -> 133 -> 55, and 160-» 217 -> 352 ->160. Further, for any positive integer a: 462 [NOV. GENERALIZED HAPPY NUMBERS • If a s 0 (mod 3), then there exists an m such that S™(a) = 153. • If a = 1 (mod 3), then there exists an m such that S™(a) = 1,55,136,160,370, or 919. • If a = 2 (mod 3), then there exists an m such that ^ ( a ) = 371 or 407. Note that the second part of the theorem follows from the first half and Lemma 2. Rather than prove the first part here, we state and prove a generalization of Theorems 1 and 3 in the following section. 2. VARIATIONS OF BASE By expressing numbers in different bases, we can generalize happy numbers even further. Fix h>2. Let a = ZU^ with 0<a,<b~l. Let e>2. We then define the function ^ : Z + ~ » Z + b y V/=o J /=o If an Se^b sequence reaches 1, we call a an e-power Chappy number. Theorem. 4: For all e > 2, every positive integer is an e-power 2-happy number. Proof: Fix e. Let a - Zf=0 at2\\ 0 < at < 1, an > 0. Then /=o J = 0 /=0 1=0 /=0 Note that none of the terms can be negative. Thus, if « > 1 , a-Sea{a)>Q. So, for a * l , $e,i^ a) <a- w i t h tWs fact> il: i s easy to prove by induction that every positive integer is an e-power 2-happy number. D Again, we ask: What are the fixed points and cycles generated when these functions are iterated? We give the answers for S2tb, 2 < b < 10, in Table 1 and for SXb9 2 < b < 10, in Table 2. TABLE 1.

Theorem 5 asserts that the tables are, in fact, complete. Theorem 5: Tables 1 and 2 give all of the fixed points and cycles of S2fb and S3J), respectively, for2<6<10. The proof of Theorem 5 uses the same techniques as the proof of Theorem 1 given in [2]. First, we find a value Nfor which Setb(a) < a for all a > N. This implies that, for each a e Z +, there exists some MGZ+ such that S%b(a) < N. Then a direct calculation for each a < N com- pletes the process and Theorem 5 is proven. Lemma 6 provides an Nfoi e = 2 and all bases b > 2 while Lemma 8 does the same for e = 3. Lemma 6: Ifb>2 and a>b 2, then S2 b(a)< a. Proof: Let a = Z?=0 off. We have i=0 1=0 /=0 Every term in the final sum is positive with the possible exception of the / = 0 term which is at least (b -1)(1 -(b-1)). It is not difficult to show that the i = n term is minimal if an = 1. From 464 [NOV. GENERALIZED HAPPY NUMBERS a>b 2 = I00(b), It follows that n>2. So the i = n term Is at least 1 (ft 2~ 1). Thus, a-S2 b(a)> b 2-l + (b-l)(l-(b-l))=3b-3>0y$mc®b>2. Hence, forall a>ft2, Sxb(a) <a. D Using Induction, Corollary 7 is Immediate. Corollary 7: For each a e Z*, there is an m e Z + such that S£ft(a) < *2 • This completes the argument for e = 2. Now we consider e = 3. Lemmm 8: If b > 2 and a > 2b 3, then 5 ^ (a) < a. Proof: The proof of Theorem 4 gives an even stronger result for b = 2, so we will assume b > 2. Using the notation from above, we have j=0 1=0 J = 0 The / = 0 term is at least (b -1)(1 - (ft -1)2) and the i = 1 term is at least (b -l)(ft - (b -1) 2). The remaining terms are all nonnegative. Since a > 2b 3 = 2000(^, n > 3 and if n = 3, then a3 > 2. So, if w = 3, the an term is at least 2(ft3-4). If w>3, then the an term is at least ft 4-l>2(ft 3-4). Thus, a - ^ & ( a ) ^ ^ ( ^ - a g ) + o i ( f t - ^ ) + a b ( l - f l g ) >2(i 3~4) + (*-l)(&-(*-l) 2) + (A~l)(l~(i-l) 2) = 7ft2-6ft--7>0 since 5 > 2. Hence, for all a > 2ft 3, 5^ 6(a) < a. D Corollary* 9: For each a e Z +, there Is an m e Z* such that S™b(a) < 2h 3. Theorem 5 now follows from a direct calculation of the 52^-sequences for all a <b2 and the £3> 4-sequences for all a < 2b 3. These calculations are easily completed with a computer. • We conclude with two general theorems concerning congruences. If, for given e9 ft, and 4 S™b(a) s a (mod d) for all a and m, then, as in Lemma -2, all e-power ft-happy numbers must be congruent to 1 modulo d. Thus, the following theorems yield a great deal of information con- cerning generalized happy numbers. In particular, bounds on the densities of the numbers are immediate. Theorem 10: Let/? be prime and let ft s 1 (mod/?). Then, for any a e Z* and m e Z 4\", Sptb(a) s a (mod/?). Proof: Let a = Zfs0<*$• % Format, af s a, (mod/?) for all i. Thus, \\/ SQ / /«o /«o /«o Using Induction, we see that, for all m e Z 4\", Sptb(a) a a (mod/?). • Corollary 11: If a is a (2-power) ft-happy number with ft odd, then a must be odd. In general, if a Is a/y-power ft-happy number with ft s 1 (mod/?) for some prime/?, then a s 1 (mod/?). 2001] 465 GENERALIZED HAPPY NUMBERS Theorem 12: Let b = l (mod gcd(6,6-l)). Then, for any A G Z + and / M G Z + , Sgb(a) = a (mod gcd(6, * - ! ) ) . Proof: Let a = EJLo aff and <i = gcd(6, b -1). If rf = 1, then the theorem is vacuous. For d = 2, note that a3 = a (mod 2). Since & = 1 (mod 2), we have <M«)= s3JiaA=z ^ * i> * 2><* j=a (mod 2 >> Vi=o y i=o /=o i=o and induction completes the argument. The case d = 3 is immediate from Theorem 10. Finally, d = 6 follows from the cases d = 2 and d = 3. • ACKNOWLEDGMENTS H. G.

A \"Constant\" Search B-913 Proposed by Herbert & Wilf, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA (Vol 39, no. 1, February 2001) Fix an integer k > 1. The Fibonacci numbers satisfy an \"accelerated\" recurrence of the form Fn2 k = ak F(n-i)2 k ~ F(n-2)2 k (^ = 2? 3> •••) with FQ = 0 and F2& to start the recurrence. For example, when * = 1, we have F2n = 3F2(r^l) - F ^ 2 ) (n = 2,3,....; F0 = 0; F2 = 1). a.

Solution by K Gauihier, Kingston, ON Case a is deduced from Case b by setting h = 0 and m = 2 k for * a positive integer, so we solve Case b only. The sought answer is flm = Lm for values of n such that m{n -1)+A * 0; for m(n - 1 ) + h = 0, fim can be arbitrary but finite, since F0 = 0.

A-Response to Gairthierf8 Comments on the Brackman Conjecture A Comment by Paul Bruckman First, I would like to make a slight correction. Although I appreciate being referred to as \"Professor Bruckman, ff I must regretfully inform the world that I am no longer teaching math, having returned to consulting work for a private firm. Secondly, I am sincerely flattered to have my name associated with a certain set of polyno- mials (the Pr(ri) of Dr. Gauthier fs note). Before accepting this honor, however, I would like to be sure that these polynomials are indeed new in the literature; I would be loath to usurp someone else ss rightful niche in mathematical history. 1 am grateful to Dr. Gauthier for pointing out the corrected version of my conjecture. 1 might have discovered this for myself, had 1 taken the time and effort to develop the correct poly- nomial expressions, as Dr. Gauthier has obviously done. It should be mentioned that there is an advanced problem proposed by Dr. Gauthier (H-568) in the last issue [Hie Fibonacci Quarterly 38.5 (2000):473; corrected 39.1 (2001):91-92] which \"20011 471 ELEMENTARY PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS is highly interesting and bears some superficial resemblance to my problem B-871 [37*1 (1999): 85]. However, unlike the polynomials Pr(n)9 the \"Gauthier functions\" fm(n) are rational func- tions. I have submitted my solution for Problem H-568 to the Advanced Problems Editor. The remainder of this letter is devoted to indicating some of my subsequent research in response to Dr. Gauthier's comments. Following Gauthier's notation, we may define the functions Pr(ri) as follows: w-ffitfty-tr 1. (i) As Dr. Gauthier correctly pointed out, what I should have originally conjectures was: Pr(n) is a polynomial in n of degree r (2) (that is, leaving out the erroneous modifier \"monic\"). Actually, we can prove a somewhat stronger result than (2), namely: Pr{n) is a polynomial in n of degree r, with its first two leading terms given by Pr(ii) = ( r - l ) ! ^ - ( r - 2 ) ( ; j i r 1 + .... (3) Towards this end, we first demonstrate that the Pr(n) %s satisfy the recurrence relation: Pr+l&) = n 2(Pr(n)-Pr(n-l)\\ r = l,2,.... (4) By means of (4), with Pt(n) = n, we readily obtain the expressions for Pr(n) indicated by Gauthier in his note, for r = 1,2,3,4,5. The proof of (4) is straightforward, following from the definition of the Pr(ri). In turn, (4) implies (3), as can be demonstrated by induction. What appears to be a more difficult problem is to obtain a general expansion (for all the terms) of Pr(n). Once obtained, this might reveal other properties of the Pr(n), and may possibly demonstrate that they are special cases of well-studied polynomials with known properties. If it should turn out that these are indeed new polynomials, they may be expected to yield additional research and should generate further interest in their properties. It already seems inter- esting enough that the special form given in the definitions of the polynomials Pr(n) and fm{ri) (as given in Dr. Gauthier's note and in H-568, respectively) should yield polynomial functions and rational functions, respectively. 472 [NOV.
