The two pairs of consecutive natural numbers (8, 9) and (288, 289) have the following property: in each pair, each number contains each of its prime factors to a power not less than 2. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many such pairs of consecutive natural numbers. Solution: Given a pair (a, a + 1) satisfying the conditions of the problem, we claim that (4a(a + 1), 4a(a + 1) + 1) = (4a(a + 1), (2a + 1)2) does too. Indeed, any prime factor of 4a(a + 1) must divide 4, a or a + 1, and will divide this to a power not less than 2; and any prime factor of (2a + 1) 2 must divide it to an even power, hence to a power at least 2. Since 4a(a + 1) > a, and we know there is at least one solution (8, 9), this gives us an inﬁnite sequence of solutions. 2. Suppose that N is a positive integer such that there are exactly 2005 ordered pairs (x, y) of positive integers satisfying 1 x + 1 y = 1 N . Prove that N is a perfect square. Solution: The given equation is equivalent to (x + y)N = xy, which we may rewrite as (x − N )(y − N ) = N 2. Since x and y are positive we have 1/x < 1/x + 1/y = 1/N , so x > N , and similarly for y. Therefore x − N , y − N are both positive, and it follows that solutions to the given equation are in 1-1 correspondence with factorisations of N 2 as N 2 = ab. Let N = pα1 1 · · · pαk k be the prime factorisation of N , where we assume that αi ≥ 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. Then N 2 has ∏k i=1(2αi + 1) factors, so we must have k∏ i=1(2αi + 1) = 2005 = 5 × 401 (note that 5 and 401 are both prime). Thus either k = 1 and α1 = 1002, or k = 2 and without loss of generality α1 = 2, α2 = 200. Thus either N = p1002 1 = (p501 1 ) 2 or N = p2 1p200 2 = (p1p100 2 ) 2, and in either case N is square. 1 3. Find all quadruples (a, b, p, n) of positive integers such that p is prime and a3 + b3 = pn. Solution: Suppose ﬁrst that a and b have a common factor d > 1. Then a = a′d, b = b′d for positive integers a′, b ′, and a3 + b3 = d 3(a′3 + b′3) = pn, so d must be a power of p. Writing d = pt we have a′3 + b′3 = pn−3t, and since a′3 + b′3 is a positive integer greater than 1 it must be the case that n − 3t is positive. Thus, if a and b have a common factor, then (a, b, p, n) = (pta′, p tb′, p, m + 3t), where (a′, b ′, p, m) is a solution with gcd(a′, b ′) = 1. Conversely, if (a, b, p, n) is a solution then so is (pta, p tb, p, n + 3t), so it suﬃces to ﬁnd the solutions for which gcd(a, b) = 1. We therefore assume that gcd(a, b) = 1. First note that we can factor the given equation as (a + b)(a2 − ab + b2) = pn, and since a, b are positive integers, we have a+b ≥ 2, so p|(a+b). In addition, a2−ab+b2 = (a − b) 2 + ab, so either a = b = 1, or a2 − ab + b2 ≥ 2. If a2 − ab + b2 ≥ 2 then p is a divisor of both a + b and a2 − ab + b2, hence also of (a + b)2 − (a2 − ab + b2) = 3ab. This means that either p = 3, or p is a divisor of ab. However, if p|ab then either p|a or p|b, and since also p|(a + b), this implies p divides both a and b. This contradicts our assumption that a and b have no common factor, so either a = b = 1, or p = 3. If a = b = 1 then we get the unique solution (1, 1, 2, 1), so it remains to consider the case p = 3. In this case a2 − ab + b2 ≥ 2, so we must have a2 − ab + b2 = 3s for some s ≥ 1. We will show that our assumption that gcd(a, b) = 1 forces s = 1. Indeed, suppose that 3 2|(a2 − ab + b2). Then, since 3|(a + b), we have that 32 divides (a2 − ab + b2) − (a + b) 2 = 3ab, so 3|ab. But by the same argument as above this implies 3 divides both a and b, contradicting our assumption that gcd(a, b) = 1. So under this assumption we must have a2 − ab + b2 = 3. We now have 3 = a2 −ab+b2 = (a−b) 2 +ab, so either (a−b) 2 = 0, ab = 3, or (a−b)2 = 1, ab = 2. The former case has no solution, and in the latter we have either a = 1, b = 2 or a = 2, b = 1. So ﬁnally we have exactly three solutions with gcd(a, b) = 1, namely (1, 1, 2, 1), (1, 2, 3, 2) and (2, 1, 3, 2), and by the ﬁrst paragraph all solutions are given by • (2 t, 2 t, 2, 3t + 1), • (3 t, 2 · 3 t, 3, 3t + 2), • (2 · 3 t, 3 t, 3, 3t + 2), for t a non-negative integer. 2 4. Does there exist a function f : N → N such that f (f (n)) = n 2 for all values of n? Solution: Yes, such a function does exist, and there are many ways to construct one. Here are several ways to do it. Construction 1. Let p1, p2, p3, . . . be the sequence of prime numbers, and set f (1) = 1, f (p2k−1) = p2k, and f (p2k) = p2 2k−1 for all k ≥ 1. Furthermore, if n has prime factorisation n = pα1 1 pα2 2 · · · , where αi ≥ 0 for all i, we set f (n) = f (p1)α1f (p2) α2 · · · . Then f (f (n)) = f (pα1 2 p2α2 1 pα3 4 p2α4 3 · · · ) = p2α1 1 p2α2 2 · · · = n2 for every positive integer n, as required. Construction 2. Let a1, a2, a3, . . . be the sequence of numbers that are not square. Then each positive integer n ≥ 2 may be written uniquely in the form n = a2k i , and we deﬁne f (1) = 1, f (a2k 2j−1) = a2k 2j , f (a2k 2j ) = a2k+1 2j−1. It’s straightforward to check that this works. Construction 3. Each number may be written uniquely in the form n = a2 + b, where 0 ≤ b ≤ 2a (here a is simply ⌊√ n⌋. Using this representation we deﬁne f for n ≥ 2 by f (n) = f (a2 + b) =  | | a2 + b + 1 if b is odd, (a2 + b − 1)2 if b > 0 is even, (f (a)) 2 if b = 0 (of course we must have f (1) = 1). This deﬁnes the same function as in the previous construction, but now we need to argue by induction that the function has been deﬁned for all n (in particular, we need to check that it has been deﬁned for fourth powers). Construction 4. It suﬃces to construct a function g : N ∪ {0} → N ∪ {0} such that g(g(n)) = 2n for all n, because then we may deﬁne f on prime factorisations by f (pα1 1 pα2 2 · · · pαk k ) = pg(α1) 1 pg(α2) 2 · · · pg(αk) k . Clearly g(0) must be 0. To deﬁne g for n ≥ 1 we write each positive integer in the form n = 2 kℓ, where ℓ is odd, and deﬁne g(2k(4m + 1)) = 2 k(4m + 3), g(2k(4m + 3)) = 2 k+1(4m + 1). It’s easy to check that this works. 3 5. Let f (n) = 1 + n + n2 + · · · + n 2010. Prove that for every integer m with 2 ≤ m ≤ 2010, there is no non-negative integer n such that f (n) is divisible by m. Solution: Assume that m divides f (n) for some integer n and 2 ≤ m ≤ 2010. As f (1) = 2011 and 2011 is a prime number, m cannot divide f (1), so we may assume n ̸= 2. In this case we can write f (n) as f (n) = n2011 − 1 n − 1 . Let p be a prime divisor of m. Then we have p | f (n) | n2011 − 1, which results in n 2011 ≡ 1 mod p. This implies n and p are coprime. Let k be the smallest positive exponent of n such that n k ≡ 1 mod p, i.e. k = ordp(n). As n2011 ≡ 1 mod p we have k is a divisor of 2011. As 2011 is prime we have k = 1 or k = 2011. If k = 1 then n ≡ 1 mod p and by the original deﬁnition of f (n) we obtain 0 ≡ f (n) ≡ 2011 mod p. This implies that p divides 2011 and therefore p = 2011, which is a contra- diction since p < 2011. We conclude that k = 2011. By Fermat’s theorem, k must divide p − 1, so p − 1 is a multiple of 2011 which is again a contradiction to 1 < p < 2011. 6. An integer m is a perfect power if there exist positive integers a and n with n > 1 such that m = an. (a) Prove that there exist 2011 distinct positive integers such that no subset of them sums to a perfect power. (b) Prove that there exist 2011 distinct positive integers such that every subset of them sums to a perfect power. Solution: (a) We give three constructions. Construction 1. Let pi be the ith prime number, and consider the 2011 numbers p1, p2 1p2, p2 1p2 2p3, . . . , p 2 1p2 2 · · · p2 2010p2011. They are clearly all distinct, and if p2 1 · · · p2 kpk+1 is the least number occurring in some subset of them, then the sum of this subset is divisible by pk+1 but not p2 k+1. It cannot therefore be a perfect power. 4 Construction 2. Let p be a prime larger than ∑2011 k=1 k = 2011 · 1006, and consider the set A = {kp : 1 ≤ k ≤ 2011}. The sum of any subset of A has the form mp for some m ≤ ∑2011 k=1 k < p, and so cannot be a perfect power. Construction 3. If p is prime then the numbers p!, (p+1)!, . . . , (2p−1)! each contain p as a prime factor with exponent 1, and so cannot be perfect powers. It follows that that there exist arbitrarily long intervals of consecutive numbers, none of which is a perfect power. Using this fact we may inductively construct the required set as follows. Suppose that for some n ≥ 1 we have an n-element set An of positive integers such that no subset-sum of An is a perfect power. Let M = max An, and let S be the sum of the elements of An. By the paragraph above there exists a positive integer N > M such that none of the numbers N, N + 1, . . . , N + S is a perfect power, and we let An+1 = An ∪ {N }. Then An+1 contains n + 1 distinct positive integers, and a subset-sum of An+1 is either a subset-sum of An, N , or N plus a subset-sum of An, and in the last two cases it lies in the interval [N, N + S], and so cannot be a perfect power. Letting A1 equal say {2} completes the induction. (b) We ﬁrst show that, given any integers a1, . . . , an, there exists b ∈ N such that bai is a perfect power for each i. Again let pi be the ith prime number, and write each ai in the form ai = pαi,1 1 pαi,2 2 · · · pαi,k k , where k is ﬁxed and αi,j ≥ 0 for all i, j. Similarly let b = pβ1 1 pβ2 2 · · · pβk k . Then bai = pαi,1+β1 1 pαi,2+β2 2 · · · pαi,k+βk k , so if bai is to be a perfect power then there must be some qi ≥ 2 such that the numbers αi,1 + β1, αi,2 + β2, . . . , αi,k + βk are all divisible by qi. Choose qi to be the ith prime number. Then for each j ∈ {1, 2, . . . , k} we have the system of congruences βj ≡ −α1,j mod q1, βj ≡ −α2,j mod q2, ... βj ≡ −αn,j mod qn, and by the Chinese Remainder Theorem this system has a solution. Choosing the exponents βj according to the solutions to these systems gives us the required b. Now, to construct the required set of 2011 distinct integers, choose x1, x2, . . . , x2011 arbitrarily, and let a1, a2, . . . , a22011−1 be the sums formed from each nonempty subset of them. From above there is b ∈ N such that ba1, . . . , ba22011−1 are all perfect powers, and so we may take our integers to be bx1, bx2, . . . , bx2011. 5 7. Let p be a prime, and let q(x) be a polynomial with integer co-eﬃcients such that q(0) = 0, q(1) = 1, and q(n) is congruent to 0 or 1 mod p for all n ∈ N. Show that the degree of q is at least p − 1. Solution: The case p = 2 is trivial: the function is nonconstant, so it has degree at least 1. Assume then for some p ≥ 3 that q has degree less then p − 1. Then q(x) = p−2∑ j=0 ajxj = a0 + a1x + · · · + ap−3xp−3 + ap−2xp−2, in which any co-eﬃcient may be zero. Noting that a0 = q(0) = 0, we consider p−1∑ k=1 q(k) = p−1∑ k=1 p−2∑ j=1 ajkj = p−2∑ j=1 ( aj p−1∑ k=1 kj) . We claim that for each 1 ≤ j ≤ p − 2 the sum ∑p−1 k=1 kj is zero mod p. This implies the result, because then ∑p−1 k=1 q(k) is congruent to zero mod p. Since q(k) is congruent to 0 or 1 mod p, this is only possible if q(k) ≡ 0 mod p for 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 1, which contradicts the fact that q(1) = 1. To prove the claim, we will use the fact that for each 1 ≤ j ≤ p−2 there must exist 1 ≤ x ≤ p−1 such that xj ̸≡ 1 mod p. The existence of x follows from either the existence of a primitive root mod p (that is, an integer of multiplicative order p − 1 mod p), or the fact that a polynomial of degree m can have at most m roots mod p. Since x has an inverse mod p the elements of the set {xt|1 ≤ t ≤ p − 1} are a complete system of nonzero residues mod p, so p−1∑ k=1 kj = p−1∑ k=1(xk) j = xj p−1∑ k=1 kj, and since xj ̸≡ 1 mod p, the sum must be zero, as claimed. The result then follows by the preceding paragraph. Remark. We note that the bound in the problem is sharp, as the polynomial q(x) = xp−1 satisﬁes the conditions of the problem, by Fermat’s Theorem.
