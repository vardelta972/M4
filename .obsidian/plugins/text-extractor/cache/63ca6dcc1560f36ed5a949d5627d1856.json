A natural number is called bright if it is the sum of a perfect square and a perfect cube. Prove that if r and s are any two positive integers, then (a) there exist inﬁnitely many positive integers n such that both r + n and s + n are bright. (b) there exist inﬁnitely many positive integers m such that both rm and sm are bright. 2. f : N → N is a function such that f (f (n)) = number of divisors of n ∀ n ∈ N. Prove that if p is a prime, then f (p) is a prime. 3. Find all continuous functions f : R → R such that for all reals x and y f (x + f (y)) = y + f (x + 1) 4. Let a, b and c be the side lengths of ∆ABC. The length of the altitudes are ha, hb and hc. Show that ha b + c + hb c + a + hc a + b ≤ 3 √ 3 4 5. Using combinatorial argument, show that F2n+1 = n∑ i=0 n−i∑ j=0 ( n − i j )(n − j i ) where F1 = 1, F2 = 2 and Fn+1 = Fn + Fn−1, n > 1. 6. We attempt to cover the plane with an inﬁnite sequence of rectangles {Rn}, overlapping allowed. (a) Is the task always possible if the area of Rn is n 2 for each n? (b) Is the task always possible if each rectangle is a square, and for any number N , there exist squares with total area greater than N ? 7. f : [0, 1] → R is a continuous function. Show that lim n→∞ n ∫ 1 0 xnf (x)dx = f (1) 8. Let z1, z2, ..., zn ∈ C such that |z1| + |z2| + ... + |zn| = 1 Show that there exist S ̸= ϕ, S⊂{1, 2, ..., n} such that \f \f \f \f \f ∑ k∈S zk \f \f \f \f \f ≥ 1 6 . Best of luck.
