As this may not necessarily be the case, some common terms are explained here. \u0000 abscissa: the x-coordinate of a point on the plane. Compare with ordinate. \u0000 altitude: a line from a vertex of a triangle, which is perpendicular to the opposite side. The three altitudes intersect at the orthocentre. \u0000 AM-GM inequality: for n non-negative real numbers, the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, with equality if and only if all variables are equal. \u0000 Apollonius’ theorem: in a triangle A B C, where M is the centre of B C, we have A M 2 \u0000 1 2 b2 \u0000 1 2 c2 \u0000 1 4 a2. \u0000 areal coordinates: a system of projective homogeneous coordinates where each point is considered to be the weighted barycentre of three variable masses, each of which is positioned at a vertex of a fixed ‘reference triangle’. \u0000 Argand plane: the idea of representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as the Cartesian coordinates of a point on the Euclidean plane. \u0000 arithmetic mean: for n variables \u0000x1, …, xn\u0000, the arithmetic mean is 1 n \u0000x1 \u0000 … \u0000 xn\u0000. \u0000 barycentre: the centre of mass of a set of masses positioned at points (on the plane). \u0000 barycentric coordinates: a synonym of areal coordinates. \u0000 Bezout’s theorem: two algebraic curves of degrees m and n intersect in precisely m n points on the complex projective plane, when counted with the appropriate multiplicity. \u0000 Brahmagupta’s formula: for a cyclic quadrilateral with side lengths a, b, c, d and semiperimeter s, the area is given by \u0000s \u0000 a\u0000 \u0000s \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000s \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000s \u0000 d\u0000 . This is a generalisation of Heron’s formula. \u0000 Brianchon’s theorem: if a hexagon A B C D E F is circumscribed about a circle (or, more generally, a conic), its three major diagonals (A D, B E and C F) are concurrent. \u0000 Cardano’s formula: the general solution to a cubic equation. \u0000 Catalan sequence: a sequence of integers that counts the number of valid strings of 2 n parentheses. \u0000 Cauchy-Schwarz inequality: for two vectors u and v, u \u0000v \u0000 u v , with equality if and only if u and v have the same direction. \u0000 Cayley-Bacharach theorem: if two cubics intersect in nine points and a third cubic passes through eight of those points, then it also passes through the ninth. \u0000 Cayley-Menger determinant: a formula for the square of the volume of a simplex in terms of the squares of the side lengths. \u0000 centroid: the intersection of the three medians of a triangle. More generally, it is synonymous with barycentre. \u0000 Ceva’s theorem: if D, E and F are points on the (possibly extended) sides B C, C A and A B, respectively, then A D, B E and C F are concurrent if and only if B D D C \u0000 C E E A \u0000 A F F B \u0000 1. \u0000 circular points at infinity: a pair of points on the complex projective plane through which all circles pass. \u0000 circumcentre: the point O equidistant from the three vertices of a triangle. \u0000 circumradius: the radius R of the circumscribing circle of a triangle or cyclic polygon. \u0000 collinear: points lying on the same straight line. \u0000 concentric: objects sharing the same centre. This is usually applied to circles, but is equally applicable to conics. \u0000 conconic: points lying on the same conic section. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 concurrent: three (or more) lines are said to be concurrent if they all intersect at a single point or are all mutually parallel. \u0000 concyclic: points lying on the same circle. \u0000 conic: a curve in the plane described by a quadratic equation in Cartesian coordinates. \u0000 coplanar: points (or curves) lying on the same flat plane. \u0000 coprime: two integers with a greatest common divisor of 1. \u0000 cosine rule: for a generic triangle A B C, a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2 \u0000 2 b c cos A. \u0000 cross-ratio: for four collinear points, the ratio A B\u0000C D B C\u0000D A . If the cross-ratio is \u00001, the points form a harmonic range. \u0000 cube roots of unity: the three roots of the polynomial z3 \u0000 1. We often use \u0000 to represent the ‘north-west’ complex cube root of unity 3 2 \u0000 \u0000 1 2 . \u0000 Desargues’ theorem: two triangles are in perspective about a point if and only if they are in perspective about a line. \u0000 difference of two squares: the polynomial a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b\u0000. \u0000 difference of three cubes: the polynomial a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 c3 \u0000 3 a b c \u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b \u0000 \u0000 c \u00002\u0000 \u0000a \u0000 b \u00002 \u0000 c \u0000\u0000, where \u0000 is a primitive cube root of unity. \u0000 Euclid’s algorithm: the greatest common divisor of a and b can be obtained by subtracting the smaller from the larger and repeating until one of the numbers is zero. For example, \u000026, 10\u0000 \u0000 \u000016, 10\u0000 \u0000 \u00006, 10\u0000 \u0000 \u00006, 4\u0000 \u0000 \u00002, 4\u0000 \u0000 \u00002, 2\u0000 \u0000 \u00002, 0\u0000, so the greatest common divisor of 26 and 10 is 2. \u0000 Euler-Apollonius lollipop: the disc on diameter G H , which contains the incentre, symmedian point and Gergonne point. \u0000 Euler-Fermat theorem: if a and n are coprime, then a\u0000\u0000n\u0000 \u0000 1 \u0000mod n\u0000, where \u0000\u0000n\u0000 is the number of positive integers \u0000 n which are coprime to n. \u0000 Euler line: the circumcentre, centroid, nine-point centre and orthocentre are collinear in the ratio O G : G T : T H \u0000 2 : 1 : 3. \u0000 Euler’s inequality: O I 2 \u0000 R 2 \u0000 2 R r, where the circumcircle has centre O and radius R, and the incircle has centre I and radius r. \u0000 excentre: the centre of an excircle. \u0000 excircle: one of three circles (other than the incircle) tangent to (the extensions of) the three sides of a triangle. \u0000 Feuerbach’s theorem: the nine-point circle is tangent to the incircle and three excircles. \u0000 Fibonacci sequence: the sequence defined with F0 \u0000 0, F1 \u0000 1 and Fn\u00002 \u0000 Fn\u00001 \u0000 Fn.
