Answer all questions. • Each of the questions 1,2,3 carries 10 points. Each of the questions 4,5,6,7,8 carries 14 points. • Use of protractors, calculators, mobile phone is forbidden. • Time allotted: 4 hours 1. Let ABCD be a convex quadrilateral with AB = a, BC = b, CD = c and DA = d. Suppose a 2 + b 2 + c2 + d2 = ab + bc + cd + da, and the area of ABCD is 60 square units. If the length of one of the diagonals is 30 units, determine the length of the other diagonal. 2. Determine the number of 3-digit numbers in base 10 having at least one 5 and at most one 3. 3. Let P (x) be a non-constant polynomial whose coeﬃcients are positive integers. If P (n) divides P (P (n) − 2015) for every natural number n, prove that P (−2015) = 0. 4. Find all three digit natural numbers of the form (abc)10 such that (abc)10, (bca)10 and (cab)10 are in geometric progression. (Here (abc)10 is representation in base 10.) 5. Let ABC be a right-angled triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦ and let BD be the altitude from B on to AC. Draw DE ⊥ AB and DF ⊥ BC. Let P , Q, R and S be respectively the incentres of triangle DF C, DBF , DEB and DAE. Suppose S, R, Q are collinear. Prove that P , Q, R, D lie on a circle. 6. Let S = {1, 2, . . . , n} and let T be the set of all ordered triples of subsets of S, say (A1, A2, A3), such that A1 ∪ A2 ∪ A3 = S. Determine, in terms of n, ∑ (A1,A2,A3)∈T |A1 ∩ A2 ∩ A3| where |X| denotes the number of elements in the set X. (For example, if S = {1, 2, 3} and A1 = {1, 2}, A2 = {2, 3}, A3 = {3} then one of the elements of T is ({1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3}).) 7. Let x, y, z be real numbers such that x2 + y2 + z2 − 2xyz = 1. Prove that (1 + x)(1 + y)(1 + z) ≤ 4 + 4xyz. 8. The length of each side of a convex quadrilateral ABCD is a positive integer. If the sum of the lengths of any three sides is divisible by the length of the remaining side then prove that some two sides of the quadrilateral have the same length.
