For each integer t, let It ⊂ {0, 1, . . . , M } denote the set of integers 0 ≤ k ≤ M such that t + k ∈ X. By the pigeonhole principle, we can ﬁnd distinct s ̸= t such that Is = It. We claim that Is+1 = It+1. To prove this, it suﬃces to show that if s + 1 + M ∈ X than t + 1 + M ∈ X. Therefore, assume s + 1 + M ∈ X. Note that by the condition of the problem, for each integer l, exactly one of l − a1, l − a2, . . . , l − an is in X. Thus, letting l = s + 1 + M + a1, we conclude that exactly one of s + 1 + M, s + 1 + M − a2 + a1, . . . , s + 1 + M − an + a1 is in X. Thus, we conclude that the numbers s + 1 + M + a1 − a2, . . . , s + 1 + M + a1 − an are not in X, and thus that M + 1 + (a1 − a2), . . . , M + 1 + (a1 − an) are not in Is = It. Thus, we conclude that t + 1 + M + a2 − a1, . . . , t + 1 + M + an − a1 are not in X, and so letting l = t + 1 + M + a1 we conclude that t + 1 + M ∈ X. We thus have that Is+1 = It+1, and thus by induction that Is+k = It+k for all positive k. Similarly, we conclude that Is−k = It−k for all positive integers k, and thus Ik = Ik+(s−t) for all integers k. Thus, as k ∈ X if and only if 0 ∈ Ik, we conclude that X = X + (s − t). 2. We ﬁrst show that the people can win with probability 1 − 1 2n . To do this, A person simply says the number (−1)r · nr where r is the number of red hats she sees. Now, if there are n − r blue hats and r red hats, then n − r people see r red hats and r people see r − 1 red hats. Thus, the sum of the numbers said will be (−1) r · ((n − r) · nr − r · nr−1) = (−1)rnr−1(n2 − r(n + 1)). Since n2 > r(n + 1) if r < n the people will win as long as the hats aren’t all red, which is an event with probability 1 2n . Now, we must show that there is no strategy that does any better. Note that there are 2 n possible events (each person gets 1 of 2 possible hat colors) and each strategy works for some subset of them. Thus, all we must show is that there is no strategy that works in all cases. So suppose there is. For each event E, let r(E) denote the number of red hats, Ei denote the number that the i’th person says under the winning strategy, and S(E) denote the sum of the Ei. Since the strategy always works, we must have (−1) r(E)S(E) is always positive. Let us consider the sum ∑ E(−1) r(E)S(E). Note that this can be rewritten as n∑ i=1 ∑ E (−1)Er(E)Ei. Now, ﬁx some i. Let E′ denote the event E but with the i’th person receiving the opposite hat coloring. Then r(E) = r(E′) ± 1 and Ei = E′ i since the colors that person i sees are the same for E and E′. Thus, (−1)r(E)Ei + (−1)r(E′)E′ i = 0. Since the map E → E′ pairs of all events, we must have that ∑ E(−1) Er(E)Ei = 0, and thus ∑ E(−1) r(E)S(E) = 0. This is a contradiction, which completes the proof. 3. Note that the sum of all elements in the grid is 18 · 37 = 666 and thus the sum in each row, column, and diagonal must be 111. Now, let Ri, Cj refer to the sum of the numbers in row i and column j respectively, and let Dk denote the sum of the numbers in diagonal k. Then 333 = R1 + R3 + R5 + C1 + C3 + C5 − D1 − D3 − D5 and this letter sum is twice the sum of the numbers in those squares whose co-ordinates are both odd. Since 333 is an odd number, this is impossible. 2 Algebra 1. In fact jacob can make f (2) = 0. To begin with, Jacob starts lowering the x coeﬃcient, making f (2) decrease by 2. Since David can only increase f (2) by 1 each term, Jacob can f (2) decrease until f (2) = 1 or f (2) = 0. If the latter happens, Jacob has won. else, David can make f (2) = 2 or f (2) = 0. In the former case, jacob lowers the coeﬃcient by 1 and wins. In the latter, Jacob has already won. 2. We claim that f (x) = x or f (x) = 0. Assume f (x) is not identically 0. Setting x = y = 0 gives f (0) = 0. Next, setting y = 0 gives f (x 2)x2 = f (x4) (1) 1 and setting x = 0 gives yf (y)f (y2) = f (y4). (2) Moreover, setting y = x gives f (x2) = xf (x) or f (x2) + x2 = 0. (3) Now, if f (c 2) = −c2 then (1) gives f (c4) = −c 4, and similarly f (c8) = −c 8. Plugging y = c 2 into (2) now gives c 8 = −c 8, and thus c = 0. Hence, (3) implies that f (x2) = xf (x) for all x. Plutting in (1) and f (y2) = yf (y) into the original equation expanded out gives f (y2) (f (x2) − x2) = 0. Thus, letting y be such that f (y) ̸= 0 and thus f (y2) = yf (y) ̸= 0, we get that f (x2) = x2. Finally, xf (x) = f (x2) = x2 and thus f (x) = x, as desired. 3. We proceed by induction on n, the case of n = 1 being obvious(as it is vacuous). So let the claim be prove for n − 1. Given a sequence a1, . . . , an with even sum create a sequence of length n − 1, given by a1, a2, . . . , an−2, |an−1 − an|. This latter sequences also has even sum, and |an−1 − an| ≤ max(an−1, an) − 1 ≤ n − 1. Hence, our induction hypothesis applies, and we can write a1 ± a2 ± · · · ± |an−1 − an| = 0 for some choice of signs. Expanding out the absolute value now gives the result. 3 Number Theory 1. Let k be such that 10 k−2 > N , and let x = ⌈√10kN ⌉. Then √10kN ≤ x < √10kN + 1. Squaring, we get 10 kN ≤ x2 < 10kN + 2√10kN + 1 < 10kN + 2 · 10k−1 + 1. Hence the ﬁrst k digit of x give N . 2. Assume that there are only ﬁnitely many primes p satisfying the conclusion of the statement, and let S be their product. Let m = 9a 3S4. Then m3 − a = a(729a2S12 − 1) = a(27a 4S6 − 1)(27a 4S6 + 1). Now let p be a prime dividing 27a4S6 + 1. Then letting n = 9a 2S3 we see that p satisﬁes the conclusions of the statement, and is relatively prime to S. This is a contradiction, thus the statement must be true. 3. The answer is no. Note that An is equal to the number of residue classes x mod n such that n | xn + 1. Letting n = ∏m i=1 p ei i this is equal to the product over all i of the number tn,i of residue classes x mod p ei i . Suppose ﬁrst that n is even. Now, if 4 | n then An = 0 since x 2 + 1 is never divisible by 4. Thus n must be equal to 2 ∏m i=2 pei i . We claim in this case that each tn,i is even. To see this, note that if xn + 1 is divisible by pei i then so is x−1. Now x = x−1 mod p ei i is equivalent to x 2 = 1 mod pei i and the only solutions are x = ±1. Thus, in order for tn,i to be odd it must be the case that 1 n + 1 or (−1) n + 1 is divisible by p ei i but not both. However, both are equal to 2, and so tn,i is odd as desired. Now, 130 is not divisible by 4, so we must have n = 2pe for some prime p. Then An is equal to the number of residue classes x mod p e such that x2pe = −1 mod pe. Thus, p must be a prime that is 1 mod 4. If e = 1, then x2p = x2 mod p and so the number of solutions is 2. If e > 1, then as (1 + pr)pe = 1 mod p e the number of solutions is divisible by p e−1, and as x modulo p can have at most 2 values the number of such values is at most 2pe−1. Thus, e = 2 and p | 130 and 2p > 130. Since the only odd primes dividing 130 are 5 and 13 this is impossible. Finally, suppose that n is odd. Then we claim that tn,i is odd for all i. To see this, note again that if xn + 1 is divisible by pei i then so is x −1. Now x = x −1 mod p ei i is equivalent to x2 = 1 mod pei i and the only solutions are x = ±1. Thus, in order for tn,i to be odd it must be the case that 1n + 1 or (−1)n + 1 is divisible by p ei i but not both. However, the former is 2 and the latter is 0 as n is odd, and so tn,i is odd as desired. Thus |An| is odd, which completes the proof. 2 4 Geometry 1. The answer is al P on the circumcircle of BCD. Wlog P is at east as close to A as to C. Note that √2BC = √2CD = BD, and thus the equation is P C · BD = P B · CD + P D · BC, and so by the converse to Ptolemy’s inequality we deduce that P BCD is cyclic, and thus P lies on the circumcircle of ABCD on arc BAD. Conversely, if P lies on this arc then P BCD is cyclic, and so the equality holds by Ptolemy. The other case is identical. 2. Let O be the circumcircle of ABCD. We claim that DHOC is concyclic. To see this, let y = ∠DAF . Then by cyclicity of ABCD we have y = ∠DCB. Since AF HD and BF HC are concyclic, we conclude that ∠F HD = ∠F HC = π − y and thus ∠DCH = 2y = ∠DCO, where the latter is because O is the circumcenter of DBC. Thus, we concluden that DCOH is cyclic and likewise, so is ABOH. Applying the radial axis theorem to the 3 circles DCOH, ABOH, ABCD we conclude that AB, DC, OH are concurrent, and thus E, H, O are collinear. Thus, it suﬃces to show that EO i perpendicular to F H. Applying the radical axis theorem to the 3 circles ABCD, ADHF, CBHF we likewise learn that H, F, K are collinear. Thus it suﬃces to prove that EO is perpendicular to F K. That this is true is Brokard’s theorem. 3. The answer is no. We shall need the following claim: Let ABC be a triangle, and I be the incenter. Now let M, N be the midpoints of AB, BC respectively. Then I and A lie on opposite sides of M N . To prove this, simply note that since the incircle is inside ABC, the diameter of the incircle is less than the altitude from A to BC, and thus the altitude from I to BC is less than half the altitude from A to BC. Now, let ABCD be our tetrahedron, and let IABC be the incenter of ABC, with IACD, IABD, IBCD be deﬁned similarly. Suppose that these 4 points are coplanar. Then either they make a convex quadrilateral or one of them – wlog IABC lies inside the triangle formed by the other 3 points. But IACD, IABD, IBCD all lie on one side of the plane ABC, and so this latter possibility is impossible. So assume that the four incenters form a convex quadrilateral, so that the two diagonals intersect. Wlog, IABCIBCD intersects IACDIABD. Now let M, N, K, L be the midpoints of AB, AC, BD, CD. Then M N ||BC||KL, and thus M N KL lie on a plane P . Now, by our initial claim, IABC and IDBC lie on the same side as BC of the plane P , and IACD and IDBC lie on the same side as AD of the plane P . But evidently AD and BC lie on opposite sides of P . Thus the segments IABCIBCD IACDIABD are on opposite sides of the plane P and therefore cannot intersect, which is a contradiction. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
