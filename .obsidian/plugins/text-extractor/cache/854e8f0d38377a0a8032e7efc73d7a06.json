Several of these standard inequalities regarding the most basic of 2-D ﬁgures also have analogues in the most basic of 3-D ﬁgures, namely tetrahedra. While proving one of these analogues, we will also discover some interesting properties of tetrahedra. We start with a basic theorem: Theorem 1. If A, B, and C are the angles in an acute triangle ABC, then cos A + cos B + cos C ≤ 3 2 . Proof. Because the cosine function is concave on the interval [ 0, π 2 ] , we have cos A + cos B + cos C ≤ 3 · cos A + B + C 3 = 3 · cos π 3 = 3 2 by Jensen’s inequality with f (x) = cos x. This leads to a main theorem regarding angles in tetrahedra: Theorem 2. Let A1A2A3A4 be a tetrahedron, and let fi be the face which opposes the vertex Ai. Furthermore, let fij = fji be the angle between the faces fi and fj. Then ∑ 1≤i<j≤4 cos fij ≤ 2. From this point onwards, we will use the notation from Theorem 2. But before we can approach Theorem 2 itself, it is helpful to familiarize ourselves with some basic properties of tetrahedra. One of the these properties is the observation that every tetrahedron has a centroid. Deﬁnition 3. Let A1, A′ 1; A2, A′ 2; A3, A′ 3; A4, A′ 4 be the four pairs of diagonally op- posite vertices of a parallelepiped, drawn so that face A1A′ 2A3A′ 4 ∼= face A′ 3A4A′ 1A2 . Through one of its vertices, say A1, draw the three diagonals A1A2, A1A3, and A1A4. We say that parallelepiped A1A′ 2A3A′ 4A′ 3A4A′ 1A2 is circumscribed about tetrahedron A1A2A3A4. Deﬁnition 4. A median of a tetrahderon is a line segment connecting a vertex with the centroid of the opposite face. Lemma 5. The medians of a tetrahedron lie along the diagonals of the tetraheron’s circumscribed parallelepiped and are two-thrids the lengths of the respective diago- nals. Mathematical Reflections 6 (2008) 1 Proof. Let A1A2A3A4 be our tetrahdedron, and let its circumscibed parallelepiped be named as indicated in Deﬁnition 3. The line A3B joining the vertex A3 to the midpoint B of A′ 1A′ 3 lies in the plane of the parallelogram A1A′ 3A′ 1A3. Hence, A3B meets A1A′ 1 in the centroid C of triangle A3A′ 3A′ 1, and thus A3C CB = 2. Now B is the common point to the diagonals A′ 1A′ 3 and A2A4 of face A′ 1A2A′ 3A4, so A3B is a median of the face A3A2A4 of the tetrahedron, and C is the centroid of this face. Therefore, the median A1C of the tetrahedron lies along the diagonal A1CA′ 1 of the parallelepiped. Let O be the point of intersection of diagonals A1A′ 1 and A3A′ 3. The length of the segment A′ 1C is equal to two thirds of A′ 1O, so it is equal to one third of A1A′ 1. Hence A1C is equal to two thirds of A1A′ 1. We will also need the following lemmas concerning tetrahedra: Lemma 6. Let the sides of a tetrahedron be ai, 1 ≤ i ≤ 6. If the radius of the circumsphere of the tetrahedron is R, then 6∑ i=1 a 2 i ≤ 16R2. Proof. Let the coordinates of Ai be (xi, yi, zi), 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. It is a well-known fact that the centroid G of the tetrahedron is the point ( x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 4 , y1 + y2 + y3 + y4 4 , z1 + z2 + z3 + z4 4 ) . Let W be a point (x, y, z). Then 16W G2 + ∑ 1≤i≤j≤4(AiAj) 2 = 16 ∑ cyc   ( x − ∑4 i=1 xi 4 )2 + ∑ 1≤i≤j≤4(xi − xj) 2   . (1) Because ∑(x − xi) 2 = x 2 − 2x · ∑ xi + ∑ x 2 i and ∑(xi − xj) 2 = 3 · ∑ x 2 i − 2 · ∑ xixj, equation (1) reduces to: Mathematical Reflections 6 (2008) 2 ∑ cyc  16x 2 − 8x · 4∑ i=1 xi + ( 4∑ i=1 xi )2 + 3 · ∑ x 2 i − 2 · ∑ 1≤i≤j≤4 xixj   = ∑ cyc [ 16x 2 − 8x · 4∑ i=1 xi + 4 · 4∑ i=1 x 2 i ] = 4 · ∑ cyc (x − xi) 2 = 4 · 4∑ i=1(W Ai) 2 Letting point W be equidistant from A1, A2 and A3, A4, we have W Ai = R for all i. Since W G ≥ 0, we have ∑ 1≤i<j≤4(AiAj)2 ≤ 16R2, as desired. We immediately see that equality holds when W G = 0. It is a well-known fact that every tetrahedron has a circumsphere (a shphere contain- ing all four vertices of the tetrahedron) and an insphere (a sphere tangent to all four faces of the tetrahedron). We call the center of the circumsphere the circumcenter and the center of the insphere the incenter. Now we ﬁnd a necessary and suﬃcient condition for the coincidence of the circum- center, incenter, and centroid of a tetrahedron. Lemma 7. A tetrahedron is isosceles (each pair of its opposite sides is congruent) if and only if its centroid, circumcenter, and incenter are coincident. Proof. We will ﬁrst prove that a tetrahedron is isosceles if and only if its incenter coincides with its centroid. The “only if” direction is trivial. Now suppose that the incenter and the centroid of a tetrahedron are coincident at point G. Because G is a centroid, the volumes of GA1A2A3, GA1A3A4, GA1A4A2, and GA2A3A4 are equal. Also, because G is an incenter, G is the same distance from all faces fi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. Hence all four faces have equal area. Again, let us denote fij = fji as the angle between the faces that oppose vertices Ai and Aj. Projecting the areas of A1A2A3, A1A3A4, and A1A4A2 onto A2A3A4, we have the equation: [A1A2A3] cos f14 + [A1A3A4] cos f12 + [A1A4A2] cos f13 = [A2A3A4] (1) Because all faces are of equal area, we have the system of equations: cos f12 + cos f13 + cos f14 = 1, cos f21 + cos f23 + cos f24 = 1, cos f31 + cos f32 + cos f34 = 1, Mathematical Reflections 6 (2008) 3 cos f41 + cos f42 + cos f43 = 1. After performing multiple substitutions, we ﬁnd that cos f12 = cos f34, cos f13 = cos f24 and cos f14 = cos f23. Also, because 0 < fij < π for 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4, we have f12 = f34, f13 = f24, and f14 = f23. Now drop perpendicular A1B onto face A2A3A4 and perpendicular A2C onto face A1A3A4. Furthermore, drop perpendicular A1B′ onto side A2A3 and perpendicular A2C′ onto side A1A4. Calculating the volume of the tetrahdron in two ways, we have 1 3 [A2A3A4]A1B = 1 3 [A1A3A4]A2C, . (2) from which we ﬁnd that A1B = A2C. Noting that BB′ ⊥ A2A3, and CC′ ⊥ A1A4, we have A1BB′ ∼= A2CC′ by the AAS Postulate (f23 = f14). Hence A1B′ = A2C′. Because all faces are of equal area, 1 2 A1B′ × A2A3 = 1 2 A2C′ × A1A4. Therefore, A1A4 = A2A3, and similarly, other pairs of opposite sides are congruent. Hence our tetrahdron is isosceles. Now, it remains to prove that a tetrahedron is isosceles if and only if its centroid and circumcenter are coincident. Suppose we have an isosceles tetrahedron. It is easy to see that the circumscribed parallelepiped is rectangular. Hence the parallelepiped’s diagonals are equal, which implies that the tetrahedron’s medians are equal (median lengths equal 2 3 corresponding diagonal lengths by Lemma 5). Therefore the centroid is equidistant from the vertices of the tetrahedron, and is also a circumcenter. Now suppose that the centroid is equidistant from the vertices. Then all medians of the the tetrahedron are equal, implying that all diagonals of the circumscribed parallelopiped are equal. Hence the circumscribed parallelepiped is rectangular and the tetrahedron is isosceles. Now, our ﬁnal lemma: Lemma 8. Let the incenter of tetrahedron A1A2A3A4 meet face fi at Pi for 1 ≤ i ≤ 4. Then A1A2A3A4 is isosceles if and only if P1P2P3P4 is isosceles. Proof. (⇒) Let I denote the incenter of tetrahedron A1A2A3A4. Because IP1 ⊥ △A2A3A4 and IP4 ⊥ △A1A2A3, it is easy to see that ∠P1IP4 = π − f14, the supplement of the angle between faces f1 and f4. Similarly, ∠P2IP3 = π − f23. In Lemma 4, we proved that f14 = f23 for all isosceles tetrahedra, so we have the equivalence ∠P1IP4 = ∠P2IP3. Because IP1 = IP2 = IP3 = IP4, △P1IP4 ∼= △P2IP3 by the SAS Postulate. Hence P1P4 = P2P3, and working similarly with other opposite edges, we ﬁnd that P1P2P3P4 is isosceles. Mathematical Reflections 6 (2008) 4 (⇐) As usual, we let I denote the incenter of A1A2A3A4. Draw a plane through I, P1, and P4, intersecting A2A3 at point B. Also, draw a plane through I, P2, and P3, intersecting A1A4 at point C. Note that IB ⊥ A2A3 and that IB is the perpen- dicular bisector of P1P4. Because IP1 = IP2 = IP3 = IP4, I is the circumcenter of tetrahedron P1P2P3P4. But because tetrahedron P1P2P3P4 is isosceles, I is also its incenter and centroid by Lemma 7. Let the intersection of IB and P1P4 be D and the intersection of IC and P2P3 be E. Then D and E are the midpoints of P1P4 and P2P3 respectively. Because I is the centroid of P1P2P3P4, ⃗I = ⃗P1 + ⃗P2 + ⃗P3 + ⃗P4 4 = 1 2 [ ⃗P1 + ⃗P4 2 + ⃗P2 + ⃗P3 2 ] = 1 2 [ ⃗D + ⃗E]. Hence D, I, and E are collinear (in particular, B, D, I, E, and C are all collinear). Since P1P4 = P2P3, we have △IP1P4 ∼= △IP2P3 ⇒ △IBP1 ∼= △ICP2 ⇒ I so I is the midpoint of segment BC. Now let the plane through P3, P4, and I intersect A1A2 at M and let the plane through P1, P2 and I intersect A3A4 at N. Similarly, we ﬁnd that I is the midpoint of segment M N . Likewise, let the plane through P1, P3, and I intersect A2A4 at P and let the plane through P2, P4, and I intersect A1A3 at Q. As before, we ﬁnd that I is the midpoint of segment P Q. It is not diﬃcult to see that BC, M N , and P Q perpendicularly bisect one another at point I. In particular, P Q is perpendicular to the plane through B, C, M, N , and the lines A1A3 and A2A4. As I is the midpoint of P Q, B, C, M, N are the midpoints of A2A3, A1A4, A1A2 and A3A4 respectively. Hence I is the centroid of A1A2A3A4, and by Lemma 7, A1A2A3A4 is isosceles. Now we can ﬁnally prove Theorem 2! Proof. As usual, let I be the incenter of our tetrahedron. Let plane S through points I, P1, P4 intersect A2A3 at point X. Now connect AP1 and AP4, and get P1XP4 = (f14) ⇒ P1IP4 = π − f14. If the inradius of the tetrahderon is r, then the law of cosines yields: (P1P4) 2 = 2r2 − 2r2 cos ∠P1IP4 = 2r2(1 + cos f14). Summing over all lengths PiPj, 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 4, we obtain: ∑ 1≤i<j≤4(PiPj) 2 = 2r2  6 + ∑ 1≤i<j≤4 cos fij   . By Lemma 6, the above equation becomes Mathematical Reflections 6 (2008) 5 ∑ 1≤i<j≤4(PiPj) 2 ≤ 16r2 ⇔ ∑ 1≤i<j≤4 cos fij ≤ 2. By Lemmas 6, 7, and 8, we have equality if and only if A1A2A3A4 is isosceles. We now present several extensions of Theorem 2. The analogue of the inequality cos A 2 cos B 2 cos C 2 ≤ 3√3 8 in a triangle ABC is: ∏ 1≤i<j≤4 cos fij 2 ≤ 8 27 . (3) The analogue of the inequality cos A cos B cos C ≤ 1 8 in a triangle ABC is: Π1≤i<j≤4 cos fij ≤ 1 36 . (4) Finally, the analoge of the inequality cos2 A 2 + cos2 B 2 + cos2 C 2 ≤ 9 4 in a triangle ABC is: ∑ 1≤i<j≤4 cos2 fij 2 ≤ 4. (5) We leave the proofs of these simple extensions to the interested reader. 1 Bibliography [1] Altshiller-Court, Nathan. Modern Pure Solid Geometry, Chelsea, 1964. [2] Wang, Hsiang-Tung.
