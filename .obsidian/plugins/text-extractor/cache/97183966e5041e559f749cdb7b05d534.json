Oct. 28, start of class 6.5 Fermat’s two square theorem Finish the proof of the determination of which integers are sums of two squares (Theorem 6.21) with the exercise below. Exercise 6.12. Suppose n = ∏ p 2ei i ∏ qfj j where each pi, qj are primes of N such that each pi ≡ 3 mod 4 and qj ≡ 1, 2 mod 4. (i) Show each p 2ei i and qfj j is the norm of an element in Z[i]. (ii) Deduce n = x2 + y2 for some x, y ∈ Z. Exercise 6.13. Find an n such that n = x2 + y2 in at least two distinct ways (with x, y > 0 and x ≥ y). Write down all solutions (with x, y > 0, x ≥ y). Using this, show there are two elements α, β ∈ Z[i] such that N (α) = N (β) but α and β do not diﬀer by units. 6.6 Pythagorean triples Exercise 6.14. Give an example of relatively prime α, β in Z[i] such that αβ is a square in Z[i], but α and β are not squares in Z[i]. 6.7 *Primes of the form 4n + 1 Exercise 6.15. Let f (x) be any nonconstant polynomial over Z. Show there are inﬁnitely many primes dividing the values of f (x). (Cf. Exercises 6.7.1—6.7.4.) Exercise 6.16. Show that there are inﬁnitely many primes of the form 4n+3 (Cf. Exercises 6.3.4— 6.3.6. Note that this argument is similar to the 4n + 1 case with the polynomial f (x) = 2x2 + 1. If you like, you may try to use this idea and apply the previous exercise.) 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
