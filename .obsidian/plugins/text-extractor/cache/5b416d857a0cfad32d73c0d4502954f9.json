There are many methods to prove inequalities. In this paper, we would like to introduce to the readers some applications of a nice identity for solving inequalities. Theorem 0. Let a, b, c be real numbers. Then (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) = (a+b+c)(ab+bc+ca) − abc. Proof. This follows immediately by expanding both sides. Corollary 1. Let a, b, c be real numbers.

Let AA’, BB’ and CC’ be three non-coplanar chords of a sphere and let them all pass through a common point P inside the sphere. There is a (unique) sphere S1 passing through A, B, C, P and a (unique) sphere S2 passing through A’, B’, C’, P. If S1 and S2 are externally tangent at P, then prove that AA’=BB’=CC’. Problem 322.

ADPE is a convex quadrilateral such that ∠ ADP = ∠ AEP. Extend side AD beyond D to a point B and extend side AE beyond E to a point C so that ∠ DPB = ∠ EPC. Let O1 be the circumcenter of ΔADE and let O2 be the circumcenter of ΔABC. If the circumcircles of ΔADE and ΔABC are not tangent to each other, then prove that line O1O2 bisects line segment AP. Problem 325. On a plane, n distinct lines are drawn. A point on the plane is called a k-point if and only if there are exactly k of the n lines passing through the point. Let k2, k3, …, kn be the numbers of 2-points, 3-points, …, n-points on the plane, respectively. Determine the number of regions the n lines divided the plane into in terms of n, k2, k3, …, kn.

For every positive integer n > 6, prove that in every n-sided convex polygon A1A2…An, there exist i ≠ j such that . )6(2 1 |coscos| − <∠−∠ n AA ji Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 5). Note the sum of all angles is (n−2)180° = 6×120°+(n−6)180°. So there are at most five angles less than 120°. The remaining angles are in [120°, 180°) and their cosines are in (−1,−1/2]. Divide (−1,−1/2] into n−6 left open, right closed intervals with equal length. By the pigeonhole principle, there exist two of the cosines in the same interval, which has length equal to 1/(2n−12). The desired inequality follows. Problem 317. Find all polynomial P(x) with integer coefficients such that for every positive integer n, 2n−1 is divisible by P(n). Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 5). First we prove a fact: for all integers p and n and all polynomials P(x) with integer coefficients, p divides P(n+p)−P(n). To see this, let P(x) = akx k + ⋯ + a0. Then [ ]∑ = −+=−+ k i ii i npnanPpnP 1 )()()( .)( 1 1 0 1∑∑ = − = −− ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ += k i i j jij i npnpa Now we claim that the only polynomials P(x) solving the problem are the constant polynomials 1 and −1. Assume P(x) is such a polynomial and P(n) ≠ ±1 for some integer n > 1. Let p be a prime which divides P(n), then p divides 2n−1. So p is odd and 2n ≡ 1 (mod p). By the fact above, p also divides P(n+p)−P(n). Hence, p divides P(n+p). Since P(n+p) divides 2 n+p−1, p also divides 2 n+p−1. Then 2p ≡ 2n2p = 2n+p ≡ 1 (mod p). By Fermat’s little theorem, 2 p ≡ 2 (mod p). Thus, 1 ≡ 2 (mod p). This leads to p divides 2−1=1, which is a contradiction. Hence, P(n) = 1 or −1 for every integer n > 1. Then P(x)−1 or P(x)+1 has infinitely many roots, i.e. P(x) ≡ 1 or −1. Comments: Two readers pointed out that this problem appeared earlier as Problem 252 in vol. 11, no. 2. Problem 318. In ΔABC, side BC has length equal to the average of the two other sides. Draw a circle passing through A and the midpoints of AB, AC. Draw the tangent lines from the centroid of the triangle to the circle. Prove that one of the points of tangency is the incenter of ΔABC. (Source: 2000 Chinese Team Training Test) Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 5). O E A B C F I D M G Let G be the centroid and I be the incenter of ΔABC. Let line AI intersect side BC at D. Let E and F be the midpoints of AB and AC respectively. Let O be the circumcenter of ΔAEF. Let M be the midpoint of side BC. We claim I is the circumcenter of ΔDEF. To see this, note I is on line AD. So . 22 λ===== FC DC AC DC AI DI AB DB EB DB Also, DB + DC = BC = (AB + AC)/2 = EB + FC = 2λ(DB + DC) implies λ=1/2. Then DB=EB and DC=FC. So lines BI and CI are the perpendicular bisectors of DE and DF respectively. Now we show I is on the circumcircle of ΔAEF. To see this, we compute ∠ EIF = 2 ∠ EDB = 2(180°− ∠ BDE− ∠ CDF) = (180°−2 ∠ BDE) + (180°−2 ∠ CDF) = ∠ DBE+ ∠ DCF = 180°− ∠ EAF. Finally, we show OI⊥IG. Since IE=IF, OI⊥EF. Since EF|| BC, we just need to show IG||BC, which follows from DI/AI = 1/2 =MG/AG. Problem 319. For a positive integer n, let S be the set of all integers m such Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 14, No. 1, Mar.-Apr. 09 Page 4 that |m| < 2n. Prove that whenever 2n+1 elements are chosen from S, there exist three of them whose sum is 0. (Source: 1990 Chinese Team Training Test) Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 5), G.R.A. 20 Problem Solving Group (Roma, Italy), LKL Problem Solving Group (Madam Lau Kam Lung Secondary School of Miu Fat Buddhist Monastery) and Fai YUNG. For n = 1, S = {−1,0,1}. If 3 elements are chosen from S, then they are −1,0,1, which have zero sum. Suppose case n is true. For the case n+1, S is the union of S’={m: −2n+1 ≤ m ≤ 2n−1} and S”={−2n−1,−2n,2n,2n+1}. Let T be a 2n+3 element subset of S. Case 1: (T contains at most 2 elements of S”). Then T contains 2n+1 elements of S’. By case n, T has 3 elements with zero sum. Case 2: (T contains exactly 3 elements of S”.) There are 4 subcases: Subcase 1: (±2n and 2n+1 are in T.) If 0 is in T, then ±2n and 0 are in T with zero sum. If −1 is in T, then 2n+1, −2n, −1 are in T with zero sum. Otherwise, the other 2n numbers of T are among 1, ±2, ±3, …, ±(2n−1), which (after removing n) can be divided into the 2n−2 pairs {1, 2n−1}, {2, 2n−2}, …, {n−1, n+1}, {−2, −2n+1}, {−3, −2n+2}, …, {−n, −n−1}. By the pigeonhole principle, the two numbers in one of the pairs must both be in T. Since the sums for these pairs are either 2n or −2n−1, we can add the pair to −2n or 2n+1 to get three numbers in T with zero sum. Subcase 2: (2n and ±(2n+1) are in T.) If 0 is in T, then ±(2n+1) and 0 are in T with zero sum. If 1 is in T, then −2n−1, 2n, 1 are in T with zero sum. Otherwise, the other 2n numbers of T are among −1, ±2, ±3, …, ±(2n−1), which (after removing −n) can be divided into the 2n−2 pairs {2, 2n−1}, {3, 2n−2}, …, {n, n+1}, {−1, −2n+1}, {−2, −2n+2}, …, {−n+1, −n−1}. By the pigeonhole principle, the two numbers in one of the pairs must both be in T. Since the sums for these pairs are either 2n+1 or −2n, we can add the pair to −2n−1 or 2n to get three numbers in T with zero sum. Subcase 3: (±2n and −2n −1 are in T.) This can be handled as in subcase 1. Subcase 4: (−2n and ±(2n+1) are in T.) This can be handled as in subcase 2. Case 3: (T contains S”.) If 0 is in T, then −2n, 2n, 0 are in T with zero sum. If 1 is in T, then −2n−1, 2n, 1 are in T with zero sum. If −1 is in T, then 2n+1, −2n, −1 are in T with zero sum. Otherwise, the other 2n−1 numbers of T are among ±2, ±3, …, ±(2n−1), which can be divided into the 2n−2 pairs {2, 2n−1}, {3, 2n−2}, …, {n, n+1}, {−2, −2n+1}, {−3, −2n+2}, …, {−n, −n−1}. By the pigeonhole principle, the two numbers in one of the pairs must both be in T. Since the sums for these pairs are either 2n+1 or −2n−1, we can add the pair to −2n−1 or 2n+1 to get three numbers in T with zero sum. This completes the induction and we are done. Problem 320. For every positive integer k > 1, prove that there exists a positive integer m such that among the rightmost k digits of 2m in base 10, at least half of them are 9’s. (Source: 2005 Chinese Team Training Test) Solution. CHUNG Ping Ngai (La Salle College, Form 5) and G.R.A. 20 Problem Solving Group (Roma, Italy). We claim m=2×5k−1+k works. Let f(k)= 2×5k−1. We check by induction that 2f(k) ≡ −1 (mod 5k). (*) First f(2)=10, 2 10=1024 ≡ −1 (mod 52). Next, suppose case k is true. Then 2f(k) = −1 + 5kn for some integer n. We get 2f(k+1) = (−1 + 5kn)5 jkjj j n j 5)1( 5 5 5 0 − = −⎟⎟ ⎠ ⎞ ⎜⎜ ⎝ ⎛ =∑ ≡ −1 (mod 5k+1), completing the induction. By (*), we get 2m ≡ −2k (mod 5k). Also, clearly 2 m ≡ 0 ≡ −2k (mod 2k). Hence, 2m ≡ −2k ≡ 10k − 2k (mod 10k). This implies the k rightmost digits in base 10 of 2m and 10 k − 2k are the same. For k > 1, 2k < 10(k−1)/2. So 10k −1 ≥ 10k − 2k > 10 k −10(k−1)/2. The result follows from the fact that the k-digit number 10k − 10(k−1)/2 in base 10 has at least half of its digits are 9’s on the left. Olympiad Corner (continued from page 1) Problem 3. Let three circles Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, which are non-overlapping and mutually external, be given in the plane. For each point P in the plane, outside the three circles, construct six points A1, B1, A2, B2, A3, B3 as follows: For each i= 1,2,3, Ai, Bi are distinct points on the circle Γi such that the lines PAi and PBi are both tangents to Γi. Call the point P exceptional if, from the construction, three lines A1B1, A2B2, A3B3 are concurrent. Show that every exceptional point of the plane, if exists, lies on the same circle. Problem 4.

Problem 5. Larry and Bob are two robots travelling in one car from Argovia to Zillis. Both robots have control over the steering and steer according to the following algorithm: Larry makes a 90° left turn after every l kilometer driving from the start; Rob makes a 90° right turn after every r kilometer driving from the start, where l and r are relatively prime positive integers. In the event of both turns occurring simultaneously, the car will keep going without changing direction. Assume that the ground is flat and the car can move in any direction. Let the car start from Argovia facing towards Zillis.
