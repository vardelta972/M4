A cut-vertex of a connected graph is a vertex whose deletion disconnects the graph. A cut-edge or cut-set (of vertices or edges, usually the former) is similar. De\fnition 1.2. A graph G is k-connected i\u000b jV (G)j \u0015 k + 1 and for every X ˆ V (G) with jXj < k, G n X is connected. De\fnition 1.3. The line graph L(G) of a graph G is the graph with V (L(G)) = E(G), with an edge for for every pair of incidences of two edges of G on the same vertex of G. De\fnition 1.4. A graph G is k-edge-connected i\u000b its line graph is k-connected. Alternately, G is k-edge- connected i\u000b for every X ˆ E(G) with jXj < k, G n X is connected. De\fnition 1.5. A separation of G is a pair (A; B) of subsets of V (G) with A [ B = V (G), such that there is no edge between A n B and B n A. Its order is jA \\ Bj. 2 Useful Theorems Theorem 2.1. (Erd}os) If G is a graph with no stable set of size t, then there's a graph H with V (G) = V (H) and at most t \u0000 1 components, each of which is a complete graph, such that 8v; degH (v) \u0014 degG(v). Theorem 2.2. (Menger's Theorem) Let Q; R ˆ V (G), and let k \u0015 0. Then there are k pairwise vertex- disjoint paths from Q to R unlesss there's a separation (A; B) of G of order < K with Q ˆ A and R ˆ B. Theorem 2.3. (Tutte's Theorem) Let odd(X) be the number of components of X with an odd number of vertices. Then G has a perfect matching unlesss there exists X ˆ V (G) with odd(G n X) > jXj. 1 3 Matchings 1. (K\u0000onig's Theorem) Let G be bipartite, and k \u0015 0 an integer. Then G has a matching of size at least k unlesss there exists X ˆ V (G) with jXj < k such that X meets every edge of G. 2. Let G be a loopless graph in which every vertex has positive degree. Let X be the largest matching in G, and let Y be the smallest set of edges of G whose union contains V (G). Show that jXj+jY j = jV (G). 3. Show that every 2-edge-connected cubic graph has a perfect matching. 4. Let G be a d-regular bipartite graph. Show that E(G) can be partitioned into perfect matchings. 4 Minors De\fnition 4.1. If e 2 E(G), then G=e (\\G contract e\") is the graph formed by deleting e and identifying its endpoints. De\fnition 4.2. A graph H is a minor of a graph G i\u000b it's obtainable from a subgraph of G by contracting edges. That is, to get a minor, one \frst deletes vertices and edges, then contracts edges. Note that contraction and deletion commute, so one can do so any order. Theorem 4.3 (Wagner's Theorem). A graph G is planar unlesss it has a K5 or K3;3 minor. Theorem 4.4 (Kuratowski's Theorem). A graph G is planar unlesss it has a subdivision of K5 or K3;3 (that is, with edges turned into paths) as a subgraph. Theorem 4.5 (Seymour). If G is an in\fnite set of graphs, then one is a minor of another. 1. Prove that every 3-connected graph has a K4 minor. 2. Prove that a graph G can be drawn in the plane with all vertices in the same region unlesss G has a K4 or K3;2 minor. 3. Prove that if a graph G has no K5 minor, then it's 4-colorable. (You may assume the Four-color Theorem.) 4. Prove that every simple graph with average degree at least 2p has a Kp+2 minor. 5. Prove that if G is nonnull and loopless and jE(G)j \u0015 2jV (G)j \u0000 1, then G has a graph with three parallel edges as a minor. 6. Find all 2-connected graphs with no C5 minor. 7. Find all 2-connected graphs with no K4 n e minor. 8. (Kotzig's Theorem, also 2009 MOP K6.2/B6.4) Let G be a connected graph that has a perfect matching. Prove that if for any edge e of the perfect matching, G n e is connected, then G has another perfect matching. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
