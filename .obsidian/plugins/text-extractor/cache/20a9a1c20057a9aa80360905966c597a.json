A square is constructed, one of whose sides forms part of the hypotenuse, and whose other two vertices are on the legs of the triangle. Show that the area of this square is at most 4 m2, and determine for which triangles equality can occur. 2. Let a, b and c be real numbers. Prove that at least one of (a+b+c) 2 −9ab, (a+b+c)2 −9bc, (a+b+c) 2 −9ca is non-negative. 3. Show that among any eight distinct composite integers less than or equal to 360, there are at least two which are not relatively prime. 4. The sides and longest diagonal of a three-dimensional rectangular box all have integer lengths. If two of the sides have lengths 9 and 12, what are the possible lengths of the third side? 5. An acute angled triangle ABC is given. Determine the set of all points P inside the triangle such that: ∠AP B ∠ACB , ∠BP C ∠BAC , ∠CP A ∠CBA ≤ 2. 6. Let A = a1, a2, . . . , a2009 be a sequence of positive integers. Let mA be the number of three element subsequences ai, aj, ak with 1 ≤ i < j < k ≤ 2009 and aj = ai + 1 and ak = aj + 1. Among all such sequences A, ﬁnd the maximum possible value of mA.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
