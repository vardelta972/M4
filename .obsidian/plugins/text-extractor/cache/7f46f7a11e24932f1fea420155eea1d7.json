Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Rectangles BCC1B2, CAA1C2, and ABB1A2 are erected outside an acute triangle ABC. Suppose that ∠BC1C + ∠CA1A + ∠AB1B = 180◦. Prove that lines B1C2, C1A2, and A1B2 are concurrent. 2. The Planar National Park is a undirected 3-regular planar graph (i.e. all vertices have degree 3). A visitor walks through the park as follows: she begins at a vertex and starts walking along an edge. When she reaches the other endpoint, she turns left. On the next vertex she turns right, and so on, alternating left and right turns at each vertex. She does this until she gets back to the vertex where she started. What is the largest possible number of times she could have entered any vertex during her walk, over all possible layouts of the park? 3. Let n ≥ 2 be an integer. An n × n board is initially empty. Each minute, you may perform one of three moves: • If there is an L-shaped tromino region of three cells without stones on the board (see figure; rotations not allowed), you may place a stone in each of those cells. • If all cells in a column have a stone, you may remove all stones from that column. • If all cells in a row have a stone, you may remove all stones from that row. For which n is it possible that, after some non-zero number of moves, the board has no stones? 4. A finite set S of positive integers has the property that, for each s ∈ S, and each positive integer divisor d of s, there exists a unique element t ∈ S satisfying gcd(s, t) = d. (The elements s and t could be equal.) Given this information, find all possible values for the number of elements of S. 5. Let n ≥ 4 be an integer. Find all positive real solutions to the following system of 2n equations: a1 = 1 a2n + 1 a2 , a2 = a1 + a3, a3 = 1 a2 + 1 a4 , a4 = a3 + a5, a5 = 1 a4 + 1 a6 , a6 = a5 + a7, ... ... a2n−1 = 1 a2n−2 + 1 a2n , a2n = a2n−1 + a1. 2 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 6. Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon satisfying AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF , CD ∥ F A, and AB · DE = BC · EF = CD · F A. Let X, Y , and Z be the midpoints of AD, BE, and CF . Prove that the circumcenter of △ACE, the circumcenter of △BDF , and the orthocenter of △XY Z are collinear. 3 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1 Solutions to Day 1 §1.1 USAMO 2021/1, proposed by Ankan Bhattacharya Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498558. Problem statement Rectangles BCC1B2, CAA1C2, and ABB1A2 are erected outside an acute triangle ABC. Suppose that ∠BC1C + ∠CA1A + ∠AB1B = 180◦. Prove that lines B1C2, C1A2, and A1B2 are concurrent. The angle condition implies the circumcircles of the three rectangles concur at a single point P . Then ∡CP B2 = ∡CP A1 = 90◦, hence P lies on A1B2 etc., so we’re done. Remark. As one might guess from the two-sentence solution, the entire difficulty of the problem is getting the characterization of the concurrence point. 4 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2021/2, proposed by Zoran Sunic Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498640. Problem statement The Planar National Park is a undirected 3-regular planar graph (i.e. all vertices have degree 3). A visitor walks through the park as follows: she begins at a vertex and starts walking along an edge. When she reaches the other endpoint, she turns left. On the next vertex she turns right, and so on, alternating left and right turns at each vertex. She does this until she gets back to the vertex where she started. What is the largest possible number of times she could have entered any vertex during her walk, over all possible layouts of the park? The answer is 3. We consider the trajectory of the visitor as an ordered sequence of turns. A turn is defined by specifying a vertex, the incoming edge, and the outgoing edge. Hence there are six possible turns for each vertex. Claim — Given one turn in the sequence, one can reconstruct the entire sequence of turns. Proof. This is clear from the process’s definition: given a turn t, one can compute the turn after it and the turn before it. This implies already that the trajectory of the visitor, when extended to an infinite sequence, is totally periodic (not just eventually periodic), because there are finitely many possible turns, so some turn must be repeated. So, any turn appears at most once in the period of the sequence, giving a naïve bound of 6 for the original problem. However, the following claim improves the bound to 3. Claim — It is impossible for both of the turns a → b → c and c → b → a to occur in the same trajectory. Proof. If so, then extending the path, we get a → b → c → d → e → · · · and · · · → e → d → c → b → a, as illustrated below in red and blue respectively. 5 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 a b c d e However, we assumed for contradiction the red and blue paths were part of the same trajectory, yet they clearly never meet. It remains to give a construction showing 3 can be achieved. There are many, many valid constructions. One construction due to Danielle Wang is given here, who provided the following motivation: “I was lying in bed and drew the first thing I could think of”. The path is CAHIF GDBAHEF GJBAC which visits A three times. 2, 9 16 8, 15 1 7 11 5, 12 13 6 3 10 4 14 A B C D E F G H I J Remark. As the above example shows it is possible to transverse an edge more than once even in the same direction, as in edge AH above. 6 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2021/3, proposed by Alex Zhai, Shaunak Kishore Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498538. Problem statement Let n ≥ 2 be an integer. An n × n board is initially empty. Each minute, you may perform one of three moves: • If there is an L-shaped tromino region of three cells without stones on the board (see figure; rotations not allowed), you may place a stone in each of those cells. • If all cells in a column have a stone, you may remove all stones from that column. • If all cells in a row have a stone, you may remove all stones from that row. For which n is it possible that, after some non-zero number of moves, the board has no stones? The answer is 3 | n. Construction: For n = 3, the construction is fairly straightforward, shown below. This can be extended to any 3 | n. Polynomial-based proof of converse: Assume for contradiction 3 ∤ n. We will show the task is impossible even if we allow stones to have real weights in our process. A valid elimination corresponds to a polynomial P ∈ R[x, y] such that degx P ≤ n − 2 degy P ≤ n − 2 (1 + x + y)P (x, y) ∈ 1 + x + · · · + xn−1, 1 + y + · · · + yn−1\u000b . (Here ⟨. . . ⟩ is an ideal of R[x, y].) In particular, if S is the set of nth roots of unity other than 1, we should have (1 + z1 + z2)P (z1, z2) = 0 for any z1, z2 ∈ S. Since 3 ∤ n, it follows that 1 + z1 + z2 ̸= 0 always. So P vanishes on S × S, a contradiction to the bounds on deg P (by, say, combinatorial nullstellensatz on any nonzero term). Linear algebraic proof of converse (due to William Wang): Suppose there is a valid sequence of moves. Call rj the number of operations clearing row j, indexing from bottom-to-top. The idea behind the solution is that we are going to calculate, for each 7 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 cell, the number of times it is operated on entirely as a function of rj. For example, a hypothetical illustration with n = 6 is partially drawn below, with the number in each cell denoting how many times it was the corner of an L.             0 0 0 0 0 0 c1 c2 c3 = r3 c4 = r5 − r4 c5 = r5 0 ... ... r2 + r3 − r5 r5 − r3 r4 0 ... ... r1 + r2 + r3 − r4 − r5 r5 − r2 r3 0 ... ... r1 + r2 + r4 − r5 r5 − r1 r2 0 ... ... r1 + r4 − r5 r5 r1 0             Let ai,j be the expression in (i, j). It will also be helpful to define ci in the obvious way as well. Claim — We have cn = rn = 0, an−1,j = rj and ai,n−1 = ci. Proof. The first statement follows since (n, n) may never obtain a stone. The equation an−1,j = rj follows as both equal the number of times that cell (n, j) obtains a stone. The final equation is similar. Claim — For 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n − 1, the following recursion holds: ai,j + ai+1,j + ai+1,j−1 = rj + ci+1. Proof. Focus on cell (i + 1, j). The left-hand side counts the number of times that gains a stone while the right-hand side counts the number of times it loses a stone; they must be equal. We can coerce the table above into matrix form now as follows. Define K =            −1 −1 0 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 −1 −1 0 . . . 0 0 0 0 0 −1 −1 . . . 0 0 0 ... ... ... ... . . . ... ... ... 0 0 0 0 . . . −1 −1 0 0 0 0 0 . . . 0 −1 −1 1 1 1 1 . . . 1 1 0            . Then define a sequence of matrices Mi recursively by Mn−1 = id, and Mi = id + KMi+1 = id + K + · · · + Kn−1−i. The matrices are chosen so that, by construction, ⟨r1, . . . , rn−1⟩ Mi = ⟨ai,1, . . . , ai,n−1⟩ for i = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. On the other hand, we can extend the recursion one level deeper and obtain ⟨r1, . . . , rn−1⟩ M0 = ⟨0, . . . , 0⟩ . However, the crux of the solution is the following. 8 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Claim — The eigenvalues of K are exactly −(1 + e 2πik n ) for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Proof. The matrix −(K + id) is fairly known to have roots of unity as the coefficients. However, we are told that apparetnly 0 = det M0 = det (id + K + K2 + · · · + Kn−1) which means det(Kn − id) = 0. This can only happen if Kn has eigenvalue 1, meaning that [−(1 + ω)] n = 1 for ω some nth root of unity, not necessarily primitive. This can only happen if |1 + ω| = 1, ergo 3 | n. 9 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2021/4, proposed by Carl Schildkraut Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498580. Problem statement A finite set S of positive integers has the property that, for each s ∈ S, and each positive integer divisor d of s, there exists a unique element t ∈ S satisfying gcd(s, t) = d. (The elements s and t could be equal.) Given this information, find all possible values for the number of elements of S. The answer is that |S| must be a power of 2 (including 1), or |S| = 0 (a trivial case we do not discuss further). Construction: For any nonnegative integer k, a construction for |S| = 2k is given by S = {(p1 or q1) × (p2 or q2) × · · · × (pk or qk)} for 2k distinct primes p1, . . . , pk, q1, . . . , qk. Converse: the main claim is as follows. Claim — In any valid set S, for any prime p and x ∈ S, νp(x) ≤ 1. Proof. Assume for contradiction e = νp(x) ≥ 2. • On the one hand, by taking x in the statement, we see e e+1 of the elements of S are divisible by p. • On the other hand, consider a y ∈ S such that νp(y) = 1 which must exist (say if gcd(x, y) = p). Taking y in the statement, we see 1 2 of the elements of S are divisible by p. So e = 1, contradiction. Now since |S| equals the number of divisors of any element of S, we are done. 10 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2021/5, proposed by Mohsen Jamaali Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498967. Problem statement Let n ≥ 4 be an integer. Find all positive real solutions to the following system of 2n equations: a1 = 1 a2n + 1 a2 , a2 = a1 + a3, a3 = 1 a2 + 1 a4 , a4 = a3 + a5, a5 = 1 a4 + 1 a6 , a6 = a5 + a7, ... ... a2n−1 = 1 a2n−2 + 1 a2n , a2n = a2n−1 + a1. The answer is that the only solution is (1, 2, 1, 2, . . . , 1, 2) which works. We will prove a2k is a constant sequence, at which point the result is obvious. ¶ First approach (Andrew Gu) Apparently, with indices modulo 2n, we should have a2k = 1 a2k−2 + 2 a2k + 1 a2k+2 for every index k (this eliminates all aodd’s). Define m = min k a2k and M = max k a2k. Look at the indices i and j achieving m and M to respectively get m = 2 m + 1 a2i−2 + 1 a2i+2 ≥ 2 m + 1 M + 1 M = 2 m + 2 M M = 2 M + 1 a2j−2 + 1 a2j+2 ≤ 2 M + 1 m + 1 m = 2 m + 2 M . Together this gives m ≥ M , so m = M . That means a2i is constant as i varies, solving the problem. ¶ Second approach (author’s solution) As before, we have a2k = 1 a2k−2 + 2 a2k + 1 a2k+2 The proof proceeds in three steps. • Define S = ∑ k a2k, and T = ∑ k 1 a2k . Summing gives S = 4T . On the other hand, Cauchy-Schwarz says S · T ≥ n2, so T ≥ 1 2 n. 11 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 • On the other hand, 1 = 1 a2k−2a2k + 2 a2 2k + 1 a2ka2k+2 Sum this modified statement to obtain n = ∑ k ( 1 a2k + 1 a2k+2 )2 QM-AM ≥ 1 n (∑ k 1 a2k + 1 a2k+2 )2 = 1 n (2T ) 2 So T ≤ 1 2 n. • Since T ≤ 1 2 n and T ≥ 1 2 n, we must have equality everywhere above. This means a2k is a constant sequence. Remark. The problem is likely intractable over C, in the sense that one gets a high-degree polynomial which almost certainly has many complex roots. So it seems likely that most solutions must involve some sort of inequality, using the fact we are over R>0 instead. 12 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2021/6, proposed by Ankan Bhattacharya Available online at https://aops.com/community/p21498548. Problem statement Let ABCDEF be a convex hexagon satisfying AB ∥ DE, BC ∥ EF , CD ∥ F A, and AB · DE = BC · EF = CD · F A. Let X, Y , and Z be the midpoints of AD, BE, and CF . Prove that the circum- center of △ACE, the circumcenter of △BDF , and the orthocenter of △XY Z are collinear. We present two solutions. ¶ Parallelogram solution found by contestants Note that the following figure is intentionally not drawn to scale, to aid legibility. We construct parallelograms ABCE′, etc as shown. Note that this gives two congruent triangles A′C′E′ and B′D′F ′. (Assuming that triangle XY Z is non-degenerate, the triangles A′C′E′ and B′D′F ′ will also be non- degenerate.) B C D E F A A′ C ′ E′ B′ D′ F ′ X M N Claim — If AB · DE = BC · EF = CD · F A = k, then the circumcenters of ACE and A′C′E′ coincide. Proof. The power of A to (A′C′E′) is AE′ · AC′ = BC · EF = k; same for C and E. 13 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 A′ C ′ E′ B′D′ F ′ XY Z Claim — Triangle XY Z is the vector average of the (congruent) medial triangles of triangles A′C′E′ and B′D′F ′. Proof. If M and N are the midpoints of C′E′ and B′F ′, then X is the midpoint of M N by vector calculation: ⃗M + ⃗N 2 = ⃗C′+ ⃗E′ 2 + ⃗B′+ ⃗F ′ 2 2 = ⃗C′ + ⃗E′ + ⃗B′ + ⃗F ′ 4 = ( ⃗A + ⃗E − ⃗F ) + ( ⃗C + ⃗A − ⃗B) + ( ⃗D + ⃗F − ⃗E) + ( ⃗B + ⃗D − ⃗C) 4 = ⃗A + ⃗D 2 = ⃗X. Hence the orthocenter of XY Z is the midpoint of the orthocenters of the medial triangles of A′C′E′ and B′D′F ′ — that is, their circumcenters. ¶ Author’s solution Call M N P and U V W the medial triangles of ACE and BDF . 14 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 M N P U V W A C E B D F X Y Z Claim — In trapezoid ABDE, the perpendicular bisector of XY is the same as the perpendicular bisector of the midline W N . Proof. This is true for any trapezoid: because W X = 1 2 AB = Y N . Claim — The points V , W , M , N are cyclic. Proof. By power of a point from Y , since W Y · Y N = 1 2 DE · 1 2 AB = 1 2 EF · 1 2 BC = V Y · Y M. Applying all the cyclic variations of the above two claims, it follows that all six points U , V , W , M , N , P are concyclic, and the center of that circle coincides with the circumcenter of △XY Z. Remark. It is also possible to implement ideas from the first solution here, by showing all six midpoints have equal power to (XY Z). Claim — The orthocenter of XY Z is the midpoint of the circumcenters of △ACE and △BDF . Proof. Apply complex numbers with the unit circle coinciding with the circumcircle of N V P W M U . Then orthocenter(XY Z) = x + y + z = a + b + c + d + e + f 2 circumcenter(ACE) = orthocenter(M N P ) 15 USAMO 2021 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 = m + n + p = c + e 2 + e + a 2 + a + c 2 = a + c + e circumcenter(BDF ) = orthocenter(U V W ) = u + v + w = d + f 2 + f + b 2 + b + d 2 = b + d + f. 16","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
