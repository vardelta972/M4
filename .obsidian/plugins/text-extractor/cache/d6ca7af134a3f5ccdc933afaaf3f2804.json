(Weighted) AM-GM is perhaps the most generally useful inequality but requires some skill to use because expressions xi and weights wi must be chosen carefully. One guide for ﬁguring this out is that the xi must all be equal at the equality cases of the inequality that you are trying to prove. • “Bunching”: One important application of weighted AM-GM is to inequalities of symmetric polynomials. Given two sequences a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn satisfying – a1 + a2 + · · · + ai ≥ b1 + b2 + · · · + bi for any i – a1 + a2 + · · · + an = b1 + b2 + · · · + bn, weighted AM-GM can be used to obtain ∑ sym xa1 1 · · · xan n ≥ ∑ sym xb1 1 · · · xbn n for any nonnegative reals x1, . . . , xn. • Schur’s inequality: If x, y, z are nonnegative reals and r > 0, then xr(x − y)(x − z) + yr(y − z)(y − x) + zr(z − x)(z − y) ≥ 0 (equality when x = y = z OR two of x, y, z are equal and the third is zero). • Cauchy-Schwarz: For any real numbers x1, . . . , xn, y1, . . . , yn, (x2 1 + · · · + x2 n)(y2 1 + · · · + y2 n) ≥ (x1y1 + · · · + xnyn) 2 (equality when the two sequences are proportional). Like weighted AM-GM, this inequality is very useful but is often tricky to ﬁgure out how to use. It is again useful to think about equality cases. 1 2 Other Techniques • Smoothing: Suppose you are trying to prove a symmetric inequality of the form f (x1, . . . , xn) ≥ C subject to the constraint x1 + · · · + xn = ns, and there is equality when x1 = · · · = xn = s. Then one can try to “smooth” the xi together by replacing two of the variables, say x1 < s and x2 > s, with s and x1 + x2 − s. If one can show that f (x1, x2, x3, . . . , xn) ≥ f (s, x1 + x2 − s, x3, . . . , xn), then by repeating this smoothing procedure one has a chain of inequalities f (x1, . . . , xn) ≥ · · · ≥ f (s, s, . . . , s) = C. Variants: unsmoothing, linear functions achieve extremal values at endpoints. • Substitutions: Finding a clever change of variables can simplify an inequality tremendously. Here are a few standard ones to keep in mind: – Trig substitutions: if you see something like √1 ± x2, substituting x = sin θ or x = tan θ is worth thinking about to eliminate the square root. – Sides of a triangle: Some three-variable inequalities are stated with the constraint that a, b, c are length of sides of a triangle. To eliminate this constraint, set a = y + z, b = z + x, c = x + y. – Cyclic substitution: In three variable inequalities, sometimes the change of variables x = a b , y = b c , z = c a is helpful. Note that this substitution doesn’t always make sense! 3 Problems 1. Prove that for any positive reals a, b, c, a 3 bc + b 3 ca + c 3 ab ≥ a + b + c. 2.
