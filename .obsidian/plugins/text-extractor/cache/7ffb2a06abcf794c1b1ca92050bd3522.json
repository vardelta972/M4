{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/Calculus/Handouts/limits-of-functions.pdf","text":"Chapter 6 Limits of Functions In this chapter, we deﬁne limits of functions and describe their properties. 6.1. Limits We begin with the ✏-\u0000 deﬁnition of the limit of a function. Deﬁnition 6.1. Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R, and suppose that c 2 R is an accumulation point of A.Then lim x!c f (x)= L if for every ✏ > 0there existsa \u0000 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. We also denote limits by the ‘arrow’ notation f (x) ! L as x ! c, and often leave it to be implicitly understood that x 2 A is restricted to the domain of f . Note that it follows directly from the deﬁnition that lim x!c f (x)= L if and only if lim x!c |f (x) \u0000 L| =0. In deﬁning a limit as x ! c, we do not consider what happens when x = c, and a function needn’t be deﬁned at c for its limit to exist. This is the case, for example, when we deﬁne the derivative of a function as a limit of its di↵erence quotients. Moreover, even if a function is deﬁned at c and its limit as x ! c exists, the value of the function need not equal the limit. In fact, the condition that lim x!c f (x)= f (c) deﬁnes the continuity of f at c. We study continuous functions in Chapter 7. Example 6.2. Let A =[0, 1) \\{9} and deﬁne f : A ! R by f (x)= x \u0000 9 px \u0000 3 . 109 110 6. Limits of Functions We claim that lim x!9 f (x)=6. To prove this, let ✏ > 0 be given. If x 2 A,then px \u0000 3 6= 0, and dividing this factor into the numerator we get f (x)= px + 3. It follows that |f (x) \u0000 6| = \u0000 \u0000px \u0000 3\u0000 \u0000 = \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 9 px +3 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000  1 3 |x \u0000 9|. Thus, if \u0000 =3✏,then x 2 A and |x \u0000 9| < \u0000 implies that |f (x) \u0000 6| < ✏. Like the limits of sequences, limits of functions are unique. Proposition 6.3. The limit of a function is unique if it exists. Proof. Suppose that f : A ! R and c 2 R is an accumulation point of A ⇢ R. Assume that lim x!c f (x)= L 1 , lim x!c f (x)= L 2 where L 1 ,L 2 2 R. For every ✏ > 0there exist \u0000 1 , \u0000 2 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 1 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L 1 | < ✏/2, 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 2 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L 2 | < ✏/2. Let \u0000 =min(\u0000 1 , \u0000 2 ) > 0. Then, since c is an accumulation point of A,there exists x 2 A such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000. It follows that |L 1 \u0000 L 2 |  |L 1 \u0000 f (x)| + |f (x) \u0000 L 2 | < ✏. Since this holds for arbitrary ✏ > 0, we must have L 1 = L 2 . ⇤ Note that in this proof we used the requirement in the deﬁnition of a limit that c is an accumulation point of A. The limit deﬁnition would be vacuous if it was applied to a non-accumulation point, and in that case every L 2 R would be a limit. We can rephrase the ✏-\u0000 deﬁnition of limits in terms of neighborhoods. Recall from Deﬁnition 5.6 that a set V ⇢ R is a neighborhood of c 2 R if V \u0000 (c \u0000 \u0000, c + \u0000) for some \u0000 > 0, and (c \u0000 \u0000, c + \u0000) is called a \u0000-neighborhood of c. Deﬁnition 6.4. Aset U ⇢ R is a punctured (or deleted) neighborhood of c 2 R if U \u0000 (c \u0000 \u0000, c) [ (c, c + \u0000) for some \u0000 > 0. The set (c \u0000 \u0000, c) [ (c, c + \u0000) is called a punctured (or deleted) \u0000-neighborhood of c. That is, a punctured neighborhood of c is a neighborhood of c with the point c itself removed. Deﬁnition 6.5. Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R, and suppose that c 2 R is an accumulation point of A.Then lim x!c f (x)= L if and only if for every neighborhood V of L, there is a punctured neighborhood U of c such that x 2 A \\ U implies that f (x) 2 V. 6.1. Limits 111 This is essentially a rewording of the ✏-\u0000 deﬁnition. If Deﬁnition 6.1 holds and V is a neighborhood of L,then V contains an ✏-neighborhood of L,so there is a punctured \u0000-neighborhood U of c such that f maps U \\ A into V ,which veriﬁes Deﬁnition 6.5. Conversely, if Deﬁnition 6.5 holds and ✏ > 0, then V =(L \u0000 ✏, L + ✏) is a neighborhood of L, so there is a punctured neighborhood U of c such that f maps U \\ A into V , and U contains a punctured \u0000-neighborhood of c,which veriﬁes Deﬁnition 6.1. The next theorem gives an equivalent sequential characterization of the limit. Theorem 6.6. Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R, and suppose that c 2 R is an accumulation point of A.Then lim x!c f (x)= L if and only if lim n!1 f (x n )= L. for every sequence (x n )in A with x n 6= c for all n 2 N such that lim n!1 x n = c. Proof. First assume that the limit exists and is equal to L. Suppose that (x n )is any sequence in A with x n 6= c that converges to c, and let ✏ > 0 be given. From Deﬁnition 6.1, there exists \u0000 > 0 such that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏ whenever 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000, and since x n ! c there exists N 2 N such that 0 < |x n \u0000 c| < \u0000 for all n>N .It follows that |f (x n ) \u0000 L| < ✏ whenever n> N ,so f (x n ) ! L as n !1. To prove the converse, assume that the limit does not exist or is not equal to L. Then there is an ✏ 0 > 0 such that for every \u0000 > 0 there is a point x 2 A with 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 but |f (x) \u0000 L| \u0000 ✏ 0 . Therefore, for every n 2 N there is an x n 2 A such that 0 < |x n \u0000 c| < 1 n , |f (x n ) \u0000 L| \u0000 ✏ 0 . It follows that x n 6= c and x n ! c,but f (x n ) 6! L, so the sequential condition does not hold. This proves the result. ⇤ A non-existence proof for a limit directly from Deﬁnition 6.1 is often awkward. (One has to show that for every L 2 R there exists ✏ 0 > 0 such that for every \u0000 > 0 there exists x 2 A with 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and |f (x) \u0000 L| \u0000 ✏ 0 .) The previous theorem gives a convenient way to show that a limit of a function does not exist. Corollary 6.7. Suppose that f : A ! R and c 2 R is an accumulation point of A. Then lim x!c f (x) does not exist if either of the following conditions holds: (1) There are sequences (x n ), (y n )in A with x n ,y n 6= c such that lim n!1 x n =lim n!1 y n = c, but lim n!1 f (x n ) 6=lim n!1 f (y n ). (2) There is a sequence (x n )in A with x n 6= c such that lim n!1 x n = c but the sequence (f (x n )) diverges. 112 6.

Aplot ofthefunction y =sin(1/x), with the hyperbola y =1/x shown in red, and a detail near the origin. Example 6.8. Deﬁne the sign function sgn : R ! R by sgn x = 8 >< >: 1if x> 0, 0if x = 0, \u00001if x< 0, Then the limit lim x!0 sgn x doesn’t exist. To prove this, note that (1/n) is a non-zero sequence such that 1/n ! 0 and sgn(1/n) ! 1 as n !1,while (\u00001/n) is a non-zero sequence such that \u00001/n ! 0 and sgn(\u00001/n) !\u00001 as n !1. Since the sequences of sgn-values have di↵erent limits, Corollary 6.7 implies that the limit does not exist. Example 6.9. The limit lim x!0 1 x , corresponding to the function f : R \\{0} ! R given by f (x)=1/x,doesn’t exist. For example, if (x n ) is the non-zero sequence given by x n =1/n,then 1/n ! 0but the sequence of values (n) diverges to 1. Example 6.10. The limit lim x!0 sin ✓ 1 x ◆ , corresponding to the function f : R \\{0} ! R given by f (x)= sin(1/x), doesn’t exist. (See Figure 1.) For example, the non-zero sequences (x n ), (y n )deﬁned by x n = 1 2⇡n ,y n = 1 2⇡n + ⇡/2 both converge to zero as n !1,but thelimits lim n!1 f (x n )=0, lim n!1 f (y n )=1 are di↵erent. 6.1. Limits 113 Like sequences, functions must satisfy a boundedness condition if their limit is to exist. Before stating this condition, we deﬁne the supremum and inﬁmum of a function, which are the supremum or inﬁmum of its range. Deﬁnition 6.11. If f : A ! R is a real-valued function, then sup A f =sup {f (x): x 2 A} , inf A f =inf {f (x): x 2 A} . A function is bounded if its range is bounded. Deﬁnition 6.12. If f : A ! R,then f is bounded from above if sup A f is ﬁnite, bounded from below if inf A f is ﬁnite, and bounded if both are ﬁnite. A function that is not bounded is said to be unbounded. Example 6.13. If f :[0, 2] ! R is deﬁned by f (x)= x 2 ,then sup [0,2] f =4, inf [0,2] f =0, so f is bounded. Example 6.14. If f :(0, 1] ! R is deﬁned by f (x)=1/x,then sup (0,1] f = 1, inf (0,1] f =1, so f is bounded from below, not bounded from above, and unbounded. Note that if we extend f to a function g :[0, 1] ! R by deﬁning, for example, g(x)= (1/x if 0 <x  1, 0if x =0, then g is still unbounded on [0, 1]. Equivalently, a function f : A ! R is bounded if sup A |f | is ﬁnite, meaning that there exists M \u0000 0 such that |f (x)|  M for every x 2 A. If B ⇢ A, then we say that f is bounded from above on B if sup B f is ﬁnite, with similar terminology for bounded from below on B, and bounded on B. Example 6.15. The function f :(0, 1] ! R deﬁned by f (x)=1/x is unbounded, but it is bounded on every interval [\u0000, 1] with 0 < \u0000 < 1. The function g : R ! R deﬁned by g(x)= x 2 is unbounded, but it is bounded on every ﬁnite interval [a, b]. We also introduce a notion of being bounded near a point. Deﬁnition 6.16. Suppose that f : A ! R and c is an accumulation point of A. Then f is locally bounded at c if there is a neighborhood U of c such that f is bounded on A \\ U . Example 6.17. The function f :(0, 1] ! R deﬁned by f (x)= 1/x is locally bounded at every 0 <c  1, but it is not locally bounded at 0. Proposition 6.18. Suppose that f : A ! R and c is an accumulation point of A. If lim x!c f (x)exists, then f is locally bounded at c. 114 6. Limits of Functions Proof. Let lim x!c f (x)= L. Taking ✏ = 1 in the deﬁnition of the limit, we get that there exists a \u0000 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < 1. Let U =(c \u0000 \u0000, c + \u0000). If x 2 A \\ U and x 6= c,then |f (x)|  |f (x) \u0000 L| + |L| < 1+ |L|, so f is bounded on A \\ U .(If c 2 A,then |f |  max{1+ |L|, |f (c)|} on A \\ U .) ⇤ As for sequences, boundedness is a necessary but not su\u0000cient condition for the existence of a limit. Example 6.19. The limit lim x!0 1 x , considered in Example 6.9 doesn’t exist because the function f : R \\{0} ! R given by f (x)= 1/x is not locally bounded at 0. Example 6.20. The function f : R \\{0} ! R deﬁned by f (x)=sin ✓ 1 x ◆ is bounded, but lim x!0 f (x)doesn’texist. 6.2. Left, right, and inﬁnite limits We can deﬁne other kinds of limits in an obvious way. We list some of them here and give examples, whose proofs are left as an exercise. All these deﬁnitions can be combined in various ways and have obvious equivalent sequential characterizations. Deﬁnition 6.21 (Right and left limits). Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R.If c 2 R is an accumulation point of {x 2 A : x>c},then f has the right limit lim x!c + f (x)= L, if for every ✏ > 0there existsa \u0000 > 0 such that c<x <c + \u0000 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. If c 2 R is an accumulation point of {x 2 A : x<c},then f has the left limit lim x!c \u0000 f (x)= L, if for every ✏ > 0there existsa \u0000 > 0 such that c \u0000 \u0000 < x < c and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. Equivalently, the right limit of f is the limit of the restriction f | A + of f to the set A + = {x 2 A : x>c}, lim x!c + f (x)= lim x!c f | A + (x), and analogously for the left limit. 6.2. Left, right, and inﬁnite limits 115 Example 6.22. For the sign function in Example 6.8, we have lim x!0 + sgn x =1, lim x!0 \u0000 sgn x = \u00001, although the corresponding limit does not exist. The existence and equality of the left and right limits implies the existence of the limit. Proposition 6.23. Suppose that f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R, and c 2 R is an accumulation point of both {x 2 A : x>c} and {x 2 A : x<c}.Then lim x!c f (x)= L if and only if lim x!c + f (x)= lim x!c \u0000 f (x)= L. Proof. It follows immediately from the deﬁnitions that the existence of the limit implies the existence of the left and right limits with the same value. Conversely, if both left and right limits exists and are equal to L, then given ✏ > 0, there exist \u0000 1 > 0 and \u0000 2 > 0 such that c \u0000 \u0000 1 <x< c and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏, c<x <c + \u0000 2 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. Choosing \u0000 =min(\u0000 1 , \u0000 2 ) > 0, we get that |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏, which show that the limit exists. ⇤ Next we introduce some convenient deﬁnitions for various kinds of limits involv- ing inﬁnity. We emphasize that 1 and \u00001 are not real numbers (what is sin 1, for example?) and all these deﬁnition have precise translations into statements that involve only real numbers. Deﬁnition 6.24 (Limits as x ! ±1). Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R.If A is not bounded from above, then lim x!1 f (x)= L if for every ✏ > 0 there exists an M 2 R such that x>M and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. If A is not bounded from below, then lim x!\u00001 f (x)= L if for every ✏ > 0 there exists an m 2 R such that x<m and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏. 116 6. Limits of Functions Sometimes we write +1 instead of 1 to indicate that it denotes arbitrarily large, positive values, while \u00001 denotes arbitrarily large, negative values. It follows from the deﬁnitions that lim x!1 f (x)= lim t!0 + f ✓ 1 t ◆ , lim x!\u00001 f (x)= lim t!0 \u0000 f ✓ 1 t ◆ , and it is often useful to convert one of these limits into the other. Example 6.25. We have lim x!1 x p1+ x 2 =1, lim x!\u00001 x p1+ x 2 = \u00001. Deﬁnition 6.26 (Divergence to ±1). Let f : A ! R,where A ⇢ R, and suppose that c 2 R is an accumulation point of A.Then lim x!c f (x)= 1 if for every M 2 R there exists a \u0000 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A implies that f (x) >M , and lim x!c f (x)= \u00001 if for every m 2 R there exists a \u0000 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A implies that f (x) < m. The notation lim x!c f (x)= ±1 is simply shorthand for the property stated in this deﬁnition; it does not mean that the limit exists, and we say that f diverges to ±1. Example 6.27. We have lim x!0 1 x 2 = 1, lim x!1 1 x 2 =0. Example 6.28. We have lim x!0 + 1 x = 1, lim x!0 \u0000 1 x = \u00001. How would you deﬁne these statements precisely? Note that lim x!0 1 x 6= ±1, since 1/x takes arbitrarily large positive (if x> 0) and negative (if x< 0) values in every two-sided neighborhood of 0. Example 6.29. None of the limits lim x!0 + 1 x sin ✓ 1 x ◆ , lim x!0 \u0000 1 x sin ✓ 1 x ◆ , lim x!0 1 x sin ✓ 1 x ◆ is 1 or \u00001,since (1/x)sin(1/x) oscillates between arbitrarily large positive and negative values in every one-sided or two-sided neighborhood of 0. 6.3. Properties of limits 117 Example 6.30. We have lim x!1 ✓ 1 x \u0000 x 3 ◆ = \u00001, lim x!\u00001 ✓ 1 x \u0000 x 3 ◆ = 1. How would you deﬁne these statements precisely and prove them? 6.3. Properties of limits The properties of limits of functions follow from the corresponding properties of sequences and the sequential characterization of the limit in Theorem 6.6. We can also prove them directly from the ✏-\u0000 deﬁnition of the limit. 6.3.1. Order properties. As for limits of sequences, limits of functions preserve (non-strict) inequalities. Theorem 6.31. Suppose that f, g : A ! R and c is an accumulation point of A. If f (x)  g(x) for all x 2 A, and lim x!c f (x), lim x!c g(x)exist, then lim x!c f (x)  lim x!c g(x). Proof. Let lim x!c f (x)= L, lim x!c g(x)= M. Suppose for contradiction that L>M , and let ✏ = 1 2 (L \u0000 M ) > 0. From the deﬁnition of the limit, there exist \u0000 1 , \u0000 2 > 0 such that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏ if x 2 A and 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 1 , |g(x) \u0000 M | < ✏ if x 2 A and 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 2 . Let \u0000 =min(\u0000 1 , \u0000 2 ). Since c is an accumulation point of A,there exists x 2 A such that 0 < |x \u0000 a| < \u0000, and it follows that f (x) \u0000 g(x)= [f (x) \u0000 L]+ L \u0000 M +[M \u0000 g(x)] >L \u0000 M \u0000 2✏ > 0, which contradicts the assumption that f (x)  g(x). ⇤ Finally, we state a useful “sandwich” or “squeeze” criterion for the existence of alimit. Theorem 6.32. Suppose that f, g, h : A ! R and c is an accumulation point of A.If f (x)  g(x)  h(x) for all x 2 A and lim x!c f (x)= lim x!c h(x)= L, 118 6. Limits of Functions then the limit of g(x) as x ! c exists and lim x!c g(x)= L. We leave the proof as an exercise. We often use this result, without comment, in the following way: If 0  f (x)  g(x) or |f (x)|  g(x) and g(x) ! 0 as x ! c,then f (x) ! 0 as x ! c. It is essential for the bounding functions f , h in Theorem 6.32 to have the same limit. Example 6.33. We have \u00001  sin ✓ 1 x ◆  1 for all x 6=0 and lim x!0 (\u00001) = \u00001, lim x!0 1=1, but lim x!0 sin ✓ 1 x ◆ does not exist. 6.3.2. Algebraic properties. Limits of functions respect algebraic operations. Theorem 6.34. Suppose that f, g : A ! R, c is an accumulation point of A, and the limits lim x!c f (x)= L, lim x!c g(x)= M exist. Then lim x!c kf (x)= kL for every k 2 R, lim x!c [f (x)+ g(x)] = L + M, lim x!c [f (x)g(x)] = LM , lim x!c f (x) g(x) = L M if M 6=0. Proof. We prove the results for sums and products from the deﬁnition of the limit, and leave the remaining proofs as an exercise. All of the results also follow from the corresponding results for sequences. First, we consider the limit of f + g.Given ✏ > 0, choose \u0000 1 , \u0000 2 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 1 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏/2, 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 2 and x 2 A implies that |g(x) \u0000 M | < ✏/2, and let \u0000 =min(\u0000 1 , \u0000 2 ) > 0. Then 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 implies that |f (x)+ g(x) \u0000 (L + M )|  |f (x) \u0000 L| + |g(x) \u0000 M | < ✏, which proves that lim(f + g)=lim f +lim g. To prove the result for the limit of the product, ﬁrst note that from the local boundedness of functions with a limit (Proposition 6.18) there exists \u0000 0 > 0 and 6.3. Properties of limits 119 K> 0 such that |g(x)|  K for all x 2 A with 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 0 . Choose \u0000 1 , \u0000 2 > 0 such that 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 1 and x 2 A implies that |f (x) \u0000 L| < ✏/(2K ), 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 2 and x 2 A implies that |g(x) \u0000 M | < ✏/(2|L| + 1). Let \u0000 =min(\u0000 0 , \u0000 1 , \u0000 2 ) > 0. Then for 0 < |x \u0000 c| < \u0000 and x 2 A, |f (x)g(x) \u0000 LM | = |(f (x) \u0000 L) g(x)+ L (g(x) \u0000 M )|  |f (x) \u0000 L||g(x)| + |L||g(x) \u0000 M | < ✏ 2K · K + |L|· ✏ 2|L| +1 < ✏, which proves that lim(fg)=lim f lim g. ⇤","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
