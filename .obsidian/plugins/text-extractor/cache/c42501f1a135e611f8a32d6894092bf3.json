There is an interesting property of complex numbers called Euler’s Formula and it says the following. e iθ = cos(θ) + i sin(θ) θ is called the argument of z sometimes called Arg(z). There is also a consequence of this formula called Demoivre’s Theorem. e niθ = (cos(θ) + i sin(θ)) n 3 Solution to Problems 1. This problem is disguised as a combinatorics problem, but it is really a complex numbers problem. This problem asks to ﬁnd the sum of the coeﬃcients of (1 + x)99 for all powers of x 1 divisible by 3. For a polynomial, P (x), the sum of the coeﬃcients for all powers divisible by 1 is just P (1) and the sum of the coeﬃcients for all powers divisible by 2 is just P (1)+P (−1) 2 , but what is it it for powers divisible by 3 or more? This brings complex numbers onto the ﬁeld. It can be shown that m−1∑ k=0 e 2niπk/m = 0 for m ∤ n. Therefore in our problem 1n + en2iπ/3 + en4iπ/3 = 0 for 3 ∤ n and 1n +en2iπ/3 +en4iπ/3 = 3 for 3 | n. Then the sum of the coeﬃcients for all powers divisible by 3 is just P (1)+P (e2iπ/3)+P (e4iπ/3) 3 and in this problem P (x) = (1 + x)99. 299 + (1 + e2iπ/3)99 + (1 + e4iπ/3)99 3 = 299 + (eiπ/3)99 + (e−iπ/3)99 3 = 299 + 2 cos(33π) 3 = 299 − 2 3 → (2, 99, −2, 3). 2. This problem when using complex numbers nicely evaluates to a geometric series, because cos(kx) 3k = ℜ( eix 3 )k. Therefore the sum is ℜ e2007ix 32007 − 1 eix 3 − 1 = ℜ ( e2007ix 32007 − 1)(cos(x)/3 − 1 − i sin(x)/3 (cos(x)/3 − 1)2 + (sin(x)/3)2 = cos(2006x) 32008 − cos(x) 3 − cos 2007x 32007 + 1 (cos(x)/3 − 1)2 + (sin(x)/3)2 = 5 6 + 5 2·32008 7/9 = 15 14 32007 + 1 32007 → (14, 3 2007) 4 Problems 1.
