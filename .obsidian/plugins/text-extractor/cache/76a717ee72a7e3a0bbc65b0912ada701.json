Similarly y + z 2 < √ yz + 1 and z + x 2 < √ zx + 1. Adding these three inequalities we get the result. Source: Russia 2004. A2. Label all possible pairs of points in M from 1 to K = ( n 2 ). Look at an arbitrary pair i of points Ai, Bi in M and consider the set Ci of all circles passing through the two points in the pair and through at least one other point in M . The number of circles in Ci is mi ≥ 2, since not all points lie on a circle. Label the circles from ωi 1 to ωi mi. Let Si = f (Ai) + f (Bi) and S = ∑ P ∈M f (P ). We have: S = [ mi∑ j=1 ∑ P ∈ωi mj f (P )] − (mi − 1)Si = (1 − mi)Si ⇒ Si = S 1 − mi (1) Assume S ̸= 0. Equation (1) holds for all i hence n−1 = K∑ i=1 Si S = K∑ i=1 1 1 − mi . But 1−mi < 0 for all i which gives n − 1 < 0, a contradiction. Hence S = 0, and equation (1) implies Si = 0 for all i, hence f (P ) = 0 for all points P . Source: Romania 1998. A3. Let bi = a1 + ... + ai. Then b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... ≤ bn. For any positive integers l < k with m = k − l: al+1 + al+2 + . . . + ak m = bk − bl k − l Consider points B0(0, 0), B1(1, b1), B2(2, b2)..., Bn(n, bn) in the coordinate plane. Then bk − bl k − l is equal to the tangent of the angle formed by line BkBl and the x−axis. The condition mk > x is equivalent to the condition that the line lk passing through Bk with the slope angle of tan−1(x) lies above at least one point Bl for l < k. We will call such a point Bk good. Also a1 + a2 + . . . + an x = bn x , which is the distance between the point (n, 0) and the point of intersection of line ln with the x−axis. Let us prove by induction on n that this distance is greater than the number of good points. The base case is clear. If point Bn is not good, remove it; then the number of good points does not change and the distance decreases, since bn−1 ≤ bn. If Bn is good, let k be the largest integer such that Bk lies below ln. Remove points Bk+1 through Bn; the number of good points will then decrease by n − k, and the distance will decrease by more than n − k, which ﬁnishes the induction step.

If all integers in the left-most column are greater than 1, subtract 1 from all entries in the column. Otherwise, multiply by 2 all entries in every row containing a 1 in the column. Repeat this procedure until all entries in the left-most column are 1. The process will eventually stop since the diﬀerence between the smallest and the greatest entries in the column is non-decreasing, and it cannot stay constant forever. Once all entries in the left-most column are 1, subtract 1 from every entry in the column, so that the left-most column contains all zeroes. Once all entries in the left-most column are 0, perform the same procedure on the next column, and so on. Source: Netherlands 1999. C2. Denote by P1 the left-most right endpoint of an interval. Throw away all intervals containing P1, and let P2 be the left-most right endpoint of the remaining intervals. Deﬁne P3, P4 . . . in the same way until all intervals have been thrown away. Let Pm be the last point deﬁned. The intervals with the right endpoints P1, P2, . . . , Pm cannot intersect, hence m ≤ k − 1. Every interval that has been thrown away contains at least one of the chosen points, hence every interval in the collection contains one of the chosen points. C3. Consider a graph where the vertices are the towns, and edges are the roads. We call a directed path P1, P2, . . . , Pn Hamiltonian if the path contains every vertex in the graph exactly once. We call such a Hamiltonian path adjacent to another Hamiltonian path, if the latter path can be obtained from the ﬁrst one by inserting edge PnPi and deleting edge PiPi+1 for i > 1, so that the latter path is P1, P2, . . . , Pi, Pn, Pn−1, . . . , Pi+1. Since Pn is adjacent to exactly 3 other vertices, every Hamiltonian path is adjacent to two paths or to one path, the latter case hap- pening only if Pn is adjacent to P1. (1) Consider a graph G where vertices are the paths, and edges join adjacent paths. Look at the cycle along which the tourist traveled the ﬁrst time. Remove one edge in the cycle to get a Hamiltonian path X = S1, S2, . . . , Sn. Look at the subgraph of G which contains path X and all paths that can be reached from X by following the edges of G. This subgraph must be itself a path because of (1). Let Y = T1, T2, . . . , Tn be the endpoint of this path diﬀerent from X. Then Tn is adjacent to T1, so path Y can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle. By deﬁnition of adjacency of Hamiltonian paths, T1 = S1, T2 = S2, hence the new cycle is not the reverse of the old one. Since X ̸= Y , the new cycle is diﬀerent from the old one, hence it satisﬁes the required conditions. Source: Japan 2004 Comment: The result also holds if we only assume that all vertices in the graph have odd degree. Think about how the above solution needs to be modiﬁed for this more general problem. 4 of 8 Winter Camp 2011 Buﬀet Problems 2.3 Geometry G1. Solution 1: Let S be the intersection of AR with the circumcircle of △P AQ. Then: ∠P SA = ∠AQP = 1 2 ∠ACP = 1 2 ∠ARP ⇒ ∠P SA = ∠SP R ⇒ RP = RS Similarly RQ = RS. Hence RP = RQ. A B C P Q R S Solution 2: Since P ACR and QABR are cyclic, it follows that: ∠ARC = ∠AP C = ∠ABC 2 ; ∠ARB = ∠AQB = ∠BCA 2 ∠P RB = 180 ◦ − ∠P AC − ∠CRB = 180 ◦ − ∠ABC 2 − −∠CAB − ∠BCA 2 − ∠ABC 2 = ∠BCA 2 = ∠BRA Consider △P AR. By Ceva’s Theorem in Sine Form applied to concurrent cevians P B, AB, RB, sin(∠RP B) sin(∠AP B) · sin(∠P AB) sin(∠RAB) · sin(∠ARB) sin(∠P RB) = 1 Since ∠P AB = ∠BP A, ∠P RB = ∠BRA, it follows that sin(∠BP R) = sin(∠BAR). We cannot have ∠BP R + ∠BAR = 180◦, hence ∠BP R = ∠BAR ⇒ ∠P AR = ∠AP R and P R = AR. Similarly RQ = AR, so RP = RQ. G2. Let P Q and AD intersect at T . By Menelaus Theorem in △ABD applied to points T, K, Q: AK KB · BQ QD · DT T A = −1 ⇒ BQ QD · DT T A = −1 (2) By Menelaus Theorem in △ACD applied to collinear points T, P, M : AP P C · CM M D · DT T A = −1 ⇒ AP P C · DT T A = −1 (3) (We use directed lengths). From equations (3), (4) it follows that BQ QD = AP P C . Similarly it follows that AR RC = DS SB . 5 of 8 Winter Camp 2011 Buﬀet Problems A B C D K L M N P Q R S Since BQ QD = AP P C , AP · P C = BQ · QD, we have |AP | = |BQ|, |P C| = |QD|, and |AC| = |BD|. Since |AC| = |BD|, BQ QD = AP P C we have |AR| = |DS|, |RC| = |SB|. Then AR · RC = BS · SD, as required. Source: Mathlinks. G3. Lemma: Points A, C, B, D lie on a line in this order. P is a point not on on this line. Then any two of the following conditions imply the third: 1. CA CB · DB DA = −1. 2. P B is the angle bisector of ∠CP D. 3. AP ⊥ P B. Proof: Assume 2 and 3 hold. Then P A, P B are the external and internal angle bisectors of ∠CP D, hence: |CA| |DA| = |CP | |DP | = |CB| |DB| ⇒ CA CB · DB DA = −1 Assume 1 and 2 hold. Let A′ be a point on line CD such that A′C < A′D and A′P ⊥ P B. Then CA′ CB · DB DA′ = −1. Since 1 holds, it follows that A ≡ A′ and AP ⊥ P B. Assume 1 and 3 hold. Let C′ be on line segment AB such that P B is the angle bisector of ∠C′P D. Since 3 holds, it follows that C′A C′B · DB DA = −1. Since 1 holds, it follows that C ≡ C′ and P B is the angle bisector of ∠CP D. The lemma is proved. Now back to the problem. It suﬃces to show that JP is the angle bisector of ∠AJC and ∠BJD. Let Q = AP ∩ EF, Q′ = BD ∩ EF . Using the lemma, it suﬃces to prove AQ QC = AP P C , BP P D = BQ′ Q′D By Menelaus’ Theorem on ∆ACF via the three collinear points B, P, D, we have AP P C · CB BF · F D DA = 1. By Ceva’s Theorem on ∆ACF via the three concurrent lines AB, CD, F Q, we have AQ QC · CB BF · F D DA = 1. 6 of 8 Winter Camp 2011 Buﬀet Problems A B C D E F P J Q Q’ Hence, AP P C = AQ QC . Similarly, BP P D = BQ′ Q′D . This completes the problem. Source: Mathlinks. Comment: Consider four points A, C, B, D, occurring on a line in this order. These points are called harmonic iﬀ (A, B; C, D) = CA CB · DB DA = −1. Let P be a point not collinear with A, B, C, D; we deﬁne the pencil P (A, B, C, D) to be made up of 4 lines P A, P B, P C, P D. There are a few useful results involving harmonic points that make them a powerful geometry tool. Fact: A pencil P (A, B, C, D) is given. The lines P A, P B, P C, P D intersect a line l at A′, B′, C′, D′ respectively. Then (A′, B′; C′, D′) = (A, B; C, D). Fact: In △ABC, points D, E, F are on sides BC, CA, AB. Let F E intersect BC at G. Then (B, C; D, G) is harmonic iﬀ AD, BE, CF are concurrent. Fact: The lemma used in the solution. Condition 1 is equivalent to (A, B; C, D) = −1. 2.4 Number Theory N1. Factor the right side: 3y2 = x(x+1)(x2 −x+1). Then every two of the terms x, x+1, x2 −x+1 are either coprime, or share a factor of 3. Hence each of the terms is a perfect square or 3 times a perfect square. Since x, x + 1 cannot both be perfect squares, it follows that exactly one of these two terms is 3 times a perfect square, and the other term is not divisible by 3. Hence x2 − x + 1 must be a perfect square. But (x − 1)2 < x2 − x + 1 ≤ x2, with equality only when x = 1. However, x = 1 does not yield a positive integer solution for y. Source: South Korea 2004. N2. Let a = ⌊√ n⌋, b = ⌊ √n − a2⌋ + 1. We claim that m = a2 + b2 works. a2 ≤ n < (a + 1)2 ⇒ n − a2 ≤ 2a ≤ 2 √n (b − 1) 2 ≤ n − a 2 ⇒ b − 1 ≤ √ n − a2 ≤ √ 2 √n (b − 1) 2 ≤ n − a2 < b 2 ⇒ m − n = b 2 − (n − a2) ≤ 2b − 1 ≤ 2√2 4√n + 1 It is clear that 2√ 2 4√n + 1 < 3 4√n for n > 10000, and we are done.

Assume f (a) = f (b) for a ̸= b, then for every positive integer n, we have f (a) + f (n)|(a + n)k, f (b) + f (n)|(b + n)k. Since f (a) + f (n) = f (b) + f (n), it follows that f (a) + f (n) is a common divisor of (a + n)k and (b + n)k. Since gcd(a + n, b + n) = gcd(a + n, b − a), we can take n such that a + n is a prime greater than b − a, then gcd(a + n, b + n) = 1, and f (a) + f (n) cannot be a common divisor of (a + n)k and (b + n)k. Fix a positive integer m. For every n, f (n) + f (m)|(n + m)k, f (n) + f (m + 1)|(n + m + 1)k. Since gcd(m + n, m + n + 1) = 1, it follows that gcd(f (n) + f (m), f (n) + f (m + 1)) = gcd(f (n) + f (m), f (m + 1) − f (m)) = 1 (4) Assume there is a prime p dividing f (m + 1) − f (m). Let a be a positive integer such that pa > m. Let n = pa − m, then f (n) + f (m)|(n + m)k = pak, hence p|f (n) + f (m). But then p| gcd(f (n) + f (m), f (m + 1) − f (m)), contradicting (4). Hence f (m + 1) − f (m) = ±1. Since f is injective, f (m + 1) − f (m) is always 1 or always -1 for all m. Since f only takes positive values, f (m + 1) − f (m) = 1 for all positive integers m. Therefore for some non-negative integer c, f (n) = n + c, for all n. If c > 0, let p be a prime greater than 2c. Then f (1) + f (p − 1)|pk, hence p|f (1) + f (p − 1) = 2c + p, which is impossible since 0 < 2c < p. Hence c = 0 and the only solution is f (n) = n for all positive integers n.
