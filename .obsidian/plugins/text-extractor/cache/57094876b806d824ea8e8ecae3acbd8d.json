(1) Determine the polynomials P for which 16P (x2) = P (2x)2. (2) If P (x)2 is a polynomial in x2, then show that so is either P (x) or P (x)/x. (3) Find all polynomials P such that P (x)2 + P ( 1 x )2 = P (x2)P ( 1 x2 ) . (4) Are there non-linear polynomials P and Q such that P (Q(x)) = (x − 1)(x − 2)...(x − 15)? (5) Determine all polynomials P for which P (x) 2 − 2 = 2P (2x 2 − 1). (6) Find all polynomials satisfying P (x)2 − 1 = 4P (x2 − 4x + 1). (7) Find all polynomials P satisfying P (x2 + 1) = P (x) 2 + 1. (8) (IMO-04) Find all polynomials P (x) with real coeﬃcients that satisfy P (a − b) + P (b − c) + P (c − a) = 2P (a + b + c) for all triples a, b, c of real numbers such that ab + bc + ca = 0. 1 2 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-II AL˙I G ¨UREL Problem 1, Solution by Brian Hamrick: We claim that P is a mono- mial. If not, then let’s write P (x) = caxa + cbxb + ... where the two written terms are the ones with smallest powers. Now, let’s look at both sides of 16P (x2) = P (2x) 2. In the expansion of 16P (x2), the two lowest degree terms will have x2a and x2b, while in the expansion of P (2x)2, the two lowest degree terms will have x2a and x a+b, a contradiction since a ̸= b. We conclude that P has to be a monomial, as claimed. Then it is easy to see that P (x) is of the form 16 ( x 4 )n for some non-negative integer n □ Problem 2, Solution by John Berman: Suppose P (x) 2 is a polynomial in x2 and not all the powers of x in P (x) have the same parity. Let a and b be the smallest odd and even powers respectively appearing in P (x) with non-zero coeﬃcients ca and cb. Then a + b is odd and the coeﬃcient of xa+b in P (x) 2 is 2cacb ̸= 0, contradiction the fact that P (x) 2 is a polynomial in x2. We conclude that all the powers of x in P (x) have the same parity □ Problem 3, Solution by Justin Brereton: Let P (x) = anxn + ... + a1x + a0, where an ̸= 0. Comparing the coeﬃcient os x 2n on both sides of P (x) 2 + P ( 1 x )2 = P (x2)P ( 1 x2 ), we see that a2 n = a0an, hence a0 = an is also non-zero. Now, we will prove by induction, on k, that 2 k divides the degree of each term of P (x) for all non-negative integers k. Base case, k = 0 is clearly true. Assume the result for k and for k + 1 case, suppose on the contrary that there exists a term with degree an odd number times 2k. Let ajxj be such a term with smallest power. Then the expansion of the LHS of the polynomial equation contains 2aja0xj term but the expansion of the RHS contains only terms with powers that are multiples of 2k+1, contradiction. It follows that P has to be a constant polynomial. Then P (x) = c implies c2 + c2 = c 2 so P = 0 is the only solution □ Problem 4, Solution by Nicholas Triantatillou: If the answer is yes, then {degP, degQ} = {3, 5}. Suppose degP = 5 and degQ = 3. If a1, a2, ..., a5 are the roots of P (x), then we have (Q(x) − a1)...(Q(x) − a5) = (x−1)(x−2)...(x−15). So Q(x) can be written as (x−b1)(x−b2)(x−b3)+d in 5 diﬀerent ways where the 5 triples (b1, b2, b3) cover the integers from 1 up to 15. We note that in each of the 5 ways, the b1 + b2 + b3 values are the same, as well as the b1b2 + b2b3 + b3b1 values. So the b2 1 + b 2 2 + b2 3 values are the same as well. But these values modulo 4 show the number of odd terms, hence the number of odd bi’s are same in all the 5 triples, which is a contradiction since we have 8 odd numbers from 1 up to 15, which is not a multiple of 5. In the other case, degP = 3 and degQ = 5, Q(x) can be written as (x − b1)(x − b2)...(x − b5) + d in 3 diﬀerent ways and as above we ﬁnd that the b 2 1 + ... + b 2 5 values in each of these 3 ways are the same. Then this value has to be one third of 12 + 22 + ... + 152 = 1240, which is not divisible by 3. From the contradictions in both cases, conclude that the answer is no □ 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-II AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 5, Solution by Joshua Pfeﬀer: Let P (1) = l. Then l2 − 2l − 2 = 0. Suppose that P is not the constant polynomial. Then, by deﬁnition of l we can write P (x) − l = (x − 1)nR(x) where n ∈ Z + and R is a polynomial such that R(1) ̸= 0. Then the given equation in terms of R becomes: (x − 1) nR(x) 2 + 2lR(x) = 2 n+1(x + 1)nR(2x2 − 1). We deduce that R(1) = 0, a contradiction. Hence we conclude that the only polynomial solutions are the constant solutions P (x) = l, where l is a root of the quadratic equation l2 − 2l − 2 = 0 □ Problem 6, Solution by Taylor: Note that the constant polynomials P = 2 ± √5 work. Now assume that n = degP > 0. Comparing ﬁrst coef- ﬁcients of x2n terms and then xn+k terms on both sides of the polynomial equation, we deduce that the coeﬃcients of P are all rational numbers. However, we ﬁnd that P (α) = 2 ± √5 where α = 5+ √21 2 is a root of the equation α = α2 − 4α + 1. This is not possible because all the powers of α are rational linear combinations of 1 and √21, so is P (α) since the coeﬃcients of P are rational but 2 ± √5 is not in this form. We conclude that the two constant polynomials we had earlier are the only solutions □ Problem 7, Solution by Minseon Shin: Observe that P (x) 2 is a poly- nomial of x2. So in the expansion of P (x) 2, the odd powers of x disappear. We ﬁnd that all powers of x must have the same parity, hence P (x) is a polynomial of x2, or x times a polynomial of x2. In the latter case, we can write P (x) = xQ(x2 + 1) ⇒ yQ(y2 + 1) = (y − 1)Q(y) 2 + 1. Letting y = 1 gives, Q(2) = 1. Then y = 2 gives Q(5) = 1. In general, Q(k) = 1 implies that Q(k2 + 1) = 1. So the polynomial Q(x) − 1 has inﬁnitely many zeros, hence it is the zero polynomial and Q(x) ≡ 1 which gives P (x) ≡ x. In the former case, P (x) = Q(x2 + 1) and letting y = x2 + 1 we get Q(y2 + 1) = Q(y)2 + 1 which is the same polynomial equation that P satisﬁes with a polynomial with smaller degree now since deg(Q) = deg(P ) 2 . For P with deg(P ) > 0, this process will then end when Q(x) = x at some point. Letting P1(x) = x and Pn+1(x) = Pn(x2 + 1), we see that P has to be one of the polynomials Pn or one of the two constant polynomials P0 = 1±√5 2 □ Problem 8, Solution by Gye Hyun Baek: Let P (x) = rnxn + ... + r1x + r0, where n = degP . Also let (a, b, c) be such that ab + bc + ca = 0. Then note that (ta, tb, tc) has the same property for all t so Q(t) =∑n i=0 ri((a − b) i + (b − c) i + (c − a) i − 2(a + b + c)i)ti ≡ 0. Hence, whenever ri ̸= 0, we must have (a − b) i + (b − c)i + (c − a)i − 2(a + b + c) i = 0. Using the triple (a, b, c) = (2, 2, −1), we ﬁnd that i is even. Considering the triple (6, 3, −2) we get 3 i + 5 i + 8 i = 2 × 7 i. For i ≥ 6 this won’t be true because 8i > 2 × 7i for i ≥ 6. i = 0 doesn’t satisfy the equation either. On the other hand, check that i = 2 and i = 4 satisﬁes the relation (a − b) i + (b − c) i + (c − a) i = 2(a + b + c)i whenever ab + bc + ca = 0 so all the solutions are of the form P (x) = r4x4 + r2x2 □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
