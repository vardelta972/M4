In particular, if n is a prime p, we denote the set by Fp ∼= Z/pZ. Throughout this lecture, p will be assumed to be prime. We say that “a is equivalent to b modulo n” if the remainders when a and b are divided by n are equal and denote it by a ≡ b (mod n). 2 Integral Mods In this section, we work in Z/nZ; that is, the statement a = b in Z/nZ is equivalent to the statement a ≡ b (mod n) in Z. Addition, subtraction, and multiplication in Z/nZ are done similarly as in Z: Lemma 1. Z/nZ is a commutative ring; that is, an + bn = (a + b)n and anbn = (ab)n for a, b ∈ Z/nZ. An inverse of an element a is an element a −1 such that aa −1 = 1. For example, the inverse of 2 in Z/9Z is 5 because 2 · 5 = 1. Although elements in Z/nZ for n composite do not necessarily have an inverse - for instance, 3 does not have an inverse in Z/9Z - all nonzero elements of Z/pZ always have an inverse. Before we can prove this, however, we invoke a theorem of B´ezout: Theorem 2 (B´ezout). Let a and b be nonzero integers, and let d = gcd(a, b). Then there exist integers x and y such that ax + by = d. Using this theorem, we can now prove the aforementioned fact: Lemma 3. Every nonzero element of Fp has an inverse; furthermore, Fp is a ﬁeld. Proof. Let 1 ≤ a ≤ p − 1 be a nonzero element of Fp. Since a and p are relatively prime, there exist integers x and y such that ax + py = 1. Now if we write x = np + r for some integers n and 0 ≤ r ≤ p − 1, then ra + (y + an)p = 1. But taking modulo p to both sides yields ra = 1, implying that r is the inverse of a. From this fact, we can prove a well-known theorem ﬁrst announced (but not proven) by Wilson: Theorem 4 (Wilson). An integer n > 1 is prime if and only if (n − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod n). Proof. If n is prime, then we can pair each term of the product (n − 1)! to its inverse to obtain a product of 1, with the exception of 1 and n − 1. Hence (n − 1)! ≡ 1 · (n − 1) · (aa −1) · (bb −1) · · · · ≡ n − 1 ≡ −1. Conversely, if n is composite, then there exists a prime q such that q|n, where 2 ≤ q ≤ n − 2. Suppose that (n − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod n). This would imply that (n − 1)! ≡ −1 (mod q). However, since q is included in the product (n − 1)!, it follows that (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q), contradiction. 1 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Modular Arithmetic Robin Park We deﬁne the Euler totient function ϕ(n) as the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that are relatively prime to n. If n = p e1 1 p e2 2 · · · pek k for primes pi and positive integers ei, then ϕ(n) = n ∏ p|n (1 − 1 p ) = n (1 − 1 p1 ) ( 1 − 1 p2 ) · · · ( 1 − 1 pk ) . Theorem 5 (Euler). If a and n are relatively prime positive integers, then a ϕ(n) ≡ 1 (mod n). Proof. Consider the set A = {n1, n2, · · · , nϕ(m)} such that each element is taken modulo m and its elements are pairwise relatively prime to each other. Now consider the set B = {an1, an2, · · · , anϕ(m)} where a and m are relatively prime. We claim that A = B. Indeed, all elements of B are relatively prime to m, so if all elements of B are distinct, then B contains the same elements as A. Hence their products are equal: n1n2 · · · nϕ(m) ≡ an1 · an2 · · · anϕ(m) ≡ aϕ(m)n1n2 · · · nϕ(m) (mod m). Since all ni are relatively prime to m, it follows that a ϕ(m) ≡ 1 (mod m). This theorem has a natural corollary when n is prime: Corollary 6 (Fermat). For any integer a, a p ≡ a (mod p). Theorem 7 (Chinese Remainder Theorem). Suppose that x is an integer such that x ≡ a1 (mod m1); x ≡ a2 (mod m2); ... x ≡ ak (mod mk). where mi are all relatively prime. If M = ∏k i=1 mi = m1m2 · · · mk, then the solutions to x are given by x ≡ a (mod M ) for some integer a. The Chinese Remainder Theorem is often used to evaluate a large number modulo a factorable large number. For instance, if we were to evaluate a large number modulo 2013, we would ﬁrst evaluate it modulo 3, 11, and 61, and then apply the Chinese Remainder Theorem to combine the results. 3 Residues When solving Diophantine equations, a common technique is to compare the residues modulo some prime power of both sides. Comparing the equation modulo some other composite number is not advised, since by the Chinese Remainder Theorem you can instead separate it into its prime divisors. A set S of integers is called a set of residue classes modulo n if for every integer 0 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, there exists s ∈ S such that k ≡ s (mod n). For instance, the set of residue classes of n2 modulo 7 is {0, 1, 2, 4}, since n2 ≡ 0, 1, 2, 4 (mod 7) all have integer solutions, whereas n2 ≡ 3, 5, 6 (mod 7) do not. A technique in choosing the “right” prime to ﬁnd the residue classes is choosing a prime that is one greater than a multiple of the exponents. For example, if we were dealing with a Diophantine equation with the term x2 + y5, it is a good idea to check residue classes modulo 2 · 5 + 1 = 11. This minimizes the number of residues, and will help in ﬁnding a contradiction. 2 TJUSAMO 2013-2014 Modular Arithmetic Robin Park 4 Fractional Mods Modular arithmetic can be extended from the integers to the rationals easily: a b ≡ ab −1 (mod n). For example, 1 2 ≡ 4 (mod 7) because 1 ≡ 2 · 4 (mod 7). However, if gcd(b, n) ̸= 1, then the fraction is not equivalent to anything, since there cannot exist an inverse of b. Fractional mods are useful when proving that the numerator of a fraction is equivalent to some number modulo some number. An example of this is shown in a theorem of Wolstenholme: Theorem 8 (Wolstenholme). For any prime number p > 3, the numerator of ∑p−1 k=1 1 k2 is divisible by p when written in lowest terms. Proof. Note that p−1∑ k=1 1 k2 ≡ p−1∑ k=1 (k−1) 2 ≡ p−1∑ k=1 k2 ≡ p(p + 1)(2p + 1) 6 (mod p). Since neither p | 2 nor p | 3, it follows that p(p+1)(2p+1) 6 ≡ 0 (mod p). Hence ∑p−1 k=1 1 k2 ≡ 0 (mod p), implying that the numerator is divisible by p. The concept of fractional mods is formalized in the set (ring) of p-adic integers. 5 Miscellaneous Theorems/Lemmas Lemma 9 (Hensel). Let f be an integer polynomial, and let α ∈ Z such that f (α) ≡ 0 (mod p) and f ′(α) ̸≡ 0 (mod p). Then there exists a sequence of integers (α = α0, α1, α2, · · · ) such that f (αn) ≡ 0 (mod p n+1) and αn+1 ≡ αn (mod pn+1). Theorem 10 (Wolstenholme). For any prime p > 3, (2p − 1 p − 1 ) ≡ 1 (mod p3). Theorem 11 (Lucas). Let m = m0 + m1p + m2p 2 + · · · + mkpk and n = n0 + n1p + n2p 2 + · · · + nkp k for some integers 0 ≤ mi, ni ≤ p − 1. Then (m n ) ≡ k∏ i=0 ( mi ni ) . Theorem 12 (Catalan Conjecture/Mih˘ailescu). The only positive integer solution to the equation xa−yb = 1 is (a, b, x, y) = (2, 3, 3, 2). 6 Problems 1.
