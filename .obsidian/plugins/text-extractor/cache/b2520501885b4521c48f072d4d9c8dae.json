{"path":"iCloudDrive/bks/OlympiadQPs/Miscellaneous/Olympiad Dark Arts - Adam Goucher/Chp13 Conics.pdf","text":"Conic sections Conics have recurred throughout this book in both geometric and algebraic settings. Hence, I have decided to dedicate the final chapter to them. As the only conics appearing on IMO geometry problems are invariably circles, the results proved in this chapter are largely irrelevant. Nevertheless, the material is sufficiently interesting to be worthy of inclusion. Sections of cones With the obvious exception of the circle, the conics were first discovered by the Greek mathematician Menaech- mus who contemplated slicing a right circular cone C with a flat plane \u0000. Indeed, the term ‘conic’ is an abbrevia- tion of conic section. It is more natural to consider C as the double cone with equation x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2. If \u0000 cuts both cones, then the conic section is a hyperbola. If it cuts only one cone in a closed curve, it is an ellipse. The intermediate case, where the plane is inclined at exactly the same slope as the cone, results in a parabola. Observe that x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 is the equation of a projective circle; this explains why all conic sections are equivalent under projective transformations. We define a Dandelin sphere 5 to be a sphere tangent to both C (at a circle *) and \u0000 (at a point F, namely the focus). The plane containing * intersects \u0000 at a line \", known as the directrix. 1. Prove that the directrix is the polar of the focus. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 For an arbitrary point P on the conic, we let P R meet * at Q. 2. Prove that P Q \u0000 P F. 3. Let A be the foot of the perpendicular from P to the plane containing *. Let D be the foot of the perpendicular from P to \". Show that P Q P D is independent of the location of P. By combining the two previous theorems, we establish the focus-directrix property of a conic section. \u0000 For every point P on a conic section, the ratio P F P \" \u0000 \u0000 remains constant. \u0000 is known as the eccentricity of the conic. [Focus-directrix property] The type of conic section can be determined by its eccentricity. 4. Show that \u0000 \u0000 1 for an ellipse, \u0000 \u0000 1 for a parabola and \u0000 \u0000 1 for a hyperbola. Conics on a plane The focus-directrix property enables us to give conic sections a Cartesian treatment. By allowing the directrix to be the x-axis and scaling the conic so that the focus is at \u00000, 1\u0000, the equation of a conic becomes x2 \u0000 \u0000y \u0000 1\u00002 \u0000 \u00002 y2. We can see that a conic section is a quadratic curve (although this is obvious from the projective definition). More remarkably, the converse is also true: all non-degenerate quadratic curves are conic sections. 5. Prove that, if \u0000 ! 1, the conic has two lines of reflectional symmetry. Hence, for ellipses and hyperbolae, we can reflect the focus and directrix in the line of symmetry to obtain an alternative focus and directrix. Returning to the Dandelin spheres, the other focus corresponds to placing the sphere below the plane instead of above it. A parabola can be regarded as an ellipse/hyperbola with a focus on the line at infinity. The Cartesian equation also makes it evident that ellipses are indeed ‘squashed (affine transformed) circles’. We can translate the ellipse so that the lines of symmetry are coordinate axes, giving us the equation for an ellipse. \u0000 x2 a2 \u0000 y2 b2 \u0000 1 is the general equation for an ellipse. If we reverse the sign of y2 b2 , we obtain a hyperbola instead. [Cartesian equations for ellipses and hyperbolae] F2F1 P Consider an ellipse, with its two foci (F1 and F2) and directrices. Let P be a variable point on the ellipse. 6. Prove that P F1 \u0000 P F2 is constant. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 7. Show that the angles between the tangent at P and the lines P F1 and P F2 are equal. [Reflector property of the ellipse] A parabola can be considered to be the limit of ellipses with one focus fixed and the other tending towards infinity. This gives us the reflector property of the parabola, which states that a pencil of rays originating from the focus is reflected to a pencil of parallel lines perpendicular to the directrix. This was known to Archimedes, and formed the basis of a mechanism for igniting the sails of enemy ships by reflecting sunlight from polished metal shields. Nowadays, it is used in Newtonian telescopes for focusing light from infinity. Let the focus be the origin, and the directrix be represented with x \u0000 d in Cartesian coordinates. Consider the polar coordinates \u0000r, \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000r cos \u0000, r sin \u0000\u0000. 8. Prove that the equation for a conic in polar coordinates is r \u0000 l 1\u0000\u0000 cos \u0000 , where l \u0000 \u0000 d. [Polar equation of a conic] This parametrisation of a conic will prove useful when verifying Kepler’s laws of planetary motion in the next section. The length l \u0000 \u0000 d is known as the semi-latus rectum, as it is half of the length of the line segment parallel to the directrix passing through the focus and meeting the conic twice. The latus rectum is shown in black on the diagram of the parabolic reflector. The return of Steiner’s porism In Steiner’s porism, we considered the family of circles internally tangent to *2 and externally tangent to *1. Let’s suppose these two circles now intersect. Instead of a finite Steiner chain, we obtain an infinite set of circles bounded by *1 and *2. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 9. Show that the centres of the circles lie on an ellipse, the foci of which are the centres of *1 and *2. 10. Hence demonstrate that the radius of the variable circle is proportional to the distance between its centre and the radical axis of *1 and *2. 11. Three circular arcs, ,1, ,2 and ,3, connect the points A and C. These arcs lie in the same half-plane defined by the line A C in such a way that ,2 lies between ,1 and ,3. Three rays, h1, h2 and h3, emanate from a point B on the line A C, resulting in a grid of four curvilinear quadrilaterals as shown in the diagram below. Prove that if one can inscribe a circle in each of three of the curvilinear quadrilaterals, then a circle can be inscribed in the fourth. [IMO 2010 shortlist, Question G7, Géza Kós] Géza created many more problems on this theme, all of which are amenable to embedding in three-dimensional space. One equivalent problem is where the situation is on the surface of a sphere, which can be transformed into the original problem through stereographic projection. Similarly, there are variants in hyperbolic space. Kepler’s laws of planetary motion The vast majority of the content of this book is exclusively in the realms of pure mathematics. Nevertheless, conic sections naturally occur as the paths traced by objects in gravitational fields. The elliptical orbits of planets were first proposed by Johannes Kepler, as a refinement of earlier (mostly Greek) ideas that celestial bodies travel in perfect circles. Isaac Newton later inferred his law of gravitation from Kepler’s laws; the derivation is not too difficult, although it relies heavily upon differential calculus. Consider an object of negligible mass moving around a fixed object O of large mass due to gravitational attrac- tion. An example of this is the Earth orbiting the Sun. We aim to show that the path must be a conic section, by showing that the polar equation of a conic satisfies Newton’s laws of gravitation. Suppose an object is initially at P and moves to Q (very close to P). Let A \u0000 \u0000P O Q\u0000 be the area ‘swept out’ by the object, and consider the derivative \u0000 A \u0000t , known as the areal velocity. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 O P Q 12. If an object moves in a straight line at constant velocity, show that \u0000 A \u0000t is constant. 13. If the acceleration of an object is entirely radial (towards or away from O) at all times, then show that \u0000A \u0000t again remains constant. [Conservation of angular momentum] Indeed, the converse is also true: if areal velocity is conserved, then acceleration is entirely radial. By integrating \u0000A \u0000t with respect to time, we obtain Kepler’s second law. \u0000 A planet P in orbit around the Sun O sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. [Kepler’s second law] If P \u0000 \u0000r, \u0000\u0000, then \u0000A \u0000t \u0000 1 2 r2 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t . So, the value of r2 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t must remain constant. Let’s refer to this value (twice the areal velocity) as k. In ordinary circular motion, the radial acceleration is given by \u0000r\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t \u0000 2. Hence, in the general case, radial accelera- tion equals a \u0000 \u00002r \u0000t2 \u0000 r\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t \u0000 2. 14. Show that, if the planet P follows the path of a conic with focus O and semi-latus rectum l, then a \u0000 \u0000 k2 r2 l . [Newton’s inverse square law] Conversely, if we assume the inverse square law a \u0000 \u0000 G M r2 , then we can choose a conic with centre O, passing through P in the appropriate direction, and with a latus rectum of l \u0000 k2 G M . As Newton’s law of universal gravita- tion is deterministic, the conic must be the unique solution. Hence, the converse is also true: all planets obeying the inverse square law travel in conic orbits. If the orbit is cyclic (and therefore closed), then it must be an ellipse. \u0000 A planet P describes an ellipse, one focus of which is the Sun O. [Kepler’s first law] By considering the equation r \u0000 l 1\u0000\u0000 cos \u0000 , the value of r is minimised at l 1\u0000\u0000 (the perihelion) and maximised at l 1\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 1\u0000\u0000 cos \u0000 1\u0000\u0000 1\u0000\u0000 (the aphelion). When the eccentricity is zero, the orbit is circular. In general, two bodies experiencing gravitational attraction will orbit each other in coplanar conic orbits, where the barycentre of the system (assumed to be stationary) is their common focus. For three or more bodies, the equations cannot be solved algebraically, and the system behaves chaotically (arbitrarily small initial perturba- tions lead to arbitrarily large effects). Indeed, it has been shown to be undecidable, so no computer or Turing machine is capable of calculating the movements with perfect precision. Areas of conics If we take the pole of the line at infinity, we obtain the centre of a conic. For parabolae, this point is at infinity, therefore does not lie on the affine plane. For ellipses and hyperbolae, however, the centre lies on the plane and can be taken as the origin. It is then possible to apply a rotation about the origin to place the conic in standard position. The ellipse has Cartesian equation x2 a2 \u0000 y2 b2 \u0000 1. The line y \u0000 x tan \u0000 meets the curve at P \u0000 \u0000a cos \u0000, b sin \u0000\u0000. The area bounded by the curve, the line O P and the positive x-axis is given by 1 2 a b \u0000. In particular, when \u0000 \u0000 2 \u0000, the total area of the ellipse is \u0000 a b. Similarly, the hyperbola has Cartesian equation x2 a2 \u0000 y2 b2 \u0000 1. The line y \u0000 x tanh \u0000 meets the curve at P \u0000 \u0000a cosh \u0000, b sinh \u0000\u0000. The area bounded by the curve, the line O P and the positive x-axis is given by 1 2 a b \u0000. The hyperbolic functions are defined in a similar way to the trigonometric functions, with cosh \u0000 \u0000 1 2 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 and sinh \u0000 \u0000 1 2 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000. The area of a parabolic segment is much easier to calculate, as it can be obtained by integration of the equation of the parabola, y \u0000 x2 4 l , with respect to x. Archimedes instead used completely Euclidean methods in his Quadrature \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 of the Parabola, determining the area recursively by adding together the area of triangle A B C with the areas of the parabolic segments below A C and B C. M is the midpoint of A B, and C is the intersection of the parabola with the perpendicular from M to the directrix. The triangle constructed by repeating this process with A C instead of A B has one eighth of the area of the original triangle. By summing an infinite geometric series, the total area is equal to \u0000A B C\u0000 \u00001 \u0000 2 8 \u0000 4 64 \u0000 8 512 \u0000 …\u0000 \u0000 4 3 \u0000A B C\u0000. Unlike areas, the arc lengths of ellipses are not easy to compute. The circumference of an ellipse is 4 a E\u0000\u0000\u0000, where E is the complete elliptic integral of the second kind. With the exception of the circle, where E\u00000\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 2 and the circumference is 2 \u0000 r, E\u0000\u0000\u0000 cannot be expressed in terms of basic functions. Inversion in arbitrary conics In the chapter about the Riemann sphere, we considered inversion in a circle. It is, however, possible to invert about any conic section. We have a seven-parameter set of inversions we can apply, as the centre of inversion and conic can be chosen independently. \u0000 Let * be a non-degenerate conic, and O be a point not on *. For any point P other than O, we draw the line l through O and P, and let it meet * at A and B. We then define P ' to be the projective harmonic conjugate of P with respect to A B. [Inversion in a conic] P P'A O B Equivalently, we can define P ' as the intersection of the polar of P with the line O P. To investigate the properties of conic inversion, apply a projective transformation to make * a circle and O its centre. Then, the basic theorems applying to ordinary inversion translate into projective versions. \u0000 O inverts to an entire line 5, namely the polar of O, and vice-versa. (If O is the centre of the conic, then this is the line at infinity.) We treat this line as a single point, so the projective plane becomes topologically equivalent to a sphere. Allow 5 to intersect * at the points I and J . In this perverse world of conic inversion, 5 behaves like the point-line at infinity and I and J are analogous to the circular points. This enables us to convert theorems in circle inversion to their conic counterparts. \u0000 Straight lines passing through O remain invariant under inversion. \u0000 Conics containing O, I and J invert to straight lines not passing through O, and vice-versa. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000 Conics containing I and J (but not O) invert to other conics containing I and J (but not O). In circle inversion, angles between curves remain constant (or, more precisely, are reversed). In conic inversion, this must be converted into a projective statement. 15. If P and Q invert to P ' and Q ', respectively, then show that P Q P ' Q ' I J are conconic. 16. Let curves C and D intersect at P. Let C ' and D' be the inverse curves with respect to *, and let P' be the inverse of P. The tangent to C at P and the tangent to D ' at P' intersect at R. Similarly, the tangent to D at P and the tangent to C ' at P' intersect at S. Show that P P' R S I J are conconic. [Preservation of generalised angle] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. Apply a projective transformation to take \" to infinity, then apply an affine transformation to return 5 to being a sphere. The cone is tangent to 5, so remains a right circular cone. The plane containing * becomes parallel to the plane \u0000 (i.e. horizontal). By symmetry, F is now the centre of the conic (which is a circle), and therefore the pole of the line at infinity \". 2. They are both tangents from P to 5, therefore of equal length. 3. The angle 2 A P Q in the right-angled triangle is constant (equal to half the angle at the vertex of the cone), so P A P Q is independent of the location of P. Similarly, P D P A is also constant, by considering the right-angled triangle P A D. 4. Observe that \u0000 \u0000 P Q P D \u0000 cos 2 H P D cos 2 H P Q . When \u0000 \u0000 1, the plane \u0000 is inclined at the same slope as the cone, thus creating a parabola. When \u0000 \u0000 1, the plane is shallower than this, so the conic is an ellipse. Conversely, when the eccentricity exceeds 1, we have a hyperbola. 5. The equation of the conic is x2 \u0000 \u00001 \u0000 \u00002\u0000 y2 \u0000 2 y \u0000 1 \u0000 0. We can complete the square, resulting in x2 \u0000 \u00001 \u0000 \u00002\u0000 \u0000y \u0000 1 1\u0000\u00002 \u0000 2 \u0000 \u00002 1\u0000\u00002 . This is symmetric about the lines x \u0000 0 and y \u0000 1 1\u0000\u00002 . 6. Let the feet of the perpendiculars from P to the directrices be D1 and D2. We have P F1 \u0000 P F2 \u0000 \u0000\u0000P D1 \u0000 P D2\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000D1 D2\u0000. 7. Let Q be another point on the ellipse, very close to P. Let F1 P \u0000 u, F1 Q \u0000 u \u0000 \" and F2 Q \u0000 v. By the previous theorem, F2 P \u0000 v \u0000 \". Let P Q \u0000 ,. We apply the cosine rule, to get cos 2 F1 P Q \u0000 u2\u0000,2\u0000\u0000u\u0000\"\u00002 2 u , \u0000 ,2\u00002 u \"\u0000\"2 2 u , . As Q approaches P, the ,2 and \"2 terms become negligible, and this cosine equates to \u0000 \" , . This is the same as cos 2 F2 Q P, so the rays F1 P and F2 P describe equal angles with the normal to the curve. This establishes the reflector property. 8. From the focus-directrix property, the equation for the conic is r \u0000 \u0000\u0000d \u0000 x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000\u0000d \u0000 r cos \u0000\u0000. Rearranging this equation gives us the formula for r. 9. Let the variable circle have centre P and radius r, and let *i have radius Ri and centre Oi. We have P O1 \u0000 r \u0000 R1 and P O2 \u0000 R2 \u0000 r. Adding the equations gives P O1 \u0000 P O2 \u0000 R1 \u0000 R2, which is constant. Hence, the locus of centres is an ellipse with foci O1 and O2. 10. r \u0000 P O1 \u0000 R1 is a linear function of the distance to the focus, which is a linear function of the distance to the directrix, which is a linear function of the distance to the radical axis (which is parallel to the directrix). As the radius of the variable circle tends to zero as it approaches the radical axis, this linear function must have a constant term of 0. Hence, the radius of the circle is proportional to the distance between its centre and the radical axis. 11. Let the three circles be C1, C2 and C3, such that (without loss of generality) C2 and C3 are tangent to both h1 and h2, and C1 and C2 are tangent to both ,1 and ,2. Let a fourth circle C4 be tangent to ,2 and ,3, and let its centre lie on the line B C1. Let di denote the perpendicular distance between the centre of Ci and the line A C, and let ri denote its radius. We want to show that r4 r1 \u0000 d4 d1 , as this means that the circles are homothetic with centre of homothety B, so C4 is tangent to both h2 and h3. Using this idea of homothety, we have r3 r2 \u0000 d3 d2 . Similarly, the previous exercise gives us r4 r3 \u0000 d4 d3 and r2 r1 \u0000 d2 d1 . We can multiply these three equations \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 2 2 3 3 1 1 to prove that r4 r1 \u0000 d4 d1 , so C4 is indeed inscribed in the remaining curvilinear quadrilateral. For further discussion of the problem, see http://www.imo-official.org/problems/IMO2010SL.pdf. This includes a three- dimensional interpretation of the problem where cones of equal gradient are erected on the circles. 12. Let d be the perpendicular distance from the locus of motion to O. Then \u0000O P Q\u0000 \u0000 1 v d t, so \u0000A \u0000t \u0000 1 v d is constant. 13. If P continues in a straight line at its present velocity, let the new position after time t be denoted Q. If P instead is accelerated towards or away from O, then its new position is denoted Q '. As the acceleration is in the direction of O, and t is very small (technically, the limit as t \u0000 0), O P is parallel to Q Q '. So, \u0000O Q P\u0000 \u0000 \u0000O Q ' P\u0000 and thus \u0000A \u0000t is unaffected by the acceleration. So, it must remain constant, as in the previous scenario. 14. We begin with the polar form of a conic, r \u0000 l 1\u0000\u0000 cos \u0000 . We then rearrange to obtain l r \u0000 1 \u0000 \u0000 cos \u0000, and differentiate both sides with respect to time. This gives us \u0000 l r2 \u0000r \u0000t \u0000 \u0000\u0000 sin \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t . Multiplying both sides by \u0000 r2 l gives us \u0000r \u0000t \u0000 k \u0000 l sin \u0000. Proceeding to differentiate again results in \u00002r \u0000t2 \u0000 k \u0000 l cos \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t \u0000 k\u0000 1 r \u0000 1 l \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t , where the last stage involves substituting the equation of the conic back into the equation. Acceleration is then a \u0000 k\u0000 1 r \u0000 1 l \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t \u0000 r\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000t \u0000 2 \u0000 k\u0000 1 r \u0000 1 l \u0000 k r2 \u0000 k2 r3 \u0000 \u0000 k2 r2 l . 15. Project I and J to the circular points at infinity, so O is the centre of the circle *. P Q P ' Q ' are concyclic, thus P Q P' Q ' I J are conconic. 16. Again, project I and J to the circular points at infinity, so O is the centre of the circle *. Then, this statement equates to P P' R S being a cyclic quadrilateral, which is obvious from the fact that angles are preserved in circle inversion. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
