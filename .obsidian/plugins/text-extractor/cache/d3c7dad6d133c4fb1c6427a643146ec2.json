Answer all questions. • Each question carries 10 points. • Use of protractors, calculators, mobile phone is forbidden. • Time allotted: 3 hours 1. Three positive real numbers a, b, c are such that a 2 + 5b 2 + 4c 2 − 4ab − 4bc = 0. Can a, b, c be the lengths of the sides of a triangle? Justify your answer. 2. The roots of the equation x3 − 3ax2 + bx + 18c = 0 form a non-constant arithmetic progression and the roots of the equation x3 + bx2 + x − c3 = 0 form a non-constant geometric progression. Given that a, b, c are real numbers, ﬁnd all positive integral values a and b. 3. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle in which ∠ABC is the largest angle. Let O be its circumcentre. The perpendicular bisectors of BC and AB meet AC at X and Y respectively. The internal bisectors of ∠AXB and ∠BY C meet AB and BC at D and E respectively. Prove that BO is perpendicular to AC if DE is parallel to AC. 4. A person moves in the x − y plane moving along points with integer co-ordinates x and y only. When she is at point (x, y), she takes a step based on the following rules: (a) if x + y is even she moves to either (x + 1, y) or (x + 1, y + 1); (b) if x + y is odd she moves to either (x, y + 1) or (x + 1, y + 1). How many distinct paths can she take to go from (0, 0) to (8, 8) given that she took exactly three steps to the right ((x, y) to (x + 1, y))? 5. Let a, b, c be positive numbers such that 1 1 + a + 1 1 + b + 1 1 + c ≤ 1. Prove that (1 + a 2)(1 + b 2)(1 + c2) ≥ 125. When does the equality hold? 6. Let D, E, F be the points of contact of the incircle of an acute-angled triangle ABC with BC, CA, AB respectively. Let I1, I2, I3 be the incentres of the triangles AF E, BDF , CED, respectively. Prove that the lines I1D, I2E, I3F are concurrent. GOOD LUCK 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
