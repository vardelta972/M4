Let a1, a2, . . . , an and b1, b2, . . . , bn be positive integers such that a1 < a2 < . . . < an, b1 > b2 > . . . > bn, and (a1, a2, . . . , an, b1, b2, . . . , bn) is a permutation of (1, 2, . . . , 2n).

For a positive integer n ≥ 2, consider the n − 1 fractions 2 1 , 3 2 , . . . , n n − 1 The product of these fractions equals n, but if you reciprocate (i.e. turn upside down) some of the fractions, the product will change. Can you make the product equal 1? Find all values of n for which this is possible and prove that you found them all. 3. Let S0 be a ﬁnite set of positive integers. We deﬁne sets S1, S2, . . . of positive integers as follows: Integer a is in Sn+1 if and only if exactly one of a − 1 or a is in Sn. Show that there exists inﬁnitely many integers N for which SN = S0 ∪ {N + a : a ∈ S0}. 4. Prove that inﬁnitely many primes divide at least one number of the form 1! + 2! + . . . + n!. 2 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions 5 Algebra Solutions 1. If we add the three given equations, we get x2 − 4y + 7 + y2 − 6z + 14 + z2 − 2x − 7 = 0 =⇒ (x − 1) 2 + (y − 2) 2 + (z − 3) 2 = 0 Therefore, we can only have x = 1, y = 2, z = 3. Checking, we see these values do indeed satisfy the given equations. (England 2013) Comment: You have to check your answer for questions like this (even if you do not show much work). We ﬁrst showed that if (x, y, z) satisfy the three given equations, then they must be (1, 2, 3). It could still be that there are no (x, y, z) which satisfy the given equations. For example, think about what happens if we replace the ﬁrst equation with x2 − 4y + 6 = 0 and the second equation with y2 − 6z + 15 = 0. 2. Suppose ai > bi for some i. Then ai > a1, a2, . . . , ai−1, bi, bi+1, . . . , bn. Therefore, ai is greater than n diﬀerent terms from {1, 2, . . . , 2n}, and so must be at least n + 1. Similarly if bi > ai, then bi > a1, a2, . . . , ai, bi+1, bi+2, . . . , bn, and so must also at least n + 1. Therefore, {max(a1, b1), max(a2, b2), . . . , max(an, bn)} is a subset of {n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n}. Since both sets are of size n, it follows that {max(a1, b1), max(a2, b2), . . . , max(an, bn)} = {n + 1, n + 2, . . . , 2n}. This leaves {min(a1, b1), min(a2, b2), . . . , min(ab, bn)} on the one side and {1, 2, . . . , n} on the other side, which implies {min(a1, b1), min(a2, b2), . . . , min(an, bn)} = {1, 2, . . . , n}. Finally, n∑ i=1 |ai − bi| = n∑ i=1 ( max(ai, bi) − min(ai, bi) ) = n∑ i=1 max(ai, bi) − n∑ i=1 min(ai, bi) = (n + 1 + n + 2 + . . . + 2n) − (1 + 2 + . . . + n) = n2. (Mathlinks) 3. Let u = a2b2 + c2d2, v = a2c2 + b2d2, w = a2d2 + b2c2. Combining opposite terms and applying the AM-GM inequality1, we have ab c2 + d2 + cd a2 + b2 = a3b + ab3 + c3d + cd3 a2c2 + b2c2 + a2d2 + b2d2 ≥ 2a2b2 + 2c2d2 a2c2 + b2c2 + a2d2 + b2d2 = 2u v + w . 1For non-negative real numbers x1, x2, . . . , xn, the AM-GM inequality states that x1+x2+...+xn n ≥ n√x1x2 . . . xn. 3 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions Applying similar reasoning to the other pairs of terms, we see that: ab c2 + d2 + ac b2 + d2 + ad b2 + c2 + bc a2 + d2 + bd a2 + c2 + cd a2 + b2 ≥ 2u v + w + 2v w + u + 2w u + v . Finally, Nesbitt’s inequality states that u v+w + v w+u + w u+v ≥ 3 2 , and so we are done. (If you have not seen Nesbitt’s inequality before, you can prove it by multiplying both sides by (u + v)(v + w)(w + u) and then applying AM-GM again.) For equality to hold in the ﬁrst step, we need a3b = ab3, or equivalently one of the following: a = b, a = 0, b = 0. The same holds for every pair of variables, so it must be that all variables are equal, or one of the variables is 0 and the other three are equal. It is easy to check that equality does indeed hold in both cases. 4. Let f (n)(x) denote the result of applying f to x exactly n times. Also, let o(x) denote the smallest n such that f (n)(x) = x(possibly inﬁnity), and let On denote the set of x such that o(x) = n. Lemma: If On is non-empty, then it has at least n elements. Proof: For arbitrary x, let Sx denote the set {x, f (x), f (2)(x), . . .}. Pick y ∈ Sx, so that y = f (i)(x) for some i. If o(x) = m for some ﬁnite m, then f (m−i)(y) = f (m)(x) = x, so x ∈ Sy. Furthermore, f (m)(y) = f (m+i)(x) = f (i)(f (m)(x)) = f (i)(x) = y, so o(y) ≤ o(x). Since x ∈ Sy, it follows similarly that o(y) ≤ o(x), and hence o(y) in fact equals m. Therefore, Sx is a subset of Om. Additionally, if f (i)(x) = f (j)(x) for 0 ≤ i < j < n, then o(f (i)(x)) ≤ j − i, which we just showed is impossible. It follows that |Sx| = m. Taking x ∈ On completes the proof of the lemma. Returning to the problem at hand, any f satisfying the given condition would have f (2)(x) − x = x2 − x − 2 = (x − 2)(x + 1). Additionally, f (4)(x) − x = x4 − 4x2 − x + 2 = (x − 2)(x + 1) (x + 1+ √5 2 ) ( x + 1−√5 2 ). Therefore, O4 = { −1− √5 2 , −1+ √5 2 }, which contradicts the lemma. (Vietnam 1990) Comment: The lemma can be strengthened slightly: If On is ﬁnite, then |On| is divisible by n. This is a powerful observation in other contexts as well, especially group theory. 6 Combinatorics Solutions 1. Suppose the top-left quadrant has no queens. There are 100 queens that must ﬁt in 100 rows, so each row must contain a queen. Since the top-left quadrant is empty, this means there must be at least 50 queens in the top-right quadrant. Similarly, by looking at columns, we see there must be at least 50 queens in the bottom-left quadrant. However, any square in the bottom-left or top-right quadrant lies on one of 99 diﬀerent diagonals going from bottom-left to top-right. Therefore, there must be two queens on the same diagonal, which is impossible. (Tournament of the Towns 2008) 2. We prove by induction on n that if n disks cover an area of size k, we can choose a subset of disjoint disks that cover an area of size at least k 9 . If n = 1, the claim is trivial. Now let’s prove the result for n = m, assuming the result for n < m. Let d be the disk with maximal radius r, let S denote the set of disks intersecting d, 4 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions and let T denote the remaining set of disks. Consider a disk s ∈ S. By assumption, it has radius at most r, and so the centers of c and s diﬀer by distance at most 2r. It follows that S is contained entirely inside the disk centered at c with radius 3r. This means that the total area covered by all disks in T is at least k − 9πr2. By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a subset of disjoint disks in T that cover an area of size at least k 9 − πr2. By assumptions, these disks are all also disjoint from c, so we can add in c to get a total area of at least k 9 , as required. (Putnam 1998) 3. Every move, we change the colour of two disks. Therefore, the parity of the number of black disks never changes, so if there are an even number of black disks to start with, the task is impossible. Otherwise, we claim the task is possible. We ﬁrst describe how to transform the circle to have 11 black disks. Since the total number of black disks is odd, there must exist some contiguous sequence of black disks of odd length: D1, D2, . . . , D2n+1 (n ≤ 4). Apply the move to black disks D1, D3, . . . , D2n+1. When everything is done, D1, D2, . . . , D2n+1 will all still be black, and so will the disks on either side. Thus, we can keep increasing the number of black disks until all but one disk is black. This leaves one contiguous sequence of black disks and it is of odd length: D1, D2, . . . , D2n+1. Apply the move to black disks D2, D4, . . . , D2n. When everything is done, D2, D3, . . . , D2n will all still be black, but D1 and D2n+1 will be white. Thus, we can keep decreasing the number of black disks until only one disk is black, as required. (Japan 1998) 4. Pick a permutation π of {1, 2, . . . , n} uniformly at random. Let us say π matches Si if the ﬁrst |Si| elements of π are the elements of Si in some order. Let Pi denote the probability that π matches Si, and let P denote the probability that π matches at least one of {S1, S2, . . . , Sk}. Note that π cannot simultaneously match both Si and Sj for distinct i, j, because this would imply one of the two sets contained the others. Therefore, P = P1+P2+. . .+Pk. Additionally, Pi = 1 ( n |Si|) since the ﬁrst |Si| elements of π are equally likely to be any of the |Si|-element subsets of {1, 2, . . . , 2n}. Therefore, ∑k i=1 1 ( n |Si|) = ∑k i=1 Pi = P ≤ 1. 7 Geometry Solutions 1. Let O be the circumcircle of △AP D. Then ∠P OA = 2∠P DA = ∠P CA, so O lies on the circumcircle of △ACP . Similarly, it lies on the circumcircle of △BDP so O = Q and the problem is solved. Comment: A slicker solution is to extend P Q to hit the circumcircle of △AP D at R, and angle chase from there. However, the solution presented here is better motivated. 2. Since AB and CD are parallel, we have ∠DCA = ∠BAC, which implies DA = BC. Addi- tionally, we have ∠EDA = ∠DCA = ∠P DC = ∠P BC = ∠QBC and ∠DAE = ∠BCD = ∠BCQ. Therefore △EDA is congruent to △QBC by angle-side-angle. It follows that EA = QC, and hence EACQ is a parallelogram. This gives EQ = AC, as required. (Nordic 2002) 5 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions 3. Let the 5 points on the circle be A, B, C, D, E. Set up vectors with the center of the circle being at 0. We claim the lines meet at X = A+B+C+D+E 3 . Let CABC denote the centroid of △ABC. We know CABC lies at vector A+B+C 3 , so the line through CABC and X travels along the vector D+E 3 . This is parallel to the line between the center of the circle and the midpoint of segment DE, and that line is orthogonal to DE because the center of a circle lies on the perpendicular bisector of any chord. It follows that CABCX is also orthogonal to segment DE. The same argument can be applied for any triple of points, so the lines concur at X, as required. Comment: The main challenge with a problem like this is to ﬁgure out where X has to be in the ﬁrst place. One approach is to start with just two lines. Let M be the midpoint of AB, and let CABC and CABE denote the centroids of triangles ABC and ABE. Let ℓC denote the line through CABC perpendicular to DE and let ℓE denote the line through CABE perpendicular to CD. If we perform a homothety about M with factor 3, then ℓC becomes the altitude from C to DE, and ℓE becomes the altitude from E to CD. Therefore, the point X we are looking for is mapped to the orthocenter of △CDE by a homothety with factor 3 about M . Now it is natural to introduce vectors since, if the vectors are centered at the circumcenter of △CDE, then the orthocenter of △CDE is at precisely C + D + E. (Do you see why this is true? It is a consequence of the Euler line.) 4. First suppose ℓ is parallel to AB. Then ∠A2P A1 = ∠BAA1 = ∠BCA1 = ∠A2CA1, so 6 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions A2P CA1 is cyclic. Similarly, B2P CB1 is cyclic, so the two circles meet at P , which is on ℓ as required. Otherwise, let X denote the intersection of AB and ℓ. We will assume the conﬁguration shown in the diagram; the remaining conﬁgurations are similar2. Let Q be the point on ℓ so that (using directed lengths) P Q · P X = P B · P B1 = P A · P A1. Then XQBB1 and XQAA1 are cyclic by Power of a Point. Therefore, ∠B2QB1 = ∠XQB1 = ∠XBB1 = 180◦ − ∠ABB1 = 180◦ − ∠ACB1 = 180◦ − ∠B2CB1. It follows that Q lies on the circumcircle of △B1B2C. A similar argument shows it also lies on the circumcircle of △A1A2C, which solves the problem since Q is on ℓ. (Mathlinks) 8 Number Theory Solutions 1. Expanding, we have a+1 b + b+1 a = a2+b2+a+b ab . We know that d2|ab, so if the given quantity is an integer, then d2|a2 + b2 + a + b. Since d2 also divides a2 and b2, it follows that d2|a + b. Therefore, a + b is a positive integer that is a multiple of d2, and hence a + b ≥ d2. (Russia 1994) 2. Suppose we reciprocate the fractions a1 a1−1 , a2 a2−1 , . . . , ak ak−1 . Then the product becomes: 2 1 · 3 2 · . . . · n n − 1 · ( a1 − 1 a1 )2 · ( a2 − 1 a2 )2 · . . . · ( ak − 1 ak )2 = n · ( (a1 − 1)(a2 − 1) . . . (ak − 1) a1a2 . . . ak )2 . If this equals 1, then n = ( a1a2...ak (a1−1)(a2−1)...(ak−1) )2, and in particular n is a perfect square. 2Saying other conﬁgurations are “similar” on a contest is not usually a good idea. You should either explicitly go through every possible conﬁguration or use something like directed angles. You can ﬁnd more on directed angles here: https://sites.google.com/site/imocanada/2011-winter-camp. 7 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions Conversely, suppose n = m2. If we reciprocate 2 1 , 3 2 , . . . , m m−1 , then we get: ( m2 m2 − 1 · m2 − 1 m2 − 2 · . . . · m + 1 m ) · ( m − 1 m · m − 2 m − 1 · . . . · 1 2 ) = m · 1 m = 1. Therefore, the product can be made equal to 1 if and only if n is a perfect square. (Bay Area 2013) 3. For each pair of integers n, i, let sn,i denote the number that is 1 if i ∈ Sn and 0 otherwise. For n ≥ 0, we are given that sn+1,i ≡ sn,i−1 + sn,i mod 2. We are now going to work with polynomials mod 2. Speciﬁcally, given two polynomials Q and R with integer coeﬃcients, we will write Q ≡ R mod 2 if every coeﬃcient of Q is congruent to the corresponding coeﬃcient of R mod 2. You can add, subtract, and multiply polynomials mod 2, and they work just like integers3. Now, for each n, deﬁne a polynomial Pn(x) = ∑ i sn,ixi. The given conditions can be rewritten to state that Pn+1(x) ≡ Pn(x) · (x + 1) mod 2, and hence Pn(x) ≡ P0(x) · (x + 1)n mod 2. Lemma: (x + 1)2k ≡ x2k + 1 mod 2 for all non-negative integers k. Proof: Using the binomial theorem, it suﬃces to show that (2k i ) is even for all i satisfying 0 < i < 2k. Recall that the largest power of 2 dividing n! is exactly ⌊ n 2 ⌋+⌊ n 4 ⌋+. . .. Therefore, the largest power of 2 dividing (2k i ) is precisely k∑ j=0 (⌊ 2k 2j ⌋ − ⌊ i 2j ⌋ − ⌊ 2k − i 2j ⌋) = 1 + k−1∑ j=0 (⌊ 2k 2j ⌋ − ⌊ i 2j ⌋ − ⌊ 2k − i 2j ⌋) ≥ 1 + k−1∑ j=0 (⌊ 2k 2j ⌋ − ⌊ i + (2k − i) 2j ⌋) = 1. This shows (2k i ) is indeed even, which completes the proof of the lemma. Finally, let R denote the diﬀerence between the largest and smallest elements of S0, and choose n to be a power of 2 larger than R. Then Pn(x) ≡ xnP (x) + P (x) mod 2 by our lemma. It follows that Sn(x) consists of the integers that are in exactly one of S0 and {n + a : a ∈ S0}. Since n > R, these two sets are disjoint, and hence Sn(x) = S0 ∪ {n + a : a ∈ S0}. (Putnam 2000) 3What does this really mean? The key property you want is this: if Q ≡ Q ′ mod 2 and R ≡ R′ mod 2, then Q + R ≡ Q ′ + R′ mod 2, Q − R ≡ Q ′ − R′ mod 2, and Q · R ≡ Q ′ · R′ mod 2. Abstract algebra is very interested in these kinds of questions. 8 of 9 Winter Camp 2014 Pre-Camp Problem Set Solutions 4. Suppose, by way of contradiction, that there are only k such primes p1, p2, . . . , pk. Let Sn = 1!+2!+. . .+n!. For each n, we can write Sn = ∏k i=1 pei i . Let f (n) denote the integer i such that pei i is maximum. For any N , the pigeonhole principle guarantees there must exist n, m ∈ {N − k, N − k + 1, . . . , N } such that n < m and f (n) = f (m). Let p = pf (n) = pf (m) and let e be the largest integer such that pe| gcd(Sn, Sm). The deﬁnition of p guarantees that pe ≥ k√n!. On the other hand, gcd(Sn, Sm)|m! − n!, which equals n! · ((n + 1)(n + 2) . . . m − 1). The largest exponent of p dividing n! is ⌊ n p ⌋ + ⌊ n p2 ⌋ + . . . ≤ n p + n p2 + . . . ≤ n. Therefore, pe ≤ pn · ((n + 1)(n + 2) . . . m − 1) < pn · mk. Combining this with the previous observation gives us pn · mk > n√n!, but we claim this is impossible for large n. Indeed, for large n, we have 2k√n! > 2k √ n 2 n 2 = n 2 n 4k = ( 4k √ n 2 )n > p n, and 2k√n! > 2k √ n 2 n 2 > 2k √ ( n + k 2 ) n 4 ≥ m n 8k ≥ mk. Multiplying these together gives a contradiction. 9 of 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
