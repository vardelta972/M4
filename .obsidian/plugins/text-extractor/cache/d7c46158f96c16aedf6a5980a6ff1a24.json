Attempt as many as you can. Answers without proper explanations will fetch zero. You can use any result proved in the class, but you have to state it properly. 1. (10 marks) Start with an equilateral triangle with unit side length. Subdivide it into four smaller congruent equilateral triangles and remove the central triangle. Repeat last step with each of the remaining smaller triangles. Denote by P (n) and A(n) the perimeter and area of the existing portion of the triangle at the n-th step, e.g. P (2) = 9/2 unit and A(2) = 3 √ 3/16 sq.unit. Find lim n→∞ P (n) and lim n→∞ A(n). Are you surprised? 2. (10 marks) Let xn be a sequence of integers such that xk+1 ̸= xk holds for every k ≥ 1. Show that xn can not be a Cauchy sequence. Is it possible that xn has a convergent subsequence? 3. (10 marks) Suppose that f : [0, 2] → R is continuous. Show that there exists a, b ∈ R such that b − a = 1 and f (b) − f (a) = 1 2(f (2) − f (0)). 4. (15 marks) Suppose that f, g : [0, 1] → [0, 1] are continuous functions such that f (g(x)) = g(f (x)) holds for every x ∈ [0, 1]. (a) (5 marks) Show that there exists b ∈ [0, 1] such that f (b) = b. (b) (10 marks) Show that there exists c ∈ [0, 1] such that f (c) = g(c). [Hint: Construct a sequence by an+1 = g(an) and choose the ﬁrst term suitably.] Do not cheat to yourself. All the best!
