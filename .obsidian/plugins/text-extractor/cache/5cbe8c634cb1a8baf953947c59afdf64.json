(8) Prove that the polynomial P (x) = xn + 4 is irreducible over Z[x] if and only if n is not a multiple of 4. 1 2 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-III AL˙I G ¨UREL Problem 1, Solution by Joshua Pfeﬀer: Let P0(x) = P (x) and Pk(x) = Pk−1(x + 1) − Pk−1(x) for k ∈ N. Lemma. For all integers k ≥ 0: Pk(x) = ∑k j=0(−1)k−j(k j)P (x + j). The proof of the lemma is done by induction on k and using the identity( k j−1 ) + (k j) = (k+1 j ). Now since degPk = degP − k for k ≤ degP , we have degPn = 0. Hence, Pn+1 ≡ 0 and ∑n+1 j=0 (−1)n+1−j(n+1 j )P (x + j) = 0. Thus we conclude that P (x + n + 1) = ∑n j=0(−1) n−j(n+1 j )P (x + j) □ Problem 2, Solution by Matthew Superdock: Using the result from Problem 1, P (n + 1) = n∑ j=0(−1) n−j( n + 1 j )P (j) = n∑ j=0(−1)n−j(n + 1 j )(n + 1 j )−1. Hence, we deduce that P (n + 1) is 1 if n is even and 0 if n is odd □ Problem 3, Solution by Taylor Han: Let the given polynomial with degree n be Pn. We will induct on the even integer n. When n = 2 we show the result by ﬁnding that P2(x) = x2−x+2 2 . Assume the result for up to n. Let Q(x) = Pn+2(x + 1) − Pn+2(x) and let R(x) = Q(x + 1) − Q(x). Note that R has the same values with Pn at j = 0, 1, ..., n and degR ≤ n = degPn. We deduce that R ≡ Pn. So R(n + 1) = 2n and R(n + 2) = 2n+1 − 1 by the induction hypothesis. Now we go back and using the values of R prove that Pn+2(n + 3) = 2n+2 and Pn+2(n + 4) = 2n+3 − 1, which completes the induction □ Problem 4, Solution by Justin Brereton: Note that all the roots are negative numbers. So P (x) = (x + r1)...(x + rn) where rj are positive and their product is 1. By AM-GM, P (2) = (2 + r1)...(2 + rn) ≥ 3 n □ Problem 5, Solution by David B. Rush: On the contrary, suppose that P (x) = Q(x)R(x) with 0 < degQ < degP . Since P (10) is prime, w.l.o.g. let Q(0) = ±1. Let α1, ..., αk be the roots of Q. We will proceed by using the following Theorem: Theorem. Let P (x) = anxn + ... + a0 with degP = n. Also let M = max0≤j≤n \f \f \f aj an \f \f \f and k denote the number of zero coeﬃcients following an. Then any root of P has norm at most 1 + k+1√M . Note. For a proof of the Theorem above, write down P (α) as a sum and estimate the norm using the triangle inequality. 2008 BLUE MOP, POLYNOMIALS-III AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 It follows from the Theorem above that P (α) = 0 ⇒ |α| ≤ 1 + ( 9 2 ) 1 k+1 < 9, where k is the number of zero coeﬃcients of P following an. Then |Q(10)| = |(10 − α1)...(10 − αk)| ≥ (10 − |α1|)...(10 − |αk|) > 1 a contradiction. □ Problem 6, Solution by David B. Rush: Assume for the sake of con- tradiction that P (x) = Q(x)R(x), where 0 < degQ < p. Then w.l.o.g Q(0) = ±p. Let the roots of Q be α1, ..., αk. So α1...αk = ±p. One of the roots, call it α, will have norm at least the geometric average of the product which is p 1 k ≥ p 1 p−1 . However, αm − α = −p implies that p ≥ |α| p − |α| = |α| (|α| p−1 − 1) . Then p ≥ p 1 p−1 (p − 1) which implies that 3 > (1 + 1 p−1 )p−1 ≥ p. So only possibility left is that p = 2 in which case irreducibility is easily checked □ Problem 7, Solution by Gye Hyun Baek: Let P0 = Q0 = {z1, ..., zn} and P1 = Q1 = {w1, ..., wm}. Then, we can write P (x) = α n∏ j=1 (x − zj) ej = α m∏ j=1(x − wj) hj + 1, Q(x) = β n∏ j=1 (x − zj) gj = β m∏ j=1 (x − wj)hj + 1, where ej, fj, gj, hj ∈ N, and ∑ ej = ∑ fj = degP , ∑ gj = ∑ hj = degQ. W.L.O.G. let degP ≥ degQ. Notice that (x − zj) ej −1 and (x − wj)fj −1 divide P ′(x) so degP ′ ≥ ∑(ej − 1) + ∑ (fj − 1) = 2degP − n − m which implies n + m ≥ degP + 1. Let R = P − Q. Then degR ≤ degP . However, zj and wj are roots of R so R has at least n + m ≥ degP roots. Hence, we conclude that R ≡ 0 and P ≡ Q □ Problem 8, Solution by Brian Hamrick: First note that if 4|n, then P (x) = x4k + 4 = (x2k + 2xk + 2)(x2k − 2xk + 2). Now, suppose that n is not a multiple of 4 and P (x) = Q(x)R(x) with 0 < degQ < n. All the roots of P have norm n√4. Since the product of the roots of Q, 4 degQ n , is an integer, n|2degQ but 2degQ < 2n, hence n = 2degQ is even. However, n is not a multiple of 4, so degQ is odd which means that Q has a real root which is a root of P as well but P doesn’t have any real roots. We conclude that P is irreducible when n is not a multiple of 4 □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
