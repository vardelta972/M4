For example, [3.141] = 3, [4] = 4, [-2.5] = -3 (since -3 < -2.5 < 2). This function f(x) = [x] is called the floor function or box function or greatest integer function. In this note, [ ] does NOT denote third bracket. To avoid this ambiguity, some people use instead of [x]. Ceiling of x: Ceiling(x) is the least integer greater than or equal to x. Notation: . Example: , , , . Notations that I shall use here: [x] for floor(x), and ceiling(x) for ceiling of x. Question: What is the relation between floor(x) and ceiling(x)? Answer: ceiling(x) = floor(x) + 1, if x is not an integer. When x is an integer, we have ceiling(x) = floor(x) = x. One more notation: fractional part of x. We shall use {x} to denote the fractional part of x, which is defined as {x} = x - [x]. Example: {3.141} = 0.141, {567.89} = 0.89, {4} = 0, {-2.3} = -2.3 - [-2.3] = -2.3 - (-3) = -2.3 + 3 = 0.7 (not 0.3). Some properties of [x]: 1. For every x, we have x-1 < [x] ≤ x. (This is the simplest yet the most useful property for [x].) 2. {x} = x - [x] lies always between 0 and 1. 3. [x + n] = [x] + n, if n is an integer. 4. [x+y] ≥ [x]+[y]. In fact, [x+y] - [x] - [y] = 0 or 1. 5. [-x] + [x] = -1 if x is not an integer, 0 if x is an integer. 6. [x+1/2] is the integer closest to x. 7. If x ≤ y, then [x] ≤ [y]. 8. [[x]/n] = [x/n] for any x and positive integer n. Proof: You can do it yourself. If stuck, look up Excursion or the book named 104 Number Theory Problems. ⌊x⌋ ⌈x⌉ ⌈3.141⌉ = 4 ⌈567.89⌉ = 568 ⌈4⌉ = 4 ⌈−2.5⌉ = − 2 Notation: For any positive integer n, n! denotes the product of first n natural numbers. For example, 1! = 1, 2! = 2, 3! = 6, 4! = 24 and so on. A convention: 0! is defined as 1. Example. Find the largest power of 2 that divides 19!. Here n! = 19! = 1 2 3 ··· 19. We want to find the largest power of 2 that divides this number. Note that there are [19/2] = 9 even numbers, each of them supply a factor of 2. Is that all? No! Because there are [19/4] = 4 multiples of 4, each of which supply one more factor of 2. Even more, there are [19/8] = 2 multiples of 8, which supply one more factor of 2. Finally, there is [19/16] = 1 multiple of 16, which supplies one more factor of 2. Thus in total, how many factors of 2 are there in 19! = [19/2] + [19/4] + [19/8] + [19/16] = 9 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 16. Legendre’s formula: The largest power of prime p that divides n! is given by Solving Problems Notations: a^b denotes a to the power b. [x] denotes floor of x, and {x} denotes x - [x]. Problem 1. Find all real numbers x satisfying the equation 4x^2 - 40[x] + 51 = 0. Solution. Observe that [x] is always less than or equal to x, by definition. Therefore, [x] ≤ x => -x ≤ -[x] => 4x^2 - 40x + 51 ≤ 4x^2 - 40[x] + 51 = 0 => 4x^2 - 40x + 51 ≤ 0 => (2x - 3)(2x - 17) ≤ 0 ……(i) If 2x < 3 or if 2x > 17 then (2x - 3)(2x - 17) will be > 0. Therefore, (i) holds only when 3 ≤ 2x ≤ 17 => 1.5 ≤ x ≤ 8.5. So, the possible values of [x] are: [x] = 1 to 8. What next? We may put these values of [x] in the equation 4x^2 - 40[x] + 51 = 0. Will of them ‘satisfy’ this equation? × × × × [ n p ] + [ n p 2 ] + [ n p 3 ] + ⋯ . If [x] = 3 then 4x^2 = 69 => 4x^2 > 64 => x > 4, so it contradicts that [x] = 3. Can you see the problem? Not all of the values of [x] give a valid solution! So we just plug in those values and note whether it gives a valid solution. A somewhat better way to check: 4x^2 = 40[x] - 51 => x = sqrt(40[x] - 51)/2 ……(ii) => [x] = [sqrt(40[x] - 51)/2] Put [x] = 1 to 8 in this equation, and see which of the values work. You will find out that [x] = 2, 6, 7, 8 satisfies the last equation. Their corresponding solution for x can be found using the equation (ii). Final answers: 2x = √29, √189, √229, √269. Problem 2. Find the largest power of 3 that divides ((3!)!)!. Solution. ((3!)!)! = (6!)! = 720! (since 6! = 720). Using Legendre’s formula, the largest power of 3 that divides 720! is given by = [720/3] + [720/9] + [720/27] + [720/81] + [720/243] + [720/729] + ··· = 240 + 80 + 26 + 8 + 2 + 0 + ··· (the rest are zero) = 356. Problem 3. Solve the following system of equations: x + [y] + {z} =200.0, {x} + y + [z] =190.1, [x] + {y} + z =178.8. Solution. Simple but useful idea: what happens if we sum these up? If we sum them up, we get 2(x + y + z) = 568.9, so x + y + z = 284.45. Now from this equation, we can subtract the given equations one-by-one. Performing this with the first equation, we get x + y + z = 284.45 -x + [y] + {z} = 200.0 —————————————————————————————— => y - [y] + z - {z} = 84.45 => {y} + [z] = 84.45. Now this directly gives [z] = 84, {y} = 0.45. In a similar manner, we can find the others. (Other two equations will be [x] + {z} = 94.35, {x} + [y] = 105.65.) Final answers: x = 94.65, y = 105.45, z = 84.35. Problem 4. Let p and q be coprime positive integers. Show that [p/q] + [2p/q] + [3p/q] + ··· + [(q-1)p/q] = (p-1)(q-1)/2. Solution. Since p, q are coprime, kp/q will not be an integer, for any k = 1 to q-1. Hence observe that for any k = 1 to (q-1), we have [kp/q] + [(q-k)p/q] = [kp/q] + [p -kp/q] = [kp/q] + p + [-kp/q] = p-1 (using [-x] + [x] = 1). So, if we denote [p/q] + [2p/q] + [3p/q] + ··· + [(q-1)p/q] by S, then 2S = [p/q] + [2p/q] + ··· + [(q-2)p/q] + [(q-1)p/q] + [(q-1)p/q] + [(q-2)p/q] + ··· + [2p/q] + [p/q] = (p-1) + (p-1) + ··· + (p-1) + (p-1) [exactly (q-1) times] = (p-1)(q-1). Therefore, S = (p-1)(q-1)/2. Done! Remark. This identity is due to C.F.Gauss. Next day: Polynomials. You must come prepared (read the chapter on polynomials from your school textbook.) I am sending a few problems as homework in a separate pdf. Also read the section on box/floor function in chapter 1 of Excursion. If you wish to learn more Number Theory, read the following books: 1.
