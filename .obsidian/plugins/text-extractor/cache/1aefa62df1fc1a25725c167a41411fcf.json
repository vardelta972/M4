Frequent users of this discipline can just skim over the notation and take a look at formulas that talk about generalities in which the theorems will be shown. The reason for starting with basic principles is the intention to show that the theory is simple enough to be completely derived on 20 pages without using any high-level mathematics. If you take a look at the ﬁrst theorem and compare it with some scary inequality already mentioned in the table of contents, you will see how huge is the path that we will bridge in so few pages. And that will happen on a level accessible to a beginning high-school student. Well, maybe I exaggerated in the previous sentence, but the beginning high-school student should read the previous sentence again and forget about this one. Theorem 1. If x is a real number, then x2 ≥ 0. The equality holds if and only if x = 0. No proofs will be omitted in this text. Except for this one. We have to acknowledge that this is very important inequality, everything relies on it, ..., but the proof is so easy that it makes more sense wasting the space and time talking about its triviality than actually proving it. Do you know how to prove it? Hint: ”A friend of my friend is my friend”; ”An enemy of my enemy is my friend”. It might be useful to notice that ”An enemy of my friend is my enemy” and ”A friend of my enemy is my enemy”, but the last two facts are not that useful for proving theorem 1. I should also write about the difference between ”≥” and ”>”; that something weird happens when both sides of an inequality are multiplied by a negative number, but I can't imagine myself doing that. People would hate me for real. 2 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Theorem 2. If a, b ∈ R then: a2 + b2 ≥ 2ab. (1) The equality holds if and only if a = b. Proof. After subtracting 2ab from both sides the inequality becomes equivalent to (a − b)2 ≥ 0, which is true according to theorem 1. 2 Problem 1. Prove the inequality a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca, if a, b, c are real numbers. Solution. If we add the inequalities a2 + b2 ≥ 2ab, b2 + c2 ≥ 2bc, and c2 + a2 ≥ 2ca we get 2a2 + 2b2 + 2c2 ≥ 2ab + 2bc + 2ca, which is equivalent to what we are asked to prove. △ Problem 2. Find all real numbers a, b, c, and d such that a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = a(b + c + d). Solution. Recall that x2 + y2 ≥ 2xy, where the equality holds if and only if x = y. Applying this inequality to the pairs of numbers (a/2, b), (a/2, c), and (a/2, d) yields: a2 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 3 Problem 4. If x and y are two positive numbers less than 1, prove that 1 4 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Example 1. M1(x1, . . . , xn) is the arithmetic mean, while M2(x1, . . . , xn) is the geometric mean of the numbers x1, . . . , xn. M0 can't be deﬁned using the expression (7) but we will show late r that as r approaches 0, Mr will approach the geometric mean. The famous mean inequality can be now stated as Mr(x1, . . . , xn) ≤ Ms(x1, . . . , xn), for 0 ≤ r ≤ s. However we will treat this in slightly greater generality. Deﬁnition 2. Let m = (m1, . . . , mn) be a ﬁxed sequence of non-negative real numbers such that m1 + m2 + · · · + mn = 1. Then the weighted mean of order r of the sequence of positive reals x = (x1, . . . , xn) is deﬁned as: Mm r (x) = (xr 1m1 + xr 2m2 + · · · + xr nmn) 1 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 5 Now we will give a geometrical interpretation of convexity. Take any x3 ∈ (x1, x2). There is λ ∈ (0, 1) such that x2 = λx1 + (1 − λ)x3. Let's paint in green the line passing through x3 and parallel to the y axis. Let's paint in red the chord connecting the points (x1, f (x1)) and (x2, f (x2)). Assume that the green line and the red chord in- tersect at the yellow point. The y coordinate (also called the height) of the yellow point is: λ f (x1) + (1 − λ) f (x2). O x1 x2x3 f (x1) f (x2) f (x3) x y The inequality (9) means exactly that the the green line will intersect the graph of a function below the red chord. If f is strictly convex then the equality can hold in (9) if and only if x1 = x2. Example 3. The following functions are convex: ex, xp (for p ≥ 1, x > 0), 1 6 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Solution. The theorem 10 implies that for ﬁxed x the function ϕ(t) = f (t)− f (x) Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 7 Proof. For any α ∈ (0, 1) we have inequality (12). Let us write A = ( n ∑ i=1xp i mi )1/p , B = ( n ∑ i=1 yp i mi )1/p . In new terminology (12) reads as n ∑ i=1(xi + yi)pmi ≤ α1−pAp + (1 − α) 1−pBp. (14) If we choose α such that A 8 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com Proof. From (15) we immediately get xiyi = (αxi) yi Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 9 Solution. The given inequality is equivalent to x3(x + 1) + y3(y + 1) + z 3(z + 1) ≥ 3 10 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 4 Inequalities of Schur and Muirhead Deﬁnition 4. Let ∑!F(a1, . . . , an) be the sum of n! summands which are obtained from the function F(a1, . . . , an) making all permutations of the array (a). We will consider the special cases of the functio F, i.e. when F(a1, . . . , an) = aα1 1 · · · · · aαn n , αi ≥ 0. If (α) is an array of exponents and F(a1, . . . , an) = aα1 1 · · · · · aαn n we will use T [α1, . . . ,αn] instead of ∑!F(a1, . . . , an), if it is clear what is the sequence (a). Example 4. T [1, 0, . . . , 0] = (n − 1)! · (a1 + a2 + · · · + an), and T [ 1 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 11 Proof. First, we prove the necessity of the condition. Setting that all elements of the array a are equal to x, we get that x∑ α′ i ≤ x∑ αi. This can be satisﬁed for both large and small xs only if the condition 1 from the deﬁnition is satisﬁed. Now we put a1 = · · · , aν = x and aν+1 = · · · = an = 1. Comparing the highest powers of x in expressions T [α] and T [α′], knowing that for sufﬁciently large x we must have T [α′] ≤ T [α], we conclude that α′ 1 + · · · + α′ ν ≤ α1 + · · · + αν. Now we will proof the sufﬁciency of the condition. The statement will follow from the following two lemmas. We will deﬁne one linear operation L on the set of the exponents (α). Suppose that αk and αl are two different exponents of (α) such that αk > αl. We can write αk = ρ + τ, αl = ρ − τ (0 < τ ≤ ρ). If 0 ≤ σ < τ ≤ ρ, deﬁne the array (α′) = L(α) in the following way:    α′ k = ρ + σ = τ+σ 12 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com because α′ k > α′ l . We also have σ < τ, because α′ k < αk i α′ l > αl. Let α′′ k = ρ + σ, α′′ l = ρ − σ, α′′ ν = αν (ν ̸= k,ν ̸= l). Now instead of the sequence (α) we will consider the sequence (α′′). Number m has decreased by at least 1. It is easy to prove that the sequence (α′′) is increasing and majorizes (α′). Repeating this procedure, we will get the sequence (α′) which completes the proof of the second lemma, and hence the Muirhead's theorem. 2 2 Example 6. AM-GM is now the consequence of the Muirhead's inequality. Problem 9. Prove that for positive numbers a, b and c the following equality holds: 1 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 13 Proof. Let ci = f (yi)− f (xi) 14 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 6 Chebyshev's inequalities Theorem 16 (Chebyshev's inequalities) . Let a1 ≥ a2 ≥ · · · ≥ an and b1 ≥ b2 ≥ · · · ≥ bn be real numbers. Then n n ∑ i=1aibi ≥ ( n ∑ i=1 ai )( n ∑ i=1 bi ) ≥ n n ∑ i=1aibn+1−i. (22) The two inequalities become equalities at the same time when a1 = a2 = · · · = an or b1 = b2 = · · · = bn. The Chebyshev's inequality will follow from the following g eneralization (placing mi = 1 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 15 2. Prove that a3 16 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 13. If a, b and c are positive real numbers, prove that: a3 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 17 We will bound the denominator of the last fraction using the inequality xy ≤ (x + y)2/4 for appropriate x and y. For x = b + c and y = a + d we get (b + c)(a + d) ≤ (a + b + c + d)2/4. The equality holds if and only if a + d = b + c. Therefore a 18 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 3. We will ﬁrst prove that ab Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 19 The last inequality is true because q2 − l = ∑i̸= j bib j > 0 (bi are positive), and lk − m2 ≥ 0 (Cauchy-Schwartz inequality). The equality holds if and only if lk − m2 = 0, i.e. if the sequences (a) and (b) are proportional. 6. This is an example of a problem where we have some conditions on x, y, and z. Since there are many reciprocals in those conditions it is natural to divide both sides of the original inequality by xyz. Then it becomes (1 − 1 20 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com After simplifying we get that what we need to prove is − (αβ + βγ + γα) < T 2. (32) We also know that at most one of the numbers α, β, γ is negative. If all are positive, there is nothing to prove. Assume that γ < 0. Now (32) can be rewritten as −αβ − γ(α + β) < T 2. Since −γ < T we have that −αβ − γ(α + β) < −αβ + T (α + β) and the last term is less than T since (T − α)(T − β) > 0. 9. Starting from (a−b)2 Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 21 12. The expressions have to be homogenous in order to apply the Muirhead's theorem. First we divide both left and right-hand side by (abc) 4 22 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com 15. Let ai = exi and let (m1, . . . , mn), (k1, . . . , kn) be two permutations of (1, . . . , n) for which the sequences (3xm1 − xm1+1, . . . , 3xmn − xmn+1) and (2xk1, . . . , 2xkn) are non-increasing. As above we assume that xn+1 = xn. Similarly as in the problem 11 from the section 5 we prove that (2xki) ≺ (3xmi − xmi+1). The function f (x) = ex is convex so the Karamata's implies the required result. 16. Hint: Choose xi such that ai = exi. Sort the sequences (2x1 − x2, . . . , 2xn − x1) and (x1, . . . , xn) in non-increasing order, prove that the ﬁrst majorizes the second, and apply Karamata's in- equality with the convex function f (x) = 1 + ex. 17. Applying the Chebyshev's inequality ﬁrst we get an Ivan Mati´c: Classical Inequalities 23 conditions it follows that only x1 can be less than 1 and that 1 24 Olympiad Training Materials, www.imomath.com such that ϕ−1(B) consists of at least S","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
