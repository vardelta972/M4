To tile a region R means to ﬁnd a set S of non-overlapping regions such that their union is R. Suppose R is a square with side length 1. (i) Is it possible to tile R with ﬁnitely many circles? (ii) Is it possible to tile R with ﬁnitely many 30 − 60 − 90 triangles such that their longest side has a rational length? 2. Consider an n row by m column grid G such that each element of the grid is a non-negative integer, the sum of the elements in the grid is n, each element in the grid is no less than the element below it or to its right, and no two elements in a single row diﬀer by more than 1. Prove that the number of distinct grids G is independent of m and that it is equal to the number of ways of writing n as a sum of non-decreasing positive integers. (For example, when n = 4, there are 5 ways to do this: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 1 + 3, 2 + 2, and 4). 3. To a polynomial P (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, of degree at most 3, one can apply two operations: (a) ax3 + bx2 + cx + d becomes dx3 + cx2 + bx + a; (b) ax3 + bx2 + cx + d becomes a(x + t)3 + b(x + t)2 + c(x + t) + d. Determine if one can transform, by applications of these operations, the polynomial P1(x) = x3 + x2 − 2x into P2(x) = x3 − 3x − 2. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
