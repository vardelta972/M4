Questions 1. Let a triangle ABC be given. Let E be the midpoint of AC, F be the midpoint of CB, and G the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB (or its extension.) Prove that ABC is an isosceles triangle if and only if EF G is also isosceles. 2. Find all positive integers whose ﬁrst digit is 6 and which have the property that when this digit is deleted, the number is reduced by a factor of 25. Show that no positive integer has the property that when its ﬁrst digit is deleted it is reduced by a factor of 35. 3. Let an = 1 + 1/n − 1/n2 − 1/n3. Find the least positive integer k such that a2a3 · · · ak > 1000. 4. Let n be a positive integer. Prove that the number: 2n∑ k=n 1 k is not an integer. 5. How many sequences a1, a2, . . . , a2009 are there such that each of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , 2009 occurs in the sequence, and i ∈ {a1, a2, . . . , ai} for all i ≥ 2? 6. Let ABCD be a square, and let M be the point of intersection of its diagonals. Given a point P inside BM C, let E be the intersection of line DP and CM , and F the intersection of line CP and BM . Determine the set of such points P for which EF is parallel to AD. 7. The squares of an n × n chessboard are coloured black and white in the usual way, with a black square in the upper left hand corner. A series of re-colourings are then applied according to the following rule: a 2 × 3 or 3 × 2 rectangle containing three white squares is chosen, and the white squares are coloured black. For which values of n, if any, is it possible to colour all the white squares black in this way? 8. For which positive integers n does there exist a polynomial P (x) with integer coeﬃcients, such that P (d) = n/d for all positive divisors d of n?","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
