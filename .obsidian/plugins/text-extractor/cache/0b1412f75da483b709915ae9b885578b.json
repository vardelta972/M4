(IMO Short list 2008, C2) Let Xn be the number of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} that have the given property, and let Yn be the number of permutations of {2, 3, . . . , n + 1} that have the given property. Note that 2(a1 + a2 + . . . + ak) ≡ 2 ((a1 − 1) + (a2 − 1) + . . . + (ak − 1) )(mod k), so we can always subtract one from each a1, a2, . . . , an without changing the problem. In particular, this means that Xn = Yn. It is easy to check that X1 = 1, X2 = 2, and X3 = 6. From now on, we will assume n ≥ 4. We have 2(a1 + a2 + . . . + an) = 2(1 + 2 + l · · · + n) = n(n + 1) ≡ 0(mod n), so a permutation need only satisfy the given condition for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. Examining the condition for n − 1, we see that (n − 1)|2(a1 + a2 + · · · + an − an), so (n − 1)|n(n + 1) − 2an. This says that 2an = 2(mod n − 1), so either an = 1, n or n is odd and an = n+1 2 . Suppose we’re in the latter case. Then examining the condition for n − 2, we get (n − 2)|2(a1 + a2 + · · · + an − an − an−1), so (n − 2)|n2 − 1 − 2an−1. But this implies 2an−1 = 3(mod n − 2), and since n − 2 is odd, this has the unique solution an−1 = n+1 2 , which contradicts an−1 ̸= an. So we must have an = 1 or an = n. This means that Xn = Xn−1 + Yn−1 = 2Xn−1. For n ≥ 3, we therefore have Xn = 3 · 2n−2. 2. (Mongolia 2008 TST, #2.1) Claim: For any positive real numbers a, b, c, d satisfying d2 = a2 + b2 + c2, we have f (a) + f (b) + f (c) = f (d). Proof: Set z = d−a 2 , x = b2 4z , y = c2 4z . These values are all positive since d > a. Further- 1 more, x + y − z = b2 + c2 4z − z = (d2 − a2) − (d2 + a2 − 2ad) 2(d − a) = a, 2 √xz = 2 √ z · b2 4z = b, 2√yz = 2 √ z · c2 4z = c, and x + y + z = b2 + c2 4z + z = (d2 − a2) + (d2 + a2 − 2ad) 2(d − a) = d. Since x + y − z = a > 0, we can substitute x, y, z into the given equation to get f (a) + f (b) + f (c) = f (d), which completes the proof of the claim. Now let g(x) = f ( √x). We have proven that g(a) + g(b) + g(c) = g(a + b + c) for all a, b, c > 0. Taking a = b = c = x, we have g(3x) = 3g(x). Taking a = b = 3x and c = x, we then have g(7x) = 7g(x). Taking a = b = 2x and c = 3x, we then have g(2x) = 2g(x). Now, taking a = b = x and c = (n − 2)x, we have g(nx) = 2g(x) + g((n − 2)x), so it follows that g(nx) = ng(x) for all positive integers n. For any positive integers p, q, we therefore have g( p q ) = 1 q · g(p) = p q · g(1) (*). Also, if a < d, then g(d) − g(a) = g(b) + g(c) > 0, so g is increasing. Since the rationals are dense in the reals, it now follows from (∗) that g(x) = Cx for some constant C > 0, and hence f (x) = Cx2. Conversely, if f (x) = Cx2, then f (x + y − z) + f (2 √xz) + f (2 √yz) = (x + y − z)2 + (2√ xz)2 + (2√yz)2 = (x + y + z)2 = f (x + y + z). Remark: It isn’t necessary to calculate x, y, z explicitly to prove the claim. One may also proceed as follows: First ﬁx the products xz and yz, and let z vary. Then if z is very small, x + y − z will approach inﬁnity, and if z is very big, x + y − z will approach minus inﬁnity, so by continuity of x + y − z as a function of z, x + y − z will take every possible value. If you ﬁnd this sort of argument confusing and want to understand it better, feel free to speak to one of the trainers! 3. (IMO Short list 2002, N4 If p = 5, then a = 2 satisﬁes the given condition. From this point forward, we will assume p ≥ 7. Claim 1: If x ∈ [1, p − 1], then xp−1 ̸≡ (p − x)p−1(mod p2). Proof: By the binomial theorem, (p − x)p−1 ≡ x p−1 − p(p − 1) · xp−2 ̸≡ xp−1(mod p2) since p ̸ |x, p − 1. Claim 2: If x ∈ [1, p − 1], then xp−1 ̸≡ (x + 2p)p−1(mod p2). Proof: Again, the binomial theorem gives (x + 2p)p−1 ≡ xp−1 + 2p(p − 1) · xp−2 ̸≡ xp−1(mod p 2) since p ̸ |x, p − 1. Let us call a number x “good” if xp−1 ≡ 1(mod p2). By pairing up x and p − x for all x ∈ [ 1, p−1 2 ] , Condition 1 implies that at most p−1 2 numbers in [1, p−1] are good. Furthermore, 2 we already know that 1 is good. Now, if two consecutive numbers in [1, p] are not good, then the problem is done. Otherwise, the good numbers in [1, p] must be exactly 1, 3, 5, . . . , p − 2. Now, (3p − 6)p−1 ≡ 3p−1 · (p − 2)p−1 ≡ 1(mod p2), so 3p − 6 is good. However, we already know p − 6 is good, so this contradicts Claim 2. The proof is now complete. 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
