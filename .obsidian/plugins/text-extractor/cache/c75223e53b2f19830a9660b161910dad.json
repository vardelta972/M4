It is nothing but a set of problems posted by active users of AoPS/MathLinks, and it will be a really good source for preparing for mathematical olympiads. I just like to thank all people who posted the problems: Andrew (WakeUp), Goutham, Orlando (orl), Valentin (Valentin Vornicu), Darij (darij grin- berg), Vesselin (vess), Gabriel (harazi), April, Arne, and Kunihiko (kunny). And a special thanks goes to Ben (bluecarneal) who helped me a lot to edit and compile this problem set. But How To Use It? You probably ask this question when you see the problems have been categorized by their posters, not by thir level/subject. First, let me tell you why are the problems are categorized like that. It’s simple: the large number of problems. It would take me a very long time to categorize all these problems and put them altogether. The Solution. Problems posted by me, Andrew, Goutham, Orlando, Valentin, and April are almost all problems of known competitions like USAMO, Iran national olympiad, etc. So, they are all olympiad level problems and you can solve them when you think you’re prepared enough in most subjects of number theory. Problems posted by Vesselin, Gabriel, and in some cases, Darij, are really hard! Obviously, they need more skills to solve. And ﬁnally problems posted by Arne and Kunihiko are random and you can ﬁnd problems of diﬀerent levels in their parts. Enjoy Problem Solving!

An integer a on the board can be re- placed with four pairwise diﬀerent integers a1, a2, a3, a4 such that the arithmetic mean 1 4 (a1 + a2 + a3 + a4) of the four new integers is equal to the number a.
