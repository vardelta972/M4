Johnny has saved 403 5 − 402 2 · (403 3 + 2 · 403 2 + 3 · 403 + 4) dollars to buy a new playstation whose cost is 2009.99 dollars. Has Johnny saved enough money? 2. Is it possible to write the number 12 + 2 2 + 3 2 + · · · + 12 2 as a sum of 11 distinct squares? 3. Two quadratic polynomials f1(x) = x2 + a1x + b1, f2(x) = x2 + a2x + b2 have roots x0, x1 and x0, x2, respectively, with x1 ̸= x2. Find the roots of the quadratic f (x) = x2 + a1 + a2 2 x + b1 + b2 2 . 4. Two players alternate making moves in a game on a 1 × 100 strip consisting of 100 unit squares. In one move the ﬁrst player colours any four consecutive squares. The second player’s move is to colour any three consecutive squares. It is not permitted to colour the same square twice. The player who cannot make his next move loses the game. Who has a winning strategy? 5. In a convex quadrilateral each vertex is connected by two line segments with the midpoints of the two opposite sides. In total eight line segments are drawn. Suppose that seven of them have the same length a. Prove that the length of the remaining segment is also a.

Find all triples of non-zero distinct integers a, b, c such that they can be written in an arithmetic progression and their reciprocals 1/a, 1/b, 1/c can be written in an arithmetic progression too. 7. Find all functions f for which f (x − y) = f (x) + f (y) − 2xy for all real numbers x and y. 8. What is the smallest positive integer n, such that there exist positive integers a and b, with b obtained from a by a rearrangement of its digits, so that a − b = 11 . . . 1| {z } n ? 9. Through the incentre I of triangle ABC a straight line is drawn intersecting AB and BC at points M and N , respectively, in such a way that the triangle BM N is acute- angled. On the side AC the points K and L are chosen such that ∠ILA = ∠IM B and ∠IKC = ∠IN B. Prove that AC = AM + KL + CN . 10. Two players alternate making moves in a game on a 3 × 3 square table. In one move a player writes a number in a square of this table. The available numbers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and the same number cannot be written in the table twice so at the end of the game all of them will be written in the table. The ﬁrst player wins if at the end of the game the sum of numbers in one of the rows or in one of the columns is equal to 14 and loses otherwise. Does the ﬁrst player have a winning strategy?
