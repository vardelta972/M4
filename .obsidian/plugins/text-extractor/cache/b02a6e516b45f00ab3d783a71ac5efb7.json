Consider the equation ax + by = c where a, b, c are given integers and we seek solutions for integer x, y. Show that, the equation has a solution iﬀ d | c where d = gcd(a, b). Furthermore, if (x0, y0) be a particular solution then show that all other solutions are given by x = x0 + (b/d)t, y = y0 − (a/d)t where t is an arbitrary integer. 2. If {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n with n > 2, then show that ∑ϕ(n) i=1 ri ≡ 0 (mod n). 3. For any n ∈ N, ﬁnd the average of all integers in {1, 2, . . . , n} that are coprime to n. 4. For any n ∈ N, deﬁne Un to be the set of positive integers less than or equal to n that are coprime to n. For example, U12 = {1, 5, 7, 11}. Let m, n be coprime positive integers. Deﬁne a function f : Umn → Um × Un as f (c mod mn) = (c mod m, c mod n). Show that f is bijective and hence prove that ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n) for coprime m, n ∈ N. 5. Suppose that m, n are natural numbers such that ϕ(mn) = ϕ(m)ϕ(n). Is it necessary that m, n must be coprime? 6. A number is called square-free if it is not divisible by the square of any integer greater than 1. Show that there exists 2020 consecutive integers none of which is square-free. 7. What is the remainder when 12 345678 is divisible by 90? 8. Consider the sequence a1, a2, . . . deﬁned by an = 2 n + 3n + 6n − 1 (n = 1, 2, . . . ). Show that no positive integer other than 1 is coprime to every term of the sequence. 9. There are no positive integers m, n, p such that 4mn − m − n = p2. 10. A natural number n is said to have the property P, if for every a, n 2 divides an − 1 whenever n divides an − 1. (a) Show that every prime number n has property P. (b) Show that there are inﬁnitely many composite numbers n that possess property P. 11. (a) Show that there are exactly 2 numbers a in {2, 3, . . . , 9999} for which a2 − a is divisible by 10000. Find these values of a. (b) Let n be a positive integer. For how many numbers a in {2, 3, . . . , n2 − 1} is a2 − a divisible by n2? State your answer suitably in terms of n and justify. 12. Suppose {r1, r2, . . . , rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n. Find all a such that {a + r1, a + r2, . . . , a + rϕ(n)} is a reduced residue system modulo n. 13. Let a, b be positive integers. Prove that in the inﬁnite A.P. {ak + b : k ≥ 0}, there exist inﬁnitely many terms with the same prime divisors. (In other words, you need to ﬁnd an inﬁnite subsequence whose set of prime divisors is ﬁxed.) 14. Prove that the sequence 2 n − 3(n > 1) contains a subsequence of numbers that are pairwisely coprime. 1 15. The positive integers a and b are such that the numbers 15a + 16b and 16a − 15b are both squares of positive integers. What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the sum of these two squares? 16. Find all pairs of positive integers (x, p) such that p is a prime, x ≤ 2p, and xp−1 divides (p − 1)x + 1. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
