The idea is that of convex functions. We formulate this idea more precisely for a function f on an interval I (this can be closed or open, bounded or unbounded) as follows: Deﬁnition. A function f : I → R is convex, if for all x, y ∈ I and all µ ∈ [0, 1], µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) ≥ f (µx + [1 − µ]y) . (a) convex (b) not convex Figure 1: Functions For example, let’s show that the function f (x) = 1/x is convex. Indeed, for any x, y ∈ (0, ∞) and µ ∈ [0, 1], (x − y) 2 ≥ 0 and hence (µy + [1 − µ]x) (µx + [1 − µ]y) = xy + µ[1 − µ](x − y) 2 ≥ xy, which means µ 1 x + [1 − µ] 1 y = µy + [1 − µ]x xy ≥ 1 µx + [1 − µ]y . Exercise 1. Let f : I → R be a convex function. Show that for all x, y ∈ I and all µ ∈ R \\ [0, 1] such that µx + [1 − µ]y ∈ I, µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) ≤ f (µx + [1 − µ]y) . Exercise 2 (Jensen’s inequality). Let f : I → R be a convex function. Show that for any integer n, any real numbers x1, x2, . . . xn ∈ I, and any positive real numbers µ1, µ2, . . . µn such that µ1 + · · · + µn = 1, µ1f (x1) + µ2f (x2) + · · · + µnf (xn) ≥ f (µ1x1 + µ2x2 + · · · + µnxn) . 1 Among the nice consequences of Jensen’s inequality are the power mean inequalities. For instance, the AM-HM inequality is obtained by setting f (x) = 1/x and µ1 = · · · = µn = 1 n : for all x1, . . . xn ∈ (0, ∞), x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ≥ n 1 x1 + · · · + 1 xn . You may have encountered the following related geometrical concept: Deﬁnition. A set A ⊆ R2 of points in the plane is convex, if for all x, y ∈ A and all µ ∈ [0, 1], µx + [1 − µ]y ∈ A. (a) convex (b) convex (c) not convex Figure 2: Shapes How are these concepts related? A function f : R → R is convex precisely if the region above its graph is convex. 2 Not everyone is below average Theorem 1. A convex function on a closed bounded interval attains its maximum at one of its endpoints. Proof. Suppose f : [a, b] → R is strongly convex. Then for any t ∈ [a, b], taking x, y, µ to be a, b, (b − t)/(b − a) respectively, we ﬁnd f (t) = f ([ b − t b − a ] a + [ 1 − b − t b − a ] b) ≤ [ b − t b − a ] f (a) + [ 1 − b − t b − a ] f (b). That is, f (t) is at most some weighted average of f (a) and f (b). This means that at least one of f (a) and f (b) is greater than or equal to f (t): f (t) ≤ [ b − t b − a ] f (a) + [1 − b − t b − a ] f (b) ≤ ([ b − t b − a ] + [ 1 − b − t b − a ]) max [f (a), f (b)] = max [f (a), f (b)] . It follows that max t∈[a,b] f (t) = max[f (a), f (b)]. 2 The idea here is: If the average of a set of numbers is m, then at least one of the numbers is at least m. The Pigeonhole Principle is another version of this same trick. Exercise 3. Show that there is some pair of Londoners, who have the same number of hairs on their heads. Exercise 4 (APMO 2002). Let a1, a2, . . . an be natural numbers, and set A = a1 + · · · + an n . Show that a1!a2! · · · an! ≥ (⌊A⌋!) n. 3 Iterate and pad The rest of these notes are a diversion into the land of midpoint-convex functions. Deﬁnition. The function f : I → R is midpoint-convex, if for all x, y ∈ I, f (x) + f (y) 2 ≥ f ( x + y 2 ) . Clearly convexity implies midpoint-convexity. However, there exist midpoint-convex functions that are not convex. Such functions can be very strange and interesting. We will explore this distinction further in the next section. In this section, we will prove a version of Jensen’s inequality for midpoint-convex functions. We need a much cleverer argument here than we did for standard Jensen’s in the previous section. Here’s the idea, a variant of standard induction: Suppose that we are given a sequence S1, S2, . . . of statements and an increasing sequence a1, a2, . . . of natural numbers, and that 1. S1 is true; 2. if Sak is true then Sak+1 is true; and, 3. if Sn is true, then for all m < n, Sm is also true. Then Sn is true for all n. Theorem 2. Let f : I → R be a midpoint-convex function. Then for any integer n and any real numbers x1, x2, . . . xn ∈ I, f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xn) n ≥ f ( x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ) . Proof. We are given a midpoint-convex function f : I → R. Let Sn be the statement, For any real numbers x1, x2, . . . xn ∈ I, f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xn) n ≥ f ( x1 + x2 + · · · + xn n ) . 3 S1 says that f (x1) ≥ f (x1) for all x1 ∈ I, and this is certainly true. For the second step, suppose that S2k is true. We’ll deduce S2k+1 by applying the deﬁnition of midpoint- convexity to two copies of S2k . Indeed, take any real numbers x1, x2, . . . x2k+1 ∈ I; then f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (x2k+1 ) 2k+1 ≥ f ( x1+x2+···+x 2k 2k ) + f ( x 2k +1+x2k +2+···+x2k+1 2k ) 2 ≥ f ( x1 + x2 + · · · + x2k+1 2k+1 ) . Finally, suppose that Sn is true. We’ll show that Sm is true for all m ≤ n, by applying Sn to some m variables x1, . . . xm ∈ I that we care about, plus n − m copies of the ﬁller variable X = x1 + · · · + xm m . Indeed, Sn gives f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xm) + (n − m)f (X) n ≥ f ( x1 + x2 + · · · + xm + (n − m)X n ) . Simplifying the left-hand side, f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xm) + (n − m)f (X) n = f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xm) n + ( n − m n ) f (X). In the right-hand side bracket, x1 + x2 + · · · + xm + (n − m)X n = x1 + x2 + · · · + xm n + ( n − m n ) X = ( m n + n − m n ) X = X. Substituting back, multiplying by n/m and subtracting a term, we get f (x1) + f (x2) + · · · + f (xm) m ≥ f (X) = f ( x1 + · · · + xm m ) . Exercise 5. A sequence a0, a1, a2 . . . of whole numbers is given, such that for any whole number k, there is exactly one pair i, j of whole numbers for which ai + 2aj = k. Find all possible values for a2009. Exercise 6. For each natural number n, deﬁne rad (n) to be the product of the primes which divide n. Pick some natural number a, and deﬁne a sequence a0 = a, a1, a2, . . . by the recurrence an+1 = an + rad (an). Show that the sequence contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. 4 4 Approximation by rationals In this section, we’ll explore some situations in which midpoint-convexity does imply convexity. So assume f is midpoint-convex. First, for any 0 ≤ k ≤ n, applying Theorem 2 to the n real numbers x1 = x2 = · · · = xk = x, xk+1 = · · · = xn = y gives kf (x) + [n − k]f (y) n ≥ f (kx + [n − k]f (y)); that is, k n f (x) + [ 1 − k n ] f (y) ≥ f ( k n x + [ 1 − k n ] y) . So midpoint-convexity implies that for all x, y ∈ I and all rational µ ∈ [0, 1], µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) ≥ f (µx + [1 − µ]y). Going further requires a new tool – approximation of reals by rationals – which is based on the following fact: The rationals are dense in the line. More precisely, for any real number x ∈ R and any real ϵ > 0, there is a rational number ξ ∈ Q for which |x − ξ| < ϵ. Equivalently, for any real number x ∈ R, there is a sequence (ξj)j∈N ⊆ Q of rational numbers with limit x. For a quick justiﬁcation, note that we can approximate, say, π, by its sequence 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, . . . of truncated decimal representations, in which the j-th term diﬀers by at most 10 j−1 from π. Of course, there are many other sequences of rationals with limit π. Now we’ll show that either of two quite natural conditions on a midpoint-convex function imply convexity. The ﬁrst is boundedness. Lemma 3. If f : I → R is midpoint-convex and bounded above, then it is convex. Proof. Ross Atkins showed me this. Let f be bounded above by M . Take any x, y ∈ I. Without loss of generality, x < y. For shorthand, for any real number µ, write tµ for the expression µx + [1 − µ]y. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that for some µ, f (tµ) > µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y). Say that f (tµ) − µf (x) − [1 − µ]f (y) = h, where h > 0. Choose n ∈ N big enough that M − min[f (x), f (y)] < nh. Let a ∈ R be any real number for which 1. µ − a is rational; and, 2. a is small enough (in absolute value) that µ − a and µ + na are in [0, 1]. Since the rationals are dense in the line, such an a exists. Then [ 1 n + 1 ] tµ+na + [ n n + 1 ] tµ−a = tµ, and so by Jensen’s inequality [ 1 n + 1 ] f (tµ+na) + [ n n + 1 ] f (tµ−a) ≥ f (tµ); 5 that is, f (tµ+na) ≥ (n + 1)f (tµ) − nf (tµ−a) = (n + 1) (µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) + h) − nf (tµ−a). Also since µ − a is rational, f (tµ−a) ≤ (µ − a)f (x) + [1 − (µ − a)]f (y). Combining the last two equations gives f (tµ+na) ≥ (µ + na)f (x) + [1 − (µ + na)]f (y) + (n + 1)h ≥ min[f (x), f (y)] + (n + 1)h > M, a contradiction. Hence the convexity condition must hold for all µ. The other condition in question is continuity; that is: Deﬁnition. A function f : I → R is continuous, if for all convergent sequences (xj)j∈N ⊆ I, lim j→∞ f (xj) = f ( lim j→∞ xj). Lemma 4. If f : I → R is midpoint-convex and continuous, then it is convex. Proof. Let f : I → R be midpoint-convex and continuous. Since the rationals are dense in the line, we can choose a sequence (µj)j∈N ⊆ [0, 1] of rational numbers with limit µ. Let us do so. Then µx + [1 − µ]y = lim j→∞ [µjx + [1 − µj]y] and µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) = lim j→∞ [µjf (x) + [1 − µj]f (y)] . So if f is continuous, then we can conclude that µf (x) + [1 − µ]f (y) = lim j→∞ [µjf (x) + [1 − µj]f (y)] ≥ lim j→∞ f (µjx + [1 − µj]y) = f ( lim j→∞ [µjx + [1 − µj]y]) = f (µx + [1 − µ]y). That is, f is convex. Exercise 7. Find all continuous functions f : R → R, such that for all x, y ∈ R, f (x) + f (y) = f (x + y). Exercise 8. Find all functions f : R → R, which are bounded above on some interval, and which for all x, y ∈ R satisfy f (x) + f (y) = f (x + y). Exercise 9. Construct an increasing function f : Q + → Q+, so that for all x ∈ Q +, f (f (x)) = 3x. 6 5 Problems 1. (IMO 2004) Let n ≥ 3 be an integer.
