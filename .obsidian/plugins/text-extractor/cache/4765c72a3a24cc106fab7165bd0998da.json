Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and suppose ∠ABC is the largest angle of the triangle. Let R be its circumcentre. Suppose the circumcircle of triangle ARB cuts AC again in X. Prove that RX is pependicular to BC. 2. Find all real numbers x and y such that x2 + 2y2 + 1 2 ≤ x(2y + 1). 3. Prove that there does not exist any positive integer n < 2310 such that n(2310 − n) is a multiple of 2310. 4. Find all positive real numbers x, y, z such that 2x − 2y + 1 z = 1 2014 , 2y − 2z + 1 x = 1 2014 , 2z − 2x + 1 y = 1 2014 . 5. Let ABC be a triangle. Let X be on the segment BC such that AB = AX. Let AX meet the circumcircle Γ of triangle ABC again at D. Show that the circumcentre of △BDX lies on Γ. 6. For any natural number n, let S(n) denote the sum of the digits of n. Find the number of all 3-digit numbers n such that S(S(n)) = 2. ———-000———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
