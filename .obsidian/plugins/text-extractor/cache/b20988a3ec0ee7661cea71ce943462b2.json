Consider 2021 cards, each having one gold side and one black side, lying in a line on a long table. Initially all cards show their gold sides. Two players, standing by the same long side of the table, play a game with alternating moves. Each move consists of choosing a block of 40 consecutive cards, the leftmost of which is showing gold, and turning them all over, so those which showed gold now show black and vice versa. The last player who can make a legal move wins. (a) Does the game necessarily end? (b) Does there exist a winning strategy for the starting player? Solution. Suppose at any step, we write 1 in place of a card with the gold-face up, and 0 for a card with the black-face up. This will give us a sequence of 2021 many 0’s and 1’s. Any conﬁguration of the cards corresponds to such a unique combination of 2021 many 0’s and 1’s, which we can interpret as the binary representation of a natural number. Now observe that this number decreases at each step. Because, a 40-digit binary number that starts with 1 is strictly greater than any 40-digit binary number that starts with 0. (. . . 10110 . . . 0 . . . )2 > (. . . 01001 . . . 1 . . . )2 Thus, the binary number corresponding to the conﬁguration of the cards strictly de- creases after each move. But it cannot decrease indeﬁnitely, because it is always a non-negative integer. Therefore, the game must end. This answers part (a) of the question. (b) Unfortunately, the number of gold-facing cards does not change monotonically as the game proceeds. However, we can focus our attention to a subset of them, say, the cards at the places numbered S = {22, 62, 102, . . . , 1982}. Note that S has 50 elements. Let N = number of gold-facing cards from S. Since each consecutive block of 40 cards contains exactly one of the cards from the set 1 S, the number N changes by a unit amount (+1 or −1) at each step. Hence the parity of N alters after move. Initially N is 50 (even), so N will be odd after any odd number of moves. Now, the odd numbered moves are from the starting player and the even numbered moves are from the second player. Therefore, after any move of the starting player, N will be odd, hence non-zero. Hence the second player can always place a move after any number of moves of the starting player. Thus, the starting player does not have any winning strategy. In fact, the second player always wins: he/she just have to keep picking blocks that start with a number from S. 2. Given are n red points and n blue points in the plane, no three collinear. Show that we can draw n non-intersecting line segments connecting the blue points to the red points. Solution using monovariance. First we match each blue point to a unique red point, in an arbitrary fashion. Now, whenever there is a point of intersection, we just change the pairs, as shown in the following diagram. It is easy to observe, using the triangle inequality, that the sum of the lengths of the n line segments, call it ℓ, strictly decreases whenever we make a change as shown in the above diagram. Can this sum of the lengths (ℓ) decrease indeﬁnitely? The number of all possible conﬁgurations is ﬁnite (in fact, n!). So, we can take the minimum possible value of ℓ over all possible conﬁgurations. Therefore, no matter how we start, the process of strictly decreasing ℓ-value at each step cannot run indeﬁnitely. When it stops, we must get a conﬁguration with zero intersections, because otherwise the ℓ-value of this conﬁgurations can be lowered further, giving us a contradiction. Extremal Principle: In a given setup, we consider an element/conﬁguration with some maximal or minimal property and show that it has the desired property. Solution using extremal principle. For any matching of the n red points with the n blue points, let ℓ denote the sum of the lengths of the n line segments. Now, among all the possible conﬁgurations (there are ﬁnitely many of them), consider a conﬁguration that has the smallest value of ℓ. We claim that this “extremal” conﬁguration gives a matching that we desire to achieve. 2 To prove our claim, let us proceed by contradiction. Let, if possible, our extremal conﬁguration contain at least one intersection. Then we make a change as shown in the following diagram. It is easy to observe, using the triangle inequality, that the above change decreases the quantity ℓ further, which contradicts the minimality of our conﬁguration. This completes the proof. 3. The Parliament of Sikinia consists of one house. Every member has at most three enemies among the remaining members. Note that a member cannot be his own enemy, and enmity is mutual. Show that one can split the house into two houses so that every member has at most one enemy in his house. Solution. For any conﬁguration1, let N be the sum of the number of enemies each member has in his own house. Since there are only ﬁnitely many conﬁgurations, we can pick a conﬁguration that has the minimum possible value of N . We claim that in this extremal conﬁguration, each member must have at most one enemy at in his own house. To prove our claim, let us assume to the contrary that there is a member, call him X, who has more than one enemy in his own house. Say, his enemies in his own house are {A, B, . . . }. Since each person can have at most three enemies, the person X can have at most one enemy in the other house, call him C. Now we can send this member X to the other house. This will decrease the number of enemies X has in his own house. This will also decrease the number of enemies (in own house) of the enemies {A, B, . . . } of X, and if there is C, only for him that number will increase (only +1). In total, the number N decreases after we send X to the other house, which contradicts the minimality of our conﬁguration. 4. On each square of an 8 × 8 chessboard, a real number is written. Suppose that each number equals the average (arithmetic mean) of its neighbours (above, below, left, right). Show that all the numbers on the chessboard must be equal. 1Here “conﬁguration” means a way of dividing the parliament members into the two houses. 3 Solution. We start with a square which contains the maximum number, say M, among all the written numbers. Since M is the largest one, all of its neighbours are less than or equal to M . Now, if one of those neighbours is strictly less than M, then their average will also be strictly less than M . But then that average cannot be equal to M , which is a contradiction. Therefore, all the neighbouring numbers must also be equal to M. We can easily spread this argument across the board. 5. There are n points given in the plane. Any three of the points form a triangle of area less than 1. Show that all n points lie in a triangle of area less than 4. Solution. Consider all possible triangles that can be formed by joining three of the n given vertices. Among these triangles, consider one that has the maximum possible area, call it △ABC. Draw lines through A, B and C parallel to their opposite sides, and let these lines meet at D, E, F , such that A, B, C are the midpoints of EF, F D, DE respectively. Since △ABC is the medial triangle of △DEF , we get area(DEF ) = 4 × area(ABC) < 4. We claim that △DEF contains all the n given points. To prove our claim, let us assume to the contrary that there is a point P that lies outside △DEF. Let us assume w.l.o.g. that P lies on the opposite side of DF of the triangle. Let P C intersect DF at Q. Then area(AP C) > area(AQC) = area(ABC), which contradicts the maximality of the area of △ABC. This completes the proof. 4 Some more problems 1. A dragon has 100 heads. A knight can cut oﬀ 15, 17, 20, or 5 heads, respectively, with one blow of his sword. In each of these cases, 24, 2, 14, or 17 heads grow on its shoulders. If all the heads are blown oﬀ, the dragon dies. Can the dragon be killed? 2. An infection spreads among the squares of an n × n grid in the following manner: every second any square adjacent to at least two infected squares becomes infected itself. (Two squares are called adjacent if they share a common edge.) Prove that the whole grid cannot be infected if initially there are at most n − 1 many infected squares. Can it be done if we start with n infected squares? 3. Five hundred people attend a party in a mansion with many rooms. Each minute somebody walks from one room into a diﬀerent room with at least as many people. Prove that eventually all the people will be gathered in one room. 4. The integers 1, 2, . . . , n are arranged in any order. In one step, you may switch any two neighbouring integers. Prove that you can never reach the initial order after an odd number of steps. 5. To each vertex of a regular pentagon an integer is assigned, such that the sum of all ﬁve numbers is positive. If three consecutive vertices are assigned the numbers x, y, z respectively, and y < 0, then the following operation is allowed: x, y, z are replaced by x + y, −y, z + y, respectively. Such an operation is performed repeatedly as long as at least one of the ﬁve numbers is negative. Determine whether this procedure necessarily comes to an end after a ﬁnite number of steps. 6. Let S be a set of points in the plane such that each point in S is a midpoint of two other points in S. Show that S must be an inﬁnite set. 7. Show that for every n > 1, the number 2n − 1 is not a multiple of n. 8. Rooks are placed on the n × n chessboard satisfying the following condition: If the square (i, j) is free, then at least n rooks are on the i-th row and j-th column together. Show that there are at least n2/2 rooks on the board. 9. We call a polynomial p(x) having integer coeﬃcients to be primitive if the gcd of the coeﬃcients of p(x) is 1. Show that product of two primitive polynomials is also a primitive polynomial. 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
