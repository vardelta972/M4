Oct. 21, start of class 6.2 Divisibility and primes in Z[i] and Z Exercise 6.5. Factor 17 and 53 in Z[i]. (Exercise 6.2.4.) 6.3 Conjugates Exercise 6.6. Suppose p ∈ N is prime in Z but factors as p = αβ where α, β are non-units in Z[i]. Show β = α. 6.4 Division in Z[i] Exercise 6.7. Use the Euclidean algorithm to determine a gcd for α = 5 and β = 3 + 4i in Z[i]. Exercise 6.8. Let π, β ∈ Z[i] and u be a unit of Z[i]. Show that π|uβ ⇐⇒ π|β. Exercise 6.9. Suppose π and π′ are primes of Z[i]. Show π|π′ implies π = uπ′ where u is a unit of Z[i]. Exercise 6.10. Let u be a unit in Z[i]. Show π is prime in Z[i] if and only if uπ is prime in Z[i]. Exercise 6.11. Suppose α is prime in Z[i]. Show N (α) = p or N (α) = p2 for some prime p of N. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
