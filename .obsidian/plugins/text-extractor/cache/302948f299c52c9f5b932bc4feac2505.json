I was motivated to write it by feeling guilty for getting free 7’s on problems by simply regurgitating a few tricks I happened to know, while other students were unable to solve the problem. Warning: These are notes, not a full handout. Lots of the exposition is very minimal, and many things are left to the reader. In a problem with n variables, these respectively mean to cycle through the n variables, and to go through all n! permutations. To provide an example, in a three-variable problem we might write ∑ cyc a 2 = a 2 + b 2 + c 2 ∑ cyc a 2b = a 2b + b 2c + c 2a ∑ sym a 2 = a 2 + a 2 + b 2 + b 2 + c 2 + c 2 ∑ sym a 2b = a 2b + a 2c + b 2c + b 2a + c 2a + c 2b. 1 Polynomial Inequalities 1.1 AM-GM and Muirhead Consider the following theorem. Theorem 1 (AM-GM). For nonnegative reals a1, a2, . . . , an we have a1 + a2 + · · · + an n ≥ n√a1 . . . an. Equality holds if and only if a1 = a2 = · · · = an. For example, this implies a 2 + b 2 ≥ 2ab, a 3 + b 3 + c 3 ≥ 3abc. Adding such inequalities can give us some basic propositions. Example 2. Prove that a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ ab + bc + ca a4 + b4 + c4 ≥ a2bc + b2ca + c2ab. 1 Evan Chen 1 Polynomial Inequalities Proof. By AM-GM, a2 + b2 2 ≥ ab and 2a4 + b2 + c2 4 ≥ a2bc. Similarly, b2 + c2 2 ≥ bc and 2b4 + c2 + a2 4 ≥ b 2ca. c2 + a2 2 ≥ ca and 2c4 + a2 + b2 4 ≥ c 2ab. Summing the above statements gives a2 + b 2 + c 2 ≥ ab + bc + ca and a 4 + b 4 + c 4 ≥ a 2bc + b 2ca + c 2ab. Exercise 3. Prove that a3 + b3 + c3 ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a. Exercise 4. Prove that a5 + b5 + c5 ≥ a3bc + b3ca + c3ab ≥ abc(ab + bc + ca). The fundamental intuition is being able to decide which symmetric polynomials of a given degree are bigger. For example, for degree 3, the polynomial a3 + b3 + c3 is biggest and abc is the smallest. Roughly, the more “mixed” polynomials are the smaller. From this, for example, one can immediately see that the inequality (a + b + c)3 ≥ a 3 + b 3 + c 3 + 24abc must be true, since upon expanding the LHS and cancelling a3 + b3 + c3, we ﬁnd that the RHS contains only the piddling term 24abc. That means a straight AM-GM will suﬃce. A useful formalization of this is Muirhead’s Inequality. Suppose we have two sequences x1 ≥ x2 ≥ · · · ≥ xn and y1 ≥ y2 ≥ · · · ≥ yn such that x1 + x2 + · · · + xn = y1 + y2 + · · · + yn, and for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1 x1 + x2 + · · · + xk ≥ y1 + y2 + · · · + yk, Then we say that (xn) majorizes (yn), written (xn) ≻ (yn). Using the above, we have the following theorem. Theorem 5 (Muirhead’s Inequality). Ifa1, a2, . . . , an are positive reals, and (xn) ma- jorizes (yn) then we have the inequality. ∑ sym ax1 1 a x2 2 . . . a xn n ≥ ∑ sym a y1 1 a y2 2 . . . a yn n . Example 6. Since (5, 0, 0) ≻ (3, 1, 1) ≻ (2, 2, 1), a 5 + a 5 + b 5 + b 5 + c 5 + c 5 ≥ a 3bc + a3bc + b 3ca + b 3ca + c 3ab + c 3ab ≥ a 2b 2c + a 2b 2c + b 2c 2a + b 2c 2a + c 2a2b + c 2a2b. From this we derive a5 + b5 + c5 ≥ a3bc + b3ca + c3ab ≥ abc(ab + bc + ca). Notice that Muirhead is symmetric, not cyclic. For example, even though (3, 0, 0) ≻ (2, 1, 0), Muirhead’s inequality only gives that 2(a 3 + b 3 + c 3) ≥ a2b + a2c + b 2c + b 2a + c 2a + c 2b and in particular this does not imply that a3 + b3 + c3 ≥ a2b + b2c + c2a. These situations must still be resolved by AM-GM. 2 Evan Chen 2 Inequalities in Arbitrary Functions 1.2 Non-homogeneous inequalities Consider the following example. Example 7. Prove that if abc = 1 then a2 + b2 + c2 ≥ a + b + c. Proof. AM-GM alone is hopeless here, because whenever we apply AM-GM, the left and right hand sides of the inequality all have the same degree. So we want to use the condition abc = 1 to force the problem to have the same degree. The trick is to notice that the given inequality can be rewritten as a2 + b 2 + c 2 ≥ a 1/3b 1/3c 1/3 (a + b + c) . Now the inequality is homogeneous. Observe that if we multiply a, b, c by any real number k > 0, all that happens is that both sides of the inequality are multiplied by k2, which doesn’t change anything. That means the condition abc = 1 can be ignored now. Since (2, 0, 0) ≻ ( 4 3 , 1 3 , 1 3 ), applying Muirhead’s Inequality solves the problem. The importance of this problem is that it shows us how to eliminate a given condition by homogenizing the inequality; this is very important. (In fact, we will soon see that we can use this in reverse – we can impose an arbitrary condition on a homogeneous inequality.) 1.3 Practice Problems 1. a7 + b7 + c7 ≥ a4b3 + b4c3 + c4a3. 2. If a + b + c = 1, then 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≤ 3 + 2 · (a3+b3+c3) abc . 3. a3 bc + b3 ca + c3 ab ≥ a + b + c. 4. If 1 a + 1 b + 1 c = 1, then (a + 1)(b + 1)(c + 1) ≥ 64. 5. (USA 2011) If a2 + b2 + c2 + (a + b + c)2 ≤ 4, then ab + 1 (a + b)2 + bc + 1 (b + c)2 + ca + 1 (c + a)2 ≥ 3. 6. If abcd = 1, then a4b + b4c + c4d + d4a ≥ a + b + c + d. 2 Inequalities in Arbitrary Functions Let f : (u, v) → R be a function and let a1, a2, . . . , an ∈ (u, v). Suppose that we ﬁx a1+a2+···+an n = a (if the inequality is homogeneous, we will often insert such a condition) and we want to prove that f (a1) + f (a2) + · · · + f (an) is at least (or at most) nf (a). In this section we will provide three methods for doing so. We say that function f is convex if f ′′(x) ≥ 0 for all x; we say it is concave if f ′′(x) ≤ 0 for all x. Note that f is convex if and only if −f is concave. 3 Evan Chen 2 Inequalities in Arbitrary Functions 2.1 Jensen / Karamata Theorem 8 (Jensen’s Inequality). If f is convex, then f (a1) + · · · + f (an) n ≥ f ( a1 + · · · + an n ) . The reverse inequality holds when f is concave. Theorem 9 (Karamata’s Inequality). If f is convex, and (xn) majorizes (yn) then f (x1) + · · · + f (xn) ≥ f (y1) + · · · + f (yn). The reverse inequality holds when f is concave. Example 10 (Shortlist 2009). Given a + b + c = 1 a + 1 b + 1 c , prove that 1 (2a + b + c)2 + 1 (a + 2b + c)2 + 1 (a + b + 2c)2 ≤ 3 16 . Proof. First, we want to eliminate the condition. The original problem is equivalent to 1 (2a + b + c)2 + 1 (a + 2b + c)2 + 1 (a + b + 2c)2 ≤ 3 16 · 1 a + 1 b + 1 c a + b + c . Now the inequality is homogeneous, so we can assume that a + b + c = 3. Now our original problem can be rewritten as ∑ cyc 1 16a − 1 (a + 3)2 ≥ 0. Set f (x) = 1 16x − 1 (x+3)2 . We can check that f over (0, 3) is convex so Jensen completes the problem. Example 11. Prove that 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≥ 2 ( 1 a + b + 1 b + c + 1 c + a ) ≥ 9 a + b + c . Proof. The problem is equivalent to 1 a + 1 b + 1 c ≥ 1 a+b 2 + 1 b+c 2 + 1 c+a 2 ≥ 1 a+b+c 3 + 1 a+b+c 3 + 1 a+b+c 3 . Assume WLOG that a ≥ b ≥ c. Let f (x) = 1/x. Since (a, b, c) ≻ ( a + b 2 , a + c 2 , b + c 2 ) ≻ ( a + b + c 3 , a + b + c 3 , a + b + c 3 ) the conclusion follows by Karamata. Example 12 (APMO 1996). If a, b, c are the three sides of a triangle, prove that √a + b − c + √b + c − a + √c + a − b ≤ √a + √b + √c. Proof. Again assume WLOG that a ≥ b ≥ c and notice that (a, b, c) ≻ (b + c − a, c + a − b, a + b − c). Apply Karamata on f (x) = √x. 4 Evan Chen 2 Inequalities in Arbitrary Functions 2.2 Tangent Line Trick Again ﬁx a = a1+···+an n . If f is not convex, we can sometimes still prove the inequality f (x) ≥ f (a) + f ′(a) (x − a) . If this inequality manages to hold for all x, then simply summing the inequality will give us the desired conclusion. This method is called the tangent line trick. Example 13 (David Stoner). If a + b + c = 3, prove that 18 ∑ cyc 1 (3 − c)(4 − c) + 2(ab + bc + ca) ≥ 15. Proof. We can rewrite the given inequality as ∑ cyc ( 18 (3 − c)(4 − c) − c 2) ≥ 6. Using the tangent line trick lets us obtain the magical inequality 18 (3 − c)(4 − c) − c 2 ≥ c + 3 2 ⇔ c(c − 1) 2(2c − 9) ≤ 0 and the conclusion follows by summing. Example 14 (Japan). Prove ∑cyc (b+c−a)2 a2+(b+c)2 ≥ 3 5 . Proof. Since the inequality is homogeneous, we may assume WLOG that a + b + c = 3. So the inequality we wish to prove is ∑ cyc (3 − 2a)2 a2 + (3 − a)2 ≥ 3 5 . With some computation, the tangent line trick gives away the magical inequality: (3 − 2a)2 (3 − a)2 + a2 ≥ 1 5 − 18 25 (a − 1) ⇔ 18 25 (a − 1) 2 2a + 1 2a2 − 6a + 9 ≥ 0. 2.3 n − 1 EV The last such technique is n−1 EV. This is a brute force method involving much calculus, but it is nonetheless a useful weapon. Theorem 15 (n−1 EV). Let a1, a2, . . . , an be real numbers, and suppose a1+a2+· · ·+an is ﬁxed. Let f : R → R be a function with exactly one inﬂection point. If f (a1) + f (a2) + · · · + f (an) achieves a maximal or minimal value, then n − 1 of the ai are equal to each other. Proof. See page 15 of Olympiad Inequalities, by Thomas Mildorf. The main idea is to use Karamata to “push” the ai together. Example 16 (IMO 2001 / APMOC 2014). Let a, b, c be positive reals. Prove 1 ≤∑ cyc a√a2+8bc < 2. 5 Evan Chen 2 Inequalities in Arbitrary Functions Proof. Set ex = bc a2 , ey = ca b2 , ez = ab c2 . We have the condition x + y + z = 0 and want to prove 1 ≤ f (x) + f (y) + f (z) < 2 where f (x) = 1√1+8ex . You can compute f ′′(x) = 4ex (4ex − 1) (8ex + 1) 5 2 so by n − 1 EV, we only need to consider the case x = y. Let t = ex; that means we want to show that 1 ≤ 2 √1 + 8t + 1 √1 + 8/t < 2. Since this a function of one variable, we can just use standard Calculus BC methods. Example 17 (Vietnam 1998). Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be positive reals satisfying ∑n i=1 1 1998+xi = 1 1998 . Prove n√x1x2 . . . xn n − 1 ≥ 1998. Proof. Let yi = 1998 1998+xi . Since y1 + y2 + · · · + yn = 1, the problem becomes n∏ i=1 ( 1 yi − 1) ≥ (n − 1) n . Set f (x) = ln ( 1 x − 1 ), so the inequality becomes f (y1) + · · · + f (yn) ≥ nf ( 1 n ). We can prove that f ′′(y) = 1 − 2y (y2 − y)2 . So f has one inﬂection point, we can assume WLOG that y1 = y2 = . . . yn−1. Let this common value be t; we only need to prove (n − 1) ln ( 1 t − 1) + ln ( 1 1 − (n − 1)t − 1) ≥ n ln(n − 1). Again, since this is a one-variable inequality, calculus methods suﬃce. 2.4 Practice Problems 1. Use Jensen to prove AM-GM. 2. If a2 + b2 + c2 = 1 then 1 a2+2 + 1 b2+2 + 1 c2+2 ≤ 1 6ab+c2 + 1 6bc+a2 + 1 6ca+b2 . 3. If a + b + c = 3 then ∑ cyc a 2a2 + a + 1 ≤ 3 4 . 4. (MOP 2012) If a + b + c + d = 4, then 1 a2 + 1 b2 + 1 c2 + 1 d2 ≥ a2 + b2 + c2 + d2. 6 Evan Chen 3 Eliminating Radicals and Fractions 3 Eliminating Radicals and Fractions 3.1 Weighted Power Mean AM-GM has the following natural generalization. Theorem 18 (Weighted Power Mean). Let a1, a2, . . . , an and w1, w2, . . . , wn be positive reals with w1 + w2 + · · · + wn = 1. For any real number r, we deﬁne P(r) =  | | (w1ar 1 + w2ar 2 + · · · + wnar n) 1/r r ̸= 0 a w1 1 aw2 2 . . . awn n r = 0. If r > s, then P(r) ≥ P(s) equality occurs if and only if a1 = a2 = · · · = an. In particular, if w1 = w2 = · · · = wn = 1 n , the above P(r) is just P(r) =  || || ( ar 1 + ar 2 + · · · + ar n n )1/r r ̸= 0 n√a1a2 . . . an r = 0. By setting r = 2, 1, 0, −1 we derive √ a2 1 + · · · + a2 n n ≥ a1 + · · · + an n ≥ n√a1a2 . . . an ≥ n 1 a1 + · · · + 1 an which is QM-AM-GM-HM. Moreover, AM-GM lets us “add” roots, like √ a + √b + √c ≤ 3 √ a + b + c 3 . Example 19 (Taiwan TST Quiz). Prove 3(a + b + c) ≥ 8 3√abc + 3 √ a3+b3+c3 3 . Proof. By Power Mean with r = 1, s = 1 3 , w1 = 1 9 , w2 = 8 9 , we ﬁnd that ( 1 9 3 √ a3 + b3 + c3 3 + 8 9 3√abc )3 ≤ 1 9 ( a3 + b3 + c3 3 ) + 8 9 (abc) . so we want to prove a3 + b3 + c3 + 24abc ≤ (a + b + c)3, which is clear. 3.2 Cauchy and H¨older Theorem 20 (H¨older’s Inequality). Let λa, λb, . . . , λz be positive reals with λa + λb + · · · + λz = 1. Let a1, a2, . . . , an, b1, b2, . . . , bn, . . . , z1, z2, . . . , zn be positive reals. Then (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) λa (b1 + b2 + · · · + bn) λb . . . (z1 + z2 + · · · + zn) λz ≥ n∑ i=1 a λa i b λb i . . . zλz i . Equality holds if a1 : a2 : · · · : an ≡ b1 : b2 : · · · : bn ≡ · · · ≡ z1 : z2 : · · · : zn. Proof. WLOG a1 + · · · + an = b1 + · · · + bn = · · · = 1 (note that the degree of the ai on either side is λa). In that case, the LHS of the inequality is 1, and we just note n∑ i=1 aλa i b λb i . . . zλz i ≤ n∑ i=1 (λaai + λbbi + . . . ) = 1. 7 Evan Chen 3 Eliminating Radicals and Fractions If we set λa = λb = 1 2 , we derive what is called the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) (b1 + b2 + · · · + bn) ≥ (√ a1b1 + √ a2b2 + · · · + √ anbn)2 . Cauchy can be rewritten as x2 1 y1 + x2 2 y2 + · · · + x2 n yn ≥ (x1 + x2 + · · · + xn)2 y1 + · · · + yn . This form it is often called Titu’s Lemma in the United States. Cauchy and H¨older have at least two uses: 1. eliminating radicals, 2. eliminating fractions. Let us look at some examples. Example 21 (IMO 2001). Prove ∑ cyc a √a2 + 8bc ≥ 1. Proof. By Holder (∑ cyc a(a2 + 8bc) ) 1 3 ( ∑ cyc a √a2 + 8bc ) 2 3 ≥ (a + b + c) So it suﬃces to prove (a + b + c)3 ≥ ∑ cyc a(a2 + 8bc) = a3 + b3 + c3 + 24abc. Does this look familiar? In this problem, we used H¨older to clear the square roots in the denominator. Example 22 (Balkan). Prove 1 a(b+c) + 1 b(c+a) + 1 c(a+b) ≥ 27 2(a+b+c)2 . Proof. Again by Holder, (∑ cyc a ) 1 3 ( ∑ cyc b + c ) 1 3 (∑ cyc 1 a(b + c) ) 1 3 ≥ 1 + 1 + 1 = 3. Example 23 (JMO 2012). Prove ∑ cyc a3+5b3 3a+b ≥ 2 3 (a2 + b2 + c2). Proof. We use Cauchy (Titu) to obtain ∑ cyc a3 3a + b = ∑ cyc (a2)2 3a2 + ab ≥ (a2 + b2 + c2)2 ∑ cyc 3a2 + ab . We can easily prove this is at least 1 9 (a2+b2+c2) (recall a2+b2+c2 is the “biggest” sum, so we knew in advance this method would work)). Similarly ∑ cyc 5b3 3a+b ≥ 5 9 (a2+b2+c2). Example 24 (USA TST 2010). If abc = 1, prove 1 a5(b+2c)2 + 1 b5(c+2a)2 + 1 c5(a+2b)2 ≥ 1 3 . Proof. We can use H¨older to eliminate the square roots in the denominator: (∑ cyc ab + 2ac )2 ( ∑ cyc 1 a5(b + 2c)2 ) ≥ (∑ cyc 1 a )3 ≥ 3(ab + bc + ca)2. 8 Evan Chen 4 Problems 3.3 Practice Problems 1.
