Prove that there do not exist natural numbers x and y, with x > 1, such that x7 − 1 x − 1 = y5 + 1 . Solution. Simple factorisation gives y5 = x(x3 + 1)(x2 + x + 1). The three factors on the right are mutually coprime and hence they all have to be ﬁfth powers. In particular, x = r5 for some integer r. This implies x3 + 1 = r15 + 1, which is not a ﬁfth power unless r = −1 or r = 0. This implies there are no solutions to the given equation. 2. In a triangle ABC, AD is the altitude from A, and H is the orthocentre. Let K be the centre of the circle passing through D and tangent to BH at H. Prove that the line DK bisects AC. Solution. Note that ∠KHB = 90◦. Therefore ∠KDA = ∠KHD = 90◦ − ∠BHD = ∠HBD = ∠HAC. On the other hand, if M is the midpoint of AC then it is the circumcenter of triangle ADC and therefore ∠M DA = ∠M AD. This proves that D, K, M are collinear and hence DK bisects AC. 3. Consider the expression 2013 2 + 20142 + 20152 + · · · + n2 . Prove that there exists a natural number n > 2013 for which one can change a suitable number of plus signs to minus signs in the above expression to make the resulting expression equal 9999. Solution. For any integer k we have −k2 + (k + 1)2 + (k + 2)2 − (k + 3)2 = −4 . Note that 9999 − (20132 + 20142 + 20152 + 20162 + 20172) = −4m for some positive integer m. Therefore, it follows that 9999 =(2013 2 + 20142 + 20152 + 20162 + 20172) + m∑ r=1 (−(4r + 2014)2 + (4r + 2015)2 + (4r + 2016)2 − (4r + 2017)2) . 4. Let ABC be a triangle with ∠A = 90◦ and AB = AC. Let D and E be points on the segment BC such that BD : DE : EC = 1 : 2 : √3. Prove that ∠DAE = 45◦. Solution. Rotating the conﬁguraiton about A by 90◦, the point B goes to the point C. Let P denote the image of the point D under this rotation. Then CP = BD and ∠ACP = ∠ABC = 45◦, so ECP is a right-angled triangle with CE : CP = √3 : 1. Hence P E = ED. It follows that ADEP is a kite with AP = AD and P E = ED. Therefore AE is the angular bisector of ∠P AD. This implies that ∠DAE = ∠P AD/2 = 45◦. 1 Paper 2 Regional Mathematical Olympiad 2013 December 1, 2013 5. Let n ≥ 3 be a natural number and let P be a polygon with n sides. Let a1, a2, . . . , an be the lengths of the sides of P and let p be its perimeter. Prove that a1 p − a1 + a2 p − a2 + · · · + an p − an < 2 . Solution. If r and s are positive real numbers such that r < s then r/s < (r + x)/(s + x) for any positive real x. Note that, by triangle inequality, ai < p − ai, so ai p − ai < 2ai p , for all i = 1, , 2 . . . , n. Summing this inequality over i we get the desired inequality. 6. For a natural number n, let T (n) denote the number of ways we can place n objects of weights 1, 2, . . . , n on a balance such that the sum of the weights in each pan is the same. Prove that T (100) > T (99). Solution. Let S(n) denote the collection of subsets A of X(n) = {1, 2, . . . , n} such that the sum of the elements of A equals n(n + 1)/4. Then the given inequality is equivalent to |S(100)| > |S(99)|. We shall give a map f : S(99) → S(100) which is one-to-one but not onto. Note that this will prove the required inequality. Suppose that A is an element of S(99). If 50 ∈ A then deﬁne f (A) = (A \\ {50}) ∪ {100}. Otherwise, deﬁne f (A) = A ∪ {50}. If A and B are elements of S(99) such that f (A) = f (B) then either 50 belongs to both these sets or neither of these sets. In either of the cases we have A = B. Therefore f is a one-to-one function. Note that every element in the range of f contains exactly one of 50 and 100. Let Bi = {i, 101 − i}. Then B1 ∪ B2 ∪ · · · B24 ∪ B50 is an element of S(100). Clearly, this is not in the range of f . Thus f is not an onto function. ——— ⋆⋆ ——— 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
