Find all possible values of the quotient r + ρ a + b where r and ρ are respectively the radii of the circumcircle and incircle of the right triangle with legs a and b. Solution: The distances between the vertices and points of tangency of the incircle (denoted according to the ﬁgure below) of a triangle ABC are |AU | = |AV | = b + c − a 2 , |BV | = |BT | = a + c − b 2 , |CT | = |CU | = a + b − c 2 . The points C, T, U and S (the centre of the incircle) form a square. The side of the square is ρ = |SU | = |CU | = a+b−c 2 . Moreover r = c 2 and so r + ρ = c 2 + a + b − c 2 = a + b 2 . Hence there is only one possible value for r+ρ a+b which is 1 2. 1 2. Let ABC be an isosceles triangle with |AB| = |AC| and P , Q are interior points of AB and AC respectively. Prove that the circumcircle of △AP Q passes through the circum- centre of △ABC if and only if |AP | = |CQ| Solution: First assume that the circumcircle of △AP Q passes through the circumcentre of the △ABC. Let O be the circumcentre of △ABC and join O with P and Q. Because △ABC is isosceles, ∠P AQ = ∠OAQ. As |OA| = |OC|, we have ∠OP A = ∠OQC. This shows that the triangles AP O and CQO have the same angles. As |OA| = |OC| this implies that |AP | = |CQ|. Assume now that |AP | = |CQ| and let O be the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of P Q and AC (see ﬁgure below). First note that the four points A, P, O, Q are concyclic. This is so, because |OP | = |OQ|, |OA| = |OC| and |AP | = |CQ| implies that the two triangles AP O and CQO are congruent, hence ∠AP O = ∠CQO, which implies that A, P, O, Q are on a circle. On the other hand, we have ∠P AO = ∠QCO from the congruence seen above and also ∠QCO = ∠QAO from the deﬁnition of O. Therefore, AO is the angle bisector and since |AB| = |AC|, the line AO bisects BC at a right angle. This implies that O is the circumcentre of △ABC. 2 3. Let ABCD be a rhombus and let a tangent of its incircle cut the interior of the sides BC and CD, and denote R, S the intersections of the tangent with the lines AB, AD respectively. Prove that the value of |BR| · |DS| is independent of the choice of the tangent. Solution: Let U, V, W, T be the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides AB, BC, DA, DA, and with the tangent respectively. Further let X be the intersection point of the tangent and the side BC, and let a = |AB| = |AD|, b = |BU | = |BV | = |DW be ﬁxed quantities, while r = |BR| and s−|DS| are the variables dependent on the choice of the tangent. We will show that r · s = a · b. The point R is the centre of similitude of the triangles ARS and BRX. Moreover the incircle is the incircle of △ARS and the excircle of △BRX tangent to BX. According to the well-known fact, the centre of BX is the centre of symmetry of the points of tangency of the incircle and excircle with BX. This means that the ratio |SW | : |AR| in △ARS corresponds to the ratio |BV | : |BR| in △BRX, that is b + s a + r = b r , which is equivalent to r · s = a · b. 4. In an acute-angled triangle ABC, M is the midpoint of side BC, and D, E and F the feet of the altitudes from A, B and C, respectively. Let H be the orthocentre of triangle ABC, S the midpoint of AH, and G the intersection of F E and HA. If N is the intersection of the line segment AM and the circumcircle of triangle BCH, prove that ∠HM A = ∠GN S. Solution: First solution. Let the line AN meet the circle BHS again at the point A′. The ABA′C is a parallelogram and ∠HCA′ = ∠HCB + ∠BCA′ = ∠HCB + ∠ABC = 90 ◦, so the points A, B, N all lie on the circle with diameter HA′ and therefore ∠AN H = 90 ◦. 3 Since S is the circumcentre of △AEF , it follows that ∠SF G = 90 ◦ − ∠EAF = ∠ACF = ∠ADF ; hence the triangles SF G and SDF are similar and SG · SD = SF 2 = SN 2. This in turn shows that △SN G △SDN and ﬁnally ∠GN S = ∠GDN = ∠HM N since the quadrilateral HDM N is cyclic. Second solution. This second solution uses slightly heavier machinery but provides a somewhat more elegant proof. Quadrilaterals BDHF and DCEH are cyclic and AF · AB = AH · AD = Æ · AC. We apply the inversion I with centre A and power AF · AB. Clearly I(F ) = B, I(H) = D, I(E) = C, so I maps the line BC to the circumcircle of △F HE, i.e. the circle with diameter AH; also, I maps the circumcircle of BCH to the circumcircle ω of F DE which is the nine-point circle of △ABC. Since M ∈ ω ∩ AM and I preserves line AM , it follows that I(M ) = N . Let I(G) = G ∗ and I(S) = S∗. Since I(EF ) is the circumcircle of △ABC, S ∈ ω and I(AH) = AH, points G ∗ and S∗ are the second intersection points of AH with the circumcircles of △ABC and △HBC respectively. Thus ∠GN S = ∠G ∗M S∗ = ∠HM A, for G ∗, S∗ are the reﬂections of H, A in BC. 5. Points C, D, E and F lie on a circle with centre O. The two chords CD and EF intersect at a point N . The tangents at C and D intersect at A, and the tangents at E and F intersect at B. Prove that ON ⊥ AB. Solution: Let P be the intersection point of CD and AO and let Q be the intersection point of EF and BO. Then the right-angled triangles CP O and ACO are similar, and 4 hence OA · OP = OC 2. Similarly we obtain OB · OQ = OF 2 and since OC = OF , we have OA · OP = OB · OQ. It follows therefore that the triangles OAB and OQP are similar, so ∠OQP = ∠OAB. On the other hand, since ∠OP N = ∠OQN = 90 ◦, we infer that the quadrilateral OP N Q is cyclic. Hence we obtain ∠ON P = ∠OQP = ∠OAB. Let X be the point of intersection of the lines ON and AB. Then ∠OAB = ∠ON P = 180◦ − ∠P N X, which implies that the quadrilateral AP N X is cyclic. Therefore, since ∠AP N = 90◦, we immediately get ∠AXN = 90 ◦. 6. Can the four incentres of the four faces of a tetrahedron be coplanar? Solution: They cannot. Let IA, IB, IC, ID be the incentres of the triangles BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively. Assume they are coplanar. Then in their common plane they form either a convex quadrilateral, or a triangle inside of which the remaining point lies. Case 1. Without loss of generality assume that IA, IB, IC, ID is a convex quadrilat- eral. Then the line segments IAIC and IBID intersect. Let M, N, K, L be the midpoints AB, AD, CD, BC respectively. We observe that M, N, K, L are coplanar, since M N and KL are both parallel to BD, and this plane separates the tetrahedron with A, C on one side and B, D on the other. 5 Consider triangle ABC and let ℓ be the line through B parallel to AC. Then the incircle of triangle ABC lies between ℓ and AC and is tangent to AC but not to ℓ. This implies that the centre of the incircle of triangle ABC, ID, and B lie on diﬀerent sides of the line M L, which is exactly half way between AC and ℓ. By a similar process we see that IB and ID lie on the same side of the plane M N KL (on the opposite side of points B, D) while IA and IC lie on the other side. Hence the line segments IAIC and IBID cannot intersect and we have reached a contradiction. Case 2. It is suﬃcient to show that IA cannot lie inside the triangle IBICID. This follows from the fact that the points IB, IC, ID lie strictly to one side of the plane BCD while IA lies inside this plane. 7. Let O be the circumcentre of an acute-angled triangle ABC. A line through O intersects the sides CA and CB at points D and E respectively, and meets the circumcircle of triangle ABO again at point P ̸= O inside the triangle. A point Q on side AB is such that AQ QB = DP P E . Prove that ∠AP Q = 2∠CAP . Solution: Denote ∠P AD = ϕ, ∠QP A = ψ, ∠BCA = γ. The ∠AP B = 2γ and ∠DAP + ∠EBP = ∠AP B − ∠ACB = γ, so ∠P BE = γ − ϕ and ∠BP Q = 2γ − ψ. Since ∠AP D = ∠BP E = 90 ◦ − γ, we also have ∠ADP = 90 ◦ + γ − ϕ and ∠BEP = 90 ◦ + ϕ. 6 The sine rule in triangles AP D and P BE gives us DP QB = DP P A · P A P B · P B P E = sin ϕcosϕ sin(γ − ϕ) cos(γ − ϕ) · P A P B = sin 2ϕ sin(2γ − 2ϕ) · P A P B . On the other hand, AQ QB = AQ AP · AP BP · BP QB = sin ψ sin(2γ − ψ) · AP P B . Now AQ QB = DP P E implies f (2ϕ) = f (ψ), where f (x) = sin x sin(2γ−x) . However f is strictly increasing for all x because f ′(x) = sin(2γ) (sin(2γ−x))2 > 0, so it follows that ψ = 2ϕ. March 9, 2011 www.mathsolympiad.org.nz 7","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
