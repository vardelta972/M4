(USAMO 1976) The polynomials A(x), B(x), C(x), D(x) satisfy the equation A(x5) + xB(x 5) + x2C(x5) = (1 + x + x2 + x3 + x4)D(x). Show that A(1) = 0. 2. A sequence a1, a2, . . . , an is called k-balanced if a1 + ak+1 + · · · = a2 + · · · + ak+2 + · · · = · · · = ak + a2k + · · · . Suppose the sequence a1, a2, . . . , a50 is k-balanced for k = 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17. Prove that all the values ai are zero. 3. Let P (x) be a monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that all its zeros lie on the unit circle. Show that all the zeros of P (x) are roots of unity, i.e., P (x)|(xn − 1)k for some n, k ∈ N. 2 Integer divisibility The main lesson, as illustrated by the ﬁrst set of problems here, is that if P (x) has integer coeﬃcients, then a − b | P (a) − P (b). 4. (a) (USAMO 1974) Let a, b, c be three distinct integers, and let P be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Show that in this case the conditions P (a) = b, P (b) = c, P (c) = a cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously. (b) Let P (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, and let n be an odd positive integer. Sup- pose that x1, x2, . . . , xn is a sequence of integers such that x2 = P (x1), x3 = P (x2), . . . , xn = P (xn−1), and x1 = P (xn). Prove that all the xi’s are equal.1 (c) (Putnam 2000) Let f (x) be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Deﬁne a sequence a0, a1, . . . of integers such that a0 = 0 and an+1 = f (an) for all n ≥ 0. Prove that if there exists a positive integer m for which am = 0 then either a1 = 0 or a2 = 0. (d) (IMO 2006) Let P (x) be a polynomial of degree n > 1 with integer coeﬃcients and let k be a positive integer. Consider the polynomial Q(x) = P (P (. . . (P (x) . . . )) | {z } k P ′s Prove that there are at most n integers t such that Q(t) = t. 5. Let a, b, c be nonzero integers such that both a b + b c + c a and a c + c b + b a are integers. Prove that |a| = |b| = |c|. 1This problem appeared in Reid Barton’s MOP handout in 2005. Compare with the IMO 2006 problem. 1 IMO Training 2008 Polynomials Yufei Zhao 6. (IMO Shortlist 2005) Let a, b, c, d, e and f be positive integers. Suppose that the sum S = a + b + c + d + e + f divides both abc + def and ab + bc + ca − de − ef − f d. Prove that S is composite. 3 Crossing the x-axis For any continuous function (e.g. polynomial) f , if f (a) and f (b) have diﬀerent signs for some a < b, then there must exist a t ∈ (a, b) such that f (t) = 0. 7. (China 1995) Alice and Bob play a game with a polynomial of degree at least 4: x2n + □x2n−1 + □x 2n−2 + · · · + □x + 1. They ﬁll in real numbers to empty boxes in turn. If the resulting polynomial has no real root, Alice wins; otherwise, Bob wins. If Alice goes ﬁrst, who has a winning strategy? 8. (USAMO 2002) Prove that any monic polynomial of degree n with real coeﬃcients is the average of two monic polynomials of degree n with n real roots. 4 Lagrange and Chebyshev Lagrange interpolation. If (x1, y1), . . . , (xn, yn) are points in the plane with distinct x-coordinates, then there exists a unique polynomial P (x) of degree at most n − 1 passing through these points, and it is given by the expression P (x) = n∑ i=1 yi ∏ j̸=i x − xj xi − xj . You may have seen many problems that can be solved directly using interpolation (e.g., here are the values of P (1), P (2), . . . , P (n), what’s the value of P (n + 1)). The following problems require more subtle uses of interpolation. Chebyshev polynomials. These are polynomials satisfying Tn(cos θ) = cos nθ. One can show using induction Tn is indeed a polynomial, and has integer coeﬃcients, with leading coeﬃcient 2n. Chebyshev polynomials (including its variants) are often useful because they are nicely bounded in [−1, 1], so that they often serve as equality cases. Speciﬁcally, we have |Tn(x)| ≤ 1, whenever x ∈ [−1, 1]. Outside of [−1, 1], the values of Tn(x) can be found through Tn ( 1 2 (x + 1 x )) = 1 2 (xn + 1 xn ) (why?). A common variant of Chebyshev polynomials is the class of polynomials satisfying Pn(2 cos θ) = 2 cos nθ. One can show that Pn(x) is a monic integer polynomial. It also satisﬁes Pn(x+x−1) = xn+x−n. 9. Show that if f (x) is a monic polynomial of degree n − 1, and a1, a2, . . . , an distinct real numbers, then n∑ i=1 f (ai) ∏j̸=i(aj − ai) = 1 2 IMO Training 2008 Polynomials Yufei Zhao 10. (IMO Shortlist 1997) Let f be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients and let p be a prime such that f (0) = 0, f (1) = 1, and f (k) ≡ 0 or 1 (mod p) for all positive integers k. Show that deg f ≥ p − 1. 11. Let P be a polynomial of degree n with real coeﬃcients such that |f (x)| ≤ 1 for all x ∈ [0, 1]. Show that |f (− 1 n )| ≤ 2n+1 − 1. 12. Let P (x) be a monic degree n polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Prove that there is some t ∈ [−1, 1] such that |P (t)| ≥ 1 2n . 13. (Walter Janous, Crux) Suppose that a0, a1, . . . , an are real numbers such that for all x ∈ [−1, 1], |a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn| ≤ 1. Show that for all x ∈ [−1, 1], |an + an−1x + · · · + a0xn| ≤ 2n−1 14. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn, n ≥ 2, be n distinct real numbers in the interval [−1, 1]. Prove that 1 t1 + 1 t2 + · · · + 1 tn ≥ 2n−2, where ti = ∏j̸=i |xj − xi|. 5 Irreducibility through mods In abstract algebra language, if A is a UFD (unique factorization domain), then so is A[x]. In particular, ﬁelds are automatically UFDs, so that K[x] is a UFD whenever K is a ﬁeld. Useful examples of UFDs include: Z[x], R[x], C[x], Z[x, y], Fp[x]. The last example is especially worth mentioning. Yes, unique factorization holds even when the coef- ﬁcients of the polynomial is considered in mod p (where p must be prime). This means that when we are considering factorizations of integers polynomials f (x) = g(x)h(x), it may be helpful to reduce the problem to ¯f (x) = ¯g(x)¯h(x), where the coeﬃcients are considered in mod p. 15. (a) (Eisenstein’s criterion) Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that p | ai for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − 1, p ∤ an and p2 ∤ a0. Then f (x) is irreducible. (b) Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that p | ai for 0 ≤ i ≤ n − k, p ∤ ak and p2 ∤ a0. Then f (x) has an irreducible factor of degree greater than k. 16. Let p be a prime number. Prove that xp−1 + xp−2 + · · · + 1 is irreducible. (This is the example that follows every exposition of Eisenstein’s criterion.) 17. Let n be a positive integer. Prove that (x2 + x)2n + 1 is irreducible. 6 Irreducibility through roots Interestingly enough, when trying to prove that a certain integer polynomial is irreducible, it can be usual to examine its complex roots. 18. Let f (x) = anxn + an−1xn + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients, such that |a0| is prime and |a0| > |a1| + |a2| + · · · + |an|. Show that f (x) is irreducible. 3 IMO Training 2008 Polynomials Yufei Zhao 19. Let P (x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, where 0 < a0 ≤ a1 ≤ · · · ≤ an are real numbers. Prove that any complex zero of the polynomial satisﬁes |z| ≤ 1. 20. Let p be a prime. Prove that xp−1 + 2xp−2 + 3xp−3 + · · · + (p − 1)x + p is irreducible. 21. (Cohn’s criterion) Suppose that pnpn−1 · · · p1p0 is the base-10 representation of a prime number p, with 0 ≤ pi < 10 for each i and pn ̸= 0. Show that the polynomial f (x) = pnxn + pn−1xn + · · · + p1x + p0 is irreducible. 22. (Romania TST 2003) Let f (x) ∈ Z[x] be an irreducible monic polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose that |f (0)| is not a perfect square. Show that f (x2) is also irreducible. 7 Rouch´e’s theorem (optional) The following theorem from complex analysis can be useful in locating the zeros of a polynomial. Theorem (Rouch´e). Let f and g be analytic functions (e.g. polynomials) on and inside a simple closed curve C (e.g. a circle). Suppose that |f (z)| > |g(z)| for all points z on C. Then f and f − g have the same number of zeros (counting multiplicities) interior to C. 23. Let P (z) = anzn + an−1zn−1 + · · · + a1z + a0 be a polynomial with complex coeﬃcients, and such that |ak| > |a0| + |a1| + · · · + |ak−1| + |ak+1| + · · · + |an| for some 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Show that exactly k zeros of P lie strictly inside the unit circle, and the other n − k zeros of P lie strictly outside the unit circle. 24. (Perron’s criterion) Let P (x) = xn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0 be a polynomial with a0 ̸= 0 and |an−1| > 1 + |an−2| + · · · + |a1| + |a0|. Then P (x) is irreducible. 25. (IMO 1993) Let f (x) = xn + 5xn−1 + 3, where n > 1 is an integer. Prove that f (x) cannot be expressed as the product of two nonconstant polynomials with integer coeﬃcients. 26. (Romania ??) Let f ∈ C[x] be a monic polynomial. Prove that we can ﬁnd a z ∈ C such that |z| = 1 and |f (z)| ≥ 1. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
