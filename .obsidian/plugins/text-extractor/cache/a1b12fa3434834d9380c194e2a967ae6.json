To a considerable extent, the book reﬂects my experiences over the years of reading and commenting on references to the incompleteness theorem on the Internet. Quotations from named sources that as far as I know exist only in electronic form are not accompanied by any URLs, since such often become obsolete. However, using a search engine, the reader can easily locate any quoted text that is still extant somewhere on the Internet. In quite a few cases, comments that I have encountered on the Internet in informal contexts are quoted (sometimes in slightly edited form) without attribution. They are used to represent commonly occurring ideas and arguments. In thanking those who have helped me write this book, I must begin with the many people discussing G¨odel’s theorem on the Internet, whether named in the book or not, without whose contributions it is unlikely that the book would ever have appeared. I also thank Andrew Boucher, Damjan Bojadziev, Alex Blum, Jeﬀ Dalton, Solomon Feferman, John Harrison, Jef- frey Ketland, Panu Raatikainen, and Charles Silver for helpful comments. In writing the book, I have drawn on the resources of Lule˚a University of Technology in several essential ways, for which I am grateful. For any remaining instances of incompleteness or inconsistency in the book, I consider myself entirely blameless, since after all, G¨odel proved that any book on the incompleteness theorem must be incomplete or inconsis- tent. Well, maybe not. Although the book will perhaps in part be heavy going for readers not used to mathematical proofs and deﬁnitions, I hope ix x Preface it will give even casual readers a basis for judging for themselves the merits of such nonmathematical appeals to the incompleteness theorem and an appreciation of some of the philosophical and mathematical perspectives opened up by the theorem. Torkel Franz´en1 Introduction 1.1 The Incompleteness Theorem Few theorems of pure mathematics have attracted much attention out- side the ﬁeld of mathematics itself. In recent years, we have seen Fer- mat’s Last Theorem attract the interest of the general public through its much-publicized ﬁnal proof by Andrew Wiles, and many nonmathemati- cians could probably state and illustrate the theorem of Pythagoras, about the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle, which made it into a song performed by Danny Kaye (with music by Saul Chaplin and lyrics by John Mercer). But it is most likely safe to say that no mathematical theorem has aroused as much interest among nonmathematicians as G¨odel’s incom- pleteness theorem, which appeared in 1931. The popular impact that this theorem has had in the last few decades can be seen on the Internet, where there are thousands of discussion groups dedicated to every topic under the sun. In any such group, it seems, somebody will sooner or later invoke G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem. One ﬁnds such invocations not only in discussion groups dedicated to logic, mathematics, computing, or philoso- phy, where one might expect them, but also in groups devoted to politics, religion, atheism, poetry, evolution, hip-hop, dating, and what have you. Interest in the incompleteness theorem is not conﬁned to the Internet. In printed books and articles, we ﬁnd the incompleteness theorem invoked or discussed not only by philosophers, mathematicians, and logicians, but by theologians, physicists, literary critics, photographers, architects, and others, and it has also inspired poetry and music. 1 2 1. Introduction Many references to the incompleteness theorem outside the ﬁeld of formal logic are rather obviously nonsensical and appear to be based on gross misunderstandings or some process of free association. (For exam- ple, “G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem shows that it is not possible to prove that an objective reality exists,” or “By G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, all information is innately incomplete and self-referential,” or again “By equating existence and consciousness, we can apply G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem to evolution.”) Thus, Alan Sokal and Jean Bricmont, in their com- mentary on postmodernism [Sokal and Bricmont 98], remark that “G¨odel’s theorem is an inexhaustible source of intellectual abuses” and give exam- ples from the writings of Regis Debray, Michel Serres, and others. But among the nonmathematical arguments, ideas, and reﬂections inspired by G¨odel’s theorem there are also many that by no means represent post- modernist excesses, but rather occur naturally to many people with very diﬀerent backgrounds when they think about the theorem. Examples of such reﬂections are “there are truths that logic and mathematics are pow- erless to prove,” “nothing can be known for sure,” and “the human mind can do things that computers can not.” The aim of the present addition to the literature on G¨odel’s theorem is to set out the content, scope, and limits of the incompleteness theorem in such a way as to allow a reader with no knowledge of formal logic to form a sober and soundly based opinion of these various arguments and reﬂections invoking the theorem. To this end, a number of such commonly occurring arguments and reﬂections will be presented, in an attempt to counteract common misconceptions and clarify the philosophical issues. The formulations of these arguments and reﬂections, when not attributed to any speciﬁc author, are adaptations of statements found on the Internet, representative of many such reﬂections. G¨odel presented and proved his incompleteness theorem in an Austrian scientiﬁc journal in 1931. The title of his paper (written in German) was, translated, “On formally undecidable propositions of Principia Mathemat- ica and related systems I.” (A part II was planned, but never written.) Principia Mathematica (henceforth PM) was a monumental work in three volumes by Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead, published 1910– 1913, putting forward a logical foundation for mathematics in the form of a (far from transparent) system of axioms and rules of reasoning within which all of the mathematics known at the time could be formulated and proved. G¨odel proved two theorems in his paper, known as the ﬁrst incomplete- ness theorem and the second incompleteness theorem. (The designation 1.1. The Incompleteness Theorem 3 “G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem” is used to refer to the conjunction of these two theorems, or to either separately.) The ﬁrst incompleteness the- orem established that on the assumption that the system of PM satisﬁes a property that G¨odel named ω-consistency (“omega consistency”), it is in- complete, meaning that there is a statement in the language of the system that can be neither proved nor disproved in the system. Such a statement is said to be undecidable in the system. The second incompleteness theorem showed that if the system is consistent—meaning that there is no state- ment in the language of the system that can be both proved and disproved in the system—the consistency of the system cannot be established within the system. The property of ω-consistency, which G¨odel assumed in his proof, is a stronger property than consistency and has a technical ﬂavor, unlike the more readily understandable notion of consistency. However, the American logician J. Barkley Rosser showed in 1936 that G¨odel’s theorem could be strengthened so that only the assumption of plain consistency was needed to conclude that the system is incomplete. In the technical details, G¨odel did not in fact carry through his argu- ment for the system of PM, but rather for a system that he called P, related to that of PM. Nevertheless, it was clear that his result also applied to PM, and indeed to a wide range of axiomatic systems for mathematics, or parts of mathematics. Today the incompleteness theorem is often formulated as a theorem about any formal system within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be expressed and some basic rules of arithmetic can be proved. The theorem states that any such system, if consistent, is incomplete, and the consistency of the system cannot be proved within the system itself. The kind of reasoning put forward in G¨odel’s paper was at the time unfamiliar to logicians and mathematicians, and even some accomplished mathematicians (for example, the founder of axiomatic set theory, Ernst Zermelo) had diﬃculty grasping the proof. Today, as in the case of other intellectual advances, both the subject and our understanding of it have developed to the point where the proof is not at all considered diﬃcult. The methods used have become commonplace, and proofs have become streamlined and generalized. Still, of course, grasping the details requires some familiarity with the methods and concepts of formal logic. In this book, no knowledge of logic or mathematics (beyond an acquaintance with basic school mathematics) will be assumed, on the basis of the view that a sound informal understanding of the theorem is attainable without a 4 1. Introduction study of formal logic, and similarly for an understanding of the various applications and misapplications of the theorem. Of course, opinions about what constitutes a sound informal under- standing of the incompleteness theorem will vary, as illustrated by state- ments such as the following: G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem can be intuitively understood without a mathematical approach and proof: the incomplete- ness concept appears in clearly recognizable form in Zen Bud- dhism. The incompleteness theorem is a theorem about the consistency and completeness of formal systems. “Consistent,” “inconsistent,” “complete,” “incomplete,” and “system” are words used not only as technical terms in logic, but in many diﬀerent ways in ordinary language, so it is not surprising that G¨odel’s theorem has been associated with various ideas relating to incompleteness, systems, and consistency in some informal sense. As will be commented on at some length in Chapter 4, such associations usually have little or nothing to do with the content of the incompleteness theorem, and the kind of intuitive understanding of the theorem that one might derive from a study of Zen Buddhism is not at all what this book is about. 1.2 Gödel’s Life and Work G¨odel has been variously described as German, Austrian, Czech, and Amer- ican. All of these descriptions are correct in their own way. G¨odel’s lan- guage was German, as was his cultural background, but he was born into a well-to-do family in 1906 in the Moravian city of Br¨unn (Czech name Brno) in Central Europe, then a center for the textile industry. At the time of G¨odel’s birth, Moravia was part of the Austro-Hungarian empire. After World War I the Austro-Hungarian empire was dismantled, and G¨odel grew up as a member of the sizeable German-speaking population of Brno and a citizen of the newly created state of Czechoslovakia. In 1929, when he was working on his doctoral dissertation at the University of Vienna, he became an Austrian citizen. After Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938, he was also, at least in the eyes of the authorities of that country, a German national. Although not Jewish and apparently completely un- concerned with politics, G¨odel, as an academic and intellectual moving in Jewish and liberal circles, was viewed with some suspicion. He encountered 1.2. Gödel’s Life and Work 5 diﬃculties in seeking an appointment as a lecturer and was once attacked in the street by a gang of Nazi youths (who were chased oﬀ by his wife). Such things, and the risk of conscription into the German army, prompted G¨odel to seek to emigrate to the United States, which he managed to do after various complications in 1940, when he joined the Institute for Advanced Study (IAS) in Princeton. In 1948 he became an American citizen. Although G¨odel is famous mainly for his incompleteness theorem, he proved several other fundamental results in logic, chieﬂy while in Vienna between 1929 and 1940, during which time he also made visits to the IAS and to the University of Notre Dame in the United States. He proved, in his doctoral dissertation, the completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic, which will be explained in Chapter 7, and went on to prove the ﬁrst, and a little later the second, incompleteness theorem. He proved some highly signiﬁcant results in set theory which will not be considered in this book, except for some incidental remarks. These were all seminal works which led to a number of developments in mathematical logic and the founda- tions of mathematics. He also proved other signiﬁcant results during this very productive period. In the 1940s, as a member of the IAS where he re- mained until his retirement in 1976, he developed what is known as G¨odel’s Dialectica interpretation (after the journal in which this contribution ﬁrst appeared, as late as 1958), having to do with what is called constructive mathematics. He also did original work in Einstein’s general theory of relativity, demonstrating the existence of a solution of the equations of the theory that describes a universe in which it is theoretically possible to travel into one’s past. Otherwise, his energies were chieﬂy directed toward philosophy. After 1940 he published little, but in the later years of his life he received numerous academic honors. He died in 1978. Readers interested in further details about G¨odel’s life, such as his recurring health problems, mental and physical, his marriage, his life as an academic in Vienna, and his friendship with Einstein, should consult [Dawson 97] and the other sources listed in the references. Large claims are often made about the impact and importance of the incompleteness theorem: for example, that it “brought a revolution to mathematical thought,” that it “turned not only mathematics, but also the whole world of science on its head,” and, in a crescendo of woolly enthusiasm, that G¨odel’s work “has revolutionized not only mathematics, but philosophy, linguistics, computer science, and even cosmology.” Such claims are wildly exaggerated. Even in mathematics, where one might ex- pect the incompleteness theorem to have had its greatest impact, it brought 6 1. Introduction about no revolution whatsoever. The theorem is used all the time in math- ematical logic, a comparatively small subﬁeld of mathematics, but it plays no role in the work of mathematicians in general. To be sure, mathemati- cians are generally aware of the phenomenon of incompleteness and of the possibility of a particular problem being unsolvable within the standard ax- iomatic framework of mathematics, but a special case needs to be made in each instance where there is reason to believe that incompleteness should be a matter of mathematical concern. G¨odel’s “rotating universes,” his new solutions of the equations of general relativity, have had no great im- pact on cosmology, and the subject of computer science could hardly have been revolutionized by G¨odel’s theorem since it didn’t exist at the time the theorem was proved. The theoretical basis of computer science is associ- ated rather with the work of the British mathematician and logician Alan Turing, who introduced in 1936 an idealized theoretical model of a digital computer and used it to prove the “unsolvability of the halting problem.” This result is closely related to the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, and the basic connections between the two will be set out in later chapters. Like the special theory of relativity a quarter of a century earlier, the theorems proved by G¨odel in 1929 and 1930—the completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic and the incompleteness theorem—were in the air at the time. G¨odel himself felt that it would have been only a matter of months before somebody else had stumbled on the theorems ([Kreisel 80]). In the case of the completeness theorem, G¨odel believed (rightly or wrongly) that only philosophical prejudice against nonﬁnitary reasoning had prevented the Norwegian logician Thoralf Skolem from arriving at the theorem. In the case of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, priority was in fact claimed by the German mathematician Paul Finsler, but although his outlined argu- ment can be made precise and correct using G¨odel’s work, it did not in his presentation amount to a proof of anything. The Polish-American logician Emil Post, who did pioneering work in the theory of computability, came much closer to G¨odel’s insight, but without producing any conclusive for- mal result. In particular, the mathematical precision and thoroughness of G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem was probably necessary for the second incompleteness theorem to emerge as a corollary. Apart from its manifold applications in logic, the incompleteness theo- rem does raise a number of philosophical questions concerning the nature of logic and mathematics. These questions, and the implications of the incompleteness theorem for our thinking about mathematics, are quite in- teresting and signiﬁcant enough without any exaggerated claims for the 1.3. The Rest of the Book 7 revolutionary impact of the theorem. In particular, there are two philo- sophically highly signiﬁcant aspects of the incompleteness theorem that will be touched on in this book. First, it shows that even very abstract math- ematical principles, asserting the existence of various inﬁnite sets, have formal consequences in elementary number theory that cannot be proved by elementary means. Secondly, when applied to formal systems whose axioms we recognize as mathematically valid, the incompleteness theorem shows that we cannot formally specify the sum total of our mathematical knowledge. 1.3 The Rest of the Book The exposition adheres to the traditional plan of presenting general expla- nations before more speciﬁc discussions, and introducing and explaining concepts before they are used, but the reader is encouraged to dip into the book at any point of interest and to read other parts of the book or return to parts already visited when this appears proﬁtable as a result of further reﬂection. The index will show where unfamiliar terms are ﬁrst introduced and explained. The incompleteness theorem is a mathematical theorem about axiom- atizations of (parts of) mathematics, and the overview of the theorem in Chapter 2 accordingly begins with the subject of arithmetic. A reader who is chieﬂy interested in the supposed applications of the incompleteness the- orem outside mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics may prefer to turn directly to Chapter 4 and later chapters, while a reader with an interest in mathematics will ﬁnd in Chapters 2 and 3 an introduction to the mathematics of incompleteness, along with a discussion of some basic philosophical issues. Invocations of the incompleteness theorem in theology and in the philosophy of mind (“Lucas-Penrose arguments”) are covered in Chapters 4, 5, and 6, and a discussion of the philosophical claims of Gregory Chaitin is found in Chapter 8. An Appendix has been added for the beneﬁt of readers who are interested in a presentation of some of the formal mathematical aspects of incompleteness. In order to make the book a bit more browsable, there is a certain amount of repetition of material from Chapter 2 in later parts of the book. 2 The Incompleteness Theorem An Overview 2.1 Arithmetic The language of mathematics is full of terms and symbols that mean noth- ing to nonmathematicians, and fairly often indeed mean very little to any- one who is not an expert in a particular ﬁeld of mathematics. But the part of mathematical language known in logic as the language of elementary arithmetic can be understood on the basis of ordinary school mathematics. It deals with the natural numbers (nonnegative integers) 0, 1, 2,. . . and the familiar operations of addition and multiplication, and it allows us to formulate some of the most striking results in mathematics, and some of the most diﬃcult problems. A prime, or prime number, is a natural number greater than 1 that is evenly divisible only by 1 and itself. Thus, the ﬁrst few primes are 2 (the only even prime), 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,. . . . One of the ﬁrst substantial results of pure mathematics in the Western world was the discovery that the primes are inexhaustible, or inﬁnite in number. In other words, for any given prime, there is a larger one. This was proved by a simple and ingenious argument in Euclid’s Elements (ca. 300 B.C.). Some 2,000 years later, it was observed that if we look at the even numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8,..., it seems that beginning with 4 they can all be written as the sum of two primes: 4 = 2+2, 6 = 3+3, 8 = 5+3, 10 = 5+5, 12 = 7+5,. . . . In this case, however, no proof suggested itself, and the statement in elementary arithmetic known as 9 10 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview Goldbach’s conjecture, “Every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes,” has not yet been either proved or disproved. Another conjecture about primes that has not yet been settled is the twin prime conjecture, according to which there are inﬁnitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also a prime. Let us take a closer look at a particular class of arithmetical prob- lems. These problems are most conveniently described in terms of the integers, which besides the natural numbers also encompass the nega- tive numbers −1, −2, −3,. . . . A Diophantine equation (named after the third century Greek mathematician Diophantus) is an equation of the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0, where D(x1, . . ., xn) is a polynomial with integer coef- ﬁcients. What this means is that D(x1, . . ., xn) is an expression built up from the unknowns x1, . . ., xn using integers, multiplication, addition, and subtraction. A solution of the equation is an assignment of integer val- ues to x1, . . ., xn such that the expression has the value 0. Some examples will make this clearer. The following (where we write x 2 for x × x, y4 for y × y × y × y, 5y for 5 × y, and so on) are Diophantine equations: x + 8 = 5y x 2 = 2y2 x 2 + y2 = z2 x 4 + y4 = z4 y2 = 2x 4 − 1 x 18 − y13 = 1. The right-hand side of these equations is not 0, but we can easily rewrite the equations so as to get an equation in the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0. The ﬁrst equation becomes x + 8 − 5y = 0, the second equation x 2 − 2y2 = 0, and so on. The study of Diophantine equations—ﬁnding and describing their solu- tions, or determining that they have no solutions—has been a specialized ﬁeld of mathematics for centuries. Diophantine problems range from the very simple to the apparently hopelessly diﬃcult, and mathematicians have displayed extraordinary ingenuity in studying various classes of Diophan- tine equations. 2.1. Arithmetic 11 The ﬁrst of the equations presented as examples clearly has inﬁnitely many solutions: for any integer n we get a solution with y = n by set- ting x = 5n − 8. The second equation has no other solution than x = 0, y = 0. This was also proved in the Elements, where it is shown by an argument traditionally attributed to the school of Pythagoras that 2 has no rational square root. By the theorem of Pythagoras about the square of the hypotenuse, this is the same as saying that the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with the side of the square. (In other words, there is no unit of length such that the side is measured by n units and the diagonal by m units for some natural numbers n and m.) The third equation has inﬁnitely many solutions, which are called Pythagorean triplets (because of the connection with the theorem of Pythagoras). The particular solu- tion x = 3, y = 4, z = 5 was used in antiquity as a means of obtaining right angles in practical surveying. The fourth equation has no solution in nonzero integers, although proving this is far from trivial. Fermat’s Last Theorem (really Fermat’s claim or conjecture), which was ﬁnally proved in 1994 through the combined eﬀorts in advanced mathematics of several mathematicians, states that no equation of the form x n + yn = zn with n greater than 2 has any solution in positive integers. The ﬁfth equation has only two positive solutions: x = 1, y = 1, and x = 13, y = 239. This was proved (using some very complicated mathematical reasoning) by the Norwegian mathematician Wilhelm Ljunggren in 1942. The last equation has no solution where x and y are both nonzero. This is a consequence of Catalan’s conjecture (1844), which states that 8, 9 is the only pair of two consecutive natural numbers where each is a perfect power, that is, equal to n k for some n and k greater than 1. Catalan’s conjecture was ﬁnally proved in 2002 by Preda Mihailescu. Problems in arithmetic do not always involve primes or Diophantine equations. The Collatz conjecture (also known by other names, for example the 3n + 1 conjecture and Ulam’s problem) states that if we start with any positive natural number n and compute n/2if n is even, or 3n + 1 if n is odd, and continue applying the same rule to the new number, we will eventually reach 1. For example, beginning with 7, we get 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1. No proof of the Collatz conjecture has been found in spite of intense eﬀorts, and the problem is generally considered extremely diﬃcult. 12 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview A Logical Distinction The subject of arithmetic plays a large role in a discussion of the incom- pleteness theorem, but fortunately we don’t need to tackle any diﬃcult arithmetical problems. Instead, we will be concerned with some relatively simple logical aspects of such problems. Goldbach’s conjecture states that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. In an equivalent formulation, Goldbach’s conjecture states that every natural number has the property of being smaller than 3 or odd or the sum of two primes. The point of this reformulation is that there is an algorithm for deciding whether or not a given number has this property. An algorithm is a purely mechanical, computational procedure, one that when applied to a given number or ﬁnite sequence of numbers always terminates, yielding some information about the numbers. For example, in school we learn algorithms that given two numbers n and k yield as output their sum n + k and their product n × k. We also have algorithms for comparing two given numbers, and for dividing a natural number by a nonzero natural number, yielding a quotient and remainder. Combining these algorithms, we get an algorithm for deciding whether a given number has the property of being smaller than 3 or odd or the sum of two primes. For if n is the sum of two primes, these must both be smaller than n, so to check whether an even number n greater than 2 is the sum of two primes, we go through the numbers smaller than n, looking for two primes that add up to n. Whether a number n is a prime is again something that can be decided by a computation—just divide n by the numbers 2, 3,. . . ,n − 1, and check whether the remainder is 0 in any division. A property of numbers that can be checked by applying an algorithm is called a computable property. (This notion will be explored further in Chapter 3.) As we have seen, Goldbach’s conjecture can be formulated as a statement of the form “Every natural number has the property P ,” where P is a computable property. This is a logically very signiﬁcant feature of Goldbach’s conjecture, and in the following, any statement of this form will be called a Goldbach-like statement. (In logic, these are known by the more imposing designation “Π-0-1-statements.”) Actually, this description glosses over an important point: the property P must not only be computable, but must also have a suﬃciently simple form so that an algorithm for checking whether a number has the property P can be “read oﬀ” from the deﬁnition of P . It will be clear in the case of all examples of Goldbach-like statements considered in the book that this 2.1. Arithmetic 13 condition is satisﬁed. (A formal deﬁnition of the Goldbach-like statements in the language of arithmetic is given in the Appendix.) We extend the class of Goldbach-like statements to statements of the form “Every ﬁnite sequence k1, . . . , kn of natural numbers has the property P ,” where P again is a computable property, so that there is an algorithm which given any sequence of numbers k1, . . . , kn decides whether or not it has property P . If P is a computable property, then so is the property not-P . So every statement of the form “There is no natural number k with property P ,” where P is a computable property, can be equivalently formulated as a Goldbach-like statement: “Every natural number has the property not-P .” A counterexample to the statement “Every natural number has property P ” is a natural number which does not have property P . A consequence of a statement being Goldbach-like is that if it is false, it can be disproved very simply. To disprove it, we need only carry out a computation show- ing that some number n is in fact a counterexample and conclude that the statement is false. Of course, if the shortest such computation is ex- tremely lengthy, “can be disproved” here only means “can in principle be disproved.” In other words, we need to disregard all limitations of time, space, and energy. But at any rate, we can observe that if the statement is false, it is a logical consequence of the basic rules of arithmetic that it is false, in the sense that a lengthy computation using those rules, if possible to carry out, would show it to be false. In other words, there exists, in the mathematical sense, a formal proof that the statement is false, one that uses only the basic rules of arithmetic. Here we are regarding computations as a special kind of proof, in the sense of a mathematical argument showing some statement to be true. In logic, we study formal systems, axiomatic theories in which mathematical statements can be proved or disproved, and the incompleteness theorem is a theorem about those formal systems within which arithmetical computations can be carried out. More will be said about formal systems, beginning in Section 2.2. It was noted above that a statement of the form “Every natural number has property P ,” where P is a computable property, can always in principle be disproved if it is false by exhibiting a counterexample and carrying out a computation. A further signiﬁcant observation is that a counterexample, if it exists, can always be found by just systematically checking 0, 1, 2, 3,. . . until we get to the smallest number that does not have the property P . Thus, there is also a systematic procedure that will (in principle) eventually ﬁnd a disproof of a Goldbach-like statement if it is false. This is a special 14 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview case of the general fact that for any formal system S, if a statement A is provable in S, a systematic search will eventually ﬁnd such a proof of A in S. If A is not provable in S, a systematic search will in general just go on forever without yielding any result. So for any formal system S that incorporates a bit of arithmetic—the basic rules needed to carry out computations—a Goldbach-like statement is disprovable in S if false. On the other hand, we cannot make any similar observations about how a Goldbach-like statement can be proved if it is true. For every n, a computation can indeed verify that every number 0, 1, . . ., n has the property P , but this is not a veriﬁcation that every number has property P , no matter how large n is chosen. If a Goldbach- like statement is true, it may well be that it can be proved to be true, but we cannot say at the outset what mathematical methods such a proof might require. Every statement of the form “The Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution in nonnegative integers” is a Goldbach-like statement. Here the relevant property of a sequence of numbers k1, . . ., kn is that of not being a solution of the equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0, and checking this property only involves carrying out a series of multiplications, additions, and subtractions, to see whether the result is 0. In contrast, the twin prime conjecture is not a Goldbach-like statement. It can be expressed as “Every natural number has the property P ,” where a natural number n has the property P if there is a prime p larger than n such that p + 2 is also a prime. But in this case we cannot read oﬀ from the deﬁnition of the property any algorithm for checking whether a number has this property or not. The procedure of systematically looking for a pair of primes p and p + 2 greater than n will never terminate if there is no such prime, and so it can never give the answer that n does not have the property. Of course, if the twin prime conjecture is true, the procedure is in fact an algorithm, one that will always show n to have the property, but as long as we don’t know whether the conjecture is true or not, we don’t know whether the procedure is an algorithm. Similar remarks apply to the Collatz conjecture. It states that a particular sequence of computations will always (that is, for every starting number) lead to 1, but there is no obvious algorithm for deciding whether a particular starting number does lead to 1. In the case of these two conjectures, we therefore have no logical grounds for claiming that they must be disprovable if false. The property of an arithmetical statement of being Goldbach-like will play a role at several points in the discussion of incompleteness. 2.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 15 2.2 The First Incompleteness Theorem As noted in Section 2.1, although the problems of elementary arithmetic are often easily stated, there is no limit on the diﬃculty or complexity of the mathematics needed to solve those problems. Thus, the 129-page proof by Andrew Wiles of Fermat’s theorem was in fact a proof of what is known as the Taniyama-Shimura conjecture for elliptic curves in the semi-stable case, which had earlier been shown by K. A. Ribet to imply Fermat’s theorem. We don’t need to know what any of this means in order to appreciate the basic point that Fermat’s theorem, although easily stated in elementary mathematical language, was proved using a detour into very complicated and advanced mathematics. Since Fermat claimed to have a proof of his conjecture, one which un- fortunately didn’t ﬁt into the margin of the work by Diophantus that he was reading, many have sought (and sometimes mistakenly believed that they have found) an elementary proof of the theorem, in the sense of a proof that does not make use of any mathematics unknown to Fermat and his contemporaries. However, there is little doubt that Fermat was himself mistaken in thinking that he had a proof of the theorem. It is an open question to what extent the existing proof of Fermat’s last theorem can be simpliﬁed, and it remains to be seen if any essentially simpler proof can be extracted from that proof. (There is some reason to believe, on gen- eral grounds, that an elementary proof of the theorem exists in a purely theoretical sense, a proof that would not only fail to ﬁt into the margin of Fermat’s book, but would if printed out require thousands of pages.) In view of the 300 years of mathematical development needed for math- ematicians to ﬁnally solve the problem posed by Fermat’s claim, and the fact that Goldbach’s and other arithmetical conjectures have not yet been settled, one may wonder whether there is any guarantee that all arithmeti- cal problems posed by mathematicians can be solved, given suﬃcient time and eﬀort. A conviction that this is the case was expressed by the Ger- man mathematician David Hilbert in a famous address at the international congress of mathematicians in Paris in the year 1900, where he presented 23 major problems facing mathematicians in the new century: Take any deﬁnite unsolved problem, such as the question as to the irrationality of the Euler-Mascheroni constant C, or the existence of an inﬁnite number of prime numbers of the form n + 1. However unapproachable these problems may seem to 16 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview us, and however helpless we stand before them, we have, nev- ertheless, the ﬁrm conviction that their solution must follow by a ﬁnite number of purely logical processes. ... This conviction of the solvability of every mathematical problem is a powerful incentive to the worker. We hear within us the perpetual call: There is the problem. Seek its solution. You can ﬁnd it by pure reason, for in mathematics there is no ignorabimus. This is one expression of Hilbert’s optimistic “non ignorabimus.” Hilbert was alluding to an old saying, “ignoramus et ignorabimus” (we do not know and we shall never know), which the physiologist Emil du Bois-Reymond had aﬃrmed in 1872, speaking of our knowledge of human consciousness and the physical world. G¨odel’s ﬁrst incompleteness theorem by no means refutes this optimistic view of Hilbert’s. What it does is establish that Hilbert’s optimism cannot be justiﬁed by exhibiting any single formal system within which all mathe- matical problems are solvable, even if we restrict ourselves to arithmetical problems: First incompleteness theorem (G¨odel-Rosser). Any consistent for- mal system S within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out is incomplete with regard to statements of elementary arith- metic: there are such statements which can neither be proved, nor disproved in S. To understand what this means, we need to start by considering the notion of a formal system. This will be followed by some comments on the consistency requirement and then on the condition of encompassing “a certain amount of arithmetic.” Formal Systems A formal system is a system of axioms (expressed in some formally deﬁned language) and rules of reasoning (also called inference rules), used to derive the theorems of the system. A theorem is any statement in the language of the system obtainable by a series of applications of the rules of reasoning, starting from the axioms. A proof in the system is a ﬁnite sequence of such applications, leading to a theorem as its conclusion. 2.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 17 The idea of an axiomatic system of this kind is an old one in mathemat- ics and has in the past been familiar to many through a study of Euclidean geometry. Euclid, in the Elements, introduces a number of deﬁnitions, such as Deﬁnition 1, “A point is that which has no part.” He further intro- duces postulates, which are basic principles of geometry (the most famous of these being the parallel postulate), and common notions, which have the character of general rules of reasoning. An example of a common notion is “Things which equal the same thing also equal one another.” Using the deﬁnitions, postulates, and common notions, Euclid derives a large number of theorems (propositions). Euclid’s deﬁnitions, postulates, and common notions do not amount to a formal system. The language of the system is not formally speci- ﬁed, his proofs use geometrical assumptions not expressed in the postu- lates, and they use other logical principles than those expressed in the common notions. (Formal axiomatizations of geometry were given only in the twentieth century.) But Euclid’s geometry was the basic model for the axiomatic method for millennia, and the idea of organizing knowledge through axioms, deﬁnitions, and rules of reasoning leading to theorems has been vastly inﬂuential in philosophy, science, and other ﬁelds of thought. However, it is only in mathematics that the axiomatic method has been strikingly successful in the organization and analysis of knowledge. In modern logic, many speciﬁc formal axiomatic systems are studied, often of a kind called ﬁrst-order theories. Here the word “theory” is logical jargon and does not have any of the connotations often associated with the word in everyday or scientiﬁc contexts—a theory in the sense used in logic is just an axiomatic formal system. In this book, “theory” will often be used as a synonym of “formal system.” “First-order” refers to a particular collection of rules of reasoning used in proving theorems, namely the rules for which G¨odel proved his (confusingly named) completeness theorem, which will be commented on in Section 2.3. Two ﬁrst-order theories prominent in logic to which the incompleteness theorem applies are Peano Arithmetic, or PA, which is a formal theory of elementary arithmetic, and Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, ZFC. (The designation ZF is used for the same theory without the axiom of choice.) In this book, we will not study these theories (although the axioms of PA are described in Section 7.2), but some general obser- vations about them will be relevant to the argument of the book. At this point we need only observe that PA is a formal system within which all of the arithmetical reasoning that is usually described as elementary can be 18 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview carried out, while ZFC is an extremely powerful system that suﬃces for formally proving most of the theorems of present day mathematics. The incompleteness theorem applies to many other kinds of formal sys- tems than ﬁrst-order theories, but we will assume that the language of a formal system at least includes a negation operator, so that every sen- tence A in the language has a negation not-A. (A sentence is here a full sentence, expressing a statement which it makes sense to speak of as proved or disproved.) This allows us to deﬁne what it means for S to be consistent (there is no A such that both A and not-A are theorems) and for a sentence A to be undecidable in S (neither A nor not-A is atheorem of S). A system is complete (sometimes called “negation complete”) if no sentence in the language of S is undecidable in S, and otherwise incomplete. We need to introduce a bit of notation: if A is a sentence in the language of S, we denote by S + A the formal system obtained by adding A as a new axiom to the axioms of S (but not changing the rules of inference). If A is provable in S, S + A has the same theorems as S (with A unnecessarily taken as an axiom), while if A is not provable in S, S + A is a stronger theory, which in particular proves A. Here, we encounter a point of usage where logical terminology is some- what at odds with ordinary usage. It may seem odd to say that A, which is an axiom of S + A, is provable in S + A. In ordinary informal contexts, it is often taken for granted that axioms are not provable, but are basic assumptions that cannot be proved. In logic, however, “provable” is rela- tive to some theory, and every axiom of a theory S is also provable in S. The proof of an axiom A is a trivial one-liner, in which it is pointed out that A is an axiom. In mathematics, we do not usually say that axioms are provable, but we do say that statements follow “immediately” or “trivially” from the axioms. For example, from the axiom “for every n, n + 0 = n”it follows immediately that 0 + 0 = 0. In logic we make no such ﬁne distinc- tion between axioms and immediate consequences of axioms—they are all provable. We can now state a couple of basic connections between negation, prov- ability, consistency, and undecidability. The ﬁrst connection consists in the fact that an inconsistent theory has no undecidable statements. This is be- cause in an inconsistent theory, every statement in the language of the theory is provable, by a rule of reasoning known in logic by the traditional 2.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 19 name of ex falso quodlibet, “anything follows from a falsehood.” (It should really be “anything follows from a contradiction.”) The second connection is expressed in the following observations: A is provable in S if and only if S + not-A is inconsistent, and A is undecidable in S if and only if both S + A and S + not-A are consistent. These observations will be used frequently in the following. They de- pend on the rule that not-not-A is logically equivalent to A, although the incompleteness theorem can also be adapted to systems in which this rule does not hold. To verify the observations, we use the fact that a proof of a statement B in the theory T + A can also be regarded as an argument in T leading from the assumption A to the conclusion B, and thus as a proof of “if A then B”in T . Conversely, if “if A then B” is a theorem of T , B is a theorem in the theory obtained by adding A as an axiom. Specializing this to a logical contradiction B (a statement of the form ”C and not-C”) yields the stated observations. Formal Systems and the Theory of Computability The incompleteness theorem applies not only to systems like PA and ZF, which formulate part of our mathematical knowledge, but also to a wide class of formal systems, those in which a “certain amount of arithmetic” can be carried out, whether or not their axioms express any part of our mathematical knowledge and even if the axioms are false or not associated with any interpretation at all. In everyday usage it would perhaps be odd to speak of false axioms, or axioms not associated with any interpretation. In logic, however, when we speak of formal systems in general, the word “axiom” must not be assumed to be reserved for statements that are in some sense basic and irreducible to simpler principles, or statements that we believe to be true or that are in some other sense acceptable. Instead, the general concept of an axiom in logic is strictly relative to a formal system, and any sentence A in a formal language can be chosen as an axiom in a formal system. This very general notion of a formal system is closely associated with the theory of computable properties. The reason for this is that when we try to characterize the general concept of a system of axioms and rules of reasoning, we need to impose some condition to the eﬀect that recognizing an axiom or applying a rule must be a mechanical matter—we shouldn’t 20 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview have to solve further mathematical problems in order to be able to decide whether an application of a rule is correct or not, or whether a particular statement is in fact an axiom. Otherwise, we would need to introduce a second system of axioms and rules of reasoning for proving that something is in fact a proof in the ﬁrst system. So it is required of a formal system that in order to verify that something is an axiom or an application of a rule of reasoning, we do not need to use any further mathematical reasoning, but need only apply mechanical checking of a kind that can be carried out by a computer. In popular formulations of G¨odel’s theorem, a condition of this kind (as far as the axioms are concerned) is sometimes included in the form of a stipulation that the axioms of a formal system are ﬁnite in number. This implies that an axiom can (“in principle”) be recognized as such by looking through a ﬁnite table. But this condition is not in fact satisﬁed by many of the formal systems studied in logic, such as PA and ZF. These systems have an inﬁnite number of axioms, but it is still a mechanical matter to check whether or not a particular sentence is an axiom. For example, PA incorporates the rule of reasoning known as “proof by mathematical induction” by having an inﬁnite number of axioms of the form “if 0 has property P , and n + 1 has property P whenever n has property P , then every number has property P .” We can recognize every instance of this principle by a simple inspection, even though there are inﬁnitely many possible choices of P . Another example of a theory with inﬁnitely many axioms, where the axioms are not just instances of a general schema as in PA, will be given in Section 5.4. Thus, in a general characterization of formal systems, we need to make use of the general notion of a mechanically computable property, for which a theoretical foundation was given by the work of Turing and others in the 1930s. The notion of a computable property was introduced earlier in connection with Goldbach-like statements when applied to properties of numbers, but it applies equally to properties of sentences and ﬁnite se- quences of sentences in a formal language. The concept of computability, and its connection with formal systems and with the incompleteness theo- rem, will be treated in a more systematic fashion in Chapter 3. Consistency The ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, in the form given (which incorporates Rosser’s strengthening of G¨odel’s result), only assumes that the system 2.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 21 S, apart from incorporating a certain amount of arithmetic, is consistent. This is a strong result because consistency is not a very strong condition to impose on a theory. Consistent theories of arithmetic, like consistent liars, can spin a partly false and completely misleading (mathematical) yarn. Suppose we know that ZFC proves an arithmetical statement A. Can we conclude that the problem of the truth or falsity of A is thereby solved? If we have inspected the proof, we will regard the problem as solved if we ﬁnd this particular proof convincing, even if we have doubts about the axioms of ZFC in general. If all we know is that a proof in ZFC exists, we will accept the problem as solved if we have conﬁdence in the theory as a whole. But mere belief in the consistency of ZFC is in general insuﬃcient to justify accepting A as true on the basis of the knowledge that it is provable in ZFC. There is a class of statements that are guaranteed to be true if provable in a consistent system S incorporating some basic arithmetic. Suppose A is a Goldbach-like statement. We can then observe that if A is provable in such a system S, it is in fact true. For if A is false, it is provable in S that A is false, since this can be shown by a computation applied to a counterexample, and so if S is consistent, it cannot also be provable in S that A is true. Thus, for example, it is suﬃcient to know that Fermat’s theorem is provable in ZFC and that ZFC is consistent to conclude that the theorem is true. But in the case of a statement that is not Goldbach- like, for example the twin prime conjecture, we cannot in general conclude anything about the truth or falsity of the conjecture if all we know is that it is provable, or disprovable, in some consistent theory incorporating basic arithmetic. The incompleteness theorem gives us concrete examples of consistent theories that prove false theorems. This is most easily illustrated using the second incompleteness theorem. Given that ZFC is consistent, ZFC + ”ZFC is inconsistent” is also consistent, since the consistency of ZFC is not provable in ZFC itself, but this theory disproves the true Goldbach-like statement “ZFC is consistent.” (That this statement is in fact Goldbach- like will be seen in Section 2.6.) In logic, one speaks of soundness properties of theories. When we are talking about arithmetic, consistency is a minimal soundness property, while the strongest soundness property of a theory is that every arith- metical theorem of the theory is in fact true. Among the intermediate soundness properties, a particularly prominent one is that of not disprov- ing any true Goldbach-like statement. In the logical literature, this prop- 22 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview erty is sometimes called “1-consistency,” sometimes “Σ-soundness” (Sigma soundness), and in this book the latter term will sometimes be used. (The reason for this terminology will emerge in the Appendix.) The property of ω-consistency, which G¨odel used in the formulation of his theorem, implies Σ-soundness, but is a stronger property. Note that since a false Goldbach-like statement is disprovable in any theory encompassing basic arithmetic, if a Goldbach-like statement is un- decidable in such a theory (which must be consistent, since it has unde- cidable statements) it is also true. Thus, a proof of the undecidability of Goldbach’s conjecture in PA would at the same time be a proof of the con- jecture. There is nothing impossible about such a situation, since the proof of undecidability could be carried out in a stronger theory such as ZFC. But it is also conceivable that we could prove a hypothetical statement such as “If Goldbach’s conjecture is true, then it is unprovable in ZFC” with- out ever deciding Goldbach’s conjecture itself. There are Goldbach-like statements A for which we can indeed prove such hypothetical statements without being able to prove or disprove A. This also follows from the sec- ond incompleteness theorem: even if we have no idea whether or not S is consistent, we can prove the hypothetical statement “if S is consistent, the consistency of S is unprovable in S.” The “Certain Amount of Arithmetic” The ﬁrst incompleteness theorem applies to formal systems within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out. We need to be a bit more explicit about what this means. Any system whose language includes the language of elementary arith- metic, and whose theorems include some basic facts about the natural numbers, is certainly one that satisﬁes the condition. (A suﬃcient set of “basic facts” of arithmetic is speciﬁed in the Appendix.) But the incom- pleteness theorem also applies to systems that do not make any explicit statements about natural numbers, but instead refer to mathematical ob- jects that can be used to represent the natural numbers. For example, strings of symbols or certain ﬁnite sets can be used in such a representa- tion. This notion of one kind of mathematical objects representing another kind will be further commented on in connection with the second incom- pleteness theorem. Here we need only note that nothing essential will be lost if we think of the formal systems to which the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem applies as those systems that have an arithmetical component, in 2.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 23 which we can use the language of arithmetic and establish some basic facts about addition and multiplication of natural numbers. Depending on the system, there may be some translation involved in using the language of arithmetic within the system, but essentially we can think of the language of the system as including the language of elementary arithmetic. The essential point of the requirement of encompassing a “certain amount of arithmetic” can be explained without formally specifying the requisite amount. In the discussion of Goldbach-like statements, it was claimed that if a property of natural numbers, such as being the sum of two primes, can be checked by a mechanical computation, then if a number n has that property, there is an elementary mathematical proof that n has the prop- erty. The “certain amount of arithmetic” that a formal system S needs to encompass for the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem to apply to S is precisely the arithmetic needed to substantiate this claim. In other words, if the “certain amount of arithmetic” can be carried out within S, S can prove all arithmetical statements that can established by means of a more or less lengthy mechanical computation. The incompleteness theorem is often misstated as applying to systems that are “suﬃciently complex.” This is incorrect because the condition of encompassing a certain amount of elementary arithmetic does not turn on complexity in either a formal or informal sense, but on what can be expressed and what can be proved in a system. There are very simple systems to which the incompleteness theorem applies, and very complex ones to which it does not apply. The relation between complexity and incompleteness will be considered further in Chapter 8. The idea of complexity also appears in supposed applications of the incompleteness theorem outside mathematics. The following is a quota- tion from “Postmodernism and the future of traditional photography” by Richard Garrod: Early in the 20th century, the mathematician G¨odel established that in a system of suﬃcient complexity (and that level is reached in the syntax of any toddler) a complete description of that system is not possible. The complexity of the simplest photograph—any photograph—is incalculable, and the creative possibilities of the simplest photograph are in fact inﬁnite—and always will be. These comments are typical of many references to G¨odel’s theorem that loosely associate it with incompleteness or complexity in some sense or 24 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview other. It may well be that the complexity of the simplest photograph is incalculable, but G¨odel did not in fact establish that a “complete descrip- tion of a system” is impossible if the system is “suﬃciently complex.” In the quotation, a photograph is apparently regarded as a “system,” and whatever is intended by this, it seems clear that the author is not actually suggesting that a photograph proves any arithmetical statements. Thus, this is one of many references to G¨odel’s theorem that do not make contact with the actual content of the theorem, but rather invoke it as an analogy or metaphor, or as a general source of inspiration. 2.3 Some Limitations of the First Incompleteness Theorem “Unprovable Truths” It is often said that G¨odel demonstrated that there are truths that can- not be proved. This is incorrect, for there is nothing in the incompleteness theorem that tells us what might be meant by “cannot be proved” in an ab- solute sense. “Unprovable,” in the context of the incompleteness theorem, means unprovable in some particular formal system. For any statementunprovable in a particular formal system S, there are, trivially, other formal systems in which A is provable. In particular, A is provable in the theory S + A in which it is taken as an axiom. Of course the trivial observation that A is provable in S + A is of no interest if we’re wondering whether A can be proved in the sense of be- ing shown to be true. The idea of G¨odel’s theorem showing the existence of “unprovable truths” derives whatever support it has from the fact that there are formal systems in which we have included axioms and rules of reasoning that are correct from a mathematical point of view, and further- more suﬃce for the derivation of all of our ordinary arithmetical theorems. In particular, ZFC is a very strong theory within which all of the arith- metical theorems of present-day mathematics are thought to be provable. So, since ZFC is incomplete with respect to arithmetical statements (given that the theory is consistent), can we conclude that there are arithmeti- cal truths that are unprovable in the sense that there is no way for us, as human mathematicians, to mathematically establish the truth of the statement? This conclusion would perhaps follow if we didn’t know of any way of extending the axioms of ZFC to a stronger set of axioms which can still, with the same justiﬁcation as the axioms of ZFC, be held to express valid 2.3. Some Limitations of the First Incompleteness Theorem 25 principles of mathematical reasoning. But in fact there are such ways of extending ZFC (see Sections 5.4 and 8.3). There is therefore nothing in the incompleteness theorem to show that there are true arithmetical statements that are unprovable in any abso- lute sense. Still, if an arithmetical sentence is unprovable in ZFC, there are good grounds for thinking that it cannot be proved using today’s “ordinary” mathematical methods and axioms, such as one ﬁnds in mathematical text- books, and also that it cannot be proved in a way that a large majority of mathematicians would today regard as unproblematic and conclusive. Complete Formal Systems The incompleteness theorem does not imply that every consistent formal system is incomplete. On the contrary, there are many complete and consis- tent formal systems. A particularly interesting example from a mathemat- ical point of view is the elementary theory of the real numbers. (Another example, a theory known as Presburger arithmetic, is given in Chapter 7.) The language of this theory, like the language of arithmetic, allows us to speak about addition and multiplication of numbers, but now with ref- erence to the real numbers rather than the natural numbers. The real numbers encompass the integers, but also all rational numbers m/n where m and n are integers, along with irrational numbers like the square root of 2 and the number π. An example of a statement in this language is the following, taken from the Canadian mathematical olympiad of 1984: For any seven diﬀerent real numbers, there are among them two numbers x and y such that x − y divided by 1 + xy is greater than 0 and smaller than the square root of three. Another such statement is An equation x 3 +bx2 +cx+d = 0 has two diﬀerent real solutions if and only if 3c − b2 is smaller than 0 and 4c 3 − b2c 2 − 18bcd − 4b 3d + 27d2 is smaller than or equal to 0. The complete theory of the real numbers proves these and similar state- ments. As should be clear from these examples, the theory is far from trivial, and it has numerous applications in electrical engineering, compu- tational geometry, optimization, and other ﬁelds. 26 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview Since the natural numbers form a subset of the real numbers, it may seem odd that the theory of the real numbers can be complete when the theory of the natural numbers is incomplete. The incompleteness of the theory of the natural numbers does not carry over to the theory of the real numbers because even though every natural number is also a real number, we cannot deﬁne the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers using only the language of the theory of the real numbers, and therefore we cannot express arithmetical statements in the language of the theory. Thus, we cannot, for example, in the theory of the real numbers express the statement “There are natural numbers m, n, k greater than 0 such that m3 + n 3 = k3.” We can express the statement “There are real numbers r, s, t greater than 0 such that r3 + s 3 = t3” and also easily prove this statement. How would we ordinarily deﬁne the natural numbers as a subset of the real numbers? The real numbers 0 and 1 can be identiﬁed with the corresponding natural numbers, and using addition of real numbers we get the natural numbers as the subset of the real numbers containing 0, 1, 1+1, 1 + 1 + 1, and so on. However, this “and so on” cannot be expressed in the language of the theory of real numbers. Another way of formulating this deﬁnition of the natural numbers is to say that the natural numbers are the real numbers that belong to every set A of real numbers that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of adding 1; that is, for which x + 1 is in A whenever x is in A. This deﬁnition uses a second-order language, in which one can refer to sets of real numbers. The language of the elementary theory of the real numbers, like the language of elementary arithmetic, only allows us to refer to numbers, not to sets of numbers. The Completeness Theorem G¨odel’s ﬁrst major work in logic was his proof that ﬁrst-order predicate logic is complete. The statement of this theorem carries the unfortunate suggestion that predicate logic is a complete formal system in the sense of the incompleteness theorem, and comments such as the following are often encountered: First-order predicate logic is still not powerful enough to suc- cumb to G¨odel’s incompleteness theorems. In fact G¨odel himself proved it consistent and complete. 2.3. Some Limitations of the First Incompleteness Theorem 27 G¨odel is also responsible for proving (1930) that ﬁrst-order predicate logic is complete. The incompleteness proofs apply only to formal systems strong enough to represent the truths of arithmetic. Such comments are based on a natural and widespread misunderstand- ing caused by the fact that “complete” is used in logic in two diﬀerent senses. That predicate logic is complete does not mean that some formal system is complete in the sense of G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, or in other words, negation complete. Completeness in the context of the com- pleteness theorem has a diﬀerent meaning—that predicate logic is complete means that the rules of reasoning used in predicate logic are suﬃcient to derive every logical consequence of a set of axioms in a ﬁrst-order lan- guage. Thus, a less misleading description of G¨odel’s early work would be to say that he proved that many formal systems are negation incomplete and also proved the adequacy for logical deduction of the inference rules of ﬁrst-order logic. The completeness theorem, and its consequences for incompleteness in the sense of G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, will be commented on further in Chapter 7. Undecidable Nonarithmetical Statements A formal system S that contains other kinds of statements than arith- metical statements can of course have many undecidable nonarithmetical statements. What the incompleteness theorem shows is that S will be incomplete in its arithmetical component. In other words, there is a state- ment of arithmetic that cannot be decided in S. Furthermore, by putting enough work into the proof of the incompleteness theorem we can explicitly construct, given a speciﬁcation of S, a particular Goldbach-like arithmeti- cal statement that is undecidable in S. Thus, the incompleteness theorem pinpoints a speciﬁc incompleteness in any formal system that encompasses some basic arithmetic: it does not decide every arithmetical statement. Unfortunately for the applicability of the incompleteness theorem outside mathematics, this also means that we learn nothing from the incompleteness theorem about the complete- ness or incompleteness of formal systems with regard to nonarithmetical or nonmathematical statements. A weaker formulation of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem than that given states only that for any formal system that encompasses a certain 28 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview amount of arithmetic, there is a statement in the language of the system which is undecidable in the system. This weaker formulation in a way sounds more interesting than the stronger one, since it suggests that a theory of astrophysics or ghosts that includes a bit of arithmetic cannot tell the whole story about astrophysics or ghosts. But this suggestion is unjustiﬁed. A consistent formal system may, for all we learn from G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, be complete as regards statements about astro- physics, about ghosts or angels, about the human soul, about the physical universe, or about the course of the past or the future. The incompleteness theorem only tells us that the system cannot be complete in its arithmetical part. Interesting-sounding, supposed applications of the incompleteness the- orem outside mathematics, therefore, often ignore the essential condition of encompassing some basic arithmetic, and formulate the theorem incor- rectly as a theorem about formal systems in general. When they do take this condition into account, authors may resort to such formulations as “Our hypothesis is that the universe is at least as big as arithmetic, so that it is aﬀected by incompleteness” or “The philosophy should incorporate arithmetic, or else it is already limited.” The ﬁrst of these makes no ap- parent sense, while the second amounts to the feeble criticism of a system of philosophy that it cannot be a complete guide to life or the universe since it fails to decide every arithmetical statement. Such invocations of the incompleteness theorem will be further commented on in Chapter 4. 2.4 The First Incompleteness Theorem and Mathematical Truth Truth and Undecidability The words “sentence” and “statement” are used interchangeably in this book, although “sentence” is sometimes used speciﬁcally to emphasize the purely syntactic character of some of the concepts introduced. A purely syntactic concept is one that makes no reference to the meaning or interpre- tation of a language, or the truth or falsity of statements in the language, but only refers to formal rules for constructing sentences or proofs. For example, that a system S is incomplete means that there is some sentence A in the language of S such that neither A nor not-A is provable in S. This notion of incompleteness does not presuppose any notion of truth for the sentences in the language of S, but only refers to sequences of symbols formed according to certain rules (the sentences of the system) and se- 2.4. The First Incompleteness Theorem and Mathematical Truth 29 quences of sentences connected by applications of certain formal rules (the proofs in the system). Incompleteness is thus a purely syntactic concept. The incompleteness theorem is often popularly formulated as saying that for systems S to which the theorem applies, there is some true state- ment in the language of S that is undecidable in S. If we do interpret the sentences in the language of S as expressing true or false statements, this is indeed a consequence of the incompleteness theorem, for if A is undecidable in S, then so is not-A, and one of A and not-A is true. But the incomplete- ness theorem applies even if we regard the sentences of S as mere sequences of symbols, not as expressing statements for which it makes sense to ask if they are true or not. For example, there are those who for philosophical reasons would hold that sentences in the language of ZFC do not in general express any true or false statements, but this does not prevent them from recognizing that the incompleteness theorem applies to ZFC. This said, it also needs to be emphasized that since the condition for the incompleteness theorem to apply to a formal system is that it encom- passes “a certain amount of arithmetic,” we can always, when applying the incompleteness theorem to a system S, specify at least a subset of the sen- tences of S that we can interpret as expressing statements of arithmetic, and therefore as being true or false. (Although very diﬀerent interpre- tations of these sentences may well be intended by the proposers of the system, as will be explained in the Appendix.) These are the sentences in the arithmetical component of S. In particular, we can talk about the truth or falsity of statements in the arithmetical component of the system without presupposing that such talk extends to arbitrary sentences in the language of the system. Thus, given that we can speak of the truth or falsity of statements in the arithmetical component of any formal system to which the incompleteness theorem applies, it follows, as noted, that the incompleteness theorem does indeed establish that there is, for these sys- tems, a true arithmetical statement in the language of the system that is not provable in the system. Whether we can tell, for some particular unde- cidable statement A, which of A and not-A is true is another matter, and one that will be considered in Section 2.7 in connection with the discussion of G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. Philosophical Misgivings about “True” Of course such reﬂections on the truth or falsity of statements undecidable in a formal system S presuppose that we can in fact sensibly talk about 30 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview arithmetical statements as being true or false. Very often in discussions of the incompleteness theorem it is regarded as unclear what might be meant by saying that an arithmetical statement which is undecidable, say in PA, is true. What, for example, are we to make of the reﬂection that the twin prime conjecture may be true, but undecidable in PA? In saying that the twin prime conjecture may be true, do we mean that it may be provable in some other theory, and if so which one? Do we mean that we may be able to somehow “perceive” the truth of the twin prime conjecture, without a formal proof? Or are we invoking some metaphysical concept of truth, say truth in the sense of correspondence with a mathematical reality? The question is a natural one, since so many philosophical conundrums are traditionally formulated in terms of truth, and a question such as “What does it mean for an arithmetical statement to be true?” is almost auto- matically regarded as taking us into the realm of philosophical argument and speculation. Hence mathematicians, who usually avoid such argument and speculation like the plague, tend to put scare quotes around “true” or avoid the word altogether when discussing mathematics in a nonmath- ematical context. In a mathematical context, on the other hand, mathematicians easily speak of truth: “If the generalized Riemann hypothesis is true...,” “There are strong grounds for believing that Goldbach’s conjecture is true...,” “If the twin prime conjecture is true, there are inﬁnitely many counterexam- ples. . . .” In such contexts, the assumption that an arithmetical statement is true is not an assumption about what can be proved in any formal sys- tem, or about what can be “seen to be true,” and nor is it an assumption presupposing any dubious metaphysics. Rather, the assumption that Gold- bach’s conjecture is true is exactly equivalent to the assumption that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Similarly, the as- sumption that the twin prime conjecture is true means no more and no less than the assumption that there are inﬁnitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also a prime, and so on. In other words “the twin prime conjecture is true” is simply another way of saying exactly what the twin prime con- jecture says. It is a mathematical statement, not a statement about what can be known or proved, or about any relation between language and a mathematical reality. Similarly, when we talk about arithmetical statements being true but undecidable in PA, there is no need to assume that we are introducing any problematic philosophical notions. That the twin prime conjecture may be true although undecidable in PA simply means that it may be the case that 2.4. The First Incompleteness Theorem and Mathematical Truth 31 there are inﬁnitely many primes p such that p + 2 is also a prime, even though this is undecidable in PA. To say that there are true statements of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution” that are undecidable in PA is to make a purely mathematical statement, not to introduce any philosophically problematic ideas about mathematical truth. (This particular purely mathematical statement is also a mathe- matical theorem, as will be explained in Chapter 3 in connection with the Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem.) Similar remarks apply to the observations made earlier regarding con- sistent systems and their solutions of problems. It was emphasized that the mere fact of a consistent system S proving, for example, that there are inﬁnitely many twin primes by no means implies that the twin prime hypothesis is true. Here again it is often thought that such an observation involves dubious metaphysical ideas. But no metaphysics is involved, only ordinary mathematics. We know that there are consistent theories extend- ing PA that prove false mathematical statements—we know this because this fact is itself a mathematical theorem—and so we have no mathematical basis for concluding that the twin prime conjecture is true, which is to say, that there are inﬁnitely many twin primes, from the two premises “PA is consistent” and “PA proves the twin prime hypothesis.” Note that this use of “true” extends to the axioms of a theory. It is sometimes thought, when “true” is used in some philosophical sense, that the axioms of a theory cannot be described as true, since they constitute the starting point that determines what is meant by “true” in later discourse. All such philosophical ideas are irrelevant to the mathematical use of the word “true” explained above, which will be adhered to throughout the book when speaking of mathematical statements as true or false. For example, that the axiom “for every n, n + 0 = n” in PA is true means only that for every natural number n, n + 0 = n. In this case, indeed, we know that the axiom is true. Why and how we know this—whether by stipulation, by inspection, by intuition—is irrelevant to the meaning of the word “true” in this usage. In the preceding comments, it has been emphasized that, for example, to say that Goldbach’s conjecture is true is the same as saying that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes, as “true” is used in this book. Thus, the use of “true” is in such cases just a convenience, freeing us from the need to repeat the formulation of the conjecture. But “true” is also used in the discussion in other ways, as when it is said that every theorem of PA is true. Here, we cannot eliminate the word “true” 32 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview and replace the statement “Every theorem of PA is true” with a statement listing all of the inﬁnitely many theorems of PA. It is still the case, however, that “Every theorem of PA is true” is a mathematical statement, not a statement about what can be proved or seen to be true, or a philosophical statement about mathematical reality. Alfred Tarski showed in the 1930s how to give a mathematical deﬁnition of truth on which a statement “A is true,” for any given A, is mathematically equivalent to A itself. The formal details will not be presented in this book, but the discussion will rely on the possibility of giving such a mathematical deﬁnition of “true” in the case of arithmetic. “True in S” A fairly common use of “true” in popular formulations of the incomplete- ness theorem is illustrated by the following: G¨odel proved that any set of axioms at least as rich as the axioms of arithmetic has statements which are true in that set of axioms, but cannot be proved by using that set of axioms. Again, the Columbia Encyclopedia states that Kurt G¨odel, in the 1930s, brought forth his incompleteness the- orem, which demonstrates that an inﬁnitude of propositions that are underivable from the axioms of a system nevertheless have the value of true within the system. Clearly, “true in that set of axioms” or “true within the system” does not mean “provable from that set of axioms” or “provable in the system” here, but since there is no notion of “true in a set of axioms” in logic, the question arises what it does mean. One possible interpretation, on which the above formulations become intelligible but incorrect, will be considered in Chapter 7, in connection with the completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic. However, it also appears that in many cases when such phrases as “true in the system” and “true within the set of axioms” are used, what the author means by this is that users of the system are somehow able to convince themselves of the truth of the statement, even though it is not formally derivable. In such a case it is a relevant observation that it may or may not be the case, depending on the system, that we know of any particular statement that it is true but unprovable in the system. In particular, we may or may not have any idea whether the undecidable 2.5. The First Incompleteness Theorem and Hilbert’s Non Ignorabimus 33 sentence exhibited in G¨odel’s proof is true, as will be further commented on in Section 2.7. A possibly related misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorem is found in formulations that speak of theorems as undecidable, as in “If the system is consistent, then there is a true but unprovable theorem in it.” Every theorem of a system S is provable in S, since this is what “theorem of S” means. A similar odd usage is found in the claim that G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem states that in every mathemat- ical system, there exists one axiom which can neither be proved nor disproved. As has already been emphasized, every axiom of a system is trivially also provable in the system. We should note that an unfortunate peripheral use of the phrase “un- provable theorems” exists in logic. The American logician (and professor of music) Harvey Friedman explains that An unprovable theorem is a mathematical result that can not be proved using the commonly accepted axioms for mathematics (Zermelo-Fraenkel plus the axiom of choice), but can be proved by using the higher inﬁnities known as large cardinals. Large cardinal axioms have been the main proposal for new axioms originating with G¨odel. This unfortunate terminology does not of course imply that there are theorems of S that are unprovable in S, for any system S. Large cardinal axioms will be commented on in Chapter 8, which also gives a brief ex- planation of the direction of Friedman’s work on the use of large cardinal axioms. 2.5 The First Incompleteness Theorem and Hilbert’s Non Ignorabimus We know from the incompleteness theorem that (assuming consistency) not even ZFC decides every arithmetical statement. Is it possible that, for example, the twin prime conjecture is in fact undecidable in ZFC? It’s a logical possibility, but there is nothing to support it. No arithmetical con- jecture or problem that has occurred to mathematicians in a mathematical context, that is, outside the special ﬁeld of logic and the foundations or phi- losophy of mathematics, has ever been proved to be undecidable in ZFC. 34 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview So a mathematician who attacks a natural mathematical problem in the optimistic spirit of Hilbert’s “non ignorabimus” is not obliged to feel at all worried by the possibility of the problem being unsolvable within ZFC. Note the formulation “no arithmetical conjecture or problem.” If we consider problems in set theory rather than arithmetic, the very ﬁrst prob- lem on Hilbert’s list of 23 open mathematical problems, that of proving or disproving a set-theoretical conjecture known as Cantor’s continuum hy- pothesis, is known to be unsolvable in ZFC (given that ZFC is consistent). That this problem is unsolvable in ZFC was proved using set-theoretical methods introduced by G¨odel in 1938 and Paul Cohen in 1963, not with the help of the incompleteness theorem. Since ZFC is known to encompass all of the methods of “ordinary” mathematics, what this means is that in order to prove or disprove the continuum hypothesis, new mathematical axioms or principles of reasoning must be introduced. Since it is not part of ordinary mathematical activity to ﬁnd and propose such axioms or prin- ciples, it is understandable that mathematicians in general tend to regard a problem that is known to be unsolvable in ZFC as no longer posing a mathematical problem. Similarly, if the twin prime hypothesis were to be proved to be undecidable in ZFC (which would be sensational in the ex- treme), the problem of its truth or falsity would thereby take on a diﬀerent mathematical dimension. Nevertheless, extensions of the axioms and rules of reasoning accepted in mathematics have occurred and are continually being explored, even if not as part of ordinary mathematical activity. So a Hilbert-style optimist may well take the view that the impossibility of formulating any one for- mal system within which every arithmetical problem is solvable does not exclude the possibility of every arithmetical problem being solvable in one or another of an indeﬁnite series of further extensions of mathematics by new axioms or rules of reasoning. This indeed was the view of G¨odel, who, as previously noted, proposed “large cardinal axioms” as a means of extending present-day mathematics. 2.6 The Second Incompleteness Theorem We begin with an informal statement of the theorem: Second incompleteness theorem (G¨odel). For any consistent formal system S within which a certain amount of elementary arithmetic can be carried out, the consistency of S cannot be proved in S itself. 2.6. The Second Incompleteness Theorem 35 Let it ﬁrst be noted that the “certain amount of arithmetic” is in this case not the same “certain amount” as in the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. This point will be commented on further in connection with the proof of the second incompleteness theorem. The formulation of the second incompleteness theorem presupposes that the statement “S is consistent” can at least be expressed in the language of S, since otherwise the observation that the consistency of S cannot be proved in S would have no interesting content. (It is not an observation of any interest that a theory of arithmetic cannot prove that horses are four-legged.) It is perfectly possible to produce formal systems S whose language refers directly to sentences and proofs in formally deﬁned lan- guages, including the language of S. The second incompleteness theorem, however, only requires S to have an arithmetical component, as in the case of the ﬁrst completeness theorem, and therefore presupposes some way of representing sentences and proofs as numbers and expressing statements about sentences and proofs as arithmetical statements about the corre- sponding numbers. This is known as the arithmetization of syntax and was ﬁrst carried out by G¨odel in his proof of the incompleteness theorem. A method of representing syntactical objects (such as sentences and proofs) as numbers is called a G¨odel numbering. The most tedious part of a formal treatment of the incompleteness theorem consists in deﬁning a G¨odel num- bering and in showing that “n is the G¨odel number of a proof in S of the sentence with G¨odel number m” can be deﬁned in the language of arith- metic. It is required that the G¨odel number of any sentence or sequence of sentences can be mechanically computed, and that computable properties of syntactic objects correspond to computable properties of G¨odel numbers. Details regarding G¨odel numberings are just the kind of technicality that will be avoided in this book, although an example of a G¨odel number- ing will be given in Chapter 3. Mostly we will merely take for granted that aG¨odel numbering can be introduced, so that the arithmetical component of a system S contains statements that we can interpret as being about sentences and proofs in formal systems, including the system S itself. This notion of “can interpret” merits some further comments. Take as an example ConS, a translation into the language of arithmetic of “S is consistent.” That is, ConS is an arithmetical statement obtained by introducing a G¨odel numbering for the language of S, and expressing in the language of arithmetic “it is not the case that for some sentence A in the language of S, there is a proof in S both of A and of not-A.” ConS if written out as a sentence in the language of elementary arithmetic would 36 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview be enormous, and we wouldn’t be able to make sense of it if presented with it. The arithmetical sentence ConS is not of any interest from an ordinary arithmetical point of view, but only in virtue of a conventional association between numbers and syntactic objects (such as sentences and sequences of sentences) whereby we know it to be true as an arithmetical sentence if and only if S is consistent. We refer to this sentence in reasoning that uses ordinary mathematical language; we do not use the sentence in formulating our reasoning. The same is true of other translations of statements about formal systems into the language of arithmetic using a G¨odel numbering. A similar situation is found, for example, in the use of binary data to represent sounds and pictures, say in computer games. Events in the game take place as a result of mathematical transformations of an enormous col- lection of bits (0 and 1) representing a certain situation in the game. These transformations, although describable in purely mathematical terms, make sense to us and are of interest only in virtue of a conventional association between bit patterns and certain sounds and images, and it is only in terms of sounds and images that we discuss these collections of bits. An everyday example of an association between numbers and sequences of symbols is that used in basic arithmetic. We use sequences of digits such as “365” to denote numbers. The association between the sequence of digits “365” and the number 365 is a conventional one, resulting from a certain way of systematically interpreting sequences of symbols as numbers. We carry out various operations on these sequences of symbols which are de- scribable in purely syntactic terms. For example, we use the operation of putting another “0” at the end of a string of digits. Although describ- able purely in terms of symbol manipulation, the interest of this operation lies in the fact that in virtue of our association of sequences of symbols with numbers, it corresponds to multiplication of a number by 10. Thus, we have in this case a “G¨odel numbering in reverse,” where statements about and operations on numbers can be expressed as statements about and operations on sequences of symbols. The idea of statements about some kind of formally deﬁnable object— numbers, sets, sequences of symbols, bit patterns—being interpretable as statements about another kind of object is thus one that had been around for a long time before G¨odel, and it is an idea used in many contexts other than formal logic. But G¨odel put this idea to good use in the arith- metization of syntax, opening up a new approach in the study of formal systems. 2.6. The Second Incompleteness Theorem 37 Proving ConS That a formal system S is inconsistent means that there are two proofs in the system such that one proves A and the other proves not-A, for some sentence A. Since the property of being the G¨odel number of a proof in S is required to be a computable one, it follows that “S is consistent” can be formulated as a Goldbach-like statement: it is not the case that there are numbers n and m such that n is the G¨odel number of a proof in S of A and m is the G¨odel number of a proof in S of not-A, for the same statement A. From this it follows that ConS, if false, can be shown to be false by a computation, but if it is true it may or may not be provable using a given set of mathematical methods and principles. The second incompleteness theorem tells us that in fact ConS, if true, cannot be shown to be true using only the methods and principles contained in the system S. But of course ConS is provable in other formal systems, and it may or may not be provable in a system that we ﬁnd mathematically justiﬁable. There is a common misconception concerning the second incompleteness theorem, expressed for example in [Kadvany 89, p. 165], in the author’s comments on supposed postmodernist implications of the incompleteness theorem: G¨odel’s Second Theorem implies that the consistency of Prin- cipia can be mathematically proven only by conjecturally as- suming the consistency of Principia outright (which is what mathematicians implicitly do in practice), or by reducing the consistency of Principia to that of a stronger system, thereby beginning an inﬁnite regress. The second incompleteness theorem does not imply that the consistency of a system S can only be proved in a stronger system than S, if by a stronger system we mean a system that proves everything S proves and more besides. It only implies that the consistency of S cannot be proved in S itself. It would be strange indeed if the consistency of S could only be proved in a stronger system, since to say that S is consistent is only to say that S does not prove any contradiction—it may prove lots of false statements and yet be consistent. So a proof that S is consistent is not a proof that S is generally reliable as a source of arithmetical theorems, and there is no reason why a consistency proof for S has to presuppose the methods of reasoning of S itself. Thus, for example, the consistency of PA 38 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview was proved by Gerhard Gentzen (1936) in a theory that extends PA in one respect and severely restricts it in other respects. What is true is that a consistency proof for a consistent theory S can only be given in a theory S′ which extends S with respect to the Goldbach- like statements provable in S. If S′ proves the consistency of S, ConS is a Goldbach-like theorem of S′ that is not provable in S, while every Goldbach-like theorem of S is also provable in S′. (This is so because it is provable in S′ that every Goldbach-like theorem of a consistent theory is true.) The idea that the second incompleteness theorem leads to an inﬁnite regress if we seek to prove the consistency of theories is often expressed. What is odd about this idea is that it has been well understood since antiquity that we cannot keep justifying our axioms and principles on the basis of other axioms and principles, on pain of inﬁnite regress. Say we carry out a consistency proof for PA in a theory S. Why do we accept this proof? If we say that we need a consistency proof for S in order to accept the proof in S of the consistency of PA, then indeed we are on the way to an inﬁnite regress. But we don’t need G¨odel to tell us that we cannot accept a proof in one formal system only on the basis of a proof in another formal system. At some point, we can only justify our axioms, and thereby our proofs, by informal means, whatever these may be—appeals to their intuitively clear and convincing character, to their usefulness or success in practice, to tradition, or to whatever else we may come up with in the way of justiﬁcation. Suppose the consistency of PA were in fact provable in PA itself. Would such a proof have any value as a proof that PA is in fact consistent? Not necessarily, for why should we accept this particular proof in PA? After all, if the consistency of PA is in doubt, the validity of a consistency proof given in PA is equally in doubt—at least as long as we haven’t seen the proof. For there is a loophole: we might consider a consistency proof for PA carried out in PA to be conclusive because it only uses a small part of PA, one that we have no doubt is consistent even if we can muster doubts about the consistency of PA as a whole. This indeed was the general approach of David Hilbert. The Second Incompleteness Theorem and Hilbert’s Program The second incompleteness theorem had profound consequences for the ideas concerning the foundations of mathematics put forward by David 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 39 Hilbert, who had the goal of proving the consistency of mathematics by ﬁnitistic reasoning. What he wanted to do was to formulate formal systems within which all of ordinary mathematics could be carried out, including the mathematics of inﬁnite sets, and to prove the consistency of these systems using only the most basic and concrete mathematical reasoning. In this sense, Hilbert intended his consistency proof to be conclusive: the consistency of, say, ZFC is proved using only reasoning of a kind that we cannot do without in science or mathematics. Although Hilbert did not formally specify what methods were allowed in ﬁnitistic reasoning, it seems clear that the methods Hilbert had in mind can be formalized in systems of arithmetic such as PA. And if PA cannot prove its own consistency, it follows that not even the consistency of elemen- tary arithmetic can be proved using ﬁnitistic reasoning, so that Hilbert’s program cannot be carried out (and that the ﬁnitistic consistency proof for arithmetic that Hilbert thought at the time had already been achieved, by his student and collaborator Wilhelm Ackermann, must be incorrect, as indeed it turned out to be). It is often said that the incompleteness theorem demolished Hilbert’s program, but this was not the view of G¨odel himself. Rather, it showed that the means by which acceptable consistency proofs could be carried out had to be extended. G¨odel’s own “Dialectica interpretation,” which he developed in the early 1940s and which was published in the jour- nal Dialectica in 1958, gave one way of extending the notion of ﬁnististic proof. Hilbert’s program was based on a particular set of ideas about the mean- ing and contents of mathematics and what is meant by a justiﬁcation of mathematics. If we do not share Hilbert’s general ideas, a consistency proof is by itself quite insuﬃcient to justify a mathematical theory, since, for ex- ample, provability in a consistent theory of the twin prime conjecture is no guarantee that there are inﬁnitely many twin primes. The nonmathemat- ical conclusions drawn from the second incompleteness theorems in recent decades are rarely explicitly based on Hilbert’s views, but the skepticism they tend to express is clearly inﬂuenced by similar ideas. Such conclusions will be commented on at some length in Chapter 5. 2.7 Proving the Incompleteness Theorem It is sometimes thought that the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem is not a mathematical theorem in the ordinary sense. For example: 40 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview The theorem is written in a formal mathematical system, but can only be proved using nonformal mathematical reasoning. There is no way to formalize the proof; it can only be stated in a natural language like English. Another diﬃculty is whether G¨odel’s proof is actually a proof. To prove incompleteness, we have to interpret the formula and have to understand that what it says is true. That is, the result is not achieved by formal reasoning, but by some meta- reasoning done from outside the system. Hence it is not a “for- mal” proof. It takes insight to see the truth of the formula. This idea that G¨odel’s theorem does not have an ordinary mathematical proof seems to be based on a speciﬁc misunderstanding of G¨odel’s original proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem: the mistaken belief that G¨odel’s proof, which shows a certain arithmetical statement G depending on S to be unprovable in S if S is consistent, also shows G to be true. This would indeed make G¨odel’s proof a remarkable one, but in fact the proof does not show anything of the kind. All that G¨odel’s proof shows is the implication “if S is consistent, G is true.” If we can prove that S is consistent, which we can sometimes do, we can also prove that G is true. If we have no idea whether or not S is consistent, G¨odel’s proof still goes through, but we have no idea whether or not G is true. In either case, the question of the truth or falsity of G cannot be decided on the basis only of G¨odel’s proof. In fact there is nothing any more informal or intuitive about the proof of G¨odel’s theorem than there is about mathematical proofs in general. The incompleteness theorem has formal proofs in fairly weak mathematical theories—PA is more than suﬃcient. Thus, applied to PA and stronger theories, G¨odel’s proof does not establish the truth of any mathematical statement which is not provable in the theory itself. Gödel’s Proof G¨odel’s original proof of the incompleteness theorem was not formulated as a theorem about formal systems in general, for the reason that the general theory of computability, and therewith the general concept of a formal system, had yet to be formulated in 1930. Instead, G¨odel proved the theorem for a particular formal system which he called P. He listed the properties of P used in the proof, and noted that these properties were shared by a wide class of formal systems. In Part II of the paper, which 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 41 never appeared, he intended to formulate a general version of the theorem. During the 1930s it became clear, with the introduction of the general concept of computability, that essentially the same proof did indeed apply to all formal systems satifying the conditions listed by G¨odel, and also that those conditions were satisﬁed by all formal systems in which a certain modest amount of arithmetic can be carried out. G¨odel’s proof of the incompleteness theorem introduced a technique that has since been used extensively in logic, that of deﬁning provable ﬁxpoints for various properties of arithmetical sentences. This technique presupposes the arithmetization of syntax. Suppose we have deﬁned in arithmetic some property P of the G¨odel numbers of sentences in the lan- guage of the system S. For example, P could be the property of being the G¨odel number of a Goldbach-like sentence in the language of S, or the property of being the G¨odel number of an axiom of S, or the property of being the G¨odel number of a theorem of S. We need to assume that the property P is itself deﬁnable in the language of arithmetic, as is the case with the properties mentioned. By a provable ﬁxpoint for the property P is meant an arithmetical sentence A such that S, or a weaker system than S, proves A if and only if m has the property P for a particular number m, and this number m is in fact the G¨odel number of A itself. Thus, it is provable in S that A holds if and only if its G¨odel number has the property P . That there is a provable ﬁxpoint for every property P deﬁnable in the language of arithmetic is far from obvious. G¨odel established the existence of such ﬁxpoints by translating a statement that “says of itself that it has property P ” into arithmetic. For this, he used a construction which in ordinary (or not so ordinary) language can be formulated as The result of substituting the quotation of “The result of sub- stituting the quotation of x for ‘x’ in x has property P .” for ‘x’ in “The result of substituting the quotation of x for ‘x’ in x has property P .” has property P . This oddly worded sentence says that the result of carrying out a certain speciﬁc substitution operation has property P . If we carry out the opera- tion speciﬁed, we ﬁnd that it results in precisely the sentence itself. The sentence therefore “says of itself that it has property P ,” in the sense that it says that a sentence satisfying a certain description has property P , and 42 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview the sentence itself is the one and only sentence satisfying that description. By showing that the substitution operation can be deﬁned in arithmetical terms as an operation on G¨odel numbers, G¨odel obtained a version A in the language of arithmetic of the statement above, provably equivalent in PA to “m has property P ,” where m is the G¨odel number of A. Other ways of formulating self-referential sentences using syntactic op- erations have also been formulated later. For example, the American logi- cian and philosopher W. V. O. Quine came up with a method known as “quining”: “yields a sentence with property P when appended to its own quotation.” yields a sentence with property P when appended to its own quotation. The general ﬁxpoint construction is widely used in logic to prove various results. G¨odel used it to prove his ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, by applying it to the property of not being a theorem of S. By a G¨odel sentence for S is meant a sentence G obtained through the general ﬁxpoint construction, such that S proves G if and only if n is not the G¨odel number of a theorem of S, where n is the G¨odel number of G itself. Let us ﬁrst observe that G can be formulated as a Goldbach-like state- ment. It is equivalent to the statement that no number p is the G¨odel number of a proof of G in S, and the property of being such a number p is a computable one, given the general requirements on formal systems and G¨odel numberings. The reasoning in G¨odel’s proof is now as follows. First, if G is in fact a theorem of S, then it is provable in S that G is atheorem of S (that is, that n is the G¨odel number of a theorem of S). The reason for this is that being a theorem of S is a property that can be veriﬁed by exhibiting a proof in S, and since being a proof in S is required to be a computable property of sequences of sentences, the veriﬁcation can be carried out within S. So if G is atheorem of S, this is provable in S, but since G is a provable ﬁxpoint of the property of not being a theorem of S, the negation of G is then also provable in S, so S is inconsistent. Thus, if S is consistent, G is not provable in S. Can we also conclude that G is not disprovable in S, on the assumption that S is consistent? No, for by the second incompleteness theorem, a consistent theory S may prove 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 43 its own inconsistency, and thereby prove that every statement is provable in S (and in particular, prove G false, since G is equivalent to the statement that G is not provable in S). But we can observe that if S is consistent, G is true (because not provable in S), and since G is also a Goldbach-like sentence, it follows that not-G is not provable in S provided we assume that S is Σ-sound, that is, does not disprove any true Goldbach-like sentences. This yields a result that is a bit stronger than G¨odel’s original version of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, since G¨odel’s original assumption that S is ω-consistent implies, but is stronger than, the assumption that S does not disprove any true Goldbach-like sentences. Rosser Sentences Rosser, in order to strengthen the formulation of the incompleteness theo- rem, introduced a Rosser sentence R, which is constructed as a ﬁxpoint of a more complicated property than that of not being provable in S. Specif- ically, PA proves R if and only if for every n, if n is the G¨odel number of a proof of R, then there is an m< n such that m is the G¨odel number of a proof of not-R. It is left to the interested reader to verify that R is also a Goldbach-like statement, and furthermore is undecidable in S if S is consistent. Nothing essential will be lost by just taking this fact on faith in the following. Tarski’s Theorem The ﬁxpoint construction can be used to show that there is no way of deﬁn- ing in the language of arithmetic the property of being the G¨odel number of a true arithmetical sentence. For if this property could be deﬁned in arithmetic, a ﬁxpoint A for the property of not being the G¨odel number of a true arithmetical sentence would have the property that A is a true arithmetical sentence if and only if its G¨odel number is not the G¨odel num- ber of a true arithmetical sentence. In other words, a form of the ancient paradox of the Liar would be a consequence: we would have constructed an arithmetical statement A that is true if and only if it is not true. The result that the property of being a true arithmetical sentence cannot be de- ﬁned in the language of arithmetic is usually called Tarski’s theorem, but 44 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview in fact G¨odel obtained this result as a step along the way in discovering the incompleteness theorem. Although the property of being a true arithmetical sentence thus can- not be deﬁned in arithmetic, the property of being a true Goldbach-like sentence can be so deﬁned, and similarly for other restricted categories of arithmetical sentence. Thus, for example, we can deﬁne an arithmetical sentence A that is true if and only if it is not a true Goldbach-like sentence. This does not result in any paradox, since A is in fact not a Goldbach-like sentence at all, and is therefore true. G¨odel himself observed that his proof of the incompleteness theorem is related to the paradox of the Liar in the following sense. The Liar sentence is a sentence L that “says of itself that it is not true.” Thus, given our ordinary use of “true” it seems to follow that L is true if and only if it is not true, a logical contradiction. G¨odel’s proof uses a corresponding arith- metical sentence in which “true” is replaced by “provable in S.” Whereas the paradox of the Liar has given rise to endless debates over the meaning of “true” and the question what is required for a sentence to express a meaningful assertion, the G¨odel sentence is an arithmetical sentence, one that is as unproblematically meaningful as other arithmetical sentences of a similar logical form (Goldbach-like statements). G¨odel’s original proof is by no means the only proof of the ﬁrst incom- pleteness theorem, and some other proofs will be brieﬂy commented on at a later point. But ﬁrst some remarks about self-reference, which the reader may well prefer to skip. G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, and Rosser’s strength- ened version, both make essential use of the ﬁxpoint construction. It is sometimes claimed that it is misleading to say that sentences obtained through the ﬁxpoint construction are “self-referential,” since (it is held) all that can be said is that the equivalences A if and only if m has the property P are provable for these sentences A, where m is the G¨odel number of A itself. In other words, sentences like G and R are just ﬁxpoints for certain properties, they are not “self-referential.” This is not correct, however. G¨odel’s proof does indeed only use the fact that the G¨odel sentence G is a ﬁxpoint for the property of not being 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 45 provable in S. But the sentences constructed in the proof that every arith- metical property P has a provable ﬁxpoint are self-referential in a stronger sense: they are sentences A of the form There is an m such that m has property P and property Q where it is provable in PA that the only number that has property P is the G¨odel number of the sentence A itself. It is in this sense that the sentence A “says of itself that it has property Q.” There are provable ﬁxpoints other than G¨odel sentences for the property of not being provable in S, for example (by the second incompleteness theorem) the sentence ConS formalizing “S is consistent.” Since it is provable in S that ConS is true if and only if it is not provable in S, ConS is in fact a ﬁxpoint for the property of not being provable in S. But ConS is not in any apparent sense self-referential, and nobody would want to say that ConS “says of itself that it not provable in S.” This characterization of self-referential arithmetical statements doesn’t tell the whole story. Let us consider a couple of varieties of ordinary self- reference, in the sense of speakers referring to themselves, rather than sen- tences referring to themselves. Suppose John says “John loves you.” This may or may not be a case of self-reference, depending on the speaker’s in- tention. He may be referring to himself in the third person the way George Costanza does in Seinfeld, when observing that “George is getting angry,” or he may be referring to another person named John. On the other hand, if John says “Your husband loves you,” and is addressing his wife, his state- ment is self-referential in a sense that is independent of his intentions. Even if he is an amnesiac and makes the statement on the basis of what he has learned about his wife’s husband, it is still self-referential in the sense that John is the one and only husband of the person addressed, and therefore the statement is true if and only if John loves his wife. In the case of self-referential statements in the language of arithmetic, there is of course no question of the sentence itself intending anything, but we can locate two similar aspects of self-reference. The use of substitution operations or something similar corresponds to the second example of self- reference above, while the ﬁrst example corresponds to the conventional choice of G¨odel numbering. Suppose we formulate a statement A 0 has property Q and then introduce a G¨odel numbering in which the G¨odel number of A is 0. There is no problem about introducing such a G¨odel numbering, since 46 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview aG¨odel numbering is purely a matter of convention, as long as computable syntactic properties correspond to computable properties of G¨odel num- bers. The statement A is then, given this G¨odel numbering, trivially a provable ﬁxpoint for the property Q. Indeed, in the sense explained, A does “say of itself that it has the property Q.” It has the form “there is an m such that m has property P and property Q,” where the G¨odel num- ber of A itself is the only number with property P (namely that of being identical with 0). Something seems to be missing in this example of self-reference. Why does this approach not yield a painless version of G¨odel’s proof? The rea- son is that we ﬁrst choose the property Q and then the G¨odel numbering, depending on Q. We can’t apply this construction to obtain a provable ﬁxpoint for the property of not being a theorem of A, since the latter prop- erty itself depends on a choice of G¨odel numbering. The trivial construction does yield a statement which “says of itself that it has the property Q,” but the property Q is in this case just a random and pointless property of the G¨odel number of the sentence. A statement that is self-referential in the sense that G and R are self-referential not only has the form “There is an m such that m has property P and property Q,” where the G¨odel number of the statement itself is the only number with property P . In addition, P and Q are translations into arithmetic, using the same G¨odel numbering, of syntactical properties of statements. Proofs of the First Incompleteness Theorem Using the Theory of Computability G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem and Rosser’s strength- ened version have given many the impression that the theorem can only be proved by constructing self-referential statements in the language of S, or even that only strange self-referential statements are known to be undecidable in elementary arithmetic. To counteract such impressions, we need only introduce a diﬀerent kind of proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. One argument is as follows. By the Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem, which has been re- ferred to a couple of times already, there is no algorithm that given any Dio- phantine equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 will decide whether or not the equa- tion has a solution. But then there can be no theory that correctly decides every statement of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has at least one solution.” For given such a theory S, we could decide 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 47 whether or not a given equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has a solution by sys- tematically searching for a proof in S of either the statement “the equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has at least one solution” or its negation. Thus, unless S proves some false sentence of the form “the equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has at least one solution,” there must be sentences of this form that are undecidable in S. Note two features of this argument. First, like G¨odel’s original proof, it only shows incompleteness on the assumption that S does not incor- rectly disprove any true Goldbach-like statements. But second, it does not, as it stands, exhibit any particular statement undecidable in S, unlike G¨odel’s proof. On the other hand, we don’t even need to introduce any arithmetization of syntax in order to conclude the incompleteness of S by this argument, since the arithmetical incompleteness of S is located among ordinary arithmetical statements about Diophantine equations. By intro- ducing arithmetization, the argument can be reﬁned to exhibit a particular undecidable sentence, as in G¨odel’s original proof. This proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, along with the Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem, will be explained in greater detail in Chapter 3, which is devoted to the theory of computability and its connections with the incompleteness theorem. A third approach to proving the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, using the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, will be presented in Chapter 8. A reader who is disinclined to digest the reasoning in these other proofs of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem should just keep in mind the essential point that incompleteness is not restricted to arithmetical translations of strange self-referential statements. Instead, we know that systems S to which G¨odel’s theorem applies have undecidable statements of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has no solution.” What we do not know is whether any statements of this form of interest to mathe- maticians are undecidable in PA or ZFC. Weaker Variants of the First Incompleteness Theorem There are still other proofs of the incompleteness of PA and of the arith- metical component of other theories. Thus, [Putnam 00] presents one such proof, due to Saul Kripke. Unlike the proofs already described, this proof of Kripke’s neither makes use of self-referential statements nor draws on the theory of computability. (Instead it makes use of the existence of non- standard models of PA, explained in Section 7.3.) However, the conclusion 48 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview proved is weaker than that in G¨odel’s theorem with regard to the logical complexity of the statement shown to be undecidable. It is not a Goldbach- like statement, and in particular the argument does not establish the truth of the second incompleteness theorem. Proving the Second Incompleteness Theorem G¨odel’s proof of the second incompleteness theorem in his 1931 paper con- sisted mostly of handwaving—in other words, sketching an argument with- out carrying it out in detail. The argument was simple: the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem established that if the system P is consistent, G is not provable in P, and therefore true. If we examine this argument, we see that it only uses mathematical reasoning of a kind that can be carried out within P, and therefore it follows that the implication “if P is consistent then G” is provable in P. But then, if P is consistent, it follows that “P is consistent” is not provable in P, since G is not provable in P. We can strengthen this conclusion: not only “if P is consistent then G” is provable in P, but also “if G then P is consistent.” For G is equivalent in P to“G is not a theorem of P,” and every theory in which some statement is not provable is consistent, a fact which is also provable in P. Thus, G and “P is consistent” are in fact equivalent in P. As in the case of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, it was clear from G¨odel’s presentation that the argument extended to a wide class of for- mal systems incorporating “a certain amount of arithmetic,” although the “certain amount” is not the same “certain amount” as in the ﬁrst incom- pleteness theorem. G¨odel’s proof of the second incompleteness theorem for a formal system S depends on the proof of “if S is consistent, G is unprovable in S” being formalizable in S itself. A formal system needs to incorporate a larger amount of arithmetic in order for the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem to be formalizable in the system than it needs for the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem to apply to the system. Thus, we can specify formal systems such as Robinson Arithmetic, presented in the Appendix, to which the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem applies, but not the second. Note that this does not mean that Robinson arithmetic proves its own consistency, but only that we cannot use the second incomplete- ness theorem, as formulated here, to show that it does not prove its own consistency. (Formulations of arithmetical theories that do prove their own consistency exist in the logical literature—these theories are in one way or another very weak, for example, in not assuming that every natural number 2.7. Proving the Incompleteness Theorem 49 has a successor, but can nevertheless incorporate a great deal of nontrivial arithmetical reasoning.) G¨odel’s argument was in fact quite convincing to his readers, and he never got around to presenting his proof of the second incompleteness the- orem in full formal detail. This was instead done in the 1939 two-volume work Grundlagen der Mathematik (Foundations of mathematics) by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays. G¨odel’s original proof remains the most com- mon and the most accessible proof of the second incompleteness theorem, although other proofs exist for particular theories. As in the case of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, it is sometimes thought that the proof of the second incompleteness theorem is not an ordi- nary mathematical proof. Thus, Kadvany comments [Kadvany 89, p. 178] that “The historical process shows that the Second Theorem is not a the- orem in the ordinary sense.” This is not an idea based on a simple mis- understanding of the theorem, as in the case of similar comments about the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. Instead, what Kadvany has in mind is the fact that the second incompleteness theorem requires us to decide on a formalization of “S is consistent” in the language of arithmetic. When we consider arbitrary formal systems this becomes a somewhat delicate matter, and it only became clear around 1960, through the work of the American philosopher and logician Solomon Feferman, how to formulate the second incompleteness theorem in the most general case. However, these subtleties do not aﬀect the formulation of the theorem applied to PA or ZFC or any other theory that we actually study in logic. In these cases, there is essentially only one way of expressing “S is consistent” as an arith- metical statement, namely the obvious and natural way. Kadvany remarks in this context that “What is natural is a matter of historical choice made against a background of mathematical tradition adapting to a radical new set of ideas,” (p. 176) which is misleading. In the general case (arbitrary theories S) there simply is no natural choice, and no historical choice has been made. In the case of theories like PA or ZFC, the choice of arithmeti- cal formulation of “S is consistent” is natural, given a particular choice of G¨odel numbering, in the same sense as the choice of an arithmetical for- mulation of, for example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic (“every natural number has a unique decomposition as a product of primes”) is natural, given a representation of ﬁnite sequences of numbers as numbers. No diﬃcult or arbitrary choices are involved, beyond the choice of a G¨odel numbering. Furthermore, although the choice of a G¨odel numbering has its arbitrary aspects, we can easily isolate the standard G¨odel numberings, 50 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview which yield equivalent G¨odel sentences and equivalent formalizations of “S is consistent” for these theories. As these comments probably suggest to the reader, this particular issue raised by Kadvany is somewhat technical, both logically and philosophi- cally, and it will not be pursued in the remainder of this book. A reader interested in the subject will ﬁnd an extended treatment in [Franz´en 04]. 2.8 A “Postmodern Condition”? Provability or decidability, in the context of the incompleteness theorem, means provability or decidability in some formal system or another. There is no concept in logic of a statement A being provable or disprovable or undecidable in any absolute sense, but only of A being provable or disprov- able or undecidable in a formal system S. Any statement A undecidable in S will be decidable in other systems. In particular, if A is undecidable in a consistent system S, A is provable in the consistent system S + A obtained by adding A as a new axiom to S, and disprovable in the consistent system S+ not-A obtained by adding the negation of A as an axiom. Of course this does not tell us whether A is decidable in the more interesting sense of being provable or disprovable by reasoning that mathematicians would consider conclusive, or whether A is decidable in some particular theory of interest such as PA or ZFC. It is sometimes thought that the fact of some particular statement be- ing undecidable in some particular formal system implies that mathematics “branches oﬀ” into a version in which the statement is provable and one in which it is disprovable. An analogy is often suggested with the logical inde- pendence of the parallel postulate from the other axioms of Euclidean ge- ometry, which led to axiomatizations of non-Euclidean geometries in which the parallel axiom does not hold. This idea is taken up in combination with a general view of G¨odel’s theorem as congenial to postmodernism in [Kadvany 89, p. 162]: The simplest observation of how G¨odel’s Theorems create a postmodern condition begins with the First Incompleteness The- orem. This theorem says, in eﬀect, that a consistent axiomatic system strong enough to prove some weak theorems from ele- mentary number theory, requiring only the operations of addi- tion and multiplication, but not either operation separately, 2.8. A “Postmodern Condition”? 51 will be incomplete: there will always be mathematical sen- tences formulated in the syntax of the system under consid- eration that are neither provable nor refutable in the system, and these sentences are said to be undecidable with respect to the system. Since an undecidable proposition and its nega- tion are each separately consistent with the base system, one can extend the old system to two mutually incompatible new ones by adding on the undecidable sentence or its negation as a new axiom. The classical example of this procedure is the generation of non-Euclidean geometries by adding the negation of the parallel postulate to the axioms of elementary geom- etry without the parallel postulate. The new systems so con- structed also have new undecidable sentences, diﬀerent from the originals, and the process of constructing new undecidable sen- tences and then new systems incorporating them or their nega- tions goes on ad inﬁnitum, like a branching tree which never ends. Let us take a closer look at the suggested analogy. Axiomatic theories of geometry obtained by replacing the parallel postulate of Euclidean geom- etry with an incompatible axiom are, like Euclidean geometry itself, both mathematically interesting and useful in applications. In particular, Eu- clidean plane geometry is applicable to smaller parts of the Earth’s surface, while the geometry of the Earth’s surface in the large is non-Euclidean. It should be noted that a useful alternative to Euclidean geometry is not ob- tained simply by replacing the parallel postulate with its negation, but by introducing a more speciﬁc axiom incompatible with the parallel postulate. In the case of elliptic geometry, the geometry of the surface of a sphere (and thus approximately the geometry of the surface of the Earth), the parallel postulate is replaced by the axiom that there is no line parallel to a given line containing a point outside that line. We can easily convince ourselves that the analogy with the parallel postulate does not apply in every case of undecidability. For example, PA has an axiom stating that for every n, n + 0= n. This axiom is not provable from the remaining axioms of PA, so we get a consistent theory by changing the axiom to “it is not the case that for every n, n + 0 = n.” By G¨odel’s completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic (explained in Chapter 7), the resulting theory has a model, that is, it is possible to specify a mathematical 52 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview structure in which there are e such that e + 0 is not equal to e, but which otherwise satisﬁes the axioms of PA. Unlike the case of non-Euclidean geometry, such a mathematical structure is not of any particular interest, either mathematically or from the point of view of applications. And of course the existence of such structures—there are very many of them—in no way aﬀects the observation that n + 0 is equal to n for every natural number n. We can also create an inﬁnite tree of consistent variants of PA by omit- ting the axiom that n + 0 = n and adding 0 + 0 = 0 or its negation to PA, then to each of the two resulting theories add either 1 + 0 = 1 or its negation, and so on. Thus we have one theory postulating that 0 + 0 equals 0 and 1 + 0 does not equal 1, one theory postulating that 0 + 0 does not equal 0 but 1 + 0 equals 1, and so on. No “postmodern condition” is created by this, but only an inﬁnite tree of very uninteresting theories. (In Chapter 7 it is explained how we know that every theory in the tree is consistent.) Thus, if we think that the incompleteness theorem opens up a spectrum of possible varieties of arithmetic, perhaps in the spirit of postmodernism, this must be because of some decisive diﬀerence between the trivial exam- ples given and the incompleteness exhibited by G¨odel’s theorem. What decisive diﬀerence might this be? The inﬁnite tree of theories described is uninteresting in part because all statements n + 0 = n are true of the natural numbers, and there is no apparent point in introducing theories that deny some or all of these statements. The resulting theories have no interesting application and are mathematically useless. Now consider the “branching” or “bifurcation” of PA based on G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. The undecidable statement G produced in G¨odel’s proof is equivalent in PA to “PA is consistent,” and we do indeed get two consistent extensions of PA by adding either “PA is consistent” or “PA is not consistent” as a new axiom to PA. Similarly, for the resulting theory T , we get two consistent extensions by adding either “T is consistent” or “T is inconsistent” as a new axiom, and so on. But as in the trivial example, since all of the statements “PA is consistent,” “T is consistent,” and so on are known to be true, there is no obvious reason why we should take any interest in theories obtained by adding “PA is inconsistent” or “T is inconsistent.” There is only one branch in this inﬁnite tree that is of any immediately apparent interest, the sequence of theories PA, PA1, PA2,... obtained by adding axioms “PA is consistent” to get PA1, “PA1 is consistent” to get PA2, and 2.8. A “Postmodern Condition”? 53 so on. The interest of this branch of the tree lies in the fact that it yields an extension of PA by an inﬁnite number of true statements not provable in PA. A comment is in order regarding a somewhat technical topic that will be considered further in Chapter 7. A mathematical structure in which the axioms of PA + not-“PA is consistent” are true is of a kind known as a nonstandard model of arithmetic: it contains, in addition to the “standard” natural number 0, 1, 2,... also “inﬁnite elements,” which are not natural numbers. Such structures do have mathematical interest, but this does not imply that we need to introduce theories with false arithmetical axioms in order to obtain such structures. How do we know that all of the consistency statements generated in the way described are true? It is sometimes thought that we must here invoke some form of intuitive insight of a dubious nature and claim that we can “see” that the theories are consistent. In fact, it is provable in perfectly ordinary mathematics that these consistency statements are true, as a consequence of PA being a sound theory, or in other words, a theory all of whose axioms are true. Thus, there is no special “seeing” involved, other than the kind of “seeing” the truth of arithmetical statements that is involved in mathematical proofs of arithmetical statements in general. Now, it is of course open to anybody to put this proof into question, and take a skeptical view of the theorem that PA, PA1, and the other theories are consistent. In this, the theorem is no diﬀerent from other mathematical theorems of a comparable degree of abstraction. For example, we might take a skeptical view of Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s last theorem, and argue that we don’t really know that the theorem is true on the basis of that proof. But such skepticism, whether or not it has anything to recommend it, is no more a matter of concern in connection with consistency proofs than it is in other mathematical contexts. Suppose we replace PA in the construction described with ZFC. It is then no longer the case that the consistency of all the theories in the tree is provable in perfectly ordinary mathematics. (The only known proofs of the consistency of ZFC use set-theoretical axioms that are not part of ordinary mathematics.) But we still don’t get any “branching” of arithmetic into diﬀerent directions. The theory obtained by adding “ZFC is inconsistent” to ZFC is indeed consistent, given that ZFC is consistent, but it is of no apparent mathematical interest and has no application. We can look for other examples, where we simply don’t know whether the undecidable statements that are introduced are true or not. Using the 54 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview Matiyasevich-Robinson-Davis-Putnam theorem (explained in Chapter 3) and results in set theory, we can in fact produce a set of statements of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . . , xn) = 0 has no solution” such that an inﬁnite tree of the kind described can be constructed, starting from PA, for which we just don’t know, for any of the statements involved, whether it is true or not. Again, this does not produce any “postmodern condition” in mathematics, since the theories obtained have no theoretical interest and no application. We just have a bunch of statements of the form indicated that we know to be unprovable in current mathematics, some of which may possibly turn out to be of some interest, and may or may not eventually be proved true or false. In brief, the point argued is that the incompleteness theorem has not led to any situation in which mathematics (and speciﬁcally arithmetic) branches oﬀ into an inﬁnity of incompatible directions, and there is no rea- son why it should. It is not commonly thought that our thinking about the place of humanity in the universe branches oﬀ into two diﬀerent direc- tions, one in which it is postulated that there is extra-terrestrial life within a thousand light years of our planet and one that postulates that there is not, and that these branches are further subdivided according to further postulates (consistent with our current knowledge) that might be made. The mere fact of incompleteness does not bring about any “branching oﬀ” in mathematics either. Kadvany, in the article quoted, comments not only on undecidable state- ments resulting from the proof of the incompleteness theorem, but on state- ments known to be undecidable in set theory on the basis of the work by G¨odel and Cohen and others. The continuum hypothesis has been men- tioned earlier as a prime example of a statement that is not only known to be undecidable in ZFC, but which is not decided by any set-theoretic principle that any signiﬁcant number of mathematicians regard as evident. Although this has not led to any branching oﬀ of set theory in diﬀerent directions, comparable to the development of non-Euclidean geometries, there is greater scope than in the case of arithmetic for an argument that such a branching might take place in the future. However, this incom- pleteness of set theory does not arise from the incompleteness phenomenon revealed by G¨odel’s theorem and will not be considered further in this book, except for some incidental remarks in Chapter 8. The ideas touched on here will be discussed further in Chapter 5, in connection with the skeptical views often associated with the second in- completeness theorem. 2.9. Mind vs. Computer 55 2.9 Mind vs. Computer An argument usually associated with the British philosopher J. R. Lucas fastens onto the fact that we know that the G¨odel sentence of (for example) PA is true, since we know that the theory is consistent, and concludes that the human mind surpasses any machine ([Lucas 61]): However complicated a machine we construct, it will, if it is a machine, correspond to a formal system, which in turn will be liable to the G¨odel procedure for ﬁnding a formula unprovable in that system. This formula the machine will be unable to produce as true, although a mind can see that it is true. This argument is invalid because based on the mistaken idea that “G¨odel’s theorem states that in any consistent system which is strong enough to pro- duce simple arithmetic there are formulas which cannot be proved in the system, but which we can see to be true.” The theorem states no such thing. As has been emphasized, in general we simply have no idea whether or not the G¨odel sentence of a system is true, even in those cases when it is in fact true. What we know is that the G¨odel sentence is true if and only if the system is consistent, and this much is provable in the system itself. When we know that the system is consistent, we also know that its G¨odel sentence is true, but in general we don’t know whether or not a formal system is consistent. If the human mind did have the ability to determine the consistency of any consistent formal system, this would cer- tainly mean that the human mind surpasses any computer, but there is no reason whatever to believe this to be the case. Given that we cannot conclude from the incompleteness theorem that the human mind surpasses any computer (or equivalently, any formal sys- tem) as far as arithmetic is concerned, we might attempt to draw the weaker conclusion that “no machine will be an adequate model of the mind” in the sense that no machine, although it may perhaps surpass the human mind in arithmetic, can ever be exactly equivalent to the human mind as far as arithmetical ability is concerned. But this too fails to follow from the incompleteness theorem. Let us assume (a large assumption) that there is such a thing as “human arithmetical ability,” and go on to suppose that a particular formal system S exactly embodies that ability. If we know S to be consistent, we will indeed have a conﬂict with the incompleteness theo- rem. But again what is missing is an argument for why we should know S to be consistent. Lucas [Lucas 61] here introduces the irrelevant reﬂection: 56 2. The Incompleteness Theorem: An Overview “The best we can say is that S is consistent if we are.” This is irrelevant because even if we know ourselves to be consistent, there is no reason why we should conclude from this that S is consistent, unless we already know that S codiﬁes human arithmetical ability—and why should we know this? Thus, G¨odel himself commented that nothing rules out the existence of a formal system S that exactly codiﬁes human arithmetical ability, although we could not recognize the axioms of S as evidently true. So let us weaken the conclusion further. What does follow from the in- completeness theorem is that we cannot actually specify any formal system S such that we know that S embodies those and only those arithmetical truths that we can convince ourselves are true. For given any system S for which we know that all its arithmetical theorems are true, we can produce an arithmetical statement—an arithmetization of “S is consistent”—which we also know to be true and which is not a theorem of S. Thus, we can- not specify any one formal system which exhausts all of our arithmetical knowledge. This last argument, which was put forward by G¨odel himself, seems to point to the inexhaustibility of our mathematical knowledge, which is one of the most striking consequences of the incompleteness theorem. It may be held that this in itself is an indication that human mathematical knowledge cannot be described in terms of mechanisms and computations. This argument will be considered in Chapter 6. 2.10 Some Later Developments As noted earlier, nothing in the proof of the incompleteness theorem tells us whether the statements undecidable in PA or ZFC include such natural mathematical statements as Goldbach’s conjecture. It would be of very great interest if any of the classical problems of number theory could be shown to be unsolvable in PA, but the methods and results described in this chapter give no clue as to whether this is the case. In recent decades, there has been considerable work seeking to establish, as a consequence of the incompleteness theorem, the undecidability in PA or in other theories of arithmetical statements which, although not expressing conjectures that have occurred to mathematicians in nonlogical contexts, are still closer to “ordinary mathematics” than G¨odel statements and con- sistency statements. The ﬁrst result of this kind was the Paris-Harrington theorem (1976), establishing the unprovability in PA of the arithmetization 2.10. Some Later Developments 57 of a certain combinatorial principle. This principle, although unprovable in PA, is in fact equivalent in PA to the statement that PA disproves no false Goldbach-like statement, and so is provable using ordinary mathematical reasoning. But we know that ZFC is also incomplete in its arithmetical component. A way of extending the arithmetical component of ZFC was suggested by G¨odel in the 1940s and has been extensively studied since. This approach consists in extending ZFC with axioms of inﬁnity, strong set-theoretical principles that imply arithmetical statements not provable in ZFC. Another line of development, dating from the 1960s, relates incom- pleteness to the theory of what is known as Kolmogorov complexity. This development is associated in particular with the work of the American mathematician Gregory Chaitin and has been presented by him in a large number of popular books and articles. Chapter 8 contains a discussion of complexity and its relevance to the incompleteness phenomenon in general, together with a presentation of the Paris-Harrington theorem and some comments about the use of axioms of inﬁnity to prove arithmetical statements otherwise unprovable in ZFC. 3 Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness 3.1 Strings of Symbols The axioms, theorems, and other sentences of a formal system, and also the proofs in the system, can all be taken to be strings of symbols. In mathematics and symbolic logic, various special mathematical symbols are used, but this is just a matter of convenience. Here, we may assume that the symbols we are concerned with are those that we ﬁnd on a standard keyboard and use in ordinary English text—lower and upper case letters, digits, parentheses, and so on—keeping in mind that an empty space, which on a standard keyboard is generated by pressing the space bar, is also a symbol. The deﬁnitions and arguments given in the following apply to any starting set of symbols, as long as there are only ﬁnitely many symbols in the set. By a string is meant any ﬁnite sequence of symbols. For example, the following are strings: Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. =)=)::)) in the nick of time watashi wa neko da yo 59 60 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness 9)#lklK0+==FDBk2++?% ∼(Ex)(y)(yEx iﬀ ∼yEy) 9023949999393020011109 As these examples illustrate, strings may or may not be meaningful words, sentences, or other kinds of expressions in some language or other. There is an ambiguity in speaking of “symbols” in connection with strings— should we say that the string “aaaa” contains one symbol (the letter a) or four symbols? We resolve the ambiguity by saying that “aaaa” contains four occurrences of a single symbol. The length of a string is the number of occurrences of symbols in the string. The examples given are all short strings, but in logic and mathematics we impose no limit on the length of strings, and reason freely about strings that contain more occurrences of symbols than there are grains of sand in the river Ganges. Thus, strings, in this connection, are mathematical objects, just like numbers, and need not have any actual physical representation. Indeed, from a mathematical point of view, strings and natural numbers are interchangeable, in the sense that we can let strings represent numbers or numbers represent strings. A representation of arbitrary strings using numbers, such as will be described in the next section, is what is usually called a G¨odel numbering. But ﬁrst let us take a closer look at the more familiar direction, the representation of natural numbers using certain strings. The strings of digits used in mathematics as well as in ordinary English and many other languages to denote natural numbers (nonnegative inte- gers) will be called numerical strings. Thus, the string “165” denotes the number one hundred and sixty-ﬁve, and “0” denotes the number zero. If we disallow initial zeros in strings containing more than one digit, every natural number is denoted by a unique corresponding numerical string. In everyday language, we are so used to this way of representing numbers (the decimal positional notation) that it may take an eﬀort to distinguish be- tween the number 165 and the string “165.” But even if we consider only the symbols used in English (and not, say, Chinese numerals) there are other common ways of representing the natural numbers as strings. One of them is through the use of counting words, as in “one hundred and sixty- ﬁve.” In order to extend this notation to cover all of the natural numbers, some new words are needed, and various systems exist. In the system of Landon Curt Noll, the number 3, 141, 592, 653, 589, 793, 238, 462, 643, 383 is named 3.2. Computable Enumerability and Decidability 61 three octillion, one hundred forty one septillion, ﬁve hundred ninety two sextillion, six hundred ﬁfty three quintillion, ﬁve hundred eighty nine quadrillion, seven hundred ninety three trillion, two hundred thirty eight billion, four hundred sixty two million, six hundred forty three thousand, three hundred eighty three. Another way of representing natural numbers as strings that is com- monly used in the theory and practice of computing is binary notation (base two positional notation). In binary notation, the above number be- comes 1010001001101010101000011111000000010001101110. Using strings to denote natural numbers is familiar to us because we have to use strings to denote numbers in order to write down numerical information and when adding and multiplying numbers on paper. The idea of giving arbitrary strings “names” that are natural numbers is less familiar from everyday contexts, but arises naturally in the context of logic and the theory of computability. It was claimed that not only the theorems and other sentences of a formal language, but also the proofs in a formal system can be taken to be strings of symbols. Since proofs are sequences of sentences, this means that we need to be able to represent such sequences too as strings. The easy way of doing this is to choose a symbol that does not occur in any sentence of the language, say £, and use it in strings to separate sentences. Thus for example, the sequence consisting of the sentences “aishiteru no,” “suki da yo,” “baka da yo” will be represented as the string aishiteru no£suki da yo£baka da yo. But what if any symbol can occur in a sentence? It is still possible to represent any sequence of strings as a string, but it is only in Chapter 8 that we will need to consider how to do this. 3.2 Computable Enumerability and Decidability Computably Enumerable Sets The set of numerical strings has two properties that are of particular in- terest in connection with the incompleteness theorem. The ﬁrst of these 62 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness properties is that there is a mechanical procedure for generating the numer- ical strings, or in other words, for producing and writing them down one after another. We simply ﬁrst write down the single-digit strings, then sys- tematically write down all two-digit strings (except that we don’t include strings beginning with 0), and so on. To fully specify the procedure we need to decide on the order in which strings of the same length are written down, and a natural choice, given our conventional alphabetical ordering of the symbols, is to generate strings of the same length in alphabetical order (in mathematics usually called lexicographic order ). In this way we obtain 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, . . . As it happens, this particular ordering of the numerical strings is very familiar to us, since it corresponds to the mathematical ordering of the numbers denoted by the strings. The reason for this is twofold. The al- phabetical ordering of the digits coincides with the mathematical ordering of the numbers they denote, and we use a positional system in denoting numbers by numerical strings. If we generate the usual names of num- bers in words using the same principle of “shorter before longer” combined with lexicographic ordering of strings of the same length, the listing will begin one, six, ten, two, ﬁve, four, nine, zero, eight, ﬁfty, forty, seven, sixty, three, eighty, eleven, ninety, thirty, twelve, twenty, ﬁfteen, seventy, sixteen, eighteen, fourteen, nineteen, thirteen, ﬁfty- one, ﬁfty-six, ﬁfty-two, forty-one,. . . We have described a mechanical procedure for generating numerical strings, such that every numerical string will, if the procedure is continued indeﬁnitely, eventually appear in the list of strings generated. The proce- dure is mechanical in the sense that it calls for no judgment, choice, or problem-solving, but only for the application of a set of explicit rules. To put it diﬀerently, it is a simple matter to program a computer to generate numerical strings according to these rules and print them out one after the other. We say that a set E of strings is computably enumerable if it is pos- sible to program a computer to compute and print out the members of E, as long as we disregard all limitations of time, energy, and memory. Thus, in this terminology, the set of numerical strings is computably enumerable. For future arguments, we need to be a bit more speciﬁc. When we speak of “programming a computer to compute and print out the members of 3.2. Computable Enumerability and Decidability 63 E,” do we allow repetitions in the output of the program, so that the same member of E may be printed more than once? In fact every inﬁnite set that can be computably enumerated with repetitions can also be computably enumerated without repetitions, and we therefore allow repetitions in the output of the computer, as long as every member of E eventually appears among the strings generated. A more subtle question is what happens if E is ﬁnite—does the computer halt when all members of E have been generated, or does the computation continue ad inﬁnitum, even though no new strings will appear in the output? For reasons that are not immediately apparent, in speaking of a computable enumeration of a ﬁnite set E, we will in fact allow that a computer programmed to compute and print out the members of E continues this activity forever, and thus either prints out at least one string inﬁnitely many times, or else just whirs silently away doing nothing after producing all of the strings in the set. The deﬁnition of “computably enumerable set” was formulated in terms of sets of strings, but we can also apply it to sets of natural numbers. A set of natural numbers is computably enumerable if and only if the set of corresponding numerical strings is computably enumerable. Similarly, the deﬁnition carries over to sets of any mathematical objects that can be represented by strings. For example, every positive rational number has a unique representation as a string m/n where m and n are numerical strings such that the corresponding natural numbers have no common di- visor greater than 1, which allows us to speak of computably enumerable sets of positive rational numbers. It was Alan Turing who, in 1936, introduced a theoretical model of a general-purpose digital computer with unlimited working memory (the universal Turing machine) and made it plausible that everything that can be mechanically computed can be computed by such a machine. Today, Turing computability is one of several equivalent deﬁnitions of computabil- ity used in logic and mathematics, and we are used to thinking of ordinary computers as physical realizations of the universal Turing machine, except that actual computers have limited memory. In a mathematical treatment of the theory of computability, the Turing machine or some other model of computation is used to give formal deﬁnitions of the basic concepts of the theory. In this book we will make do with informal deﬁnitions of these basic concepts, which still allow us to understand and appreciate several important results of the theory. All we need to know about the workings of a computer is that executing a program can be described as consisting in a series of steps, so that it is possible to carry out a certain number of 64 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness steps in a computation, do something else for a while, and then return to carry out the next step in the computation. As an example of the kind of informal reasoning that we can carry out on the basis of these deﬁnitions, we see that if A and B are two computably enumerable sets, then their union C, containing the strings belonging to A or B or both, is also computably enumerable. For in order to enumerate C we need only alternately carry out steps in enumerations of A and B, and deliver a member of A or B as output whenever it is generated. Computably Decidable Sets A second property of the set of numerical strings is that there is an algo- rithm that allows us to decide, given any string of symbols, whether or not it will ever appear in a computable enumeration of the set. An algorithm is a mechanical procedure, such as can be carried out by a computer, which always terminates, generally yielding some string as output. (An alterna- tive terminology is also used in the literature, in which an algorithm is a mechanical procedure that does not necessarily terminate.) The algorithm is simple in this case: we need only check that every symbol in the string is a digit, and that the string does not begin with a zero, unless it has length 1. We say that a set E of strings is computable or computably de- cidable, or just decidable for short, if it is possible to program a computer to decide, given any string s of symbols, whether or not s is in E. In other words, given s as input, the computer carries out some computation, and then outputs “yes” if s is in E, and “no” if s is not in E. (As in the case of computable enumerability, we can also apply this deﬁnition to sets of natural numbers.) A set that is not decidable is said to be (computably) undecidable. Here again, we need to take note of the fact that we are talking about what is mathematically possible, not about what is in any sense feasible. In particular, every ﬁnite set E of strings is decidable, since an algorithm for deciding whether a string s is in E can consist of simply going through a list of all strings in E, looking for s. A computer can be programmed to carry out this algorithm by including in the program a listing of all the strings in E. Of course if E contains, say, a quadrillion strings, this has nothing to do with what can in fact be done, and it may or may not be possible to actually program (in a diﬀerent way) a physical computer to decide whether a given string is in E. Statements in the following about 3.2. Computable Enumerability and Decidability 65 what we “can compute” or “can decide” must be understood to carry a similar qualiﬁcation. Like the words “complete” and “incomplete,” the words “decidable” and “undecidable” are used in logic in two diﬀerent senses. A sentence A is said to be decidable in a formal system S if either A or its negation is provable in S. Decidability in this sense is a property of sentences and is relative to some formal system. Decidability in the sense introduced here is not a property of sentences, but of sets—sets of strings, of numbers, or of other objects that can be represented as strings or numbers—and it is not relative to any formal system. There is nevertheless a connection between these two senses of “decidable,” in that we can use the fact that certain sets are not decidable to prove that certain formal theories have undecidable sentences. To present this result is the main point of this chapter. Mathematically Deﬁnable Sets To ask whether a set of strings is computably enumerable, or computably decidable, makes sense only if the set can be given a formal (mathematical) deﬁnition. For example, is the set of sentences in English decidable? Here, we need to specify just what is meant by a sentence in English. If we restrict ourselves to sentences that have been spoken or written, or will be spoken or written in the future, it is clear that there is a limit on their length, since it will never happen that a sentence containing billions of symbols is spoken or written. So, since every ﬁnite set of strings is decidable, does it follow that the set of English sentences of length smaller than a billion is decidable? No, for it is simply not determinate which strings belong to this supposed set, which means that no set has yet been speciﬁed. A natural language like English, as opposed to the formal languages studied in logic, is not deﬁned through mathematical rules, but through actual usage, and as soon as we consider what users of English accept as an English sentence, we ﬁnd variations of time and place, variations among diﬀerent speakers, cases of people changing their mind, and cases where nobody can tell whether a string is a sentence or not. This does not mean that the question whether the set of sentences in English is decidable is meaningless. But to make sense of it, we need to introduce a theoretical model of the English language in the form of a formal grammar that can reasonably be held to make explicit rules for constructing English sentences that agree with how the language is in fact used. This formal grammar will allow an inﬁnite number of strings as 66 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness English sentences, and it becomes a nontrivial question whether the set of sentences is decidable. In logic and mathematics, the sets of strings that we investigate are deﬁned at the outset in mathematical terms, for example, as the set of sen- tences derivable from certain axioms using certain formal rules of inference. The question whether the set is computably enumerable or decidable thus always makes good sense. A Gödel Numbering Let us ﬁrst observe that the procedure described for generating the numer- ical strings can be modiﬁed so as to generate all strings. We ﬁrst generate the strings consisting of only one symbol (there are only ﬁnitely many of these), and then systematically generate, in lexicographic order, the strings consisting of two symbols (again, there are only ﬁnitely many), and so on. Thus suppose our symbols are the symbols in positions 32–126 in the ASCII table. These symbols, in alphabetical order, are space, !, “, #, $, %, &, ‘, (, ), *, +, comma, -, period, /, the digits 0–9, :, ;, <, =, >, ?, @, the letters A–Z, [, \\, ], ˆ, , ‘, the letters a–z, |, }, ∼. In generating all strings we start by generating the 95 one-symbol strings, then the 95×95 = 9025 two- symbol strings in lexicographic order (the ﬁrst being the string consisting of two occurrences of space), and so on. This also gives us an example of a G¨odel numbering, a way of repre- senting arbitrary strings, not just numerical ones, by numbers. We simply associate every string with its position in the enumeration of all strings. Thus the 95 one-symbol strings are given G¨odel numbers 1–95, and the following 9025 two-symbol strings will have G¨odel numbers 96–9120. The number 0 is assigned to the empty string, like the empty set a convenient mathematical construct, which contains no symbols at all. This G¨odel numbering is only one of inﬁnitely many ways of representing arbitrary strings by numbers. It satisﬁes two essential conditions. First, given a string we can mechanically compute its G¨odel number, by simply generating strings and counting them until we come to the string whose G¨odel number we seek. Second, given a number, we can decide by a similar computation whether it is the G¨odel number of a string—which in this particular numbering is true of every number—and if so which one. As a consequence, a set of strings is computably enumerable or decidable if and only if the set of G¨odel numbers of strings in the set is computably enumerable or decidable. 3.3. Undecidable Sets 67 3.3 Undecidable Sets Two Basic Connections There are two basic relations between computable enumerability and com- putable decidability that are the key to many observations involving these concepts. The ﬁrst basic connection is the following: Every computably decidable set is computably enumerable. This is because we can always (in theory) program a computer to gen- erate the strings in a decidable set E by generating every string internally, but retaining and printing out a string only if a computation shows it to be in E, and discarding it if it is not in E. In practice, if a set is decidable, there are usually more simple and direct ways of generating its members. For example, to generate the numerical strings, we don’t systematically generate all strings and sift out those that are numerical, but instead systematically generate all strings from the re- stricted alphabet containing only the symbols 0–9, skipping strings with initial zeros, except for the one-symbol string consisting only of 0. But the general procedure described is always available, and it shows that every decidable set can be computably enumerated. The complement of a set E of strings is the set of all strings that are not in E. The second basic observation is that Aset E is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable. To see this we ﬁrst note that if E is computably decidable, so is the complement of E, so it follows from the ﬁrst basic fact that both E and its complement are computably enumerable. If E and its complement are both computably enumerable, a computer can decide whether a given string is in E as follows. First carry out one step in a computable enumeration of E and one step in a computable enumeration of the complement of E. If the string has not yet appeared in either set, carry out another step in both computations. Eventually the string will appear in either E or the complement of E, and the computer outputs “yes” or “no” accordingly. The Undecidability Theorem We can now state the starting point of the theory of computably enumer- able sets: 68 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness Undecidability theorem (Turing, Church). There are computably enumerable sets which are not computably decidable. Before considering proofs that such sets exist and examples of such sets, it is worthwhile to ponder their general characteristics. Suppose E is a computably enumerable set that is not decidable. There is then an algorithm for systematically generating all of the strings in the set. Thus if s is a member of E, it is possible, in theory at least, to show that s is a member of E, by generating members of E until s appears. (Computably enumerable sets have sometimes been called semi-decidable.) However, there is no mechanical procedure which, applied to an arbitrary string s, will always give information about whether or not s is in E. Thus, if s is not a member of E, this can only be shown, if at all, by special reasoning. In proving the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem using an undecidable computably enumerable set E, we will see that unless a formal system S incorrectly decides some statements of the form “k is in E,” there will be statements of the form “k is in E” that are undecidable in S. Turing’s Proof of the Undecidability Theorem Turing proved the undecidability theorem by proving the “recursive un- solvability of the halting problem.” Here we need to take note of some traditional terminology often used in the literature. “Recursively enumer- able” or “eﬀectively enumerable” are both synonyms for “computably enu- merable.” The term “recursively unsolvable problem” does not refer to a problem in the sense of an open question, but to a set of problems. A recursively unsolvable problem is given by a set E (of natural numbers, of strings, or of some other kind of mathematical objects representable as numbers or strings) that is not decidable. The set of problems of the form “is a in E?” is computably unsolvable in the sense that there is no me- chanical procedure that applied to any problem of this form will yield a correct answer (yes or no). To understand the connection between the undecidability theorem and the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, it is not necessary to study any proof of the undecidability theorem, but a presentation of Turing’s proof will be given here for the interested reader. Let us ﬁx a programming language—Basic, C, Java, or any other stan- dard language, since they are all equivalent from the point of view of com- putability theory. A reader who is not familiar with any programming language need only think of it as a language for expressing instructions on 3.3. Undecidable Sets 69 how to proceed in a mechanical step-by-step computation. The computa- tion may require some initial input strings to work with, and it may or may not eventually terminate, returning some output string. A program in the language is itself a string of symbols. The rules for writings programs are such that the set of programs is decidable, and so is the set of programs that expect one string as input, and when executed either deliver a string as output or else never terminate. Thus, there is a computable enumeration of these (inﬁnitely many) programs: P0, P1, P2, . . . We say that the number i is the index of the program Pi. Now let K be the set of i such that Pi terminates and outputs a value when given the (numerical string denoting the) index i of the program itself as input. This somewhat oddly deﬁned set K is in fact computably enumerable. For the veriﬁcation of this, all we need to know about the programs Pi is that their computations proceed in a step-by-step fashion so that the set of true statements of the form The computation carried out by Pi with input k terminates after at most n steps, where k and n are numerical strings, is decidable. This is so because given i, k, and n, we can ﬁrst generate the program Pi in the enumeration of programs, and then start Pi on its computation with input k, but allow it to proceed for at most n steps. Now to computably enumerate the elements of K, we just go through all strings of the indicated form, and whenever we encounter a true such statement with k = i, we add i to the listing of the elements of K. So K is computably enumerable, but it is not decidable. For suppose K is decidable. We can then deﬁne a procedure which given any input i ﬁrst checks whether i is in K. If not, we give 0 as output. If i is in K, so that Pi does terminate with i as input, we let Pi compute its result and then give as output that result with a further symbol added at the end. Since this deﬁnes a program P that given any string computes another string as output, P must be identical with Pm for some m. But P and Pm do not agree on m, so they are not identical. Hence, K is not decidable. Turing’s argument is what is known in logic as a diagonalization argu- ment. In its most basic form, the diagonalization argument goes as follows. 70 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness Given a relation R(a, b) between elements a and b in some set A, if we deﬁne the property P of elements in A to hold if and only if R(a, a) does not hold, this property P is not identical with the property Ra for any a, where Ra(b) is deﬁned to hold if and only if R(a, b) holds. Variations of this very simple argument have been used in set theory and logic since it was ﬁrst introduced in the late nineteenth century by the German mathemati- cian Georg Cantor, the creator of set theory. Some form of diagonalization argument lies at the basis of most proofs, or perhaps of every proof, of the undecidability theorem and of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem, when the incompleteness theorem is given a proof that implies the existence of undecidable Goldbach-like statements. (See Section 2.1 for a deﬁnition of the Goldbach-like statements.) Two further examples of eﬀectively enumerable but undecidable sets will be introduced, simple sets as deﬁned by Post and the set of solvable Diophantine equations. Post’s Simple Sets Emil Post, who did pioneering work in the theory of computably enumer- able sets, came up with a category of computably enumerable sets which are in a sense extremely undecidable. A simple set is a computably enumerable set A of natural numbers such that the complement of A, although inﬁnite, has no inﬁnite computably enumerable subset. Thus, although there are inﬁnitely many numbers not in A, it is not possible for any mechanical procedure to generate more than ﬁnitely many of them. The set K deﬁned in Turing’s proof is not simple, for we can easily construct inﬁnitely many programs that do not terminate for any input. That there are simple sets is not obvious. Post showed how to deﬁne a simple set using an enumeration of the computably enumerable sets. In Chapter 8, a speciﬁc example of a simple set, which was found some 20 years later, will be deﬁned, the set of compressible strings. Hilbert’s Tenth Problem and the MRDP Theorem Number ten on the list of 23 problems put forward by David Hilbert in the year 1900 was the problem of ﬁnding an algorithm for deciding whether or not a Diophantine equation (see Section 2.1) has any solution. In 1970 it was established, as a consequence of what is known as the Matiyasevich- Robinson-Davis-Putnam (MRDP) theorem, that there is no such algorithm. 3.3. Undecidable Sets 71 To simplify matters, we will restrict the solutions of Diophantine equa- tions to nonnegative integers. (It can be shown that the question whether a Diophantine equation has any solution in integers can always be reduced to the question whether another Diophantine equation has a solution in nonnegative integers.) Thus, a Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 is said to be solvable if it has a solution k1, . . ., kn in natural numbers. We ﬁrst note that the set of solvable Diophantine equations is com- putably enumerable. To see this, note that the set of all statements (true or false) of the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has the solution x1 = k1, . . ., xn = kn where k1, . . ., kn are numerical strings is decidable, and hence computably enumerable. So, in order to generate all solvable Diophantine equations, we need only generate all strings of this form, and for each string check whether D(x1, . . ., xn) does in fact evaluate to 0 when x1 = k1, . . ., xn = kn. If this is the case, we list D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 as a solvable Diophantine equation. Similarly, for any given Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn,y) = 0, the set ED of k for which there exists a solution of the equation with y = k is computably enumerable. This is so since we can generate the set of solvable equations of the form D(x1, . . ., xn,k) = 0, obtained by replacing the unknown y with the number k, and list k as a member of ED for every such equation found. A computably enumerable set that is equal to ED for some D is said to be Diophantine. The MRDP theorem states that every computably enumerable set of natural numbers is Diophantine. One consequence is that since there are computably enumerable sets that are not decidable, there cannot be any algorithm for deciding whether or not a given Diophantine equation has any solution. Thus, the set of solvable Diophantine equations is an example of a computably enumerable but not decidable set, and the set of unsolvable Diophantine equations is not computably enumerable. The MRDP theorem has another consequence, which depends on the fact that the theorem can be proved in elementary arithmetic, by a proof formalizable in PA. Given any Goldbach-like statement A, as informally deﬁned in Section 2.1 (and formally in the Appendix), we can construct a corresponding Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 such that it is provable in PA that A is true if and only if the equation has no solution. In particular, such an equation can be found for the statement “PA is consistent.” 72 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness 3.4 Computability and the First Incompleteness Theorem Formal Systems A formal system is determined by a formal language, a set of inference rules, and a set of axioms. The set of sentences of the language is assumed to be a decidable set of strings. The axioms (which are certain sentences in the language of the system) and the inference rules need to be deﬁned in such a way that the system satisﬁes the following: Basic property of formal systems. The set of theorems of a formal system is computably enumerable. For example, in the case of a ﬁrst-order theory, it is possible to choose the set of axioms (including “purely logical” axioms, which are axioms in every ﬁrst-order theory) to be decidable, and to have only one rule of in- ference, whereby B follows from A together with “if A then B.” A proof in such a system is a ﬁnite sequence of sentences A1, . . ., An where for each i, either Ai is an axiom or there are earlier sentences Aj and “if Aj then Ai” in the sequence. Thus, the set of proofs is also decidable, and as a consequence the basic property holds, since to computably enumerate the theorems of the system we need only go through all strings to check if they are proofs and for each string that is a proof output the last sen- tence in the sequence. In general, it is suﬃcient that the set of proofs is computably enumerable for the basic property to hold, since we need only systematically generate proofs and pick out their conclusions in order to generate the theorems. Conversely, if the basic property holds, we can al- ways deﬁne proofs in the system so as to make the set of proofs computably enumerable. The basic property implies that it is always possible to search for a proof of a given sentence A in a mechanical way, and if there is any such proof, it will eventually be found. If A is not a theorem of the system, the search will just go on forever. In practice, when proving theorems, we do not usually search mechanically, but are guided by more or less clear ideas about how to prove the theorem. In the ﬁeld of automatic theorem proving, one tries to program computers to search for proofs “intelligently,” rather than just by systematic brute force, although such automated “intelligent” searching for proofs is still mechanical in the sense that it follows a speciﬁable set of rules. When we look for proofs informally, we may or may not be following rules that computers can be programmed to follow, but we are not usually able to specify any such rules. 3.4. Computability and the First Incompleteness Theorem 73 A formal system is decidable if the set of theorems of the system is not only computably enumerable, but also decidable. A complete formal system is always decidable. For either it is inconsistent, in which case the set of theorems is identical with the set of sentences, or else we can decide whether a sentence A is a theorem by enumerating the theorems of the system until we come upon either A or not-A. Thus, for example, the elementary theory of the real numbers (see Section 2.3), which is complete, is also decidable. (This is not to say that there is any algorithm which can be used in practice to decide whether an arbitrary sentence in the language of the theory is provable.) There are also theories that are decidable without being complete. The First Incompleteness Theorem Suppose S is a formal system that contains enough arithmetic to be able to prove all true statements of the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has the solution x1 = k1, . . ., xn = kn. Not a great deal of arithmetic is needed to prove every true statement of this form—we only need to be able to carry out multiplication, addition, and subtraction of integers, and to handle the logic of =. Now consider the theorems of S of the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution. If S is consistent, every such theorem of S is true. For if the equation does have a solution, this is provable in S, by the assumption on S, so it cannot also be provable in S that the equation has no solution. So the set of all equations for which it is provable in S that they have no solution is a computably enumerable subset of the set of equations that do not have a solution. But since the latter set is not computably enumerable, it follows that there are inﬁnitely many equations D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 that have no solution, but for which this fact is not provable in S. And if we further assume that S is Σ-sound, and thus does not prove any false statements of the form “The Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution,” it follows that there are inﬁnitely many equations D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 for which it is undecidable in S whether or not they have any solution. We can make a stronger statement. The set A of all equations for which it is provable in S that they have no solution is a computably enu- merable subset of the set B of equations that do not have a solution. If 74 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness the set B\\A of elements in B that do not belong to A were computably enumerable, B would be the union of two computably enumerable sets and therefore itself computably enumerable. Thus, the set of true statements of the form “The Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solu- tion” that are not provable in S is not only inﬁnite, but is not computably enumerable. This version of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem based on computability theory shows that the use of (arithmetical formalizations of) self-referential sentences is not essential when proving incompleteness. Indeed, there is no assumption in the proof that S is capable of formalizing self-reference. It also shows that the content and structure of S, beyond encompassing some elementary arithmetic, is not relevant if we only want to establish incompleteness. In particular, whether S is a ﬁrst-order theory or uses what is called second-order logic makes no diﬀerence, as long as S satisﬁes the basic property of formal systems. The same argument can be carried through using any computably enu- merable but undecidable set E instead of the set of solvable Diophantine equations. What is not obvious is that all statements of the form “k is in E” can be formulated in the language of arithmetic for any computably enumerable E, and all true statements of this form can be proved on the basis of some basic principles of arithmetic. To make it clear that this is in fact the case, we need a formal speciﬁcation of some model of computa- tion (such as Turing machines), and we also need to use an arithmetization of the language of computation, similar to the arithmetization of syntax used in G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. Using the set of solvable Diophantine equations as E has the advantage that no arithme- tization of syntax is needed, and only simple arithmetical statements are involved. The version of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem obtained through this argument has the same strength as G¨odel’s original version: we need to assume that S is Σ-sound (does not prove any false Goldbach-like state- ment), which is equivalent to assuming that S does not prove any false statement of the form “The Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution.” For some computably enumerable but undecidable sets E, it is perfectly possible for a consistent system to decide all statements of the form “n is in E,” although inﬁnitely many statements will be decided incorrectly. In the special case of the set of unsolvable Diophantine equa- tions, however, no consistent system (incorporating a certain amount of arithmetic) settles every statement of the form “The Diophantine equation 3.4. Computability and the First Incompleteness Theorem 75 D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution,” since the undecidable Rosser sentence (see Section 2.7) is equivalent to such a statement. Suppose we choose E as a simple set in Post’s sense. Then S can prove only ﬁnitely many statements of the form “k is not in E,” although there are inﬁnitely many true such statements. We will consider this further in connection with Chaitin’s incompleteness theorem in Chapter 8. For a ﬁnal illustration of the power of the basic ideas of the theory of computability, we turn to another topic ﬁrst commented on by G¨odel. Essential Undecidability and Speeding Up Proofs Let us look at the above argument from a diﬀerent point of view. Given that S is Σ-sound, it follows that a Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution if and only if S proves the statement “The Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution.” The set of theorems of S therefore cannot be decidable, since otherwise there would be an algorithm for deciding whether or not a Diophantine equation has a solution—just check whether the corresponding statement is provable in S. It follows in particular that PA, and every Σ-sound theory that contains PA as a part, which we call an extension of PA, is undecidable. By a variant of this argument, it can be shown that in fact every consistent extension of PA is undecidable. We say that PA is essentially undecidable. To prove a theory T undecidable is another way of proving that it is incomplete, since, as has been noted, a complete formal system is decidable. Suppose T is essentially undecidable, and let A be a sentence undecidable in T . We can now observe (assuming T to incorporate the logic of “not” and “or”) that the set M of theorems of T ′ = T + A that are not theorems of T is not computably enumerable. For given any sentence B, the sentence “A or B” (which is a theorem of T ′) is a member of M if and only if “A or B” is not a theorem of T , which is to say if and only if B is not a theorem of T + not-A. So if M is eﬀectively enumerable, the set of non-theorems of T + not-A is eﬀectively enumerable, implying that T + not-A is decidable, which is inconsistent with our two assumptions that A is undecidable in T and that every consistent extension of T is undecidable. The argument in the preceding paragraph concerned the richness of the set of new theorems provable in T +A but not in T . Essential undecidability has a further consequence, concerning theorems of T + A that are also theorems of T , which although easily established is by no means obvious. 76 3. Computability, Formal Systems, and Incompleteness Suppose we extend PA by a statement A undecidable in PA to the theory PA ′. If we consider theorems of PA and how they can be proved in PA ′, is it necessarily the case that there is some theorem of PA which can be proved more eﬃciently in PA ′, in the sense that it has a shorter proof in PA ′ than any proof that can be found in PA? Here, by a shorter proof we mean one with a smaller G¨odel number. The answer is yes, and in fact there must be theorems of PA that have “much” shorter proofs in PA ′. For example, there is a theorem A of PA for which 10 1000 × p′ < p, a theorem A for which 2 p ′ < p, and so on, where p′ is the length of the shortest proof of A in PA ′ and p is the length of the shortest proof of A in PA. In fact, for any computable function f that takes natural numbers to natural numbers, there is a sentence A for which f (p′) < p. (G¨odel was the ﬁrst to state a result of this kind, in 1936.) To see this, suppose that on the contrary there is a computable f such that there is no theorem A of PA for which f (p ′) < p. Then for every A, if A is a theorem of PA ′ with a proof of length n, A is atheorem of PAif and only if A has a proof in PA of length smaller than f (n). This means that we have a procedure for eﬀectively enumerating those theorems of PA ′ that are not theorems of PA, which contradicts the essential undecidability of PA. 4 Incompleteness Everywhere 4.1 The Incompleteness Theorem Outside Mathematics The incompleteness theorem is a theorem about the consistency and com- pleteness of formal systems. As noted in the introductory chapter, “consis- tent,” “inconsistent,” “complete,” “incomplete,” and “system” are words used not only in a technical sense in logic, but in various senses in ordinary language, and so it is not surprising that the incompleteness theorem has been thought to have a great many applications outside mathematics. A few examples:Religious people claim that all answers are found in the Bible or in whatever text they use. That means the Bible is a complete system, so G¨odel seems to indicate it cannot be true. And the same may be said of any religion which claims, as they all do, a ﬁnal set of answers. • As G¨odel demonstrated, all consistent formal systems are incomplete, and all complete formal systems are inconsistent. The U.S. Consti- tution is a formal system, after a fashion. The Founders made the choice of incompleteness over inconsistency, and the Judicial Branch exists to close that gap of incompleteness. • G¨odel demonstrated that any axiomatic system must be either in- complete or inconsistent, and inasmuch as Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism claims to be a system of axioms and propositions, one of those two conditions must apply. 77 78 4. Incompleteness Everywhere It will be noted that all of these misstate the incompleteness theorem by leaving out the essential condition that the system must be capable of formalizing a certain amount of arithmetic. There are many complete and consistent formal systems that do not satisfy this condition. If we remem- ber to include the condition, supposed applications of the incompleteness theorem such as those illustrated will less readily suggest themselves, since neither the Bible, nor the constitution of the United States, nor again the philosophy of Ayn Rand is naturally thought of as a source of arithmetical theorems. The incompleteness theorem is a mathematical theorem, dealing with formal systems such as the axiomatic theory PA of arithmetic and ax- iomatic set theory ZFC. Formal systems are characterized by a formal language, a set of axioms in that language, and a set of formal inference rules which together with the axioms determine the set of theorems of the system. The Bible is not a formal system. To spell this out: it has no formal language, but is a collection of texts in ordinary language, whether Latin, English, Japanese, Swahili, Greek, or some other language. It has no axioms, no rules of inference, and no theorems. Whether something follows from what is said in the Bible is not a mathematical question, but a question of judgment, interpretation, belief, opinion. Similarly for the Constitution and the philosophy of Ayn Rand. Deciding what does or does not follow from these texts is not a task for mathematicians or computers, but for theologians, believers, the Supreme Court, and just plain readers, who must often decide for themselves how to interpret the text and have no formal rules of inference to fall back on. Thus, we need only ask the question “is the Bible (the Constitution, etc.) a formal system?” for the answer to be obvious. Of course it’s not a formal system. It’s nothing like a formal system. To be sure, if we set aside the mathematical notion of a formal system and use the words “formal” and “system” in an everyday sense, it can be said that the Constitution is a formal system “after a fashion.” That is to say, from the point of view of ordinary language, the Constitution contains lots of formal language, and it looks rather systematic. But nobody would seriously claim that there is any such thing as the formally deﬁned language, the axioms, and the rules of inference of the Constitution. So the incompleteness theorem does not apply to the Constitution, the Bible, the philosophy of Ayn Rand, and so on. Without pretending that these various systems of thought, legislation, philosophy, and so on constitute formal systems, we could apply to them 4.1. The Incompleteness Theorem Outside Mathematics 79 analogues of the formal notions of consistency and completeness. For the Bible to be complete in such a sense, analogous to that used in logic, would mean that every statement that makes sense in the context of Bible reading could be reasonably held to be decided by the Bible, in the sense that either that statement or its negation can be held to be explicitly or implicitly asserted in the Bible. If we raise the question whether the Bible is complete in this sense, the answer is again pretty obvious: it is not. For example, it makes good sense in the context of Bible reading to ask whether Moses sneezed on his ﬁfth birthday. No information on this point can be found in the Bible. Hence, the Bible is incomplete. Similarly, the Constitution is incomplete, since it does not tell us whether or not wearing a polka- dot suit is allowed in Congress. Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism is incomplete, since we cannot derive from it whether or not there is life on Mars, even though it makes sense in the context of Objectivism to ask whether there is life on Mars. We don’t need G¨odel to tell us that these “systems” are in this sense incomplete. Trivially, any doctrine, theory, or canon is incomplete in this analogical sense. Such trivial observations are presumably not at issue in the comments quoted. But there is no more substantial or interesting use to be made of the incompleteness theorem in discussing the Bible, the Constitution, Objectivism, etc. Similar remarks apply to the following reﬂections by John Edwards in the electronic magazine Ceteris Paribus: We can view rules for living, whether they are cultural mores of the sort encoded in maxims, or laws, principles, and policies meant to dictate acceptable actions and procedures, as axioms in a logical system. Candidate actions can be thought of as propositions. A proposition is proved if the action it corre- sponds to can be shown to be allowed or legal or admissible within the system of rules; it is disproved if it can be shown to be forbidden, illegal, or inadmissible. In the light of G¨odel’s theorem, does it not seem likely that any system of laws must be either inconsistent or incomplete? To say that we “can view” rules for living and so on as axioms in a logical system is unexceptionable since anything, broadly speaking, can be viewed as anything else. Furthermore, in the case of viewing a lot of things as “systems” with “axioms” and “theorems,” it is demonstrably the case that many people ﬁnd it natural and satisfying to view things this way. It is a 80 4. Incompleteness Everywhere diﬀerent question whether any conclusions can be drawn, or any substantial claims supported, on the basis of such analogies and metaphors. In the quoted passage, the suggested conclusion is that a system of laws must be “inconsistent or incomplete.” Given the accompanying explanation of what “inconsistent” and “incomplete” mean here, it is an easy observation that all systems of laws, rules of living, and so on, are both inconsistent and incomplete and will remain so. In other words, in the case of legal systems, there will always be actions and procedures about which the law has nothing to say, and there will always be actions and procedures on which conﬂicting legal viewpoints can be brought to bear. Hence the need for courts and legal decisions. References to G¨odel’s theorem can only add a rhetorical ﬂourish to this simple observation. 4.2 “Human Thought” and the Incompleteness Theorem A prominent example of a “system” to which the incompleteness theorem is sometimes thought to be applicable is “human thought,” also known as “the human mind,” “the human brain,” or “the human intellect.” Here the term “human thought” will be used. The same general comments apply as in the case of supposed applications of the theorem to the Bible, the Constitution, the philosophy of Ayn Rand—there is no such thing as the formally deﬁned language, the axioms, and the rules of inference of “human thought,” and so it makes no sense to speak of applying the incompleteness theorem to “human thought.” There are however special factors that inﬂuence this particular invocation of the incompleteness theorem and may seem to lend the view that the incompleteness theorem applies to “human thought” a certain appeal. One formulation of such a view is the following: Insofar as humans attempt to be logical, their thoughts form a formal system and are necessarily bound by G¨odel’s theorem. Here by “attempt to be logical” one could perhaps mean “try to argue in such a way that all conclusions reached are formal logical consequences of a speciﬁed set of basic assumptions stated in a formal language.” Within certain narrowly delimited areas of thought, this description is indeed appli- cable. For example, in attempting to factor large numbers, the conclusions reached, of the form “the natural number n has the factor m,” are intended to be logical consequences of some basic arithmetical principles. This does not mean, however, that one is restricted to applying logical rules starting 4.2. “Human Thought” and the Incompleteness Theorem 81 from those basic principles in arriving at the conclusion. On the contrary, any mathematical methods may be used, and in the case of factorization, there would be nothing wrong with using divination in tea leaves if this turned out to be useful, since it can be checked whether a claim of the form “the natural number n has the factor m” is true or not (and thus whether it is a logical consequence of basic principles). On a stricter inter- pretation, “attempting to be logical” might consist in the actual application by hand of certain speciﬁc formal rules of reasoning, as when we carry out long division on paper, and then indeed it may be reasonable to say that our thinking is closely associated with a formal system. But these are not typical intellectual activities. If by “attempting to be logical” one means only, as in the everyday meaning of “logical,” attempting to make sense, to be consistent, not jump to conclusions, and so on, we can’t point to any formal systems that have any particular relevance to our thinking. Formal systems are studied and applied in mathematical contexts and in program- ming computers, not in political debates, in legal arguments, in formal or informal discussions about sports, science, the news, or the weather, in problem solving in everyday life, or in the laboratory. And even when we strive to be as mindlessly computational as we can, to say that “our thoughts form a formal system” is metaphorical at best. A line of thought that is often put forward in this connection is the fol- lowing. Let us accept that the incompleteness theorem can only be sensibly applied when we are talking about proving mathematical statements, and not in the context of Bible reading, philosophical or political discussion, and so on. But human beings do prove mathematical, and in particular arithmetical, statements. If we say that “human thought,” when it comes to proving arithmetical statements, is not bound by the incompleteness theorem, are we then not obliged to hold that there is something essen- tially noncomputable about human mathematical thinking which allows it to transcend the limitations of computers and formal systems, and per- haps even some irreducibly spiritual, nonmaterial component of the human mind? Such a conclusion is as welcome to many as it is unwelcome to others, and this tends to inﬂuence how people view attempts to apply the incompleteness theorem to human thought. The view here to be argued is the following. It doesn’t matter, when we talk about the incompleteness theorem and its applicability to human thought, whether people are similar to Lieutenant Commander Data of Star Trek fame, with “positronic brains” whirring away in their heads, in- ﬂuenced from time to time by their “emotion chips,” or are on the contrary 82 4. Incompleteness Everywhere irreducibly spiritual creatures transcending all mechanisms. The basic assumption made in disputes over whether or not human thought is constrained by the incompleteness theorem is that we can sensi- bly speak about “what the human mind can prove” in arithmetic. Assum- ing this, we may ask whether the set M of all “humanly provable” arith- metical sentences is computably enumerable. If it is, “the human mind” is subject to G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, and there are arithmetical statements that are not “humanly decidable” (given that “human thought” is consistent). If M is not computably enumerable, human thought sur- passes the powers of any formal system and is in this sense not constrained by the incompleteness theorem. To ask whether or not M is computably enumerable is, given this assumption, to pose a challenging and highly sig- niﬁcant problem, a solution to which would be bound to be enormously interesting and illuminating. But is there such a set M of the “humanly provable” arithmetical state- ments? This assumption is implausible on the face of it and has very little to support it. Actual human minds are of course constrained by many factors, such as the limited amount of time and energy at their disposal, so in considering what is “theoretically possible” or “possible in principle” for “the human mind” to prove, some theory or principle of the workings of “the human mind” is presupposed, one that allows us to speak in a theoret- ical way of the “humanly provable” arithmetical statements. What theory or set of principles this might be is unclear, and the fact of the variability and malleability of “the human mind” makes it highly unlikely that any such theory is to be had. Let us consider the question what “the human mind” has proved. Some human minds reject inﬁnitistic set theory as meaningless, whereas others ﬁnd it highly convincing and intuitive, with a corresponding sharp disagree- ment over whether or not certain consistency statements have been proved or made plausible. The question what “the human mind can prove” pre- supposes an agreement on what is or is not a proof. Lacking any theoretical characterization of all possible proofs, and even any general agreement on what existing arguments are proofs, we can only ask what “the human mind can prove” using certain formally speciﬁed methods of reasoning, in which case the human mind becomes irrelevant, and the question is one about what is provable in certain formal systems. As for malleability, Errett Bishop, who supported and worked in what is known as constructive mathematics, spoke of “the inevitable day when constructive mathematics will be the accepted norm.” From what we know 4.3. Generalized Gödel Sentences 83 about the human mind, it is perfectly conceivable that such an event could take place. Indeed, we know nothing to rule out the possibility that the accepted mathematical norm will in the future be such that even Bishop’s constructive mathematics is regarded as partly unjustiﬁable. It is equally conceivable that people can convince themselves, in one way or another, of the acceptability of extremely nonconstructive principles that are today not considered evident by anybody. In this sense, then, there may be no limit at all on the “capacity of the human mind” for proving theorems, but of course there is nothing to exclude the possibility that false statements will be regarded as proved because principles that are not in fact arithmetically sound will come to be regarded as evident. The question of the actual or potential reach of the human mind when it comes to proving theorems in arithmetic is not like the question how high it is possible for humans to jump, or how many hot dogs a human can eat in ﬁve minutes, or how many decimals of π it is possible for a human to memorize, or how far into space humanity can travel. It is more like the question how many hot dogs a human can eat in ﬁve minutes without making a totally disgusting spectacle of himself, a question that will be answered diﬀerently at diﬀerent times, in diﬀerent societies, by diﬀerent people. We simply don’t have the necessary tools to be able to sensibly pose large theoretical questions about what can be proved by “the human mind.” This point will be considered again in Chapter 6, in connection with G¨odelian arguments in the philosophy of mind. There is yet another approach to the application of the incomplete- ness theorem to human thought, which does not seek undecidable state- ments either in ordinary informal reasoning or in mathematics, but sug- gests that G¨odel’s proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem can be carried through in nonmathematical contexts. This suggestion will be considered next. 4.3 Generalized Gödel Sentences As mentioned in Chapter 2, the technique of introducing provable ﬁxpoints that G¨odel invented has been used since in very many arguments in logic, not just in the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. An example follows. The basic property of a formal system, as emphasized in Section 3.4, is 84 4. Incompleteness Everywhere that its set of theorems is computably enumerable. If we no longer require this property, but retain the formal language, the set of axioms, and the rules of inference, we get the concept of a formal theory in a wider sense, also studied in logic. A theory in this generalized sense need not be relevant to mathematical knowledge, since we may not have any method for deciding whether something is a proof in the theory or not, but the concept is very useful in logical studies. Using this more liberal notion of “theory,” we can deﬁne T as the theory obtained by adding every true statement of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution” to PA as an axiom. The set of G¨odel numbers of true statements of this form can be deﬁned in the language of arithmetic, so using the ﬁxpoint construction we can formulate an arithmetical statement A for which it is provable in PA that A is true if and only if it is not provable in T . (This A will not be a Goldbach-like statement.) If A is false, then it is provable in T , which is impossible since all axioms of T are true. So A is in fact true but unprovable in T . In this way, the ﬁxpoint construction used in G¨odel’s proof can be extended to show that many theories that do not constitute formal systems are still incomplete. But suppose we add every true arithmetical sentence as an axiom to PA. The resulting theory T (known as “true arithmetic”) is obviously complete, so where does the argument break down in this case? It breaks down because we can no longer form a “G¨odel sentence” for T , since (as this very argument shows) the property of being the G¨odel number of a true arithmetical sentence cannot be deﬁned in the language of arithmetic. Nonmathematical So why not, instead of seeking to apply the incompleteness theorem to nonmathematical systems, just mimic G¨odel’s proof of the theorem by for- mulating a “G¨odel sentence” for such systems? Thus, we might come up with the following: • The truth of this sentence cannot be established on the basis of the Bible. • The truth of this sentence cannot be inferred from anything in the Constitution. • This sentence cannot be shown to be true on the basis of Ayn Rand’s philosophy. 4.3. Generalized Gödel Sentences 85 Before considering these dubious statements, we need to dispose of a particular objection that is often raised against them, regarding the use of the phrase “this sentence” to denote a sentence in which the phrase occurs. Such self-reference has been thought to be suspect for various reasons. In particular, the charge of leading to an inﬁnite regress when one attempts to understand the statement has been leveled against it. Such a charge makes good sense if one takes “this” to refer to what is traditionally called a “proposition” in philosophy, the content of a meaningful sentence. But in the above statements, as in the corresponding construction in the original G¨odel sentence, “this sentence” refers to a syntactic object, a sequence of symbols, and there is no inﬁnite regress involved in establishing the reference of the phrase. As in the case of the G¨odel sentence, we can make this fact apparent by eliminating the phrase “this sentence” in favor of the use of syntactical operations, such as substitution or “quining” (see Section 2.7), but we can also simply replace the ﬁrst sentence with The truth of the sentence P cannot be established on the basis of the Bible together with the explicit deﬁnition P = “The truth of the sentence P cannot be established on the basis of the Bible.” This explicit deﬁnition is as unproblematic as any in logic or mathe- matics, since we are simply introducing a symbol to denote a particular string of symbols. (In particular, the deﬁnition of P does not presuppose that the string of symbols on the right means anything.) In the following, the shorter version of self-referential sentences, containing “this sentence,” will be used. Now, in considering the three proposed “G¨odel sentences,” one’s ﬁrst impulse may be to regard them as unproblematically true, but not as pre- senting any inadequacy of either the Bible, the Constitution, or Ayn Rand’s philosophy. After all, it is by no means obvious that the statements even make sense in the context of Bible studies, etc. The G¨odel sentence for PA is in a diﬀerent case, since that sentence is itself an arithmetical sentence, and the inability of PA to settle it indicates a gap in the mathematical power of PA. That the Constitution (let us suppose) does not suﬃce to establish the truth of “The truth of this sentence cannot be inferred from 86 4. Incompleteness Everywhere anything in the Constitution” indicates no gap whatsoever in the Consti- tution, which after all was not designed as an instrument for the discussion of logical puzzles. However, the three statements are not as unproblematic as they may seem, since we might as well go on to formulate a more far-reaching “G¨odel sentence” of this kind: This sentence cannot be shown to be true using any kind of sound reasoning. If this sentence is false, it can be shown to be true using sound reasoning, but sound reasoning cannot establish the truth of a false sentence. So sound reasoning leads to the conclusion that the sentence is true—but then it is false. Perhaps we should describe it, rather, as meaningless? But then, surely, it cannot be shown to be true using any kind of sound reasoning, so. . . . A popular variant of this argument seeks to establish the existence of a “G¨odel sentence” for any particular person, one that can unproblematically be held to be true by everybody except that person: for example, John will never be able to convince himself of the truth of this sentence. And of course, in the version using “cannot be shown to be true,” we are approaching the classical paradox of the Liar, which leads to the conclusion that the Liar sentence This sentence is false is true if and only if it is false. The many arguments and ideas surrounding the Liar sentence and the various “G¨odel sentences” formulated above will not be discussed in this book. The following observations are however relevant. The incomplete- ness theorem is a mathematical theorem precisely because the relevant notions of truth and provability are mathematically deﬁnable. Nonmath- ematical “G¨odel sentences” and Liar sentences give rise to prolonged (or endless) discussions of just what is meant by a proof, by a true statement, by sound reasoning, by showing something to be true, by convincing oneself of something, by believing something, by a meaningful statement, and so on. In spite of the similarities in form between these other sentences and 4.4. Incompleteness and the TOE 87 the ﬁxpoints of arithmetically (or more generally, mathematically) deﬁn- able properties of sentences in a formal language, we are again not dealing with any application of the incompleteness theorem or its proof, but with considerations or conundrums inspired by the incompleteness theorem. It is an open question whether the pleasant confusion that statements like “John will never accept this statement as true” tend to create in people’s minds has any theoretical or philosophical signiﬁcance. 4.4 Incompleteness and the TOE The TOE is the hypothetical Theory of Everything, which is sometimes thought to be an ideal or Holy Grail of theoretical physics. The incom- pleteness theorem has been invoked in support of the view that there is no such theory of everything to be had, for example, by eminent physicists Freeman Dyson and Stephen Hawking. In a book review in the New York Review of Books, Dyson writes: Another reason why I believe science to be inexhaustible is G¨odel’s theorem. The mathematician Kurt G¨odel discovered and proved the theorem in 1931. The theorem says that given any ﬁnite set of rules for doing mathematics, there are undecid- able statements, mathematical statements that cannot either be proved or disproved by using these rules. G¨odel gave examples of undecidable statements that cannot be proved true or false using the normal rules of logic and arithmetic. His theorem im- plies that pure mathematics is inexhaustible. No matter how many problems we solve, there will always be other problems that cannot be solved within the existing rules. Now I claim that because of G¨odel’s theorem, physics is inexhaustible too. The laws of physics are a ﬁnite set of rules, and include the rules for doing mathematics, so that G¨odel’s theorem applies to them. The theorem implies that even within the domain of the basic equations of physics, our knowledge will always be incomplete. It seems reasonable to assume that a formalization of theoretical physics, if such a theory can be produced, would be subject to the incompleteness theorem by incorporating an arithmetical component. However, as em- phasized in Section 2.3, G¨odel’s theorem only tells us that there is an 88 4. Incompleteness Everywhere incompleteness in the arithmetical component of the theory. The basic equations of physics, whatever they may be, cannot indeed decide every arithmetical statement, but whether or not they are complete considered as a description of the physical world, and what completeness might mean in such a case, is not something that the incompleteness theorem tells us anything about. 1 Another invocation of incompleteness goes further: Not to mention there are an inﬁnite number of other attributes of the world which are simply not quantiﬁable or computable, such as beauty and ugliness, happiness and misery, intuition and inspiration, compassion and love etc. These are completely outside the grasp of any mathematical Theory of Everything. Since scientiﬁc theories are built upon mathematical systems, incompleteness must be inherited in all our scientiﬁc knowledge as well. The incompleteness theorem reveals that no matter what progress is made in our science, science can never in prin- ciple completely disclose Nature. Here the connection with the actual content of the incompleteness the- orem is tenuous in the extreme: “Since scientiﬁc theories are built upon mathematical system, incompleteness must be inherited in all our scientiﬁc knowledge as well.” This doesn’t follow, since nothing in the incomplete- ness theorem excludes the possibility of our producing a complete theory of stars, ghosts, and cats all rolled into one, as long as what we say about stars, ghosts, and cats cannot be interpreted as statements about the natu- ral numbers. That science cannot be expected to disclose to us everything about beauty and ugliness, intuition and inspiration, and so on, is a rea- sonable view which neither needs nor is supported by G¨odel’s theorem. Stephen Hawking, in a talk entitled “G¨odel and the End of Physics,” also mentions G¨odel’s theorem: What is the relation between G¨odel’s theorem, and whether we can formulate the theory of the universe, in terms of a ﬁnite number of principles? One connection is obvious. According to the positivist philosophy of science, a physical theory is a math- ematical model. So if there are mathematical results that can- not be proved, there are physical problems that cannot be pre- 1Dyson conceded this point in a gracious response to similar remarks made by Solomon Feferman in a letter to the New York Review of Books (July 15, 2004). 4.4. Incompleteness and the TOE 89 dicted. One example might be the Goldbach conjecture. Given an even number of wood blocks, can you always divide them into two piles, each of which cannot be arranged in a rectangle? That is, it contains a prime number of blocks. Although this is incompleteness of sorts, it is not the kind of unpredictability I mean. Given a speciﬁc number of blocks, one can determine with a ﬁnite number of trials, whether they can be divided into two primes. But I think that quantum theory and gravity to- gether introduce a new element into the discussion, one that wasn’t present with classical Newtonian theory. In the stan- dard positivist approach to the philosophy of science, physical theories live rent-free in a Platonic heaven of ideal mathemat- ical models. That is, a model can be arbitrarily detailed and can contain an arbitrary amount of information, without af- fecting the universes they describe. But we are not angels who view the universe from the outside. Instead, we and our mod- els are both part of the universe we are describing. Thus, a physical theory is self-referencing, like in G¨odel’s theorem. One might therefore expect it to be either inconsistent, or incom- plete. The theories we have so far, are both inconsistent, and incomplete. Here the upshot is that physical theory is “self-referencing,” apparently in the sense that physical theories are “part of the universe” and that one might therefore expect them to be inconsistent or incomplete, considering that G¨odel proved his ﬁrst incompleteness theorem using a self-referential statement. Again, the relevance of the incompleteness theorem is here at most a matter of inspiration or metaphor. But Hawking also touches on another subject, the relevance of arithmetic to predictions about the outcome of physical experiments. Given 104, 729 wooden blocks, will we succeed in an attempt to arrange them into a rectangle? A computation shows 104, 729 to be a prime, so we conclude that no such attempt will succeed. Or, to take a somewhat more realistic example, consider the 15- puzzle, the still-popular sliding square puzzle that Sam Lloyd introduced in 1873, which has long been a favorite among AI researchers when testing heuristic search algorithms. Lloyd oﬀered a $1,000 reward for the solution of the “15-14 problem,” the problem of rearranging the squares so that only the last two squares were out of place. He well knew that his money was not at risk, since a combinatorial argument shows that the problem has no 90 4. Incompleteness Everywhere solution. Thus, he could set people to work on the problem and conﬁdently predict, on the basis of arithmetical reasoning, the eventual outcome (their giving up). Do such examples show that arithmetical incompleteness can entail an incompleteness in our description of the physical world? Not really. Sup- pose the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution, but this fact is not provable in our mathematics. We then have no basis for a predic- tion of the outcome of any physical experiment describable as “searching for a solution of the equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0.” (Such an experiment might consist in people rearranging wooden blocks or doing pen-and-paper calculations, or it might consist in having a computer execute a program.) This does not, however, indicate any incompleteness in our description of the physical systems involved. Our predictions of the outcome of physi- cal experiments using arithmetic are based on the premise that arithmetic provides a good model for the behavior of certain actual physical systems with regard to certain observable properties (which in particular implies that physical objects like blocks of wood have a certain stability over time, that there are no macroscopic tunneling eﬀects that render arithmetic in- applicable, that eggs do not spontaneously come into existence in baskets, and so on). The relevant description of the physical world amounts to the assumption that this premise is correct. The role of the arithmetical statement is as a premise in the application of this description to arrive at conclusions about physical systems. 4.5 Theological Applications G¨odel sometimes described himself as a theist and believed in the possibility of a “rational theology,” although he did not belong to any church. In [Wang 87] he is quoted as remarking that “I believe that there is much more reason in religion, though not in the churches, that one commonly believes.” It should not be supposed that G¨odel’s theism agreed with that expressed in established theistic religions. Theistic religions usually involve a God or several gods assumed to stand in a relationship to human beings that makes it meaningful to pray to the God(s), to thank the God(s), to obey the God(s), and more generally to communicate with the God(s). G¨odel’s “rational theology” was not concerned with such matters. Among his unpublished papers was a version of St. Anselm’s ontological proof of the existence of God. More precisely, the conclusion of the argument is that 4.5. Theological Applications 91 there is a God-like individual, where x is deﬁned to be God-like if every essential property of x is positive and x has every positive property as an essential property. As this explanation of “God-like” should make clear, G¨odel’s idea of a rational theology was not of an evangelical character, and Oskar Morgenstern relates ([Dawson 97, p. 237]) that he hesitated to publish the proof “for fear that a belief in God might be ascribed to him, whereas, he said, it was undertaken as a purely logical investigation, to demonstrate that such a proof could be carried out on the basis of accepted principles of formal logic.” Although G¨odel was thus not at all averse to theological reasoning, he did not attempt to draw any theological conclusions from the incomplete- ness theorem. However, others have invoked the incompleteness theorem in theological discussions. Bibliography of Christianity and Mathematics, ﬁrst edition 1983, lists 13 theological articles invoking G¨odel’s theorem. Here are some quotations from the abstracts of these articles: Nonstandard models and G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem point the way to God’s freedom to change both the structure of know- ing and the objects known. Uses G¨odel’s theorem to indicate that physicists will never be able to formulate a theory of physical reality that is ﬁnal. Stresses the importance of G¨odel’s theorems of incompleteness toward developing a proper perspective of the human mind as more than just a logic machine. ...theologians can be comforted in their failure to systematize revealed truth because mathematicians cannot grasp all math- ematical truths in their systems, either. If mathematics were an arbitrary creation of men’s minds, we can still hold to eternal mathematical truth by appealing to G¨odel’s incompleteness result to guarantee truths that can be discovered only by the use of reason and not by the mechanical manipulation of ﬁxed rules—truths which imply the existence of God. It is argued by analogy from G¨odel’s theorem that the method- ologies, tactics, and presuppositions of science cannot be based entirely upon science; in order to decide on their validity, re- sources from outside science must be used. 92 4. Incompleteness Everywhere As can be seen from these quotations, appeals to the incompleteness theorem in theological contexts are sometimes invocations of G¨odelian ar- guments in the philosophy of mind, which will be considered in Chapter 6, and sometimes follow the same line of thought as the arguments considered in Section 4.4 in connection with “theories of everything.” But there are also some more speciﬁcally theological appeals to the theorem. These are sometimes baﬄing: For thousands of years people equated consistency with deter- minism, holding that a logically consistent sequence of proposi- tions could have only one outcome. This feeling lies behind the notion that God knows and controls everything. Kurt G¨odel, working on a question asked by David Hilbert, showed that consistency does not always mean determinism. It is diﬃcult to know what to make of the idea that “a logically consis- tent sequence of propositions can have only one outcome” or of its relation to negation completeness. Other theological invocations of G¨odel are more easily made sense of. The following reﬂections by Daniel Graves are taken from an essay on the “Revolution against evolution” website: G¨odel showed that “it is impossible to establish the internal logical consistency of a very large class of deductive systems— elementary arithmetic, for example—unless one adopts princi- ples of reasoning so complex that their internal consistency is as open to doubt as that of the systems themselves.” (Here the author is quoting [Nagel and Newman 59]). In short, we can have no certitude that our most cherished systems of math are free from internal contradiction. Take note! He did not prove a contradictory statement, that= non-A, (the kind of thinking that occurs in many East- ern religions). Instead, he showed that no system can decide between a certain A and non-A, even where A is known to be true. Any ﬁnite system with suﬃcient power to support a full number theory cannot be self-contained. Judeo-Christianity has long held that truth is above mere rea- son. Spiritual truth, we are taught, can be apprehended only by the spirit. This, too, is as it should be. The G¨odelian pic- ture ﬁts what Christians believe about the universe. Had he 4.5. Theological Applications 93 been able to show that self-proof was possible, we would be in deep trouble. As noted above, the universe could then be self-explanatory. As it stands, the very real inﬁnities and paradoxes of nature demand something higher, diﬀerent in kind, more powerful, to explain them just as every logic set needs a higher logic set to prove and explain elements within it. This lesson from G¨odel’s proof is one reason I believe that no ﬁnite system, even one as vast as the universe, can ultimately satisfy the questions it raises. A main component of these reﬂections is the observation that any con- sistent system incorporating arithmetic cannot prove itself consistent and cannot answer every question it raises, and is in these respects “not self- contained.” It is only in a wider, stronger system that every question raised by the ﬁrst system can be answered and more besides, and the ﬁrst sys- tem can also be proved consistent. As a description of the incompleteness theorem, this is unobjectionable, and in fact in his 1931 paper G¨odel had a footnote 48a that should be quite congenial to the author of passage quoted: As will be shown in Part II of this paper, the true reason for the incompleteness inherent in all formal systems of mathematics is that the formation of ever higher types can be continued into the transﬁnite (see Hilbert 1926, page 184), while in any formal system at most denumerably many of them are available. For it can be shown that the undecidable propositions constructed here become decidable whenever appropriate higher types are added (for example, the type ω to the system P). An analogous situation prevails for the axiom system of set theory. While this part of Graves’ comments is thus unobjectionable, they are highly dubious in other aspects. The idea that the consistency of arith- metic is in doubt will be commented on in Chapter 6. It is not clear that this idea is theologically relevant. The formulation “no system can decide between a certain A and non-A” is incorrect, since there is no A such that no system can decide between A and non-A, but rather for any given sys- tem there is an A depending on the system such that the system cannot decide between A and non-A. But the main thrust of the passage is (unsur- prisingly) to point to the incompleteness theorem as providing an analogy 94 4. Incompleteness Everywhere to a Christian perception of the relation between the universe and God: the universe needs something higher to explain it. Finding such analogies is perfectly legitimate, but of course it is tendentious in the extreme to speak of analogies as “lessons.” It is also obscure on what grounds the author claims that “Had he been able to show that self-proof was possible, we would be in deep trouble.” If “self-proof” means a consistency proof for S carried out within S itself, it is diﬃcult to believe that any theologian would have concluded from a consistency proof for PA carried out within PA that since arithmetic needs nothing higher than itself to support or explain it, neither does the universe, and so God is unnecessary. The author makes a further comment: As a third implication of G¨odel’s theorem, faith is shown to be (ultimately) the only possible response to reality. Michael Guillen has spelled out this implication: “the only possible way of avowing an unprovable truth, mathematical or otherwise, is to accept it as an article of faith.” In other words, scientists are as subject to belief as non-scientists. [The reference is to Bridges to Inﬁnity, Los Angeles: Tarcher, 1983, p.117.] Here, the reference to G¨odel’s theorem is pointless. That science in- volves faith is a standard argument in discussions of theology and religion, but one to which G¨odel’s theorem is irrelevant. As much or as little faith is needed to accept the axioms of a theory whether or not that theory is complete and the necessity of accepting some basic principles without proof is not something that was revealed by G¨odel’s theorem. Another example of a theological invocation of G¨odel’s theorem is given by the following comments by Najamuddin Mohammed: It is pointed out that, no matter how you describe the world (with logical rules) there will always be “some things” that you cannot determine as true or false. And whether you select the answer to these “some things” as true or false doesn’t aﬀect the validity of your logical rules. Strange but true! For example let’s say: you and I have agreed upon a set of logical rules, then there will always be some thing, lets call it, that we cannot determine as true or false, using our logical rules. You can take A to be true and I can take A to be false, but in either case we are both logically consistent with our new set of logical rules respectively. 4.5. Theological Applications 95 But now we have two sets of self-consistent rules and again there will always be something called B that we cannot agree upon....and so on. This is the basis of G¨odel’s Incompleteness Theorem. If we rely on logic or reason alone we can end up in utter confu- sion, with many contradictory but logically self-consistent sys- tems of reasoning/logic. Which is correct? Does everything depend on our current psychological disposition as to what is right and wrong? Correctness has no meaning in these cases, all this can lead to agnostic and atheistic stances. There is a similarity between these reﬂections and the ideas about a “postmodern condition” created by the incompleteness theorem com- mented on in Section 2.8. Incompleteness, it is argued, leads to a profu- sion of diﬀerent consistent theories, and nobody knows where truth—or “truth”—is to be had. Thus, reason alone cannot put us on the right path, and religious faith is the way to go. Again, the weakness of this line of thought is that there is not in fact any such branching oﬀ into various directions in mathematical thinking, no ﬂoundering in a sea of undecid- ability. The “utter confusion” in mathematical thinking is a theological dream only. What remains to be considered in connection with theological invoca- tions of the incompleteness theorem are two lines of thought that are not speciﬁcally theological but are often thought congenial from a theological point of view: the skeptical conclusions thought to follow from the second incompleteness theorem, and the conclusions about the nature of the hu- man mind claimed to follow from the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. These will be considered in later chapters. 5 Skepticism and Conﬁdence 5.1 The Second Incompleteness Theorem The Discovery of the Theorem G¨odel ﬁrst presented his incompleteness theorem at a conference on “Epis- temology of the exact sciences” in 1930. G¨odel was then not yet 25 years old, so he is one of a considerable number of mathematicians and logicians who have made major discoveries at an early age. Among those present was the Hungarian mathematician John von Neumann, three years G¨odel’s senior, one of the great names of twentieth-century mathematics and the subject of various anecdotes about his remarkable powers of quick appre- hension. It appears that he was the one participant at the conference who immediately understood G¨odel’s proof. At this point G¨odel had not yet arrived at his second incompleteness theorem, and his proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem was not applicable to PA, but only to somewhat stronger theories. His proof did, however, establish that assuming a theory S to which the proof applied to be consistent, it follows that the G¨odel sen- tence G for S is unprovable in S. Reﬂecting on this after the conference, von Neumann realized that the argument establishing the implication “if S is consistent, then G is not provable in S” can be carried out within S itself. But then, since G is equivalent in S to “G is not provable in S,” it follows that if S proves the statement ConS expressing “S is consistent” in the language of S, S proves G, and hence is in fact inconsistent. Thus, the second incompleteness theorem follows: if S is consistent, ConSis not provable in S. By the time von Neumann had discovered this and written 97 98 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence to G¨odel about it, G¨odel had himself already made the same discovery and included it in his recently accepted 1931 paper. Central to this proof of the second incompleteness theorem is the notion of an ordinary mathematical proof being formalizable in a certain formal system. This means that for every step in the proof there is a corresponding series of applications of formal rules of inference in the system, so that the conclusion of the proof, when expressed in the language of the system, is also a theorem of the system. At the time of G¨odel’s proof, this notion was familiar to logicians and philosophers of mathematics through the work of Gottlob Frege, Russell and Whitehead, Hilbert, and others, so G¨odel could take it for granted in arguing that the proof of the ﬁrst half of the incompleteness theorem for P—“if P is consistent then G is not provable in P”—was formalizable in P itself. In fact, G¨odel only sketched the proof of the second incompleteness theorem in his paper. To prove the second (as opposed to the ﬁrst) incom- pleteness theorem for a formal system S, we deﬁnitely need to arithmetize the syntax of S, and reason about S in S itself, since this is required to even express “S is consistent” in the language of S. This arithmetiza- tion was carried out in detail in G¨odel’s paper, but we then need to verify that the proof of the implication “if S is consistent then G is unprovable in S” is indeed formalizable in S. In his paper, G¨odel only presented this as a plausible claim, noting that the proof of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem only used elementary arithmetical reasoning of a kind formaliz- able in the system P for which he carried out his proof. In the planned follow-up to his paper, he intended to give a full proof of the second in- completeness theorem. Part II of the paper never appeared, for the in- formal argument G¨odel gave was in fact quite convincing to his readers, and furthermore, in 1939, in the two-volume work Grundlagen der Mathe- matik (Foundations of Mathematics) by Paul Bernays and David Hilbert, a detailed proof was given. At that point, the general concept of a for- mal system had been clariﬁed through the work of Turing and Church, yielding the general formulation of the incompleteness theorem that we know today. For the proof of the second incompleteness theorem, what was needed was to show that the implication “if ConS then G” is provable in S. The converse implication, “if G then ConS,” is much more easily shown to be provable in S. All that is needed is to formalize in S the argument that G implies that G is not provable in S, and so it also implies that S is consistent, since everything is provable in an inconsistent system. Thus, G 5.1. The Second Incompleteness Theorem 99 and ConS are equivalent, and this equivalence is provable in S. It follows that we know the G¨odel sentence G for a formal system to be true if and only if we know the system to be consistent. That G and ConS are equivalent in S merits underlining, for two rea- sons. First, it is often said that G¨odel’s proof shows G to be true, or to be “in some sense” true. But the proof does not show G to be true. What we learn from the proof is that G is true if and only if S is consistent. In this observation, there is no reason to use any such formulation as “in some sense true”—if S is consistent, G is true in the ordinary mathematical sense of “true,” as when we say that Goldbach’s conjecture is true if and only if every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. Second, G¨odel’s proof does not show that there is any arithmetical statement at all that we know to be true but is not provable in S, since the statement “ConS if and only if G” is provable in S itself, for the theories S here at issue. For many theories S we do know that S is consistent, and hence know G to be true, but there is nothing in G¨odel’s proof that shows S to be consistent. Another aspect of the second incompleteness theorem that needs to be emphasized is that it does not show that S can only be proved consistent in a system that is stronger than S. To say that S is consistent is not to endorse the axioms of S, and a proof that S is consistent need not use the axioms of S itself. An example worth keeping in mind is that by the second incompleteness theorem, PA + not-ConPA is consistent, given that PA is. It would be unfortunate if we could only prove the consistency of this theory in a stronger theory, one that in its arithmetical component proves every theorem of PA + not-ConPA. Instead, we prove PA + not- ConPA consistent by proving PA consistent, and thus prove the consistency of this theory in an incompatible theory. Here it should be noted that in logic, PA + ConS is sometimes said to be stronger than S “in the sense of interpretability.” The completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic (see Chapter 7) implies that every consistent ﬁrst-order theory S has a model, a mathematical structure in which all the axioms of S are true. A reﬁnement of this theorem shows that such a model can in fact be deﬁned in PA and the axioms of S can be proved to hold in PA + ConS when interpreted in terms of this model. Thus, for example, we can deﬁne in PA a certain arithmetical relation such that when we interpret the symbol for set membership in a sentence of ZFC as referring to this relation, A ′ is provable in PA + ConZFC for every theo- rem A of ZFC, where A ′ is the resulting arithmetical interpretation of A. 100 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence This does not mean that every theorem in the arithmetical component of ZFC is provable in PA + ConZFC. Suppose, for example, that the formal- ization A in the language of ZFC of the twin prime conjecture (a certain statement about ﬁnite sets, which we know to be true if and only if the twin prime conjecture is true) is provable in ZFC. Its translation A ′ is then provable in PA + ConZFC. There is no guarantee, however, that A ′ is provably equivalent in PA to the twin prime conjecture itself. The transla- tion A ′ does not preserve the arithmetical meaning of A. Indeed, there are statements A in the arithmetical component of ZFC such that A is true but A ′ false (such A are undecidable in ZFC). However, if A is a Goldbach- like statement in the arithmetical component of ZFC, not only A ′, but the arithmetical statement whose meaning A captures, is provable in PA + ConZFC. The proof of the second incompleteness theorem in the Grundlagen did not answer every question about how to formulate and prove the theorem in complete generality, and it was only in 1960 that Solomon Feferman cleared up the remaining areas of uncertainty (in his paper “Arithmetization of Metamathematics in a General Setting”). However, in the case of the theories actually used and studied in logic and mathematics, like PA or ZFC, it has been clear since the 1930s how to formulate and prove the second incompleteness theorem. G¨odel’s original proof of the second incompleteness theorem is still the most important, in terms of the insight it gives into the theorem and its range of application, but there are several other proofs of the theorem for speciﬁc theories, again typically PA and ZFC, in the logical literature. These other proofs, however, are highly technical. Some Consequences The consistency of any theory T is of course provable in other theories, in the sense that these other theories have among their theorems the statement “T is consistent” (which may or may not be true). For example, if we add the axiom ConT to PA we get a theory in which the consistency of T is provable. To reiterate, if T is consistent, PA + ConT is stronger than T in one respect, since it proves an arithmetical theorem not provable in T , but at the same time T may prove, even in its arithmetical component, any number of (non-Goldbach-like) theorems not provable in PA. The observation that the consistency of T is provable in PA + ConT is not as pointless as it may seem, since it serves to underline an important 5.1. The Second Incompleteness Theorem 101 distinction. The second incompleteness theorem is a theorem about formal provability (which is always relative to some formal system), showing that ConT is not (for the T at issue) provable in T itself. That is, it shows that there is no formal derivation of ConT in the theory T . It does not tell us whether “T is consistent” can be proved in the sense of being shown to be true by a conclusive argument, or by an argument acceptable to mathematicians. Neither the provability of ConT in PA + ConT nor the unprovability of ConT in T itself has any immediate implications for the question whether it is possible to demonstrate the truth of ConT to the satisfaction of the mathematical community. Another aspect of this distinction deserves a comment. Since it is very easy to ﬁnd a theory in which the consistency of T is formally provable, to say that ConT cannot be formally proved in T itself is to make a stronger statement than one might naturally suppose. It is not just a matter of T lacking the means to analyze or justify itself, but one of T not being able to consistently assert its own consistency. Using G¨odel’s ﬁxpoint construc- tion described in Section 2.7, we can produce an arithmetical statement C which formalizes “this sentence is consistent with the axioms of PA.” Thus, the theory PA + C postulates its own consistency (without attempting any analysis or justiﬁcation), and so by the second incompleteness theorem, it follows that PA + C is in fact inconsistent. The unprovability of consis- tency might thus just as well be called the unassertibility of consistency. A consistent theory T cannot postulate its own consistency, although the consistency of T can be postulated in another consistent theory. (An exer- cise for the reader: Is it possible to have a pair of consistent theories S and T such that each postulates the consistency of the other? It follows from what has been said above that the answer is no.) Using the second incompleteness theorem to show that a theory is in- consistent since it proves its own consistency is not uncommon in logic, although the interest of such proofs usually lies in some positive aspect of the argument. An illustration of this is given by L¨ob’s theorem. Suppose we produce a provable ﬁxpoint for the property of being a theorem of PA, instead of (as in G¨odel’s proof) the property of not being theorem of PA. In other words, let H (for Leon Henkin, who ﬁrst raised this question) be an arithmetical statement formalizing “this statement is provable in PA.” Is H provable in PA or not? Reﬂecting on the meaning of H only yields that H is true if and only if it is provable in PA, which doesn’t get us anywhere, and it may at ﬁrst seem hopeless to decide whether this strange self-referential sentence is provable in PA or not. 102 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence L¨ob solved the question of the provability of H by showing that it holds more generally that if PA proves “if PA proves A then A,” then PA proves A (so that in particular the Henkin sentence is indeed provable in PA). To see this, consider the theory PA + not-A. We are assuming that PA proves “if PA proves A then A,” which implies “if not-A then PA does not prove A.” But this in turn implies “if not-A then PA + not-A is consistent,” so PA + not-A proves the consistency of PA + not-A, and thus is in fact inconsistent, implying that PA proves A. The same argu- ment applies to any theory T for which the second incompleteness theorem holds. The second incompleteness theorem is a special case of L¨ob’s theorem, as we see by choosing A in the formulation of the theorem as a logical contradiction “B and not-B.” For such an A, “PA proves A” is the same as saying “PA is inconsistent,” and any hypothetical statement “if C then A” is logically equivalent to not-C. Thus, L¨ob’s theorem tells us that if PA proves “PA is not inconsistent” then PA is inconsistent, or in other words, if PA is consistent then PA does not prove “PA is consistent.” L¨ob’s theorem gives us a rather odd principle for proving theorems about the natural numbers. In order to prove A, it is admissible to assume as a premise that A is provable in PA, as long as the argument is one that can be formalized in PA. For if there is a proof in PA of “if there is a proof in PA of A then A,” then there is a proof in PA of A. A similar principle holds, for example, for ZFC. This principle doesn’t have any known ap- plication in proving any ordinary mathematical theorems about primes or other matters of traditional mathematical interest, but it does have uses in logic. L¨ob’s principle may seem baﬄing rather than just odd. How can it be admissible, in proving A, to assume that A is provable in PA? After all, whatever is provable in PA is true, so can’t we then conclude with- out further ado that A is true, and so prove A without doing any rea- soning at all? The essential point here is that it is admissible to assume that A is provable in PA when proving A only if the reasoning leading from the assumption that A is provable in PA to the conclusion A can in fact be carried out within PA. That everything provable in PA is true is not something that can be established within PA itself, as is shown by the second incompleteness theorem. To say that, for example, 0 = 1 is true if provable in PA is (given that 0 is not equal to 1) the same as saying that 0 = 1 is not provable in PA, or in other words that PA is consistent. 5.2. Skepticism 103 Theories That Almost Prove Their Own Consistency Since PA is consistent, it does not prove its own consistency. But if we choose any ﬁnite number of axioms of PA, the consistency of that ﬁnite set of axioms is provable in PA. The same is true for ZFC: if we take any ﬁnite set of axioms of ZFC, their consistency can be proved in ZFC. If a theory is inconsistent, there is a proof of a logical contradiction from the axioms of the theory. For theories such as PA and ZFC, which formalize proofs that we actually carry out in mathematics, a proof is a ﬁnite sequence and can use only ﬁnitely many axioms of the theory. So if every ﬁnite subset of the axioms of the theory is consistent, then so is the whole theory. This easy argument can be carried out within PA, so it is provable in PA that if every ﬁnite subset of the axioms of PA is consistent, then so is PA. So if PA proves every ﬁnite set of PA-axioms to be consistent, then why does PA not prove itself consistent? The answer lies in an ambiguity in the formulation “PA proves every ﬁnite set of PA-axioms to be consistent.” What is true is that for any ﬁnite set M of axioms of PA, PA proves “the theory with axioms M is consistent.” It is not the case however that PA proves the statement “for any ﬁnite set M of axioms of PA, the theory with axioms M is consistent.” This distinction, which does not correspond to anything in ordinary infor- mal talk about proofs and consistency, is a reminder that there are some subtleties connected with G¨odel’s theorem that may or may not be relevant to the many philosophical or informal ideas associated with the theorem. We will return to this point in Section 6.4, about “understanding one’s own mind.” 5.2 Skepticism The incompleteness theorem is often thought to support some form of skep- ticism with regard to mathematics. It is argued either that we cannot, strictly speaking, prove anything in mathematics or that the consistency of theories like PA or ZF is shown to be doubtful by the theorem. In many cases no explanation is given of how the skeptical conclusion is supposed to follow. Thus, the Encyclopedia Britannica says mysteriously of G¨odel’s proof that it ...states that within any rigidly logical mathematical system there are propositions (or questions) that cannot be proved or 104 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence disproved on the basis of the axioms within that system and that, therefore, it is uncertain that the basic axioms of arith- metic will not give rise to contradictions. Other peculiar aspects of this comment aside (it is actually borrowed from Carl Boyer’s and Uta Merzbach’s History of Mathematics), the abrupt conclusion from incompleteness to possible inconsistency has no immedi- ately apparent rational basis, and none is suggested in the article. Similarly, we ﬁnd such comments as By G¨odel’s theorem, a system is either incomplete or inconsis- tent. Thus, logically speaking, it is impossible for us to fully “prove” any proposition. The occurrence in such remarks of phrases like “logically speaking” is a noteworthy feature of many startling non sequiturs inspired by the incompleteness theorem. When accompanied by an intelligible argument, skeptical conclusions based on G¨odel’s work usually speciﬁcally invoke the second incompleteness theorem. Thus, Nagel and Newman [Nagel and Newman 59, p. 6] state that G¨odel proves that it is impossible to establish the internal logical consistency of a very large class of deductive systems—elementary arith- metic, for example—unless one adopts principles of reasoning so complex that their internal consistency is as open to doubt as that of the systems themselves. Other commentators go further. Morris Kline, in Mathematics: The Loss of Certainty, states that “G¨odel’s result on consistency says that we cannot prove consistency in any approach to mathematics by safe logical principles.” There are two main ingredients in such reﬂections: the idea that the consistency of some or all of the formal systems we use in mathematics is doubtful, and the idea that the consistency of these systems cannot be proved in the same sense as other mathematical statements can be proved. For a perspective on these ideas, let us begin with the matter of doubt. 5.2. Skepticism 105 The Irrelevance of Gödel’s Theorem to Doubts Nothing in G¨odel’s theorem in any way contradicts the view that there is no doubt whatever about the consistency of any of the formal sys- tems that we use in mathematics. Indeed, nothing in G¨odel’s theorem is in any way incompatible with the claim that we have absolutely certain knowledge of the truth of the axioms of these systems, and therewith of their consistency. In considering this point, we need to distinguish between two things: what degree of skepticism or conﬁdence regarding mathematical axioms or methods of reasoning is justiﬁable or reasonable, and what bearing G¨odel’s theorem has on the matter. Perhaps we take a dim view of the claim that we know with absolute certainty the truth of, say, the axioms of ZFC, but how can we use G¨odel’s theorem to criticize this claim? Can we direct at the claim the telling criticism that if we know with absolute certainty that the axioms of ZFC are true, then the consistency of ZFC must be provable in ZFC itself? No, because this is not a telling criticism at all. Why should there be a proof of the consistency of ZFC in ZFC just because we know with absolute certainty that the axioms of ZFC are true (and hence consistent)? Obviously, we cannot prove everything in mathematics. We don’t need G¨odel’s theorem to tell us that we must adopt some basic principles without proof. And given that the axioms of ZFC are so utterly compelling, so obviously true in the world of sets, we can do no better than adopt these axioms as our starting point. Since the axioms are true, they are also consistent. Again, the point at issue is not whether such a view of the axioms of ZFC is justiﬁed, but whether it makes good sense to appeal to the incompleteness theorem in criticism of it. If the axioms of ZFC are manifestly true, they are obviously consistent, although there is no reason to expect a consistency proof for ZFC in ZFC. From the point of view of a skeptic about the consistency of ZFC, it is on closer inspection also unclear what is supposed to be the relevance of the second incompleteness theorem. What would be the interest of a consistency proof for ZFC given in ZFC? Since the consistency of ZFC is precisely what is in question, there is no reason to expect such a proof to carry any weight. So if we have no doubts about the consistency of ZFC, there is nothing in the second incompleteness theorem to give rise to any such doubts. And if we do have doubts about the consistency of ZFC, we have no reason 106 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence to believe that a consistency proof for ZFC formalizable in ZFC would do anything to remove those doubts. The Tradition of Finitism Hilbert had the idea of proving the consistency of strong theories like ZFC on the basis of very weak mathematical assumptions and ﬁnitistic rea- soning, without assuming the existence of inﬁnite sets and making only restricted use of logical principles. The second incompleteness theorem does indeed establish that we cannot prove the consistency even of PA us- ing only the kind of reasoning that Hilbert had in mind. So if we take the view that only ﬁnitistic reasoning in Hilbert’s sense embodies “safe logical principles” and is not open to doubt as regards its consistency, or that only ﬁnitistic proofs are really proofs, we will indeed conclude that the consistency of even elementary arithmetic cannot be proved by safe logical principles, and so on. But such a view is in no way a conclu- sion from G¨odel’s theorem. It is a particular doctrine in the philosophy of mathematics that one brings to G¨odel’s theorem. Those who do not believe that only ﬁnitistic reasoning is unproblematically correct or mean- ingful can accept with equanimity that there is no ﬁnitistic consistency proof for PA and observe that the consistency of PA is easily provable by other means. It should also be noted that from a less narrow viewpoint than that of ﬁnitism, consistency is only a weak soundness condition. That S is consistent does not, as we know from the second incompleteness theorem itself, rule out that S proves false theorems. For example, PA + not-ConPA is consistent but falsely proves the inconsistency of PA (and thus of itself). If we wish to justify our theories, a mere consistency proof will not take us far. Not only philosophers, but also mathematicians, not infrequently seem to get carried away by the philosophical legacy of Hilbert and the decades of rhetoric surrounding the incompleteness theorem and, without explicitly endorsing any ﬁnitistic doctrines, attach a large signiﬁcance to the impos- sibility of giving a ﬁnitistic consistency proof for PA. A consistency proof, they say, can only be a relative consistency proof, showing, for example, that if ZFC is consistent, then PA is consistent. We need next to take a closer look at the idea that consistency proofs are somehow not just ordi- nary mathematical proofs, or that consistency statements cannot be proved in the sense that other mathematical statements can be proved. 5.3. Consistency Proofs 107 5.3 Consistency Proofs There are many consistency proofs in the logical literature. Georg Kreisel has made the point that these proofs often prove something a great deal more interesting than mere consistency, but putting one’s ﬁnger on just what that something is can be diﬃcult. An example of this is the con- sistency proof for PA that was given by Gerhard Gentzen in 1935. This proof used an induction principle for an ordering relation much “longer” than that of the natural number series, but applied that induction principle only to a restricted class of properties. Thus, it extended PA in one di- rection but restricted it in another. Gentzen’s proof, along with the whole subject of “ordinal analysis” to which it gave rise, is very technical and stands in no simple relation to any doubts that people may have about the consistency of PA. Another famous example is G¨odel’s proof of the “relative consistency” of the axiom of choice in set theory. This is not a consistency proof, but is usually described as a proof of the implication “if ZF is consistent then ZFC is consistent.” In this formulation, G¨odel’s result conveys no information of interest to anybody who regards ZFC as obviously consistent. But, in fact, the proof establishes much more and shows, for example, that every arithmetical theorem that can be proved using the axiom of choice can be proved without using that axiom—a fact that is by no means obvious, even given the consistency of ZFC. These two famous results from logic have been mentioned here chieﬂy in order to emphasize that the content and interest of “consistency proofs” or “relative consistency proofs” in mathematical logic is often a technical and diﬃcult matter. The remaining comments will concern only consistency proofs of a diﬀerent kind. These proofs are mathematically essentially trivial, and they prove much more than the consistency of a theory, namely that all theorems of the theory are true. Proving ZFC Consistent In the case of ZFC, there is no technical consistency proof in logic corre- sponding to Gentzen’s consistency proof for PA. The consistency of ZFC is, however, an immediate consequence of various much stronger statements than “ZFC is consistent” and follows in particular from set-theoretical prin- ciples of a kind known as axioms of inﬁnity (see Section 8.3). Because such axioms (with the exception of the basic axiom of inﬁnity which is part of 108 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence ZFC) are not ordinarily used in mathematics to prove theorems, it is a per- fectly reasonable observation that these consistency proofs for ZFC are not ordinary mathematical proofs, and that such proofs do not establish that the consistency of ZFC can be proved in the same sense as Fermat’s Last Theorem has been proved. This is so whether or not we regard axioms of inﬁnity as mathematically justiﬁed. As long as mathematicians, with very few exceptions, do not make use of axioms of inﬁnity in proving theorems, it makes sense to observe that there is no “ordinary mathematical proof” of the consistency of ZFC. Similar comments apply to what is known as proofs by reﬂection of the consistency of ZFC. As has been noted, for every ﬁnite set M of axioms of ZFC, it is provable in ZFC that M is consistent. So, it may seem, if we are prepared in mathematics to accept every statement that we know to be a theorem of ZFC as proved, we should accept it as proved that every ﬁnite set of axioms of ZFC is consistent, and thereby that ZFC is consistent. To examine this line of argument would be to open a philosophical can of worms that had better be set aside in this context. So we will just note again that whatever the merits of such a consistency proof by reﬂection, it does not much resemble proofs in ordinary mathematics. On the other hand, it is a simple matter to prove PA consistent using only ordinary mathematics. So in order to take a closer look at the idea that consistency proofs as such are necessarily more problematic, more dubious, or less robust than other mathematical proofs, we turn to the case of arithmetic. Proving PA Sound As an example of a trivial consistency proof that falls well within ordinary mathematics, consider the question of how to prove the consistency of the theories in the sequence PA, PA1, PA2, . . . where PA1 is obtained by adding the axiom “PA is consistent” to PA, PA2 adds the axiom “PA1 is consistent” to PA1, and so on. We say that a theory T is arithmetically sound if every arithmetical theorem of T is true. An arithmetically sound theory is consistent, since an inconsistent theory proves the false arithmetical statement 0 = 1. Fur- thermore, if T is arithmetically sound, the theory T + “T is consistent” is also arithmetically sound. Given that PA is arithmetically sound, we ﬁnd 5.3. Consistency Proofs 109 that all of the theories in the above sequence are sound, and hence consis- tent. And, in fact, very much longer sequences of theories can be shown to be consistent by the same reasoning. (For some hints about what can be meant by “longer sequences” here, see Section 5.4.) Note that the knowledge that PA is consistent is not enough to justify the consistency of the theories in the sequence after the ﬁrst, since we know from the incompleteness theorem that there are consistent theories that prove their own inconsistency. Thus, for example, the theory T obtained by adding to PA the axiom “PA is inconsistent” is consistent, but if we add to T the axiom “T is consistent” we get an inconsistent theory. So to prove the theories in the sequence to be consistent, it is enough to prove that PA is arithmetically sound. What does this involve? Well, we need to deﬁne “true arithmetical sentence,” then we need to show that the axioms of PA are all true arithmetical sentences and that the rules of reasoning of PA lead from true premises to true conclusions. Inevitably, this involves some logical and mathematical formalities, and so falls outside the treatment in this book. We will note the following aspects of the proof. First, recall that the concept of “true arithmetical sentence” is not deﬁned relative to any formal system. Instead, as explained in Section 2.4, what we get from a mathematical deﬁnition of the concept of truth for arithmetical sentences is simply that Goldbach’s conjecture is true if and only if every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes, and similarly for other arithmetical sentences. Second, the proof that the axioms of PA are true and the rules of reasoning of PA lead from true statements to true statements uses just the same axioms and rules of reasoning as those embodied in PA, plus a little bit of set theory or some mathematics at a comparable degree of abstraction. The proof is sometimes said to be carried out in ZFC, but logically speaking this is enormous overkill. Only a very much weaker set theory is needed to carry out the proof, speciﬁcally a fragment of ZFC known as ACA. Although mathematicians in general have no reason to be at all familiar with the formulation of ACA, the methods of reasoning formalized in ACA are commonly used in mathematics. So what we have here is a mathematical proof, formalizable in the weak set theory ACA, that all the theories in the sequence PA, PA1,... are consistent. In particular, we have a mathematical proof, using ordinary mathematical principles, that PA is consistent. A common objection to this description of what has been achieved is that the proof is really no proof of consistency, for ACA is logically stronger 110 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence than all of the theories in the sequence, and if we have doubts about the consistency of PA or any of the other theories in the sequence, these doubts will extend to the consistency of ACA. So all we can say that the proof shows is the consistency of the theories in the sequence assuming the con- sistency of ACA. In other words, the proof shows that if ACA is consistent, then PA and the other theories in the sequence are consistent. This whole line of thought is predicated on the assumption that we have doubts about the consistency of PA and are trying to allay those doubts by means of a consistency proof. But when we regard the axioms and principles formalized in PA and ACA as straightforwardly part of our mathematical knowledge, the soundness proof for PA (and the other theo- ries in the sequence) is not intended to allay any doubts at all. It is quite simply an essentially trivial proof of a basic result in logic. There is, therefore, no basis in G¨odel’s theorem for the idea that a con- sistency proof—in this case for PA and the other theories in the sequence— is not a proof in exactly the same sense as any other mathematical proof is a proof. Every mathematical proof is based on certain basic axioms and rules of reasoning. A consistency proof such as the one sketched by no means yields a justiﬁcation of the axioms and rules of reasoning for- malized in PA. It is just a proof of an arithmetical statement, a proof which establishes the statement as true in the same way and in the same sense of “establish” as do other proofs of arithmetical statements using those same axioms and rules of reasoning. In regarding the proof as es- tablishing the consistency of PA, we are of course drawing on our con- ﬁdence in the mathematical axioms and rules of reasoning formalized in ACA—not just conﬁdence in their consistency, but in their mathemat- ical correctness (which might mean, in this context, their arithmetical soundness). Those who do not regard PA and ACA as straightforwardly formalizing a part of our mathematical knowledge may, of course, have every reason to doubt any and all results proved in ACA, including the consistency proof for PA. So let us take a closer look at this skeptical perspective. The Skeptical Perspective If we do have doubts about the consistency of a theory T and seek to allay those doubts by means of a consistency proof for T in a theory S, then indeed we need to have conﬁdence in the reasoning used in that particular proof in S. And if all we know is that there is some proof in S of the 5.3. Consistency Proofs 111 consistency of T , we need to have conﬁdence in the consistency of S in order to conclude that T is consistent. Such a skeptical perspective is not peculiar to those who have or claim to have doubts about the consistency of ACA or PA. Whatever our view of PA, ACA, ZFC, and other theories, there will be cases where we by no means regard the mathematical principles formalized in a theory T as evident or acceptable and have doubts even about the consistency of T . For example, the theory obtained by adding the axiom “PA is inconsistent” to PA has a false axiom, and without knowledge of G¨odel’s theorem it is natural to have doubts about its consistency. But as we know, the consistency of this theory can be proved, as a consequence of the consistency of PA. What is striking about skepticism with regard to theories like PA and ACA is that it is rarely observed in any ordinary mathematical contexts. In particular, an insistence on a hypothetical interpretation of an arithmetical theorem (as in the claim that the above consistency proof only shows “if ACA is consistent then PA is consistent”) is rarely heard from mathemati- cians or anybody else in connection with proofs of ordinary arithmetical statements. For example, one never encounters as a response to the claim “Andrew Wiles proved Fermat’s Last Theorem” the objection “No, no, that’s not possible—all he proved was that if ZFC is consistent, then there is no solution in positive integers to x n +yn = zn for n > 2.” The reason for this diﬀerence is not that Wiles’ proof was so elementary that the doubts aﬀecting the consistency proof for PA do not arise. On the contrary, Wiles’ proof involves heavy mathematical machinery, and it is an open question just what principles are needed to prove the theorem. But it is as true in the case of Wiles’ proof as in the case of the consistency proof sketched here that if you have doubts about the consistency of ZFC (assuming this to be the setting for Wiles’ proof), there is no obvious reason why you should accept a proof in ZFC of Fermat’s Last Theorem as showing that theorem to be true. It may be held that there is always an implicit “if ZFC is consistent” aﬃxed to an arithmetical theorem proved in ZFC, and similarly for other theories. In the case of consistency theorems, it might be argued, we need to make this explicit, so as not to give the misleading impression that we have given an absolute consistency proof, allaying all doubts about the consistency of for example PA. One may wonder, in such a case, why it is not equally important to avoid giving the misleading impression that Fermat’s Last Theorem has been proved in any absolute sense. But there is the more substantial question of 112 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence how to make sense of mathematics in general in such hypothetical terms. Consider the classical result proved in 1837 by Dirichlet, that whenever the positive integers n and k have no common divisor greater than 1, there are inﬁnitely many primes in the sequence n, n + k, n + 2k, n + 3k,. . . . What can we conclude, assuming that we do not accept the mathematical principles formalized in ACA as valid, from a proof in ACA of Dirichlet’s theorem? In this case, because Dirichlet’s theorem is not a Goldbach-like statement, we have no grounds for concluding “if ACA is consistent, there are inﬁnitely many primes in the sequence n, n + k, n + 2k, n + 3k,. . . whenever n and k have no common divisor greater than 1.” So just what does the proof of Dirichlet’s theorem prove? A further consideration of these matters would take us too far into the philosophy of mathematics. The basic points argued above can be summed up as follows. It is indeed perfectly possible to have doubts about the consistency of a theory T and to seek to eliminate those doubts through a consistency proof. In such a case we need to carry out the proof in a theory whose consistency is not equally open to doubt. However, a consistency proof may just as well be a perfectly ordinary mathematical proof of a certain fact about a formal system (or, in its arithmetized form, about the natural numbers), not aiming at allaying doubts about the consistency of mathematics, any more than proofs of arithmetical theorems in general are aimed at allaying such doubts. G¨odel’s theorem tells us nothing about what is or is not doubtful in mathematics. To speak of the consistency of arithmetic as something that cannot be proved makes sense only given a skeptical attitude towards ordinary mathematics in general. 5.4 Inexhaustibility Suppose we are not skeptically inclined, but rather accept some formal system to which the incompleteness theorem applies, say PA or ZFC, as unproblematically formalizing part of our mathematical knowledge. What are then the consequences of the second incompleteness theorem? On this, G¨odel commented (Collected Works, vol. III, p. 309, italics in the original): It is this theorem [the second incompleteness theorem] which makes the incompletability of mathematics particularly evident. For, it makes it impossible that someone should set up a certain well-deﬁned system of axioms and rules and consistently make 5.4. Inexhaustibility 113 the following assertion about it: All of these axioms and rules I perceive (with mathematical certitude) to be correct, and more- over I believe that they contain all of mathematics. If somebody makes such a statement he contradicts himself. For if he per- ceives the axioms under consideration to be correct, he also perceives (with the same certainty) that they are consistent. Hence he has a mathematical insight not derivable from his axioms. Thus in this case the second incompleteness theorem has the positive consequence that we can always extend any formal system that we recognize as sound (in the sense that its axioms are all true statements) to a stronger system that we also recognize as sound, by adding as a new axiom the statement that the original system is consistent. This means that we immediately come up with an inﬁnity of extensions of our starting theory T , as was illustrated previously for the case T = PA. Each of the theories PAi in the sequence PA, PA1, PA2,... is obtained by adding as a new axiom that the preceding theory is consistent. Given that PA is sound, all of the theories in this sequence are also sound. But we can say more, for if we form the theory PAω whose axioms are those of PA together with all of the consistency statements obtained in this way, Pω is also sound. And the procedure can be continued, for we can now extend PAω, which is still subject to the incompleteness theorem, to a stronger theory PAω+1 by adding “PAω is consistent” as a new axiom. What happens when this process is continued? Whenever we manage to deﬁne a theory like PAω, which is demonstrably sound, given that PA is sound, we will also be able to extend it to a stronger theory that is still sound. But then the question arises just when we can prove that a particular theory obtained in this way is in fact sound. The subject quickly becomes technical. In the sequence of theories presented, each theory was obtained from the preceding one by adding as an axiom that the preceding theory is con- sistent. G¨odel’s remarks apply equally to theories obtained by adding to a theory T as a new axiom a stronger statement than “T is consistent,” which still follows from the arithmetical soundness of T . For example, if every arithmetical theorem of T is true, the same is true for the theory obtained by adding to T the axiom “T is Σ-sound,” or in other words, “ev- ery Goldbach-like statement disprovable in T is false.” As in the sequence of extensions by consistency statements, we get a sequence of sound ex- 114 5. Skepticism and Conﬁdence tensions of PA using this way of extending a theory in the sequence. The theories in this sequence will be logically stronger than the corresponding theories in the sequence obtained by adding consistency statements. Sim- ilar but stronger extension principles, known as reﬂection principles, can also be formulated. In this book, we will return to the subject of inexhaustibility in Sec- tion 6.3, in connection with G¨odelian arguments in the philosophy of mind. The mathematics of repeatedly adding consistency statements is not then at issue, but instead the argument that our inability to specify any formal system that exhausts our mathematical knowledge indicates that there is something essentially nonmechanical about our mathematical thinking. 6 Gödel, Minds, and Computers 6.1 Gödel and the UTM Discussions of appeals to the incompleteness theorem in the philosophy of mind (“G¨odelian arguments”) sometimes refer to machines (comput- ers), sometimes to formal systems. The two notions are interchangeable in these discussions, since for any formal system there is a way to program a computer to systematically generate the theorems of the system, and con- versely, for any way of programming a computer to generate sentences in some formal language, there is a corresponding formal system which has those sentences among its theorems. One of the most widespread misconceptions about the ﬁrst incomplete- ness theorem is that G¨odel’s proof of it, when applied to a consistent sys- tem, shows the G¨odel sentence of the system, unprovable in the system it- self, to be true. Rudy Rucker, in Inﬁnity and the Mind [Rucker 95, p.174], tells the following misleading story: The proof of G¨odel’s Incompleteness Theorem is so simple, and so sneaky, that it is almost embarrassing to relate. His basic procedure is as follows: 1. Someone introduces G¨odel to a UTM, a machine that is supposed to be a Universal Truth Machine, capable of cor- rectly answering any question at all. 115 116 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers 2. G¨odel asks for the program and the circuit design of the UTM. The program may be complicated, but it can only be ﬁnitely long. Call the program P(UTM) for Program of the Universal Truth Machine. 3. Smiling a little, G¨odel writes out the following sentence: “The machine constructed on the basis of the program P(UTM) will never say that this sentence is true.” Call this sentence G for G¨odel. Note that G is equivalent to “UTM will never say G is true.” 4. Now G¨odel laughs his high laugh and asks UTM whether G is true or not. 5. If UTM says G is true, then “UTM will never say G is true” is false. If “UTM will never say G is true” is false, then G is false (since G = “UTM will never say G is true”). So if UTM says G is true, then G is in fact false, and UTM has made a false statement. So UTM will never say that G is true, since UTM makes only true statements. 6. We have established that UTM will never say G is true. So “UTM will never say G is true” is in fact a true statement. So G is true (since G = “UTM will never say G is true”). 7. “I know a truth that UTM can never utter,” G¨odel says. “I know that G is true. UTM is not truly universal.” So far Rucker. We can invent a continuation of the story: 8. G¨odel’s jaw drops as UTM gravely intones, “I hereby de- clare that G is true.” “But,” G¨odel manages to squawk, “you’re supposed to always tell the truth.” “Well,” says UTM, “it seems I don’t.” Suppose UTM is in fact a machine that always tells the truth, so that the ﬁnal exchange can never take place. G¨odel still hasn’t demonstrated that he knows any truth that UTM can never utter. What he knows is only the implication “if UTM always tells the truth, then G is true.” But this implication can be uttered by UTM as well. It is only if G¨odel has somehow acquired the knowledge that UTM always tells the truth that he knows the truth of G. Being told that UTM is “supposed to be” a universal truth machine does not amount to knowing that UTM always tells the truth. 6.1. Gödel and the UTM 117 The argument put forward in [Lucas 61] to show that for any consistent formal system S, there is a true statement that we can prove but S can not, is invalid for the same reason. Lucas wrongly claims that “G¨odel’s theorem states that in any consistent system which is strong enough to produce simple arithmetic there are formulas which cannot be proved in the system, but which we can see to be true.” As emphasized in earlier chapters, the theorem neither states nor implies any such thing. What we know on the basis of G¨odel’s proof of the incompleteness theorem is not that the G¨odel sentence G for a theory S is true, but only the implication “if S is consistent then G is true.” This implication is provable in S itself, so there is nothing in G¨odel’s proof to show that we know more than can be proved in S, as far as arithmetic is concerned. (A persistent reader of Rucker’s book will learn as much from “Excursion Two” at the end of the book, which gives a presentation of the proof of the incompleteness theorem.) We do of course know the G¨odel sentence of, for example, PA to be true, since we know PA to be consistent. Whenever we know a theory S to be consistent, we also know the truth of a statement not provable in S. But in those cases when we have no idea whether or not S is consistent, we also have no idea whether or not a G¨odel sentence G for S is true, and if we merely believe or guess S to be consistent, we merely believe or guess G to be true. Given that we have no basis for claiming that we (“the human mind”) can outprove any given consistent formal system, a weaker claim could be made that there can be no formal system that exactly represents the human mind as far as its ability to prove arithmetical theorems is concerned. To test this claim, suppose we specify a theory T , say as ZFC with an added axiom of inﬁnity (as described in Section 8.3). Can we use G¨odel’s theorem to disprove the claim that the arithmetical theorems of T are precisely those that the human mind is capable of proving? An attempt to do so fails for the same reason that the original Lucas argument fails. First, nothing in the incompleteness theorem rules out that every arithmetical statement provable in T can also be proved by the human mind. We may not at the moment know how to prove a given arithmetical theorem of T , but we can’t use the incompleteness theorem to rule out the possibility that a proof acceptable to the human mind exists. Second, the incompleteness theorem does not rule out the possibility that every arithmetical statement provable by the human mind is provable in T . If we make a suitable choice of axiom of inﬁnity, it will not be in any way evident to the human mind that T is consistent, and nothing in G¨odel’s theorem gives us any example 118 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers of an arithmetical statement that we can prove or “see to be true” but which is unprovable in T . To this standard argument, Lucas responds ([Lucas 96, p. 117]): The mind does not go round uttering theorems in the hope of tripping up any machines that may be around. Rather, there is a claim being seriously maintained by the mechanist that the mind can be represented by some machine. Before wasting time on the mechanist’s claim, it is reasonable to ask him some questions about his machine to see whether his seriously main- tained claim has serious backing. It is reasonable to ask him not only what the speciﬁcation of the machine is, but whether it is consistent. Unless it is consistent, the claim will not get oﬀ the ground. If it is warranted to be consistent, then that gives the mind the premise it needs. The consistency of the machine is established not by the mathematical ability of the mind but on the word of the mechanist. The mechanist has claimed that his machine is consistent. If so, it cannot prove its G¨odelian sentence, which the mind can none the less see to be true: if not, it is out of court anyhow. These comments are somewhat odd, since they seem to set aside the question whether G¨odel’s theorem can be used to disprove the statement that T exactly represents human arithmetical ability, quite apart from whether anybody claims this to be the case. But suppose we adopt the attitude expressed by Lucas, that the point is what we can argue when faced with a “seriously maintained claim” that T represents the human mind. It is then noteworthy that Lucas only speaks of the machine being “warranted to be consistent.” This is just like the “supposed to always tell the truth” in the story of the UTM. An earnest claim by “the mechanist” that the machine is consistent will not give Lucas any grounds for claiming the G¨odel sentence of the machine to be in any sense humanly provable. Being assured that the machine is consistent gives no support to the claim that “the mind can see” that it is consistent. We need to distinguish be- tween “We know that if T is consistent then G is true,” which is true, and “If T is consistent, then we know that G is true,” which we have no grounds for claiming. Of course, if Lucas has great conﬁdence in the constructor of the machine, he will perhaps accept his claim and believe the machine to be consistent, and so also believe the G¨odel sentence of the machine to be 6.2. Penrose’s “Second Argument” 119 true, but this in no way amounts to proving the G¨odel sentence or “seeing” it to be true. 6.2 Penrose’s “Second Argument” Roger Penrose, in his two books The Emperor’s New Mind and Shadows of the Mind, has argued at length that G¨odel’s theorem has implications for a “science of consciousness.” In Shadows, he presents a G¨odelian argu- ment (“Penrose’s new argument,” “Penrose’s second argument”) aiming to establish what the Lucas argument does not, that no machine can exactly represent the ability of the human mind to prove arithmetical theorems. The presentation of this argument in Shadows is fairly long and involved, but fortunately Penrose has set out the argument in its essentials in the electronic journal Psyche ([Penrose 96]): We try to suppose that the totality of methods of (unassailable) mathematical reasoning that are in principle humanly accessible can be encapsulated in some (not necessarily computational) sound formal system F . A human mathematician, if presented with F , could argue as follows (bearing in mind that the phrase “I am F ” is merely a shorthand for “F encapsulates all the humanly accessible methods of mathematical proof”): (A) “Though I don’t know that I necessarily am F , I conclude that if I were, then the system F would have to be sound and, more to the point, F ′ would have to be sound, where F ′ is F supplemented by the further assertion “I am F .” I perceive that it follows from the assumption that I am F that the G¨odel statement G(F ′) would have to be true and, furthermore, that it would not be a consequence of F ′. But I have just perceived that “if I happened to be F , then G(F ′) would have to be true,” and perceptions of this nature would be precisely what F ′ is supposed to achieve. Since I am therefore capable of perceiving something beyond the powers of F ′, I deduce that, I cannot be F after all. Moreover, this applies to any other (G¨odelizable) system, in place of F .” Let us simplify further. Given a formal system F , Penrose invokes a corresponding mathematical statement (or, with suitable adjustments in the argument, a rule of inference) IAMF such that 120 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers 1. If IAMF then F + IAMF is consistent, and furthermore, 2. I can prove (or “perceive”): if IAMF then F + IAMF is consistent. In this formulation, the G¨odel sentence for F + IAMF has been replaced by the corresponding consistency statement, which is usually a good idea in these arguments, since the G¨odel sentence for a theory S is equivalent in S to “S is consistent,” which is less likely to promote confusion than the self-referential G¨odel sentence. Penrose establishes (1) by way of the soundness of F + IAMF, but it is only essential to the argument that we can somehow prove (1). The next premise in the argument is 3. If IAMF then for every A, if I can prove (or “perceive”) A then F proves A. It follows from (2) and (3) that if IAMF then F proves “if IAMF then F + IAMF is consistent.” But then F + IAMF proves that F + IAMF is consistent, so F + IAMF is inconsistent. This is incompatible with IAMF, by (1). So if IAMF is true it is false, so IAMF is false. The argument is correct in the sense that not-IAMF follows from (1)– (3) for any F to which the incompleteness theorem applies. Furthermore, it is easy to ﬁnd mathematical statements IAMF for which (1)–(3) hold: just take any statement that we can prove to be false. But of course the argument is pointless unless we can ﬁnd such an IAMF for which we have grounds for claiming 4. If I am F , in the sense that F encapsulates all the humanly accessible methods of mathematical proof, then IAMF. Can an IAMF for which (1)–(4) hold be found? Penrose comments: Of course, one might worry about how an assertion like “I am F ” might be made use of in a logical formal system. In eﬀect, this is discussed with some care in Shadows, Sections 3.16 and 3.24, in relation to the Sections leading up to 3.16, although the mode of presentation there is somewhat diﬀerent from that given above, and less succinct. This comment is wildly optimistic. It would lead too far to go into Pen- rose’s presentation of the “second argument” in Shadows. Commentaries 6.3. Inexhaustibility Revisited 121 on Penrose’s second argument in the literature (such as the contributions to the debate in Psyche, [Lindstr¨om 01], and [Shapiro 03]) diﬀer consid- erably both in their attempted reconstructions of the argument and in their diagnoses of where the error lies. Any further contribution to these commentaries that might be included in this book would essentially only consist in a prolonged complaint, which few readers would be likely to ﬁnd illuminating, that Penrose fails to substantiate the idea that there is any IAMF for which (1)–(4) hold. Fortunately, there is little reason to enter into any sustained exam- ination of Penrose’s arguments on this point, for he comments himself ([Penrose 96, Section 4.2]) that ...I do not regard [the “second argument”] as the ‘real’ G¨odelian reason for disbelieving that computationalism could ever pro- vide an explanation for the mind—or even for the behavior of a conscious brain. Instead, the argument that Penrose considers most persuasive, and to which he devotes Chapter 2 of Shadows, turns on our inability to fully specify our arithmetical knowledge. 6.3 Inexhaustibility Revisited As G¨odel emphasized, if we accept a formal system S as a correct formal- ization of part of our mathematical knowledge, we will also in the same sense, and with the same justiﬁcation, accept an extension of that system obtained by adding as a new axiom “S is consistent.” Since the resulting system is logically stronger than S, we conclude that we cannot specify any formal system S that exhausts our mathematical knowledge. Penrose formulates an equivalent observation in somewhat eccentric terms as “Conclusion G” in [Penrose 94, p. 76]: “Human mathematicians are not using a knowably sound algorithm in order to ascertain mathe- matical truth.” Instead of invoking the second incompleteness theorem, he applies Turing’s proof of the unsolvability of the halting problem (see Section 3.3). Penrose’s argument, slightly modiﬁed, is the following. If we know that every theorem of a formal system T of the form “Pi does not terminate for input i” is true, we can specify a statement of this form which we know to be true but is not a theorem of T . For we can ﬁnd an e such that Pe is a program that given n looks for a theorem in T of the form 122 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers “Pn does not terminate for input n,” and for this e, we know the statement “Pe does not terminate for input e” to be true but unprovable in T . In this sense there is no “knowably sound” theory T that proves every “humanly provable” statement of the form “Pn does not terminate for input n.” Unlike the Lucas argument, the observation that no “knowably sound” algorithm or theory exhausts our arithmetical knowledge is not based on any misunderstanding of the incompleteness theorem or its proof, and un- like Penrose’s “second argument,” it is not rendered opaque by various obscurities and uncertainties. But does it tell us anything about the hu- man mind? Penrose grants that his Conclusion G is compatible with the assumption that the human mind is in fact exactly equivalent to some formal system T as far as its ability to prove arithmetical statements is concerned, although we could in such a case not prove or perceive the consistency of T (and perhaps not formulate the axioms of T ). He presents various arguments against this idea, and indeed the assumption that there is such a T has little to recommend it. To come to grips with the feeling that Conclusion G shows that the human mind is in some sense nonalgorithmic, we need to tackle head on the question whether it shows that it is in fact impossible for us to program a computer with all of our ability to prove arithmetical theorems. It may seem that the answer is obvious, since what conclusion G states is precisely that we cannot specify any formal system that exhausts our mathematical knowledge. But there is no reason why programming a com- puter with all of our ability to prove arithmetical theorems should consist in specifying such a formal system. To emulate human mathematicians, the computer also needs to be able to apply precisely the kind of reasoning that leads us from accepting a formal system T as mathematically correct to accepting a stronger system as in the same sense correct. Penrose, in considering this possibility ([Penrose 94, p. 81]), argues that whatever rules of reasoning of this kind with which we program the robot, the totality of statements provable by the robot will still be theorems of a formal system that we recognize as sound, and Conclusion G still applies: the robot has not been programmed with the sum total of our arithmetical knowledge and theorem-proving ability. This argument is inconclusive because in fact the kind of reasoning that leads us from accepting a formal system T as mathematically correct to accepting a stronger system as mathematically correct covers a wide range of both formal and informal principles, some of which are evident 6.3. Inexhaustibility Revisited 123 and unproblematic, while others are less so. The case where we go from a theory T that we unhesitatingly accept as correct to the extension T + “T is consistent” is simple and unproblematic. How could we incorporate this principle in trying to program a robot mathematician with all of our arithmetical knowledge? We start by programming the robot with some basic theory T of arithmetic. To include the extension principle, we might give the robot a button to press: whenever the button is pressed, the store of axioms available to the robot is extended by the statement that its earlier store of axioms is consistent. In searching for a proof of an arithmetical statement, the robot may press the button any number of times. Does this make the robot our mathematical equal? No, for since we recognize that all of the theories obtainable by repeatedly applying the above principle starting with T are correct, we also recognize that the union of these theories, which has all of the consistency statements obtained in this way as axioms, is correct, so we get a new consistency statement which can not be proved by the robot. But now we’re applying a diﬀerent principle: we go from a theory T that we unhesitatingly accept as correct to an extension of T by inﬁnitely many consistency statements, which we also unhesitatingly accept as correct. We can program the robot to make use of this principle as well. But now we ﬁnd that the robot still does not match our theorem-proving ability, for we can formulate stronger principles of extension. As we continue to formulate stronger and more involved principles for extending a correct theory to a stronger theory that is still correct, we are confronted with a number of questions about what is or is not evident or mathematically acceptable, questions to which diﬀerent mathematicians and philosophers will give diﬀerent answers, and where many would say that there is no deﬁnite answer. To program a robot to perfectly emulate human mathematicians, we would need to give it a similar range of responses to these questions. If we manage to do this, the set of theorems provable by the robot using any of the formally deﬁned extension principles will still indeed be computably enumerable, but we will have no grounds for the claim that we as human mathematicians can prove anything not provable by the robot. We will have succeeded in creating a robot that becomes just as confused and uncertain as humans do when pondering ever more complicated or far-reaching ways of extending a correct theory to a stronger correct theory. The above brief description of what happens when we start thinking about various principles for extending a correct theory to a stronger cor- 124 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers rect theory can only be substantiated by going into technicalities. The interested reader can turn to [Franz´en 04] for a sustained exposition. 6.4 Understanding One’s Own Mind A fairly common invocation of G¨odel’s theorem is illustrated by the follow- ing remark: AccordingtoG¨odel’s incompleteness theorem, understanding our own minds is impossible, yet we have persisted in seeking this knowledge through the ages! Like so many similar references to the incompleteness theorem outside logic and mathematics, this comment, taken literally, is simply mistaken. “According to” means “as stated or implied by,” and of course G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem neither states nor implies that understanding our own minds is impossible. But as in the case of other such statements, we need to understand the above reﬂection as inspired by the incomplete- ness theorem rather than as drawing any conclusion from it. Douglas Hofstadter’s formulation of a similar reﬂection, in G¨odel, Escher, Bach ([Hofstadter 79, p. 697]), has the virtue of making it explicit that the role of the incompleteness theorem is a matter of inspiration rather than implication: The other metaphorical analogue to G¨odel’s Theorem which I ﬁnd provocative suggests that ultimately, we cannot understand our own minds/brains .... Just as we cannot see our faces with our own eyes, is it not inconceivable to expect that we cannot mirror our complete mental structures in the symbols which carry them out? All the limitative theorems of mathematics and the theory of computation suggest that once the ability to represent your own structure has reached a certain critical point, that is the kiss of death: it guarantees that you can never represent yourself totally. Finding suggestions, metaphors, and analogies in other ﬁelds when studying the human mind is of course perfectly legitimate and may be quite useful. But it can only be a starting point, and actual theories and studies of the human mind would be needed to give substance to reﬂections like Hofstadter’s. Metaphorical invocations of G¨odel’s theorem often suﬀer 6.4. Understanding One’s Own Mind 125 from the weakness of giving such satisfaction to the human mind that they tend to be mistaken for incisive and illuminating observations. The question how to substantiate reﬂections like Hofstadter’s, and whether it can be done, will not be considered in this book. However, this particular category of metaphorical applications of the incompleteness theorem merits some further comments. In reﬂections such as those quoted, it is commonly the second incom- pleteness theorem that is explicitly or implicitly referred to. The inability of a formal system S to prove its own consistency is interpreted as an in- ability of S to suﬃciently analyze and justify itself, or as a kind of blind spot. The system doesn’t “understand itself.” To this, it may be objected that the metaphor understates the diﬃculty for a system to prove its own consistency. As commented on in Section 5.1, the unprovability of consistency is really the unassertibility of consistency. A system cannot truly postulate its own consistency, quite apart from ques- tions of analysis and justiﬁcation, although other systems can truly postu- late the consistency of that system. An analogous diﬃculty for a human is that he cannot truly state that he never talks about himself, although other people can truly make this observation about him. The reason for this is not that the human mind cannot suﬃciently analyze or justify itself, but that the very utterance of the statement “I never talk about myself” falsiﬁes it. Of course this analogy is not likely to strike anybody as provocative or suggestive, since it doesn’t even have the appearance of saying anything about the human mind, but only makes a logical observation about the incompatibility of the content of a particular kind of assertion with the making of the assertion. So let us make an eﬀort to draw a “conclusion” about the human mind by way of a comparison with formal systems like PA and ZFC. Instead of concluding that the human mind cannot understand itself, we will conclude that the human mind, if it is at all like these formal systems, is able to understand itself wonderfully. For every ﬁnite subset of the axioms of PA, PA proves the consistency of that subset, and does so by shrewdly analyzing the logic of such ﬁnite parts of itself. Furthermore, PA proves For every ﬁnite subset of my axioms, I can prove that subset consistent and also 126 6. Gödel, Minds, and Computers If every ﬁnite subset of my axioms is consistent, then I am consistent. However, in order to avoid tedious paradoxes, PA cannot assert “If I can prove a ﬁnite subset of my axioms consistent, then that subset is consistent” (since in such a case PA would prove its own consistency, and therewith both the truth and the falsity of the G¨odel sentence for PA). PA can of course also prove this fact about its own inability to consistently aﬃrm such a principle. That is, PA proves If I can prove “For every ﬁnite subset M of my axioms, if I can prove M consistent then M is consistent” then I am inconsis- tent. Inspired by this impressive ability of PA to understand itself, we conclude, in the spirit of metaphorical “applications” of the incompleteness theorem, that if the human mind has anything like the powers of profound self- analysis of PA or ZFC, we can expect to be able to understand ourselves perfectly. “Going Outside the System” It is often said that it is only by “going outside the system” that one can prove the G¨odel sentence of a theory such as PA, an image that reinforces the idea that “a system cannot understand itself fully.” This is correct in the sense that one cannot prove, or even truly postulate, the G¨odel sentence of the system, or equivalently the consistency of the system, in the system, that is, by a proof formalizable in the theory. But the image of “going outside the system” is a bit too seductive, in that it suggests that there is some generally applicable way of viewing a system “from outside” so as to be able to prove things about it that are not provable in the system. We don’t know of any such general method. Consider the theory T obtained by adding Goldbach’s conjecture as a new axiom to PA. T is consistent if and only if Goldbach’s conjecture is true, but we have no inkling of any method of “going outside the system” by which T might be proved or “seen” to be consistent. 7 Gödel’s Completeness Theorem 7.1 The Theorem A common source of confusion in connection with G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem is the fact that G¨odel also proved, in his doctoral dissertation, an important result known as the Completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic (G¨odel). First-order logic (also known as predicate logic, ﬁrst-order predicate logic, or ﬁrst-order predicate calculus) is complete. As noted in Section 2.3, it is often said that predicate logic escapes the conclusion of the incompleteness theorem because it does not incorporate the “certain amount of arithmetic.” For example: G¨odel proposed that every formal system embodying a language complex enough that elementary number theory can be repre- sented in terms of it is either incomplete or inconsistent. Most of the formal systems that we use in practice are both complete and consistent: e.g., ﬁrst-order predicate calculus, Euclidean ge- ometry. They aren’t complex enough to qualify as “G¨odelian.” Such comments are based on a misunderstanding due to an unfortunate overloading in logic of the term “complete.” Euclidean geometry (suitably restricted and axiomatized) is indeed a complete theory in the sense of the incompleteness theorem, that is, every statement in the language of the 127 128 7. Gödel’s Completeness Theorem theory is either provable or disprovable in the theory. This result, like the completeness of the elementary theory of the real numbers mentioned in Section 2.3, to which it is closely related, was proved by Alfred Tarski in the early 1930s. But ﬁrst-order predicate calculus is not complete in this sense. So what does the completeness theorem mean? Here we need to recall that a formal axiomatic system has a formal language, a set of axioms formulated in that language, and a set of rules of reasoning for drawing conclusions from those axioms. In the case of what is called a ﬁrst-order theory, the language of the system is of a kind known as a ﬁrst-order pred- icate language, and the rules of reasoning include (and often consist solely of) some version of the rules of ﬁrst-order predicate logic. That ﬁrst-order predicate logic is complete means that these rules suﬃce to derive from the axioms every sentence that is a logical consequence of the axioms. Since, conversely, every sentence derivable from a set of axioms using the rules of reasoning is a logical consequence of those axioms, it follows that the theorems of a ﬁrst-order theory are precisely the sentences that are logical consequences of the axioms of the theory. The present chapter contains a fairly brief explanation of ﬁrst-order logic and a discussion of how the completeness theorem for predicate logic relates to the incompleteness theorem. A reader who ﬁnds the topic unre- warding need only retain from it that what is “complete,” in the sense of the completeness theorem for predicate logic ﬁrst proved by G¨odel, is not an axiomatic theory, but the logical apparatus common to PA and ZFC and all formal systems known as ﬁrst-order theories. That this logical appara- tus is complete means that it suﬃces to deduce every logical consequence of the axioms of any such formal system. First-order predicate logic has been an important part of logic since it was ﬁrst formulated as a set of formal rules of inference in the latter part of the nineteenth century, chieﬂy by the German mathematician, logician, and philosopher Gottlob Frege. In Frege’s formulation, the rules of ﬁrst- order logic were not separated from the other parts of his logical system, and it was only in the early decades of the twentieth century that the distinctive character of ﬁrst-order logic came to be understood. There are diﬀerent formulations of the logical apparatus of ﬁrst-order logic. Some versions include special logical axioms, so that one distinguishes between the “logical” and the “non-logical” axioms of a theory, where the logical axioms are common to all theories. Other versions have no logical axioms, but only logical rules of reasoning. In this book, for clarity and consistency, 7.1. The Theorem 129 the logical apparatus of a theory has been assumed to be formulated wholly in terms of rules of reasoning. First-Order Logical Consequence To illustrate the notion of logical consequence, let us introduce a sim- ple ﬁrst-order predicate language. In such a language, we can formulate statements about the individuals in some domain of individuals, using a collection of predicates to express properties of and relations between in- dividuals. In our example of a ﬁrst-order language we can say that an individual has the property of being a fnoﬄe, and that one individual glo- rfs another. We say that “fnoﬄe” is a unary predicate and “glorfs” is a binary predicate. To form complex sentences we have at hand the logical constructions “if-then,” “not,” “or,” “and,” “if and only if,” and we also use variables ranging over the domain of individuals to express statements of the form “for every (individual) x it holds that. . . ” and “there is at least one (individual) x such that. . . .” Let us consider a few examples of sentence in this language, and how they might be formulated in ordinary language. • There is at least one fnoﬄe: there is an x such that x is a fnoﬄe. • No fnoﬄe glorfs itself: for every x, if x is a fnoﬄe it is not the case that x glorfs x. • Every fnoﬄe is a fnoﬄe: for every x, if x is a fnoﬄe then x is a fnoﬄe. • Every fnoﬄe is glorfed by at least one fnoﬄe: for every x, if x is a fnoﬄe then there is a y such that y is a fnoﬄe and y glorfs x. • There is a fnoﬄe which glorfs every fnoﬄe: there is an x such that x is a fnoﬄe and for every y, if y is a fnoﬄe then x glorfs y. In specifying the language, nothing is said about just what domain of individuals we are talking about, or what “x is a fnoﬄe” or “x glorfs y” is supposed to mean. The speciﬁcation of the language is just a matter of syntax, and does not involve any questions of meaning. (See Section 2.4.) We can, however, make the following observation: no matter what domain of individuals we are talking about, no matter what subset of that domain is singled out by “is a fnoﬄe,” and no matter what relation between in- dividuals is speciﬁed by “glorfs,” if the ﬁfth sentence above is true, then 130 7. Gödel’s Completeness Theorem the fourth sentence is also true. This is what is meant by saying that the fourth sentence is a logical consequence (in ﬁrst-order logic) of the ﬁfth sentence. We can also verify that the ﬁfth sentence is not in this sense a logical consequence of the fourth sentence. For suppose we take the do- main of individuals to contain only 0 and 1, interpret “is a fnoﬄe” as “is a member of the domain,” and interpret “x glorfs y”as “x is identical with y.” Then the fourth sentence is true, but the ﬁfth sentence is false. The third sentence above is an example of a logically true statement: it is true no matter what domain of individuals we choose, and no matter what “is a fnoﬄe” is taken to mean in that domain. In a formulation of predicate logic that includes logical axioms, those axioms are logically true statements. Thus, informally speaking, to say that a sentence A in a ﬁrst-order language is a logical consequence of a set M of sentences in that language means that for any domain of individuals, and for any speciﬁcation of what the predicates used in the language mean when applied to individuals in that domain, if every sentence in M is true (when understood in accordance with this speciﬁcation), then so is A. An interpretation of a ﬁrst-order lan- guage is a structure consisting of a domain of individuals together with subsets of that domain and relations between elements in the domain cor- responding to the predicates of the language. An interpretation is called a model of a ﬁrst-order theory T if all the axioms of T are true when read using that interpretation. So another way of formulating the concept of logical consequence is that A is a logical consequence of the axioms of T if A is true in every model of T . Soundness and Completeness of the Rules of Logic The formal rules of logical reasoning used in a ﬁrst-order theory have the property of being sound with respect to the notion of logical consequence. What this means is that anything that can be proved from a set of axioms using these rules of reasoning is also a logical consequence of the axioms in the sense deﬁned. The soundness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic establishes that this is the case. What the completeness theorem shows is that the converse holds: if A is in fact a logical consequence of a set of axioms, then there is a proof of A using those axioms and the logical rules of reasoning. Recalling that a model of a theory is an interpretation in which all of the axioms of the theory are true, we can formulate the completeness theorem combined with the soundness theorem as the statement that for a 7.2. PA as a First-Order Theory 131 ﬁrst-order theory T , A sentence A is true in every model of T if and only if A is a theorem of T , and also as the statement that for a ﬁrst-order theory T , T has a model if and only if T is consistent. No proof of the completeness theorem will be given in this book, but we can see that each of these two formulations of the theorems follows from the other. The second formulation follows from the ﬁrst by taking A to be a logical contradiction “B and not-B,” while the ﬁrst formulation follows if we apply the second formulation to the theory T + not-A. (The com- pleteness theorem in fact holds also for the more liberal notion of “theory” explained in Section 4.3.) We will take a closer look at these concepts in the particular case of PA. 7.2 PA as a First-Order Theory The language of PA contains function symbols, which did not ﬁgure in the “fnoﬄe” example. Function symbols denote operations on individuals in the domain, and in the language of PA we have symbols + for addition and × for multiplication. There is also a constant, the symbol 0 denoting the number zero, and a special symbol s for the successor function, which applied to a number n gives n + 1. In the following we will use the notation n, where n is any natural number, for the expression built up from 0 using n occurrences of s, so that 0 is 0, 1 is s(0), 2 is s(s(0)), and so on. The expressions n correspond to the numerals used in ordinary mathematical language to denote natural numbers. There is only one predicate in the language of PA, namely = denoting the equality relation. Those rules for = that are not peculiar to arithmetic, for example the rule by which we conclude that a = b if b = c and c = a, are sometimes, but not always, regarded as part of the logical apparatus of the theory. Here we will follow this approach (taking PA to be formalized in “predicate logic with equal- ity”) and describe the speciﬁc content of PA in terms of its arithmetical axioms. In the above presentation, the language of PA was speciﬁed together with the interpretation of the language that we normally use, known as “the intended interpretation” or “the standard model.” But of course there are 132 7. Gödel’s Completeness Theorem other interpretations of the language of PA, as will be commented on and illustrated below. The axioms of PA fall into four groups. First, we have the axioms for the successor function, which state that 0 is not the successor of any number, and diﬀerent numbers have diﬀerent successors. Formulated in predicate logic, these are For every x, it is not the case that s(x) = 0. For every x, for every y, if s(x) = s(y) then x = y. The second group of axioms give the basic properties of the addition operation: For every x, x + 0 = x. For every x, for every y, x + s(y) = s(x + y). The axioms in the third group do the same for multiplication: For every x, x × 0= 0. For every x, for every y, x × s(y) = x × y + x. The axioms for addition and multiplication are all we need to be able to prove every true statement of the form n + m = k or n × m = k. Using the axioms for the successor function we can also disprove every false statement of this form. The ﬁnal group of axioms consists of the induction axioms. For every property P of natural numbers expressible in the language of PA, there is an axiom stating that if 0 has the property P and s(x) has the property P whenever x has the property, then for every x, x has the property P . Here, P may be deﬁned using parameters, so that, for example, there is an axiom stating For every y, if 0 + y = y + 0 and it holds for every x that if x + y = y + x then s(x) + y = y + s(x), then for every x, x + y = y + x. This particular induction axiom enters into the proof in PA that x+y = y + x for every x and y. 7.2. PA as a First-Order Theory 133 Presburger Arithmetic If we drop the multiplication symbol from the language of PA and delete the multiplication axioms, we get a theory known as Presburger arithmetic (after the Polish mathematician who introduced this theory in 1929). Pres- burger arithmetic is another example (in addition to the elementary theory of the real numbers mentioned in Section 2.3) of a theory which is com- plete without being at all trivial. Unlike PA, Presburger arithmetic can be ﬁnitely axiomatized, that is, it is possible to replace the inﬁnitely many induction axioms with a ﬁnite number of other axioms and get a theory with the same theorems. A Consistency Proof In Section 2.8, in an argument against the idea of the incompleteness theo- rem leading to a “postmodern condition” in mathematics, it was observed that we can create an inﬁnite tree of consistent variants of PA by omitting the axiom “for every x, x + 0 = x” and adding 0 + 0 = 0 or its negation to PA, then to each of the two resulting theories add either 1 + 0 = 1 or its negation, and so on. Using the description given of PA and the soundness theorem for pred- icate logic, we can verify that all of these theories are indeed consistent, by showing that they all have models. In fact we can show that if we leave out the axiom “for every x, x + 0 = x,” the result of an addition n + 0 can be anything. Suppose we replace the indicated axiom with an inﬁnite number of axioms: 0 + 0 = n0, 1 + 0 = n1, 2 + 0 = n2, . . . where n0, n1, n2,. . . is any computably enumerable sequence of numbers. We can deﬁne a model of the resulting theory as follows. The domain is again the set of natural numbers, the constant 0 is interpreted as denoting the number 0, and the successor operation has its ordinary interpretation. Note that this is enough to ensure that the induction axioms will still hold, whatever the interpretation of + and ×. We change the interpretation of + to denote the operation + ′ deﬁned by k + ′ m = nk + m. It is still true that k+ ′s(m) = s(k+ ′m). To make the axioms for × true, we now need to interpret k × m not as the ordinary product of k and m, 134 7. Gödel’s Completeness Theorem but as k × ′ m where we deﬁne the operation × ′ on natural numbers by the equations k × ′ 0= 0, k × ′ s(m) = k × ′ m + ′ k. Thus, all of the theories in the uninteresting inﬁnite tree of theories de- scribed in Section 2.8 are consistent. “True in the Standard Model” The idea is sometimes expressed that instead of speaking of arithmetical statements as true or false, we should say that they are “true in the stan- dard model” or “false in the standard model.” The following comment illustrates: This is the source of popular observations of the sort: if Gold- bach’s conjecture is undecidable in PA, then it is true. This is actually accurate, if we are careful to add “in the standard model” at the end of the sentence. The idea in such comments seems to be that if we say that an arithmeti- cal statement A is “true” instead of carefully saying “true in the standard model,” we are saying that A is true in every model of PA. This idea can only arise as a result of an over-exposure to logic. In any ordinary math- ematical context, to say that Goldbach’s conjecture is true is the same as saying that every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes. PA and models of PA are of concern only in very special contexts, and most mathematicians have no need to know anything at all about these things. It may of course have a point to say “true in the standard model” for emphasis in contexts where one is in fact talking about diﬀerent models of PA. 7.3 Incompleteness and Nonstandard Models An incorrect formulation of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem that is some- times encountered is illustrated by the following: In any consistent theory T of a certain degree of complexity there will be a statement expressible in the language of T that is true in all models of T and yet not provable in T . 7.3. Incompleteness and Nonstandard Models 135 As we know from the completeness theorem, this statement is incorrect when we are talking about ﬁrst-order theories like PA and ZFC. If a sen- tence A in the language of PA is true in every model of PA, it is provable in PA. By the incompleteness theorem, the completeness theorem for ﬁrst- order logic, and the consistency of PA, the theory obtained by adding to PA an arithmetization A of “PA is inconsistent” as a new axiom has a model. That is, there is a mathematical structure consisting of some set N ′ together with operations s ′, + ′, and × ′ on the set N ′ such that all of the axioms of PA are true if we take s, +, and × to denote those operations on N ′, and furthermore A is also true. Since A is not true on its ordinary interpretation, that is, with the quantiﬁers taken to range over the natural numbers and + and × denoting ordinary addition and multiplication, it follows that the model of PA given by N ′, s ′, + ′, and × ′ is essentially diﬀerent from the standard model. We can in fact say a bit more. N ′ contains a part that is essentially the same as the ordinary natural numbers, namely the individuals in N ′ denoted by the terms 0, s(0), s(s(0)),. . . , and for these individuals, + and × have their usual meaning. But in addition, N ′ contains other members, which are usually called inﬁnite elements. The reason for this terminology is that for any individual a in N ′ which is not the value of m for any natural number m, n < a is true in N ′ for every n. (Here we deﬁne x < y to mean that y = x + s(z) for some z.) This follows from the fact that it is provable in PA that for every x and y, either x < y or y < x or x = y, and that it is also provable, for every natural number n, that if x < n then x = 0 or x = 1 or . . . or x = n − 1. So if a is not the value of any m, we must have n < a. A model of PA containing inﬁnite elements is known as a nonstandard model. There are many diﬀerent nonstandard models of PA, but essentially only one standard model. Although we can deﬁne the natural numbers in many diﬀerent ways (for example, using set theory), as long as every natural number is the value of n for some n, the diﬀerent models are isomorphic, meaning that they have exactly the same mathematical structure. In a model of PA + “PA is inconsistent” there is an element e satisfying the condition expressed by the arithmetical formula that we introduce to formalize “x is the G¨odel number of a proof in PA of a contradiction.” Since e is an inﬁnite element, it is not in fact a G¨odel number. The operations + ′ and × ′ in the nonstandard model are not multiplication and addition when applied to inﬁnite elements, and the arithmetical deﬁnition of “x is 136 7. Gödel’s Completeness Theorem the G¨odel number of a proof in PA,” when applied to an inﬁnite element e, does not express that e is the G¨odel number of anything. Nonstandard models of arithmetic are studied in logic, but they also have a role to play in mathematics in general through the subject of non- standard analysis. This is a subject created in the 1960s by the American logician Abraham Robinson, who used predicate logic to introduce a theory of the “inﬁnitely small” within which the concepts and reasoning in calcu- lus used by Newton and Leibniz, the creators of calculus, can be rigorously represented. Nonstandard analysis is a lively subject and a prominent ex- ample of how mathematical logic has been put to mathematical use. But it should not be assumed that we need to add a false existential axiom to PA in order to get a nonstandard model. On the contrary, the nonstandard models of arithmetic used in nonstandard analysis have exactly the same true arithmetical statements as the standard model. This can be achieved because the existence of nonstandard models of PA is not tied to incom- pleteness at all. Even true arithmetic (see Section 4.3) has nonstandard models. This follows from the completeness theorem. True arithmetic T , which is a theory only in a generalized sense, has every true arithmetical sentence as an axiom. Consider the theory obtained by adding to the ax- ioms of T the new axioms c > 0, c > 1, c > 2,. . . , where c is a new constant symbol. If this theory is inconsistent, T together with some ﬁnite number of the new axioms is inconsistent, since only ﬁnitely many axioms of T can be used in a proof. But T with any ﬁnite number of new axioms has a model, obtained by interpreting c as denoting a suﬃciently large natural number, and hence is consistent. So T with all of the new axioms is also consistent and has a model by the completeness theorem, a model which contains an inﬁnite element denoted by c. (In logic, this reasoning is known as an application of the compactness theorem.) Thus, the diﬀerence between standard and nonstandard models of PA cannot be formulated in the language of elementary arithmetic. A non- standard model may have exactly the same true sentences in the language of elementary arithmetic as the standard model. This fact has prompted many a commentator to agonize over how we distinguish between the stan- dard and nonstandard models, but this is not a question directly connected with the incompleteness theorem, as noted, and so will not be taken up in this book. 8 Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity 8.1 Incompleteness and Complexity In Section 2.2 it was commented that the common popular formulation of the incompleteness theorem as applying to any formal system of “suﬃcient complexity” is misleading at best, since there are very complex systems to which the theorem does not apply and very simple ones to which it does apply. Most often in such misleading formulations of the incompleteness theorem, “complexity” is perhaps used in an informal sense. In such a case it suﬃces to look at a system like Robinson arithmetic (deﬁned in the Ap- pendix) to see that very simple systems can encompass the “certain amount of arithmetic” needed for the incompleteness theorem to apply. In the other direction, it is a simple matter to formulate complete and consistent theo- ries of impenetrable complexity. So if we use “complexity” in an informal sense, there is no correlation between complexity and incompleteness. There is also a technical sense of “complexity” in logic, variously known as Kolmogorov complexity, Solomonoﬀ complexity, Chaitin complexity (and various combinations of these names), algorithmic complexity, information- theoretic complexity, and program-size complexity. The most common des- ignation is “Kolmogorov complexity”—as remarked in [Li and Vitanyi 97], this is probably a manifestation of the principle of “Them that’s got shall get,” since Kolmogorov is the most famous of these mathematicians. Again, the applicability of the incompleteness theorem does not turn on the com- 137 138 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity plexity of a system in this technical sense, but there are connections be- tween incompleteness and Kolmogorov complexity. In particular, the appli- cation of Kolmogorov complexity to prove the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem has been widely popularized by Gregory Chaitin, one of the people who independently invented the concept. Chaitin’s Incompleteness Theorem The concept of Kolmogorov complexity can be varied in many ways without aﬀecting the aspects here to be considered. In extended theoretical treat- ments, the various technical concepts of complexity are usually applied to binary sequences, or bit strings, like 0110101010011, and the theory of Tur- ing machines is used for technical deﬁnitions. Here, we will use instead the theory of computable properties of strings of symbols informally introduced in Chapter 3. The basic idea is a simple one: we measure the complexity of a string s by the length, not of s itself, but of the shortest string containing infor- mation that enables us to compute the string s, in the form of a program that when executed outputs s, together with any input required by the program. For example, the complexity of the numerical string s consisting of the ﬁrst one billion decimals of π is very small compared to the length of the string, since there are short programs for computing the decimals of π, and to get a program for producing the string s we need only add to such a program the instruction to stop after one billion decimals. We say that this string is highly compressible: its Kolmogorov complexity is small compared to its length. The opposite property is that of being highly incompressible, when the complexity of a string is close to its length. For any n greater than, say, 1000, the vast majority of strings of length n are highly incompressible. In particular for every n there is at least one string of length n which is maximally incompressible, having complexity n. (This follows by a simple counting argument: the number of programs of length smaller than n is at most 1 + 2 + 4 + . . . + 2 n−1 = 2 n − 1, while there are 2 n strings of length n.) Incompressible strings are “typical,” or “random,” containing no pattern that makes it possible to give an algorithm for pro- ducing the string that is signiﬁcantly shorter than the string itself. In the case of a maximally incompressible string, an algorithm for producing the string can do no better than explicitly listing the symbols in the string. Thus, one would expect a genuinely random sequence of symbols (gen- erated by observing physical processes like radioactive decay or the ﬂow 8.1. Incompleteness and Complexity 139 of lava lamps) to be incompressible. However, proving that a particular sequence is incompressible is a diﬀerent matter. Suppose T is a consistent formal system incorporating the usual “cer- tain amount of arithmetic.” Chaitin’s incompleteness theorem states that there is then a number c depending on T such that T does not prove any statement of the form “the complexity of the string s is greater than c.” Since there are true such statements, it follows that unless T proves false statements about complexity, there are statements of the form “the com- plexity of the string s is greater than c” that are undecidable in T . We can formulate the essence of the argument showing this in semi- formal terms. Let K(s) denote the Kolmogorov complexity of a string s. Suppose there are arbitrarily large n such that the consistent theory T proves K(s) > n for some s, and that the string t gives suﬃcient infor- mation to enable us to computably generate the theorems of T . Choose n so that n minus the number of digits in a numerical string denoting n is several times larger than the length of t. To produce a string of com- plexity larger than n, we need only search through the theorems of T until we ﬁnd the ﬁrst theorem of the form K(s) > n. But this means that we can produce s using only the information t (giving T ) together with the numerical string denoting n (to tell us what we are looking for), and the complexity of this combined information is much smaller than n, which yields a contradiction. Before discussing this result further, a second and more formal proof of the theorem follows for readers who wish to understand the result in its technical aspects. Recall from Section 3.3 the computable enumeration P0, P1, P2, . . . of the set of programs which expect one string as input, and when executed either deliver a string as output or else never terminate. For any string s, there are inﬁnitely many i and w such that Pi with input w yields s as output. For example, if Pi is a program that simply returns its input as output, Pi with input s yields s as output. In deﬁning Kolmogorov complexity (in this particular formulation), we are looking for the shortest way of specifying s by specifying a program and an input for that program which yields s as output. Thus we deﬁne K(s) as the length of the shortest pair (i, w) such that Pi with input w yields output s. It will be noted that the Kolmogorov complexity of a string thus de- ﬁned depends on a particular choice of enumeration of programs. But it 140 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity can be shown that for any two computable enumerations of programs that might be used, the resulting complexity measures K1(s) and K2(s) are es- sentially equivalent, in the sense that there is some constant c, depending on K1 and K2 but independent of s, such that |K1(s) − K2(s)| < c for all s. This implies that the various results of a qualitative nature that we arrive at using the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, such as Chaitin’s incom- pleteness theorem, are independent of exactly how we deﬁne complexity. (This also extends to various other ways of deﬁning the concept, which in general yield measures of complexity that diﬀer by a term logarithmic in the length of s.) We cannot, however, attach any great signiﬁcance to quantitative results associated with a particular deﬁnition of K(s). The reference above to “the length of the pair (i, w)” calls for some words of explanation. Given any strings s and t, the pair (s, t) is deﬁned as another string, from which s and t can both be read oﬀ. Thus given a pair, the two strings that compose the pair are uniquely determined. The exact deﬁnition of (s, t) doesn’t matter here, but one way of deﬁning the pair (s, t) is the following. Suppose s has length n. Then (s, t) consists of n occurrences of 1 followed by a 0, followed by s and then t. Thus, for example, if s is “abcdef” and t is “ghijk,” (s, t) is the string 1111110abcdefghijk The two strings in the pair (s, t) can be read oﬀ by ﬁrst counting the number of 1s before the ﬁrst 0, and then picking out s as the string consisting of the indicated number of symbols immediately following the 0, while t is the remainder of the string. This is called a self-delimiting representation of the pair formed by s and t. Note that if s has length n and t has length m, the length of (s, t) is 2n + m + 1. An important feature of Kolmogorov complexity is that a statement of the form K(s) > n can be assumed to be a Goldbach-like statement. This is so because it can be formulated as the statement For every m and for every pair (i, w) of length smaller than or equal to n, it is not the case that m steps in the computation of Pi with input w yields s as output. As a consequence, if a consistent theory proves K(s) > n, s does indeed have complexity greater than n. To prove Chaitin’s incompleteness theorem we also need a computable enumeration of the computably enumerable sets: W0, W1, W2, . . .. 8.1. Incompleteness and Complexity 141 We deﬁne the set Wi as the set of strings s for which Pi terminates with s as input. Wi is computably enumerable, because the set of true statements of the form Pi terminates after n steps when given input s is computably decidable, so by generating all true statements of this form and delivering s as output for every true statement found, we get a com- putable enumeration of Wi. Conversely, every computably enumerable set E is identical with Wi for some (and in fact for inﬁnitely many) i. This is so because if E is computably enumerable, E is the set of strings s for which the search for s in a computable enumeration of E terminates. What if Wi is ﬁnite? The procedure described will in such a case not halt after every member of Wi has been generated, but will instead con- tinue forever even after every element of Wi has already been delivered. This is in fact a necessary feature. There is no computable enumeration of the computably enumerable sets that allows us to determine which com- putably enumerable sets are ﬁnite, or only includes the inﬁnite computably enumerable sets. This is why, in the deﬁnition of computably enumerable sets, we allow an enumeration of a ﬁnite set to continue forever. For the proof of the theorem, we begin by deﬁning a particular program Pe, which when given as input any pair (p, k), where p and k are numerical strings, starts looking for a sentence in Wp of the form “the complexity of w is greater than the length of the pair (k, (p, k)).” If and when it ﬁnds such a sentence in Wp, the string w is output as the result of the computation. Now, given a theory T , choose Wp as the set of theorems of T . Suppose Pe terminates for input (p, e) with result w. By the deﬁnition of complexity, the complexity of w is at most the length of (e, (p, e)). But if T is consistent, the complexity of w is greater than the length of (e, (p, e)). Thus, assuming T consistent, T does not prove any theorem of the form “the complexity of w is greater than c,” where c is the length of the pair (e, (p, e)). In the pair (e, (p, e)), e is independent of T , while p is an index for the set of theorems of T —to specify the theorems of T it suﬃces to specify p. It is reasonable to regard the minimal length of such a p as a measure of the complexity K(T ) of the theory T , and indeed it gives essentially the same measure of complexity as do other natural choices. By suitably modifying and tweaking the deﬁnition of complexity, the incompleteness theorem can in fact be formulated as stating that, for some 142 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity constant c independent of T , T does not prove any statement of the form K(s) > n for any n greater than K(T ) + c (see [Chaitin 92]). The neatness of this formulation does not really add anything to the result, though, since neither the constant c nor the complexity measure used has any special signiﬁcance. (See [van Lambalgen 89] and [Raatikainen 98].) A consequence of Chaitin’s incompleteness theorem is that the com- plement of the set of maximally incompressible strings, that is, the set of strings s with complexity smaller than the length of s, is a simple set in Post’s sense (see Section 3.3). For the strings s with K(s) smaller than the length of s can be computably enumerated by sifting through the state- ments of the form “m steps in the computation of Pi with input w yields output s.” Furthermore, there cannot be any inﬁnite computably enu- merable set of maximally incompressible strings, since that would yield an inﬁnite set Wp of true statements of the form “the complexity of s is greater than or equal to the length of s” and therewith a theory proving statements of the form “the complexity of s is greater than n” for arbitrarily large n. Thus, a consistent theory can prove only ﬁnitely many statements of the form “s is a maximally incompressible string.” When we inspect the proof that there are unprovable true statements of the form “the string s is maximally incompressible” in any consistent theory T , we see that the proof does not yield any explicit example of such a statement. If we had a general mechanism for producing, given a consistent theory, a true sentence of this form unprovable in the theory, we would be able to computably generate an inﬁnite number of true such statements, which cannot be done. Thus, since “s is incompressible” is a Goldbach-like statement, we also cannot produce any statement of this form that we know to be undecidable in T . For any T , we can produce an n such that “s is an incompressible string of length n” is not provable in T for any s, but to know that a particular statement of this form is unde- cidable in T , we need to know that s is in fact an incompressible string of length n. As noted by Chaitin (for example, in his paper “G¨odel’s Theorem and Information” [Chaitin 82]), the proof of his incompleteness theorem is re- lated to what is known as Berry’s paradox, in the way that G¨odel’s original proof is related to the paradox of the Liar. Berry’s paradox (named after G. G. Berry, librarian at the Bodleian Library in Oxford and immortalized in a footnote in Principia Mathematica) consists in the observation that the smallest number not deﬁnable using fewer than a hundred words has just been deﬁned using fewer than a hundred words. (Another proof of 8.1. Incompleteness and Complexity 143 the incompleteness theorem exploiting Berry’s paradox has been given by George Boolos [Boolos 89].) Complexity as a Supposed Explanation of Incompleteness Some of the comments that Chaitin has made about his incompleteness theorem in various places have given many of his readers the impression that the theorem sheds light on the grounds for incompleteness in general. Thus, in the abstract of [Chaitin 82], Chaitin states that G¨odel’s theorem may be demonstrated using arguments having an information-theoretic ﬂavour. In such an approach it is pos- sible to argue that if a theorem contains more information than a given set of axioms then it is impossible for the theorem to be derived from the axioms. In contrast with the traditional proof based on the paradox of the liar, this new viewpoint suggests that the incompleteness phenomenon discovered by G¨odel is natural and widespread rather than pathological and unusual. It is unclear what Chaitin intends by “it is possible to argue. . . ,” or in the body of the paper by the remark that “I would like to be able to say that if one has ten pounds of axioms and a twenty-pound theorem, then that theorem cannot be derived from those axioms.” By “contains more information,” Chaitin means “has greater Kolmogorov complexity,” and apparently what Chaitin has in mind in these comments is his incom- pleteness theorem. This theorem, however, doesn’t say anything about the complexity of the theorems of a theory, but instead deals with theorems that are statements about complexity. It is indeed the case that a true state- ment of the form “K(s) > n” must itself have complexity greater than n, since the string s can be extracted from it. But this does not mean that it is the complexity of the statement that accounts for its being unprovable in the theory. It is by no means the case that a theorem cannot have greater complexity than the axioms from which it is derived. For example, if we have as our only axiom “for every string x, x = x,” this yields a theory with very low complexity. Among the theorems of this theory, however, are the statements of the form “s = s” for any speciﬁc string s, and thus the Kolmogorov complexity of the theorems is unbounded. So while it may be “possible to argue” that the theorems of a theory cannot be more complex than its axioms, and while it may be that Chaitin “would like to be able 144 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity to say” that a fat theorem cannot be derived from skinny axioms, such statements have no apparent justiﬁcation. In fact Chaitin in [Chaitin 92] notes as much, and proposes an “im- proved version” of the “heuristic principle” that the complexity of a theo- rem cannot exceed that of the axioms: One cannot prove a theorem from a set of axioms that is of greater complexity than the axioms and know that one has done this. I.e., one cannot realize that a theorem is of substantially greater complexity than the axioms from which it has been deduced, if this should happen to be the case. Chaitin suggests no justiﬁcation for this “improved version,” and it is not obvious what such a justiﬁcation might look like. For any string s, we can prove s = s from the axiom “for every string x, x = x.” The quoted principle implies that we can never know that any string s has higher complexity than the string “for every string x, x = x,” a baseless claim. Chaitin concludes with the reﬂection that “Perhaps it is better to avoid all these problems and discussions by rephrasing our fundamental principle in the following totally unobjectionable form: a set of axioms of complexity N cannot yield a theorem that asserts that a speciﬁc object is of complexity substantially greater than N .” This is unobjectionable as a formulation of his incompleteness theorem in the form “T does not prove K(s) > n for any n greater than K(T ) + c,” if we keep in mind that it depends on a particular choice of complexity measure and that the constant c may be enormous, rendering the description “not substantially greater” moot. This is a special case of the incompleteness phenomenon, one that we can understand on the basis of informal arguments such as the one presented earlier. As for the contrasting of the “new viewpoint” with “the old proof based on the paradox of the liar,” proofs of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem based on computability theory have been around for a long time, as Chaitin him- self notes. In particular, the MRDP theorem (see Section 3.3) shows that every theory to which the incompleteness theorem applies leaves unde- cided inﬁnitely many statements of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1,. . . ,xn) = 0 has no solution.” It is indeed important to emphasize that undecidable arithmetical sentences need not be formalizations of odd self-referential statements, but this point is fully illustrated by the unde- cidability of statements about Diophantine equations. 8.2. Incompleteness and Randomness 145 8.2 Incompleteness and Randomness Incompressible strings are also called (Kolmogorov) random strings. While randomness in this sense is a matter of degree, there is also a notion of random inﬁnite sequences of symbols or numbers, on which a sequence is random or not random, without gradation. The deﬁnition of this property is rather more technical than the deﬁnition of the Kolmogorov complexity of strings and will not be given here. There is a particular such random inﬁnite bit sequence (that is, a sequence of occurrences of 0 and 1) deﬁned and introduced by Chaitin, called “the halting probability” or Ω (Omega), with several interesting properties. The sequence Ω is the limit of a certain computable enumeration r1, r2, r3,. . . of ﬁnite strings of bits, in the sense that the nth bit of Ω is i if and only if there is some k such that the nth bit of rm is i for every m> k. Ω itself is not computable: there is no eﬀective enumeration of the bits of Ω. We can compute the strings r1, r2, r3,. . . , and we know that for any bit position n in Ω, the strings r1, r2, r3,. . . will eventually stabilize so that every later string rk has the same nth bit, which is also the nth bit of Ω, but we cannot in general decide at what point the nth bit has been arrived at. Chaitin proves the stronger statement that only ﬁnitely many state- ments of the form “the nth bit of Ω is i” can be correctly decided in any one formal system, and he also proves, using a suitable deﬁnition of com- plexity, that a formal system of complexity n can determine at most n + c bits of Ω, for some constant c. So what is the signiﬁcance of Ω for incompleteness? Chaitin, in the preface to his book The Unknowable, states In a nutshell, G¨odel discovered incompleteness, Turing discov- ered uncomputability, and I discovered randomness—that’s the amazing fact that some mathematical statements are true for no reason, they’re true by accident. The statements that Chaitin is referring to would appear to be the true statements of the form “The nth bit of Ω is i.” “True for no rea- son” suggests that these statements are in some absolute sense unprovable by “reasoning,” and indeed Chaitin elsewhere (“Irreducible Complexity in Pure Mathematics”) ampliﬁes: In essence, the only way to prove such mathematical facts is to directly assume them as new mathematical axioms, without using reasoning at all. 146 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity We will take a closer look at this idea below, but ﬁrst we need to take notice of the fact that Chaitin also calls these statements “true by acci- dent,” emphasizing the “randomness” of Ω. In his recent book MetaMath, he comments Now we’re really going to get irreducible mathematical facts, mathematical facts that “are true for no reason,” and which simulate in pure math, as much as is possible, independent tosses of a fair coin: It’s the bits of the base-two expansion of the halting probability Ω. This suggests that statements of the form “The nth bit of Ω is i”are “true for no reason” in a sense analogous to that in which it may be “true for no reason” that, say, an atom decays at a particular time. When we say that radioactive decay is “truly random,” we mean that there is no mechanism that causes an atom to decay at a particular moment and that a statistical description of radioactive decay tells us all there is to know about it. But of course Ω is not deﬁned in terms of any physical experiments, and we have no conception of any “mathematical mechanism” or “laws of mathematics” by which some mathematical statements are caused to be true whereas others just happen to be true. If we are not talking about proofs and reasoning, but about what makes a statement true, all we can say is that Goldbach’s conjecture, if true, is true because every even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes, a statement “the nth bit of Ω is i,” if true, is true because i is the limit of the nth bit of the mathematically deﬁned sequence r1, r2, r3,. . . of ﬁnite strings of bits, and so on. The mere fact that Ω is called a “random sequence” does not confer any automatic meaning on a claim that the bits of Ω are random in any sense analogous to the randomness that may exist in nature. Indeed, Chaitin himself goes on to emphasize that Ω is a mathematically deﬁned sequence, and that it may be preferable to use some other term than “random” to describe it. He suggests “irreducible”: In other words, the bits of Ω are logically irreducible, they can- not be obtained from axioms simpler than they are. Finally! We’ve found a way to simulate independent tosses of a fair coin, we’ve found “atomic” mathematical facts, an inﬁnite series of math facts that have no connection with each other and that are, so to speak, “true for no reason” (no reason simpler than they are). 8.2. Incompleteness and Randomness 147 This brings us back to the idea that these statements can only be postu- lated, not proved in any more interesting sense, which in the above passage seems to be based on their not being “obtainable from simpler axioms.” Let’s take a closer look at this idea. Given any concept of “simpler,” if the degree of simplicity of a string is given by a natural number, it is trivially the case that there are true arithmetical statements that cannot be logically derived from simpler true statements. For example, the simplest statement among the true statements that logically imply “0 = 0” cannot be logically derived from any simpler true statement. Indeed, on many natural measures of simplicity, “0 = 0” itself will have this property. The “amazing fact” Chaitin speaks of thus cannot be just the fact that there exist true statements that cannot be deduced from simpler true statements. There are of course signiﬁcant diﬀerences between “0 = 0” and state- ments of the form “The nth bit of Ω is i.” In particular, such statements are not trivially or obviously true, but instead pose mathematical prob- lems and call for a proof. But nor is there any apparent basis for claiming that they “cannot be obtained from axioms simpler than they are.” The result that a formal system of complexity n can determine at most n + c bits of Ω doesn’t tell us that, for example, “The 1000th bit of Ω is 0,” if true, can only be proved by assuming the statement as an axiom. Which particular statements about the bits of Ω that can be proved in a given system depends on the system and on the details in the deﬁnition of Ω. In particular, for any n, the parameters in the deﬁnition of Ω can be chosen so as to allow us to prove every true statement of the form “the kth bit of Ω is i”for k < n. For a natural choice of those parameters, Calude et al. [Calude et al. 01] computed the ﬁrst 64 bits of Ω. Let us consider instead statements of the form “the ﬁrst n bits of Ω are given by s,” where s is a bit string of length n. The randomness of Ω implies that there is some constant c such that the complexity of the string Ω1:n of the ﬁrst n bits of Ω, using a suitable deﬁnition of complexity, is always no smaller than n − c for some c independent of n. Thus for large enough n, Ω1:n is incompressible (to any degree we care to specify), and a true statement of the form “the ﬁrst n bits of Ω are given by s” cannot be gen- erated by an algorithm using as input a string (essentially) shorter than n. But we know that statements of enormous complexity can, in general, be proved from very simple axioms, even though there is no algorithm which yields any of those statements given a simple input. A special argument would be needed to show that suﬃciently long statements of this partic- ular form can only be proved using axioms of the same complexity, that 148 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity is (since these statements are incompressible) of the same length. Even if we could show this to be the case, there is no apparent basis for the idea that if reasoning can establish the truth of a statement B using axioms A, then the axioms A must be shorter than the statement B (an idea that neatly complements Chaitin’s other, contrary, “heuristic principle” that the complexity of a theorem cannot exceed that of the axioms from which it is derived). Chaitin does not present any argument for this idea, and it is not in agreement with our experience. Consider the statement There is a prime p such that 10000 10000 < p < 2 × 10000 10000. Reason is by no means powerless to prove this statement—it follows from Erd¨os’ nice elementary proof of Chebyshev’s theorem that there is always a prime between n and 2n. But for the proof we need to use various arithmetical axioms that have greater length and complexity, on any natu- ral measure, than the theorem we wish to prove. A justiﬁcation for the idea that statements of the form “the ﬁrst n bits of Ω are given by s” (for large enough n) can only be proved by postulation, not by reasoning, must be sought in some other aspect of these statements than the incompressibility of Ω1:n. Of course we know that reasoning formalizable in, for example, ZFC cannot prove any statement of this form for large enough n. (In fact, as Robert Solovay has shown, by suitably tweaking Chaitin’s deﬁnition of Ω, “large enough n” can mean “any n > 0.”) But to conclude that “reasoning” as such is powerless to establish these statements, we need some analysis or theory of reasoning in general (involving statements of arbitrary length), which is completely lacking in Chaitin’s writings. This is not to say that we have any grounds for claiming that statements about the bits of Ω, or statements of the form “K(s) > n,” are always “true for a reason” in any theoretical sense. Again, we simply don’t have any theoretical basis for reasoning about what can or cannot be proved or ex- plained or given a reason in any absolute sense. Chaitin’s claim to have discovered “the amazing fact that some mathematical statements are true for no reason” has no apparent content, but seems rather to be based on the general associations surrounding the word “random.” The instances of arithmetical incompleteness found using the theory of Kolmogorov com- plexity are still of considerable interest. 8.3. Incompleteness and Inﬁnity 149 8.3 Incompleteness and Inﬁnity Varieties of Incompleteness Many incomplete formal systems are designed to be incomplete, since their purpose is to specify certain features of a particular class of mathematical structures, the properties of which otherwise vary. A typical example is the elementary theory of groups, which deﬁnes what is meant by “a group”: it is a mathematical structure in which the axioms of the theory are true. The theory is incomplete, since, for example, some groups have a property called commutativity while others do not, and not all groups have the same number of members. Usually, theories introduced to characterize a class of mathematical structures do not satisfy the conditions for G¨odel’s theorem to apply, and their incompleteness is fairly obvious from their deﬁnition. However, even if we restrict consideration to theories that are not used to deﬁne a certain class of mathematical structures, but are formalizations of parts of our mathematical knowledge, theories to which the incomplete- ness theorem applies, there are signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the various incompleteness results proved in logic. Let us consider ZFC, Zermelo- Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice, which is a theory within which most of the mathematics done today is formalizable. ZFC is incom- plete in several dimensions. (In the following comments, the arithmetical soundness of ZFC, or in other words the truth of all arithmetical theorems of ZFC, will be taken for granted.) First, since the incompleteness theorem applies to ZFC, the arithmeti- cal component of ZFC is incomplete. In particular, ZFC does not prove its own consistency. From the MRDP theorem, we know that there are undecidable statements in ZFC of the form “The Diophantine equation D(x1,. . . ,xn) = 0 has no solution,” but the arithmetical statements known to be undecidable in ZFC (given the arithmetical soundness of ZFC) do not include any such problems that have been posed by mathematicians, or any problems about primes or other such matters of general mathemat- ical interest. Although it cannot be excluded on general logical grounds that, for example, the twin prime conjecture is undecidable in ZFC, there is no reason whatever to believe this to be the case, and a proof that the twin prime conjecture is undecidable in ZFC would be a mathematical sensa- tion comparable to the discovery of an advanced underground civilization on the planet Mars. 150 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity Second, the axioms of ZFC prove the existence of a profusion of inﬁnite sets, but leave many statements about these inﬁnite sets undecided. Most famous of these is Cantor’s continuum hypothesis (CH), which states that every inﬁnite subset of the set of real numbers either has the same cardi- nality as the set of real numbers itself or is countably inﬁnite. (We don’t need to go into what this means.) The continuum hypothesis is known to be undecidable in ZFC through work by G¨odel and Paul Cohen. Co- hen, building on G¨odel’s work in set theory, introduced a method called forcing, which has been extremely successful in proving statements about inﬁnite sets to be unprovable in ZFC. This method has nothing to do with G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem. CH is typical of statements shown to be undecidable in ZFC using these methods, in that neither CH nor not-CH implies any arithmetical statement that is not already provable in ZFC. (Also, only the consistency of ZFC needs to be assumed in proving that CH is undecidable in ZFC.) In his fundamental set-theoretical work establishing, among other things, the consistency of CH with the axioms of ZFC, G¨odel introduced a set- theoretical principle known as “the axiom of constructibility,” usually writ- ten “V = L.” V = L settles all, or practically all, of the known undecidable statements in the second category (although we also know that it has no arithmetical consequences which are not already provable in ZFC). Fur- thermore, G¨odel proved that V = L is consistent with the axioms of ZFC. (Thus, for undecidable statements in the second category, showing that they cannot be disproved in ZFC is often done by showing that they follow from V = L.) A reader who wishes to understand why V = L has neverthe- less not been incorporated into the standard axioms of set theory can turn to Shelah’s “Logical Dreams” [Shelah 03], which contains a more technical and searching discussion of several issues touched on in this ﬁnal part of the book. The third dimension of incompleteness of the axioms of ZFC is found in the fact that they do not decide just how “large” inﬁnities exist. There is a family of statements known as “axioms of inﬁnity” that have been intensively studied in set theory since the 1960s. These statements assert the existence of sets that, if they exist, must be “very large.” In the case of axioms of inﬁnity, the consistency of ZFC only implies that an axiom of inﬁnity A is not provable in ZFC, that is, that ZFC + not-A is consistent. The consistency of the theory ZFC + A may be more or less problematic, even given the truth of the axioms of ZFC. There is a broad distinction between axioms of inﬁnity that assert that the universe 8.3. Incompleteness and Inﬁnity 151 of sets has certain closure properties and therefore contains very large sets, and axioms of inﬁnity that isolate some property of the smallest inﬁnite set, the set of natural numbers, and simply state that there are larger inﬁnite sets with a corresponding property. While the former category of axioms of inﬁnity (“weak axioms of inﬁnity”) seem convincing to many, and justiﬁable on the basis of informal considerations, probably very few people would claim that it is at all evident that axioms of inﬁnity in the second category (“strong axioms of inﬁnity”) are even consistent with the axioms of ZFC. Strong axioms of inﬁnity are often inconsistent with V = L and are logically stronger than the axioms in the ﬁrst category, although no axiom of inﬁnity is known which settles the continuum hypothesis. This third dimension of incompleteness of ZFC, and the study of ax- ioms of inﬁnity to which it has given rise, may seem a highly esoteric and specialized aspect of mathematics, and so it is. But at the same time, it is relevant to the mathematics of the natural numbers. The Gödelian Connection The reason for this is a remarkable connection between the incomplete- ness of ZFC in regard to the existence of very large inﬁnite sets and the arithmetical incompleteness revealed by G¨odel’s incompleteness theorem: extensions by axioms of inﬁnity always have arithmetical consequences not provable in the theory they extend, and the stronger the axiom of inﬁnity, the more new arithmetical theorems it implies. The connection can be understood on the basis of the incompleteness theorem. The weakest axiom of inﬁnity is actually part of ZFC: it states that there exists an inﬁnite set. Using this axiom, we can prove in ZFC the existence of a model of the remaining axioms of ZFC, and therewith prove the consistency of the theory ZFC −ω obtained by leaving out the axiom of inﬁnity from ZFC. ZFC −ω is subject to the incompleteness theorem (and is equivalent, in its arithmetical part, to PA) and so does not prove its own consistency. Thus, we see that introducing the axiom “there is an inﬁnite set” yields new arithmetical theorems, in particular the consistency of ZFC −ω, and therewith of PA. (This basic example is in a way misleading, since ZFC is in fact arithmetically very much stronger than ZFC −ω.) Stronger axioms of inﬁnity are not as easily formulated, but the ba- sic connection between inﬁnity and arithmetic follows the same G¨odelian principle. Thus, the next axiom of inﬁnity, asserting the existence of what is known as a strongly inaccessible cardinal, implies among other things 152 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity that every arithmetical theorem of ZFC is true. An axiom that asserts the existence of an inaccessible cardinal is a “weak” axiom of inﬁnity in the sense explained above. “Strong” axioms of inﬁnity are far from transparent as regards their consequences, but investigations have shown that exten- sions of ZFC by the stronger axioms imply the arithmetical soundness of extensions of ZFC by the weaker axioms. From a philosophical point of view, it is highly signiﬁcant that exten- sions of set theory by axioms asserting the existence of very large inﬁnite sets have logical consequences in the realm of arithmetic that are not prov- able in the theory that they extend. Again, however, no arithmetical prob- lem of traditional mathematical interest is known to be among the new arithmetical theorems of extensions of ZFC by axioms of inﬁnity, and it is highly desirable to ﬁnd arithmetical statements of interest outside the special ﬁeld of logic which are not decidable in ZFC but can be proved using axioms of inﬁnity. The Paris-Harrington Theorem A ﬁrst step in this direction was taken in 1977, when it was proved that a certain combinatorial principle is undecidable in PA. The great interest of this result lay in the fact that the combinatorial principle in question did not refer to G¨odel numbers or formal theories, but was a seemingly insigniﬁcant strengthening of a well-known mathematical principle. It is worthwhile to take a closer look at this result, to obtain a broad understanding of the far-reaching extensions of this approach that will be described at the end of this chapter. Ramsey’s theorem is a fundamental result in ﬁnite mathematics, proved by Frank Plumpton Ramsey in 1928. To formulate this theorem we need some deﬁnitions. Suppose we have a ﬁnite set A of numbers (or indeed of anything else). An n-element subset of A is a set B with n elements, all of which are taken from A. An m-partition of the n-element subsets of A sorts those subsets into m categories C1,. . . ,Cm so that each n-element subset of A belongs to one and only one of these categories. Finally, a subset H of A is homogeneous for the given partition if there is some particular category Ci in the partition such that every n-element subset of A all of whose elements are taken from H falls in the category Ci. Here is a concrete example. If A is the population of a city, we can partition the 5-people subsets of A into two categories: those groups of ﬁve people who get on well together, and those who do not. A homogeneous 8.3. Incompleteness and Inﬁnity 153 subset is a set H of people such that either any ﬁve people taken from H get on well together, or else any ﬁve people taken from H do not get on well together. Ramsey’s theorem is about the existence of homogeneous subsets. The theorem (or more speciﬁcally “the ﬁnite Ramsey theorem”) states that for any n, m, and k there is a number p such that if A contains at least p elements, there is, for any m-partition of the n-element subsets of A, a homogeneous subset of A containing at least k elements. In the example (choosing k = 1000), if we specify a large enough population, we know that for any population at least that size, there is a set of 1000 people in the population such that either any ﬁve people from that subset get on well together, or else any ﬁve people from that subset do not get on well together. The ﬁnite Ramsey theorem is a theorem about ﬁnite sets, but by rep- resenting ﬁnite sets of numbers as numbers, it can be formulated as an arithmetical statement. It is then provable in PA. The Paris-Harrington theorem is about a slight modiﬁcation of the conclusion of the ﬁnite Ramsey theorem. We say that a set A of numbers is relatively large if the number of elements in A is greater than the smallest number in A. It can be proved that Ramsey’s theorem holds also if we require the homogeneous set H to be relatively large. But, the Paris-Harrington theorem shows, this is not provable in PA. While the Paris-Harrington theorem can be proved using diﬀerent meth- ods, the incompleteness in PA that it reveals is an instance of G¨odelian incompleteness, in the sense that the strengthened Ramsey theorem is in fact equivalent in PA to “PA is Σ-sound.” Thus, this is an instance of incompleteness in PA that can be remedied by proving the soundness of PA, and in particular can be proved on the basis of an axiom of inﬁnity. Later Developments The Paris-Harrington theorem suggests that similar combinatorial princi- ples in the mathematics of ﬁnite sets could be found which are unprovable in ZFC but can be proved using axioms of inﬁnity. Harvey Friedman has produced a large body of work in this direction, showing various combina- torial principles to be equivalent to the consistency or the Σ-soundness of extensions of ZFC by various axioms of inﬁnity. These results are similar to the Paris-Harrington theorem in that seemingly minor modiﬁcations of combinatorial principles provable in PA result in principles that imply the 154 8. Incompleteness, Complexity, and Inﬁnity consistency of strong theories. The combinatorial principles formulated in Friedman’s theorems are somewhat recondite, and it is an open question to what extent they can be put to use in “ordinary mathematics.” Also, when these principles imply the consistency of “strong” axioms of inﬁnity, it is not at all clear why the results should prompt us to accept the combinato- rial principles. G¨odel expressed the idea that the consequences of axioms of inﬁnity in the realm of ﬁnite mathematics may be so rich and illuminating as to prompt us to accept axioms of inﬁnity that are not evident considered as assertions about the existence of inﬁnite sets. Friedman’s work is clearly relevant to this idea, and it remains to be seen what its eventual mathe- matical outcome will be. An accessible discussion of issues connected with new axioms in mathematics can be found in [Feferman et al. 00]. A Appendix A.1 The Language of Elementary Arithmetic The main purpose of this appendix is to give a formal deﬁnition of the concept of a Goldbach-like arithmetical statement and to comment on the signiﬁcance of Rosser’s strengthening of G¨odel’s original formulation of the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem. A reader who would like to see a full proof of the incompleteness theorem can proﬁtably turn to [Smullyan 92], which contains a wealth of information and does not presuppose any prior knowledge of logic. The language of elementary arithmetic was deﬁned in Section 7.2. To recapitulate, with some additional terminology, we begin with the terms. These are built up from variables x, y, z,. . . , the numeral 0, symbols × for multiplication and + for addition, and ﬁnally the symbol s, denoting the successor function, which takes a number n to n + 1. Thus the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3. . . are denoted in this language by the (formal) numerals 0, s(0), s((0)), s(s(s(0))),. . . . We write n for the numeral with value n. The variables are used the way one does in mathematics, and in particular to form terms like x + s(0), (x + y) × z, and so on, which have a natural number as value once values have been assigned to the variables in the term. For example, if x is assigned the value 8, y the value 0 and z the value 2, (x + s(y) × z) has the value 18. Formulas are formed in the language from equalities s = t, where s and t are terms, using logical operators (called connectives) “not,” “or,” “if-then,” and “if and only if,” together with the universal quantiﬁer “for every natural number x” and the existential quantiﬁer “for at least one natural number x.” 155 156 A. Appendix Thus we can say in this language such things as For every natural number x, there is a natural number y such that y = x + s(z) for some z, and y = s(s(w)) for some w, and for all natural numbers u and v, if y = u × v then u = s(0) and v = y or u = y and v = s(0), which, as we shall see, is a way of expressing that there are inﬁnitely many primes. We are free to extend the language of elementary arithmetic by introducing deﬁned operations and relations, where the deﬁnitions are given using language already introduced. Thus, writing x < y instead of “y = x + s(z) for some z,” and “y is a prime” instead of “y = s(s(w)) for some w, and for all natural numbers u and v, if y = u × v then u = s(0) and v = y or u = y and v = s(0),” the above statement becomes the more readily intelligible For every natural number x, there is a natural number y such that x < y and y is a prime. In talking about formulas, a recurring distinction is that between free and bound occurrences of variables. Bound occurrences of variables are those that are governed by a quantiﬁer. Thus, in “y = s(s(w)) for some w, and for all natural numbers u and v, if y = u×v then u = s(0) and v = y or u = y and v = s(0),” all occurrences of the variables w, u and v are bound. These variables are only used in the formula as a means of expressing the logical constructs “for every number” and “for some number.” The occurrence of the variable y in the indicated formula is free, which means that the formula as a whole expresses a condition on y, in this case that y is a prime. A formula A with one free variable x is often written A(x), and A(t) then stands for the formula obtained by replacing x with t. A sentence in the language is a formula containing no free variables. Thus a sentence expresses a statement, which it makes sense to speak of as true or false, while a formula with free variables x, y,. . . expresses a condition on x, y,. . . , which some numbers may satisfy while others do not. If prime(y) is the indicated formula expressing that y is a prime, prime(17) is atrue sentence expressing that 17 is a prime, and prime(15) is the false sentence expressing that 15 is a prime. It is a remarkable fact, discovered by G¨odel, that using only addition and multiplication, we can deﬁne exponentiation and all of the other usual operations on numbers in this language. That exponentiation is deﬁnable A.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 157 means that there is a formula exp(x, y, z) such that for all natural numbers m, n, k, the sentence exp(m, n, k) obtained by substituting the numerals denoting these numbers for the variables x, y, z is true if and only if k = m n. Furthermore, using this deﬁnition, PA proves the basic rules of exponenti- ation, that is x 0 = 1 and x y+1 = x y × x for all numbers x, y. (From this together with the induction axioms other rules for exponentiation follow.) Thus, in discussing the subject of elementary arithmetic in a philosophical or logical context, we can restrict ourselves to addition and multiplication and the axioms of PA. A Bit of Symbolism Introducing some standard logical symbolism, we write ∀x for “for every x,” ∃x for “there is an x such that,” ¬A for “it is not the case that A,” A ∨ B for “A or B,” A ∧ B for “A and B,” A ⊃ B for “if A then B,” and A ≡ B for “A if and only if B. ′′ Using these symbols, the formula deﬁning “x < y” becomes ∃z(y = x + s(z)), the deﬁnition given above of “y is a prime” becomes the more perspicuous ∃w(y = s(s(w))) ∧ ∀u∀v(y = u × v ⊃ (u = 1 ∧ v = y) ∨ (u = y ∧ v = 1)), and the formalization of “there are inﬁnitely many primes” becomes ∀x∃y(x < y ∧ y is a prime). A.2 The First Incompleteness Theorem We are now in a position to formally deﬁne a “certain amount of arithmetic” suﬃcient for the ﬁrst incompleteness theorem to apply to a formal system. In the following, the rules of reasoning of the formal systems we deal with will not be speciﬁed, but instead we will simply assume that any informal logical reasoning involving the language of arithmetic that we use can also be carried out within the system. This informal reasoning is in fact of a kind that can be formalized using the rules of ﬁrst-order logic, so by the completeness theorem for ﬁrst-order logic (see Chapter 7), we are justiﬁed in this assumption as long as the system encompasses those rules. We will also assume that the system satisﬁes the basic condition that its set of theorems is computably enumerable. (See Section 3.4.) Suppose the language of such a theory includes the language of elemen- tary arithmetic and that the axioms include the ﬁrst six axioms of PA: 1. ∀x¬s(x) = 0 2. ∀x∀y(s(x) = s(y) ⊃= y) 3. ∀x(x + 0 = x) 158 A. Appendix 4. ∀x∀y(x + s(y) = s(x + y)) 5. ∀x(x × 0= 0) 6. ∀x∀y(x × s(y) = x × y + x) Consider a statement of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has at least one solution (in natural numbers).” We assume this statement expressed in the language of PA, so that for example the equationx × x − y × y = 1” is written “x × x = y × y + 1.” Axioms (3), (4), (5), and (6) are all that is needed to prove every true statement of this form, since if an equation s(x1, . . ., xn) = t(x1, . . ., xn) has a solution k1, . . ., kn, axioms (3)–(6) prove s(k 1, . . ., kn) = m and t(k1, . . ., kn) = m for some m, where- upon a simple logical inference leads to the conclusion that the equation has a solution. If T is consistent, it follows from the MRDP theorem that there are true statements of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has no solution” that are not provable in T , as shown in Section 3.4. If, furthermore, T does not prove any false statement of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has a solution,” it follows that there are such statements that are undecidable in T . Before commenting further on this result, let us observe that it is not really necessary for the language of T to include the language of arithmetic and the axioms of T to include (1)–(6). It suﬃces that s, × and + can be deﬁned in the language, and (1)–(6) proved restricted to the objects satisfying some formula N (x). For example, in set theory we can deﬁne “x is a natural number” by a purely set-theoretical formula N (x), that is, one that only uses the predicate “is a member of,” and we can similarly deﬁne “the natural number x is the sum of the natural numbers y and z,” “the natural number x is the successor of the natural number y,” and “the natural number x is the product of the natural numbers y and z”and prove (1)–(6) using these deﬁnitions (together with a deﬁnition of 0). The reasoning by which incompleteness follows still goes through, with obvious modiﬁcations. We can note further that the axioms (1) and (2) were not used in the argument. We need those axioms in order to arrive at G¨odel’s formulation of the incompleteness theorem. Axioms (1) and (2) suﬃce to disprove every false statement of the form “m = n,” so together with (3)–(6) they disprove every false statement of the form “D(k1, . . ., kn) = 0.” Thus, given these axioms we can formulate the incompleteness theorem using G¨odel’s concept of ω-consistency: if it is not the case that there is an arithmetical formula A.2. The First Incompleteness Theorem 159 A(x1, . . ., xn) such that T proves “for some x1, . . ., xn, A(x1, . . ., xn)” but disproves every instance A(k1, . . ., kn), then T is incomplete. (Actually we only need the weaker assumption of Σ-soundness, formally deﬁned below, since we only need to apply this condition in the special case of formulas of the form D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0.) Rosser’s strengthening of the incompleteness theorem states that any consistent theory incorporating some basic arithmetic is incomplete. Re- placing the assumption of ω-consistency or Σ-soundness by the assumption of consistency may seem a very minor strengthening of the incompleteness theorem. And indeed, if we consider those theories, like PA and ZFC, in which we formalize part of our mathematical knowledge, Σ-soundness is no more problematic than consistency, so the stronger form of the incomplete- ness theorem doesn’t give us any new information about these theories. In theory, a skeptic might doubt the Σ-soundness of theories like PA or ZFC while being fairly convinced of their consistency, but in actuality such skeptics appear to be unknown. Rosser’s stronger version of the incompleteness theorem does, however, have signiﬁcant applications, and in particular it patches up a weakness in the application of the theorem to theories in general, as presented in this book. In applying the incompleteness theorem to a theory T we isolate an “arithmetical component of T ” within which we can deﬁne “x is a natural number,” “x×y,” and so on, so as to be able to prove (1)–(6) in T restricted to the natural numbers. But it may well be that what we choose to regard as the arithmetical component of T is better interpreted in a diﬀerent way, and is so interpreted by somebody who asserts the axioms of T . For this reason there need not be anything at all wrong with T even if it proves a statement of the form “the Diophantine equation D(x1, . . ., xn) = 0 has a solution” that is false considered as a statement about the natural numbers. For example, suppose we have a theory T that proves not only (1)–(6), but also ∃x(s(0) + x = x) Regarded as an arithmetical statement, this sentence is trivially false: the equation 1 + x = x has no solution in natural numbers. But other interpre- tations of what we have chosen to regard as the arithmetical component of T may be perfectly reasonable. For example, a proponent of the theory T may interpret the variables as ranging, not over the natural numbers, but over the countable ordinals, which are a set-theoretical generalization of the natural numbers. On this interpretation, (1)–(6) are still true, but 160 A. Appendix the equation s(0) + x = x does have a solution, and in fact inﬁnitely many solutions, among the inﬁnite ordinal numbers. Thus, using Rosser’s strengthening of the incompleteness theorem in applying the theorem to a theory T , we can observe that although it may be more or less reasonable (depending on what else the theory proves) to describe a part of T within which “a certain amount of arithmetic” can be carried out as the “arithmetical component” of the theory, the theory will be incomplete with regard to statements within this component, unless it is inconsistent, which is a “bad” property however we interpret T . Rosser’s proof using a Rosser sentence for a theory T was brieﬂy com- mented on in Section 2.7. There are several variants and generalizations of this proof, but none that applies the MRDP theorem in the straightfor- ward way that yields G¨odel’s version of the incompleteness theorem. The G¨odel-Rosser theorem is usually proved for theories that incorporate (in the sense indicated above) a slight strengthening of axioms (1)–(6), known as Robinson arithmetic (named after R. M. Robinson). One version of this theory uses an extension of the language of elementary arithmetic in which we do not deﬁne <, but instead include this symbol in the language from the outset, interpreting it as usual to denote the relation “is strictly smaller than.” We extend axioms (1)–(6) with three axioms of which the ﬁrst two do the same for the relation < that axioms (1)–(6) do for addition, multiplication, and the successor function: 7. ∀x¬x < 0 8. ∀x∀y(x < s(y) ≡ x < y ∨ x = y) 9. ∀x∀y(x < y ∨ y < x ∨ x = y) The interested reader is referred to Smullyan’s book for a full and read- able presentation of a proof, generalizing Rosser’s argument, that any con- sistent theory incorporating axioms (1)–(9) is incomplete. Here we will consider Robinson arithmetic from the point of view of computability the- ory, in a formal deﬁnition of the concept of a Goldbach-like statement. A.3 Goldbach-Like Statements, Σ-Formulas and Computably Enumerable Relations Using < we can deﬁne a special class of formulas containing only bounded quantiﬁcation, which we will call bounded formulas. In such a formula, A.3. Goldbach-Like Statements 161 every universal quantiﬁcation has the form ∀x(x < t ⊃ A) and every exis- tential quantiﬁcation has the form ∃x(x < t ∧ A) (where in both cases t is a term that does not contain x). We abbreviate these formulas as ∀x < tA(x) and ∃x < tA(x). The essential property of bounded formulas is that there is an algorithm for deciding whether a sentence in which all quantiﬁers are bounded is true. To check whether a sentence ∀x < tA(x) is true we compute the value n of t, and check whether A(k) is true for every k smaller than n, and similarly for ∃x < tA(x). Consider, for example, the sentence ∀x < 1000(2 < x ∧ ∃w < x(x = 2 × w) ⊃ ∃y < x∃z < x(x = y + z ∧ y is a prime ∧ z is a prime) where we now deﬁne “y is a prime” by a formula containing only bounded quantiﬁers: 1 < y ∧ ∀u < y∀v < y¬u × v = y. By repeatedly applying the above method, we reduce the question of the truth or falsity of this sentence, which says that Goldbach’s conjecture holds for every number smaller than 1000, to checking the truth or falsity of a ﬁnite number of sentences of the form s = t or s < t. Similarly with any other sentence containing only bounded quantiﬁers. In fact, the reasoning by which we decide in this way on the truth or falsity of a bounded sentence can be carried out wholly within Robinson arithmetic. It follows that any set E of natural numbers that can be deﬁned by a bounded formula A(x) is a computable set. For to check whether a number n is in E, we need only check whether the sentence A(n) is true. The converse of this observation does not hold, that is, there are computable sets that cannot be deﬁned by any bounded formula. But we can nevertheless formally characterize the computable sets using this concept, as will be seen in the following. Note that the negation of a bounded formula can be formulated as a bounded formula, since ¬∀x < tA(x) is logically equivalent to ∃x < t¬A(x), and ¬∃x < tA(x) is logically equivalent to ∀x < t¬A(x). By repeated application of these rules, together with other logical equivalences such as the equivalence of ¬(A ∨ B) and ¬A ∧ ¬B, the negation of a bounded formula can be reduced to another bounded formula. We can now give a formal deﬁnition of “Goldbach-like sentence” for the language of arithmetic. Quoting from Section 2.1: As we have seen, Goldbach’s conjecture can be formulated as a statement of the form “Every natural number has the property 162 A. Appendix P ,” where P is a computable property. This is a logically very signiﬁcant feature of Goldbach’s conjecture, and in the follow- ing, any statement of this form will be called a Goldbach-like statement. . . . Actually, this description glosses over an impor- tant point: the property P must not only be computable, but must have a suﬃciently simple form so that an algorithm for checking whether a number has the property P can be “read oﬀ” from the formulation of P . We can now deﬁne a Goldbach-like sentence as a sentence of the form ∀xA(x), where A(x) is a bounded formula. As was noted above, this deﬁ- nition satisﬁes the condition that an algorithm for checking whether A(n) is true for a particular number n can be formulated on the basis of the formulation of the condition A(x). While it is easy to see that Goldbach’s conjecture itself can be formal- ized as a Goldbach-like sentence in this sense (just remove the restriction on ∀x in the formula given), it is by no means obvious that every statement conforming to the informal deﬁnition of Goldbach-like given in Section 1.2 can be expressed as a Goldbach-like statement according to the given def- inition. To see why this is so, we ﬁrst introduce some further terminology. A formula of the form ∃xA(x) where A(x) contains only bounded quantiﬁ- cation is called a Σ-formula. (A theory is Σ-sound if every Σ-sentence provable in the theory is true.) Suppose ∃xA(x) has one free variable y, so that we write it ∃xA(x, y). The set of n such that ∃xA(x, n) is true is a computably enumerable set, since it can be enumerated by going through all sentences A(m, n), deciding their truth or falsity, and delivering n as output whenever A(m, n) is true. The converse of this also holds: for every computably enumerable set E there is a Σ-formula ∃xA(x, y) such that E is the set of n for which ∃xA(x, n) is true. To prove this requires a for- malization of the informal deﬁnition of computably enumerable sets given in Chapter 3, for example in terms of Turing machines, together with an arithmetization of the formal deﬁnition. (The proof thus involves a great deal of detailed formal work, and so will not be attempted here.) In fact, if we are given a set E through some deﬁnition by which we know E to be computably enumerable (for example, “let E be the set of proofs in ZFC of the conjunction of some formula with its negation”), we can construct such a formula ∃xA(x, y) which deﬁnes E. The statement “for every n, n is not in E” can then be formulated ∀y¬∃xA(x, y), which can be equivalently ex- A.3. Goldbach-Like Statements 163 pressed as ∀z∀y < z∀x < z¬A(x, y), and thus as a Goldbach-like statement according to the formal deﬁnition. In particular, given a property P that we know to be computably decidable, the statement “every natural number has property P ” can be formulated as ∀xA(x) for some bounded formula A(x), since the complement of a decidable set is eﬀectively computable, and the statement is equivalent to “for every n, n is not in the complement of the set of numbers having property P .” By the same kind of reasoning, applying the basic observation that aset E of numbers is computably decidable if and only if both E and its complement are computably enumerable, we ﬁnd that the computably decidable sets are those which can be deﬁned both by a Σ-formula ∃xA(x, y) and by a Π-formula, a formula ∀xA(x, y) with A bounded.
