The circle Γ with BC as diameter intersects AB and AC again at P and Q, respectively. Determine ∠BAC given that the orthocentre of triangle AP Q lies on Γ. 2. Let f (x) = x3 + ax2 + bx + c and g(x) = x3 + bx2 + cx + a, where a, b, c are integers with c ̸= 0. Suppose that the following conditions hold: (a) f (1) = 0; (b) the roots of g(x) = 0 are the squares of the roots of f (x) = 0. Find the value of a2013 + b2013 + c2013. 3. Find all primes p and q such that p divides q2 − 4 and q divides p2 − 1. 4. Find the number of 10-tuples (a1, a2, . . . , a10) of integers such that |a1| ≤ 1 and a2 1 + a2 2 + a2 3 + · · · + a 2 10 − a1a2 − a2a3 − a3a4 − · · · − a9a10 − a10a1 = 2 . 5. Let ABC be a triangle with ∠A = 90◦ and AB = AC. Let D and E be points on the segment BC such that BD : DE : EC = 3 : 5 : 4. Prove that ∠DAE = 45◦. 6. Suppose that m and n are integers such that both the quadratic equations x2 + mx − n = 0 and x2 − mx + n = 0 have integer roots. Prove that n is divisible by 6. ——— ⋆ ———","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
