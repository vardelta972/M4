A unit square is dissected into n > 1 rectangles such that their sides are parallel to the sides of the square.

Solution: See IMO Shortlist 2007 Problem G3 3. Let n be a ﬁxed positive integer. Find the maximum value of the expression (ab)n 1 − ab + (bc)n 1 − bc + (ca)n 1 − ca where a, b, c ≥ 0 and a + b + c = 1. Answer: When n = 1, then maximum is 3 8 . When n ≥ 2, the answer is 1 3·4n−1 . Solution: First consider the case when n ≥ 2. By AM-GM, we have ab ≤ ( a+b 2 )2 ≤ 1 4 , and similarly ab, bc, ca ≤ 1 4 . So (ab)n 1 − ab + (bc)n 1 − bc + (ca)n 1 − ca ≤ 4 3 ((ab) n + (bc)n + (ca) n) . Thus, we have to prove that (ab)n + (bc)n + (ca)n ≤ 1 4n . Without loss of generality, suppose that a is the maximum among a, b, c. We have a(1 − a) ≤ 1 4 , so 1 4n ≥ an(1 − a) n = a n(b + c) n ≥ anb n + anc n + na nb n−1c ≥ a nb n + b nc n + c na n. So we have proved that in this case the maximum is at most 1 3·4n−1 . Furthermore, this bound can be attained when a = b = 1 2 , c = 0. Therefore, the maximum value of the expression is 1 3·4n−1 when n ≥ 2. Now, suppose that n = 1. The value of 3 8 can be attained by a = b = c = 1 3 . So it remains to prove that ab 1 − ab + bc 1 − bc + ca 1 − ca ≥ 3 8 . Since a + b + c = 1, it is equivalent to prove that ab (a + b + c)2 − ab + bc (a + b + c)2 − bc + ca (a + b + c)2 − ca ≥ 3 8 . 2 Now, clearing the denominators and simplifying (details omitted here . . . ), we see that the above inequality is equivalent to 3[6, 0, 0] + 14[5, 1, 0] + 2[4, 2, 0] + 10[4, 1, 1] ≥ 6[3, 3, 0] + 10[3, 2, 1] + 13[2, 2, 2], (†) where we adopt the notation [p, q, r] = ∑ sym apb qc r = apb qc r + apb rc q + aqb pc r + aqb rc p + arb pc q + arb qc p. Now, (†) is true as it is the sum of the following inequalities, each of which is true due to Muirhead’s Inequality: 3[6, 0, 0] ≥ 3[3, 3, 0], 3[5, 1, 0] ≥ 3[3, 3, 0], 10[4, 1, 1] ≥ 10[3, 2, 1], 11[5, 1, 0] ≥ 11[2, 2, 2], 2[4, 2, 0] ≥ 2[2, 2, 2]. 3 IMO Training Camp Mock Olympiad #4 July 6, 2008 Time limit: 4.5 hours 1.

Let ω be the incircle of triangle CP D, and let I be its incenter. Suppose that ω is tangent to the incircles of triangles AP D and BP C at points K and L, respectively. Let lines AC and BD meet at E, and let lines AK and BL meet at F . Prove that points E, I and F are collinear. Solution: See IMO Shortlist 2007 Problem G8 4 IMO Training Camp Mock Olympiad #5 July 8, 2008 Time limit: 4.5 hours 1. Given non-obtuse triangle ABC, let D be the foot of the altitude from A to BC, and let I1, I2 be the incenters of triangles ABD and ACD, respectively. The line I1I2 intersects AB and AC at P and Q, respectively. Show that AP = AQ if and only if AB = AC or ∠A = 90◦. Solution: First, we prove that if AB = AC or ∠A = 90, then AP = AQ. If AB = AC, then the result is obvious, so assume that ∠A = 90◦. Let P ′, Q′ be the points on AB, AC, respectively, such that AP ′ = AQ′ = AD, so ∠AP ′Q′ = ∠AQ′P ′ = 45◦. Let I ′ 1 and I ′ 2 be the intersections of the bisectors of ∠BAD and ∠CAD, respectively, with P ′Q′. Then triangles AP ′I1 and ADI ′ 1 are congruent, and triangles and AQ′I ′ 2 and ADI ′ 2 are congruent, so ∠ADI ′ 1 = ∠ADI ′ 2 = 45◦. Therefore I ′ 1 lies on the angle bisector of ∠BDA and I ′ 2 lies on the angle bisector of ∠CDA. Hence, I ′ 1 and I ′ 2 are the incenters of ABD and ACD, respectively, so I ′ 1 = I1 and I ′ 2 = I2. This means that P ′ = P and Q′ = Q, so AP = AQ. A B C D P Q I1 I2 ̸ Conversely, suppose that AP = AQ. Let D′ be the point on AD such that AD′ = AP = AQ. If D ̸= D′, then triangles AP I1 and AD′I1 are congruent, and triangles AQI2 and AD′I2 are congruent, so ∠I1D′A = ∠I2D′A. Then ∠I1D′D = ∠I2D′D, and since we also know that ∠I1DD′ = ∠I2DD′ (they are either both 45◦ or both 135◦, depending on whether D′ is on the segment AD or the ray AD past D), we have that triangles I1D′D and I2D′D are congruent. Thus triangles AD′I1 and AD′I2 are congruent, so in particular ∠BAD = 2∠I1AD′ = 2∠I2AD′ = ∠CAD, hence triangle ABC is isosceles with AB = AC. If D = D′, then ∠AP I1 = ∠ADI1 = ∠ADI2 = ∠AQI2 = 45◦, so ∠A = 90◦. Comment: Various trigonometric solutions are available, and they are generally pretty easy. 2. Let λ be the positive root of the equation t2 − 2008t − 1 = 0. Deﬁne the sequence x0, x1, . . . by setting x0 = 1 and xn+1 = ⌊λxn⌋ for n ≥ 0. Find the remainder when x2008 is divided by 2008. Solution: Because λ2 − 2008 − 1 = 0, we have λ = 2008 + 1 λ . Note also that xn is an integer. We conclude that xn+1 = ⌊xnλ⌋ = ⌊ 2008xn + xn λ ⌋ = 2008xn + ⌊ xn λ ⌋ ≡ ⌊ xn λ ⌋ (mod 2008). 5 Because xn = ⌊xn−1λ⌋ and xn−1 is an integer and λ is irrational, we have xn = xn−1λ − ϵ, where 0 < ϵ < 1 is the fractional part of xn−1λ. Since λ > 1, we have 0 ≤ ϵ λ < 1, and so ⌊ xn λ ⌋ = ⌊ xn−1 − ϵ λ ⌋ = xn−1 − 1. It follows that xn+1 ≡ xn−1−1 (mod 2008). Therefore, by induction x2008 ≡ x0−1004 ≡ 1005 (mod 2008). 3. Let A0 = (a1, . . . , an) be a ﬁnite sequence of real numbers. For each k ≥ 0, from the sequence Ak = (x1, . . . , xn) we construct a new sequence Ak+1 in the following way. We choose a partition {1, . . . , n} = I ∪ J, where I and J are two disjoint sets, such that the expression \f \f \f \f \f \f ∑ i∈I xi − ∑ j∈J xj \f \f \f \f \f \f attains the smallest possible value. (We allow the sets I or J to be empty; in this case the corresponding sum is 0.) If there are several such partitions, one is chosen arbitrarily. Then we set Ak+1 = (y1, . . . , yn), where yi = xi + 1 if i ∈ I, and yi = xi − 1 if i ∈ J. Prove that for some k, the sequence Ak contains an element x such that |x| ≥ n 2 . Solution: See IMO Shortlist 2007 Problem C4 6 IMO Training Camp Mock Olympiad #6 July 11, 2008 Time limit: 4.5 hours 1. Let ABC be a triangle, and let M be the midpoint of side BC. Triangles ABM and ACM are inscribed in circles ω1 and ω2, respectively. Points P and Q are midpoints of arcs AB and AC (not containing M , on ω1 and ω2 respectively). Prove that P Q ⊥ AM . First solution: By arc midpoints, we have that P A = P B and QA = QC, ∠P M A = ∠P M B, and ∠QM A = ∠QM C. Pick point D such that A, D lie on the same side of M and M B = M C = M D. By SAS, △P AM ∼= △P DM , and △QM C ∼= △QM D; consequently, P D = P A and QD = QA. Therefore, P DQA is a kite, and so P Q ⊥ AD =⇒ P Q ⊥ AM . Second solution: Consider a rotation about P that brings B to A, and let the image of M be T . Since ∠P BM + ∠P AM = 180◦, we see that M, A, T are collinear and M B = AT = M C. Similarly, consider a rotation about Q that brings C to A, this must also bring M to T as the triangles QCM and QAT have equal side lengths. Now, notice that in quadrilateral M P T Q we have P M = P T and QM = QT , so it is a kite, and thus P Q ⊥ M T . The result follows from the fact that A lies on line M T . 2. Let a1, . . . , an and b1, . . . , bn be two sequences of distinct real numbers such that ai + bj ̸= 0 for all i, j. Show that if n∑ j=1 cjk ai + bj = { 1 if i = k 0 otherwise, then n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 cjk = (a1 + · · · + an) + (b1 + · · · + bn). Solution: Let ri = ∑n k=1 cjk. Then n∑ j=1 rj ai + bj = n∑ j=1 n∑ k=1 cjk ai + bj = n∑ k=1 n∑ j=1 cjk ai + bj = 1, (1) for all i = 1, 2, . . . , n. We wish to determine r1 + · · · + rn. Let R(x) = n∑ j=1 rj x + bj . (2) Then R(x) = P (x)/Q(x) where Q(x) = (x + b1)(x + b2) · · · (x + bn) and P (x) has degree at most n − 1. By (1), R(a1) = R(a2) = · · · = R(an) = 1, so if we write R(x) = 1 − S(x) Q(x) , 7 then S(x) is a monic polynomials of degree n and S(a1) = S(a2) = · · · = S(an) = 0. Hence S(x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an). Consider the coeﬃcient of xn−1 in P (x) = Q(x)−S(x). Form (2), this coeﬃcient is r1+· · ·+rn. On the other hand, Q(x) = (x + b1)(x + b2) · · · (x + bn) and S(x) = (x − a1)(x − a2) · · · (x − an). From this we see that coeﬃcient xn−1 in Q(x) − S(x) equals to (a1 + a2 + · · · + an) + (b1 + b2 + · · · + bn). Hence we have our desired result. 3. Let X be a subset of Z. Denote X + a = {x + a|x ∈ X}. Show that if there exist integers a1, a2, . . . , an such that X + a1, X + a2, . . . , X + an form a partition of Z, then there is an non-zero integer N such that X = X + N . Solution: Assume wlog that 0 = a1 < a2 < · · · < an. Deﬁne a map f : Z → {a1, a2, . . . , an} thus: for r ∈ Z, f (r) is the unique ai such that r = X + ai. Suppose we are given f (r), f (r + 1), f (r + 2), . . . , f (r + an) for some r ∈ Z. Then the value of f (r + an + 1) is determined: if there exists ai > 0 such that f (r + an + 1 − ai) = 0, then f (r + an + 1) = ai; otherwise, f (r + an + 1) = 0 = a1. The value of f (r − 1) is also determined: if there exists ai < an such that f (r − 1 + an − ai) = an, then f (r − 1) = ai; otherwise, f (r − 1) = an. By the Pigeonhole principle, there must exist distinct integers r and s such that (f (r), f (r + 1), . . . , f (r + an)) = (f (s), f (s + 1), . . . , f (s + an)). The preceding paragraph, along with a straightforward induction argument shows that that f is periodic with period |r − s|, and therefore X = X + |r − s|. 8 IMO Training Camp Mock Olympiad #7 July 13, 2008 Time limit: 4.5 hours 1. Let T be a ﬁnite set of real numbers satisfying the property: For any two elements t1 and t2 in T , there is a element t in T such that t1, t2, t (not necessarily in that order) are three consecutive terms of an arithmetic sequence. Determine the maximum number of elements T can have. Solution: The answer is ﬁve. Let m denote this maximum number. It is not diﬃcult to check that the set S = {−3, −1, 0, 1, 3} satisﬁes the conditions of the problem. Hence m ≥ 5. It suﬃces to show that m ≤ 5. We approach indirectly by assuming on the contrary that m ≥ 6 and that T is a set satisﬁes the given property and that T has m elements. Note that adding or multiplying a common number to each element in T will not eﬀect the property of the set. Hence, we may assume that −3 = t1 < t2 < · · · < tm = 3. Then taking t1 = −3 and tm = 3, we know that 0 is an element of T . Because T has m ≥ 6 elements. There is an element in t in T such that t is not an element in S. By symmetry, we may assume that 0 < t < 3. Because t is not in S, t ̸= 1. Let t be the element in T such that t > 0, t ̸= 1, and |t − 1| is minimal. (This is possible because such t exists by our assumption and that T is ﬁnite.) Taking elements −3 and t shows that t−3 2 ∈ T . Because t−3 2 < 0, taking t−3 2 and 3 shows that t′ = 1 2 ( t−3 2 + 3) = t+3 4 ∈ T . Note that t′ > 0, and that |t′ − 1| = 1 4 |t − 1|, violating the minimality of |t − 1|. Thus, our assumption was wrong and thus m = 5. 2. Let ABM be an isosceles triangle with AM = BM . Let O and ω denote the circumcenter and circle of triangle ABM , respectively. Point S and T lie on ω, and tangent lines to ω at S and T meet at C. Chord AB meet segments M S and M T at E and F , respectively. Point X lies on segment OS such that EX ⊥ AB. Point Y lies on segment OT such that F Y ⊥ AB. Line ℓ passes through C and intersects ω at P and Q. Chords M P and AB meet R. Let Z denote the circumcenter of triangle P QR. Prove that X, Y, Z are collinear. Solution: Consider a homothety centred at S that sends segment OM to segment XE. Let ω0 be the image of ω under the homothety. We see that ω0 is centred at X and passes through E and S. Furthermore, because ω is tangent to CS, ω0 is tangent to CS as well. 9 Z Q R X E B O M A P S C Since ∠M AR = ∠M BA = ∠M P A, we see that triangles M AR and M P A are similar, from which we get that M A2 = M R · M P . Similarly, triangles M EA and M AS are similar, so M A2 = M E · M S. Thus M R · M P = M E · M S. Also, by Power of a Point, we have CP · CQ = CS2. It follows that both M and C have equal powers with respect to ω0 and the circumcircle of P QR. That is, M C is the radical axis of these two circles. Since the radical axis is perpendicular to the line joining the centres of the two circles, we have that ZX ⊥ M C. Similarly, ZY ⊥ M C. Therefore, X, Y, Z are collinear. Source: China TST 2007 3. Let a1, a2, . . . be a sequence of positive integers satisfying the condition 0 < an+1 − an ≤ 2008 for all integers n ≥ 1 Prove that there exist an inﬁnite number of ordered pairs (p, q) of distinct positive integers such that ap is a divisor of aq. Solution: Consider all pairs (p, q) of distinct positive integers such that ap is a divisor of aq. Assume, by way of contradiction, that there exists a positive N such that q < N for all such pairs. We prove by induction on k that for each k ≥ 1, there exist • a ﬁnite set Sk ⊂ {aN , aN +1, . . . }, and • a set Tk of 2008 consecutive positive integers greater than or equal to aN , such that at least k elements of Tk are divisible by some element of Sk. For k = 1, the sets S1 = {aN } and T1 = {aN , aN +1, . . . , aN +2007} suﬃce. Given Sk and Tk (with k ≥ 1), deﬁne Tk+1 = {t + ∏ s∈Sk s | t ∈ Tk}. 10 Tk+1, like Tk, consists of 2008 consecutive positive integers greater than or equal to aN — in fact, greater than or equal to max Sk. Also, at least k elements of Tk+1 are divisible by some element of Sk: namely, t + ∏s∈Sk s for each of the elements t ∈ Tk which are divisible by some element of Sk. By the given condition 0 < an+1 − an ≤ 2008, and because the elements of Tk+1 are greater than or equal to aN , we have that aq ∈ Tk+1 for some q ≥ N . Because the elements of Tk+1 are greater than max Sk, we have aq ̸∈ Sk. Thus, by the deﬁnition of N , no element of Sk divides aq. Hence, at least k + 1 elements of Tk+1 are divisible by some element of Sk ∪ {aq}: at least k elements of Tk+1 are divisible by some element of Sk, and in addition aq is divisible by itself. Therefore, setting Sk+1 = Sk ∪ {aq} completes the inductive step. Setting k = 2009, we have the absurd result that T2009 is a set of 2008 elements, at least 2009 of which are divisible by some element of S2009. Therefore, our original assumption was false, and for each N there exists q > N and p ̸= q such that ap | aq. It follows that there are inﬁnitely many ordered pairs (p, q) with p ̸= q and ap | aq.
