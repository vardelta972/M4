Maximum marks: 102. • Answer to each question should start on a new page. Clearly indicate the question number. 1. In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, let the diagonals AC and BD intersect at X. Let the circumcircles of triangles AXD and BXC intersect again at Y . If X is the incentre of triangle ABY , show that ∠CAD = 90 ◦. 2. Let P1(x) = x2 + a1x + b1 and P2(x) = x2 + a2x + b2 be two quadratic poly- nomials with integer coeﬃcients. Suppose a1 ̸= a2 and there exist integers m ̸= n such that P1(m) = P2(n), P2(m) = P1(n). Prove that a1 − a2 is even. 3. Find all fractions which can be written simultaneously in the forms 7k − 5 5k − 3 and 6l − 1 4l − 3 , for some integers k, l. 4. Suppose 28 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? 5. Let ABC be a right triangle with ∠B = 90 ◦. Let E and F be respectively the mid-points of AB and AC. Suppose the incentre I of triangle ABC lies on the circumcircle of triangle AEF . Find the ratio BC/AB. 6. Find all real numbers a such that 3 < a < 4 and a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) ———-0———-","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
