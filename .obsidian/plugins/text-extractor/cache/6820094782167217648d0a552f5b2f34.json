How many zeroes are there at the end of 4 56 + 6 54? 2 Basic Facts For the purposes of this handout, p is an odd prime. 1 Z/pnZ is the set of integers mod p. It has an addition and a multiplication law, furthermore, any element that is not a multiple of p has a multiplicative inverse. We can consider the subset Z/pnZ ∗ of invertible elements; these are exactly the elements not divisible by p. These form an abelian group, so we can use the language of group theory here, but we don’t need to. Deﬁnition 1. The order mod pn of an element a ∈ Z/pnZ is the least d such that ad = 1 mod pn. Theorem 1. The multiplicative group of Z/pnZ: The multiplicative group of Z/pnZ has order ϕ(pn) = pn−1(p − 1) and is cyclic. (You should prove this but you may assume that the multiplicative group of Z/pZ is cyclic.) More useful terminology: Deﬁnition 2. For an integer n deﬁne vp(n) = max{a : pa | n}. This is often called the “p-adic valuation” of n. Exercise 1. Show that vp(a + b) ≥ min(vp(a), vp(b)). Theorem 2. (a + prb) n = an + npran−1b (mod p2r). mod pn analogue of Taylor Series: If P (x) ∈ Z[x], then P (a + prb) = P (a) + prbP ′(a) + p2rb2P ′′(a) 2! + p2rb3P ′′′(a) 3! + · · · . In particular: P (a + prb) = P (a) + prbP ′(a) (mod p2r). (Again, this sum is ﬁnite.) 1Unless stated otherwise. 1 MOP 2011, Black Group Stuﬀ mod pr June 24, 2011 Lemma 1 (Hensel’s Lemma). For a polynomial P (x) ∈ Z[x], if there exists a ∈ Z such that P (a) ≡ 0 (mod p), and P ′(a) ̸≡ 0 (mod p), then, for any positive integer k, there exists b ∈ Z with b ≡ a (mod p) and P (b) ≡ 0 (mod pn). The sort of inductive construction used in Hensel’s Lemma can be useful in other contexts as well. Lemma 2 (The Lemma Which is Not Hensel’s Lemma, a.k.a. Lifting the Exponent). Let p be an odd prime and n a positive integer. If vp(a) = vp(b) = 0 and vp(a − b) > 0, then vp(an − bn) = vp(a − b) + vp(n). Corollary 1. Let p be an odd prime and n an odd positive integer. If vp(a) = vp(b) = 0 and vp(a + b) > 0, then vp(an + bn) = vp(a + b) + vp(n). (The prime p = 2 is ﬁnicky, so we won’t talk about it here. But analogous statements do exist; can you ﬁnd them?) The formula for vp(n!) is useful; it can also be used to ﬁnd the p-adic valuation of binomial coeﬃcients. Theorem 3 (Wolstenholme’s theorem:). This is a name given to a number of related facts. Here, let p be a prime greater than or equal to 5. Then the numerator of 1 + 1 2 + 1 3 + · · · + 1 p − 1 is divisible by p2 and the numerator of 1 + 1 22 + 1 32 + · · · + 1 (p − 1)2 is divisible by p. (2p p ) ≡ 2 (mod p3), and more generally (ap bp ) ≡ (a b ) (mod p3). 3 Problems Not all the problems below involve prime powers in their statements, so you may need to focus on certain primes or apply Chinese Remainder theorem to solve them. 2. (a) Find the smallest integer n with the following property; if p is an odd prime and a is a primitive root modulo pn, then a is a primitve root modulo every power of p. (b) Show that 2 is a primitive root modulo 3 k and 5 k for every positive integer k. 3 (Ireland 1996). Let p be a prime number and a, n positive integers. Prove that if 2 p + 3 p = an, then n = 1. 2 MOP 2011, Black Group Stuﬀ mod pr June 24, 2011 4. Find all pairs (m, n) of positive integers, with m, n ≥ 2, such that an − 1 is divisible by m for each a ∈ {1, 2, . . . , n}. 5 (USA TST). Let p be a prime number greater than 5. For any integer x, deﬁne fp(x) = p−1∑ k=1 1 (px + k)2 Prove that for all positive integers x and y the numerator of fp(x) − fp(y), when written in lowest terms, is divisible by p3. 6. Show that the equation xn + yn = (x + y) m has a unique solution satisfying x > y, m > 1, n > 1. 7 (China TST 2004, MOP 2004). Let u be a ﬁxed positive integer. Prove that the equation n! = uα − uβ has a ﬁnite number of solutions (n, α, β). 8 (IMO Shortlist 2007). For every integer k ≥ 2, prove that 2 3k divides the number (2 k+1 2k ) − ( 2 k 2k−1 ) but 2 3k+1 does not. 9 (MOP ’08). Let a, b, c, d, m be positive integers such that gcd(m, c) = 1. Prove that there exists a polynomial f of degree at most d such that f (n) ≡ can+b (mod m) for all n if and only if m divides (ca − 1) d+1. 4 Factorials, Binomial coeﬃcients, etc Let p be an odd prime. We know that n! is divisible by a high power of p. In fact... vp(n!) = ⌊ n p ⌋ + ⌊ n p2 ⌋ + · · · . So looking at n! modulo powers of p is boring, because there are all those p’s in them. Let’s take them out! Deﬁnition 3. Let (n!)p = ∏ 1≤i<n p̸|i i. This is however a suboptimal deﬁnition because it turns out that the value of (n!)p mod pn depends not only on the value of n mod p but also on the parity of p (look at (1!)p versus (p + 1)!p). The mathematicians who have thought about this sort of thing have generally worked in terms of generalizing the Γ function Γ(n) = (n − 1)!, so we will use their terminology. The following deﬁnition ﬁxes both those problems. Deﬁnition 4 (Morita’s p-adic gamma function). Let Γp(n) = (−1) nΓp(n − 1). . 3 MOP 2011, Black Group Stuﬀ mod pr June 24, 2011 Theorem 4. If a ≡ b (mod pn), then Γp(a) ≡ Γp(b) (mod pn). (Note: this implies that Γp can be extended to a continuous function on the p-adics.) 10. Suppose p is 1 mod 4. Show that if 2a ≡ 1 (mod pn) then Γp(a) 2 ≡ −1 (mod pn). Because of this we can say that Γp(1/2) is a p-adic square root of −1. 5 Bonus: TST 2010 and Beyond [WARNING: this section was written late at night and may contain typos/mistakes.] This problem should be familiar: 11 (TST 2010). Determine whether or not there exists a positive integer k such that p = 6k + 1 is a prime and (3k k ) ≡ 1 (mod p). While (trying to) solve it, one might make the observation that (3k k ) ≡ − ∑ i mod p i4k(1 + i) 3k (mod p) (The sum above is the sum as i runs through all of the p distinct residues mod p.) and also 0 ≡ ∑ i mod p i2k(1 + i) 3k (mod p). Let’s generalize if p = nk + 1, then for positive integers a, b with 0 < a, b < n: 12. Show ∑ i mod p iak(1 + i) bk (mod p) = { 0 ifa + b < n ( bk (a+b−n)k) (mod p) ifa + b ≥ n. (Side question; what happens if you switch a and b?) Why is this in this handout? Well, it has a mod pn generalization, as follows: 13. Let kn = (pn − 1)/a, so k1 = k. Show ∑ i mod p iakpn−1(1 + i) bkpn−1 (mod p) = ( bkn (a + b − n)kn ) p (mod pn) ifa + b ≥ n. Where (m n) p should be something deﬁned analogously to (n!)p. (Side note; if you know what the beta function is, this sort of looks like the integral deﬁnition of the beta function.) (Reality checks you ought to make: Why does it even make sense to consider the left hand side mod pn, given that i is only deﬁned mod p? Also, you should check that the mod pn results you are getting for diﬀerent n are consistent with each other. If you think there is a mistake in this, send me an e-mail at abmiller@math.princeton.edu. Also I think the a + b ≥ n condition may be unnecessary.) This should follow from the work of some subset of {Gross-Koblitz, Katz, Dwork} using very advanced methods. I don’t know an olympiad-level proof but am curious if one exists (even one that only works for special cases). 4 MOP 2011, Black Group Stuﬀ mod pr June 24, 2011 Appendix to last time: the correct version of Siegel’s Theorem Let f (x) ∈ Z[x] be a polynomial of degree at least 3 with distinct roots. Then the equation y2 = f (x) has only ﬁnitely many solutions in Z. (This is actually a special case of the full Siegel’s theorem for integer points on curves, but it’s a form which is easy to cite and apply accurately.) However, it certainly can have inﬁnitely many solutions in Q if f has degree 3 or 4. (This is true by the theory of elliptic curves; doing an explicit example is messy but I’d like to see one if anyone has one.) 5","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
