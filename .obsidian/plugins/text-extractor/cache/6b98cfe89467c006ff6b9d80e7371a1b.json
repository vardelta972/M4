You are often given a number of degrees of freedom in the problem, and there can several diﬀerent ways to make a construction that works; some of them are usually nicer than others. Try to make guesses that make the problem nicer (i.e. make terms cancel each other out) but be brave when expanding whatever algebra you need to see if your guess works. Because there are so many ways to approach these problems, the ﬁrst method you think of may very well not work, but keep trying! Warm-up problem 1 (USAJMO 2010). A triangle is called a parabolic triangle if its vertices lie on a parabola y = x2. Prove that for every nonnegative integer n, there is an odd number m and a parabolic triangle with vertices at three distinct points with integer coordinates with area (2 nm) 2. Some general tips 1. Look at prime factorizations: try to make terms cancel each other out or have large common factors. 2. Try to ﬁnd small solutions: you might see a pattern. If you need to ﬁnd inﬁnitely many solutions or large solutions to a given equation, see whether you can take a small solution and scale it up to ﬁnd a larger solution. 3. Find a family of guesses depending on one or two parameters that satisﬁes some of your conditions, and see if you can pick the parameters appropriately to meet the other conditions. 4. For Diophantine-type problems: the easiest Diophantine equations to solve are ones of low degree in a small number of variables (eg linear equations, Pell equations, Pythagorean triples). Try to guess solutions as above to transform your equation into one of that form. 5. Your problem might really be more of a combinatorics problem, so try thinking of it combi- natorially. 6. Inductive constructions can be useful; once you ﬁnd one solution to your equation, try seeing if you can “bootstrap” oﬀ it to ﬁnd more. 7. Sometimes a “just do it” approach works; approach the problem in a way where you can make choices to make each condition satisiﬁed one at a time. 1 MOP 2010, Red Group Number Theory – Constructions June 12, 2010 Problems 2 (Yugoslavia 07). Let a, b, c be natural numbers and a2 + b2 + c2 = n. Prove that there exist constants pi, qi, ri, (i = 1, 2, 3) independent of a, b, c such that (p1a + q1b + r1c) 2 + (p2a + q2b + r2c) 2 + (p2a + q2b + r2c) 2 = 9n. Furthermore, if a, b, c are not all divisible by 3, show that 9n can be expressed as x2 + y2 + z2 for some natural numbers x, y, z not divisible by 3. 3. The positive integer m has a prime divisor greater than √2m + 1. Find the smallest positive integer M such that there exists a ﬁnite set T of distinct positive integers satisfying (i) m and M are the least and greatest elements, respectively, in T , and (ii) the product of all the numbers in T is a perfect square. 4. Let x < y be positive integers and P = x3 − y 1 + xy . Find all integer values that P can take. 5 (MOP 2007). Find a set of positive integers n1, n2, . . . , n2006, each greater than one billion, satisfying the equation n2 1 + n3 2 + n4 3 + · · · + n2006 2005 = n2007 2006 6. Show that there exists a sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . , of positive integers such that (i) the sequence a1, a2, a3, . . . , contains each positive integer exactly once (ii) the sequence |a1 − a2|, |a2 − a3|, . . . also contains each positive integer exactly once. 7 (USAMO 98). Prove that for each integer n ≥ 2, there is a set S of n integers such that ab is divisible by (a − b) 2 for all distinct a, b ∈ S. 8 (USAMO 2002). Let a, b be integers greater than 2. Prove that there exists a positive integer k and a ﬁnite sequence n1, n2, . . . , nk of positive integers such that n1 = a, nk = b, and nini+1 is divisible by ni + ni+1 for each i (1 ≤ i < k). 9 (CGMO 2006). An integer is called good if it can be written as the sum of three positive cubes. Prove that for every i ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3} there are inﬁnitely many n such that there are exactly i good numbers among n, n + 2, and n + 28. 10 (CGMO 2006). Let p be a prime greater than 3. Prove that there exist integers a1, a2, . . . , an with −p 2 < a1 < a2 < · · · < an < p 2 such that (p − a1)(p − a2) · · · (p − an) |a1a2 · · · an| is a perfect power of 3. 11. Prove that every positive rational number can be represented in the form a3+b3 c3+d3 where a, b, c, d are positive integers. 12 (MOP 02). Show that there are inﬁnitely many ordered quadruples of integers (x, y, z, w) such that all six of xy + 1, xz + 1, xw + 1, yz + 1, yw + 1, zw + 1 are perfect squares. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
