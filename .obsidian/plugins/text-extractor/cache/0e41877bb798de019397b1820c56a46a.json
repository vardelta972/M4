In recent years the camp selection problems have been known as the “September Problems”, as they were made available in September. This year we’re going to trial moving the selection problems earlier in the year, releasing them in July and moving the due date to August. This will allow more time for pre-camp training, building up to Round One of the British Mathematical Olympiad in December. The solutions will be posted in about two month’s time, but can be obtained before then by email if you write to me with evidence that you’ve tried the problems seriously. Good luck!

Points A and B, both distinct from P , are chosen on O1 and O2 respectively so that A, P and B are collinear. Determine the length of the line segment P B if the length of AB is 4. 2. Prove that the number 9n + 8 n + 7 n + 6 n − 4 n − 3 n − 2 n − 1 n is divisible by 10 for all non-negative integers n. 3. Suppose that each point in the plane is coloured either black or white. Show that there is a set of three points of the same colour which form the vertices of an equilateral triangle. 4. If 1 = d1 < d2 < · · · < dk = n are all the positive divisors of a positive integer n > 1, prove that d1 + d2 + · · · + dk > k√n.
