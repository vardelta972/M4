A deleted neighbourhood of c is a set of the form (c − δ, c + δ)\\{c} where δ > 0. In some books it is denoted by N ′(c, δ). 1. Suppose that f, g are functions such that lim x→a f (x) = ℓ1 and lim x→a g(x) = ℓ2. Show that lim x→a (f (x) + g(x)) = ℓ1 + ℓ2 and lim x→a f (x)g(x) = ℓ1ℓ2. Furthermore, if g(x) ̸= 0 in a deleted neighbourhood of a and ℓ2 ̸= 0 then show that lim x→a f (x)/g(x) = ℓ1/ℓ2. 2. Suppose that f (x) ≤ g(x) holds for every x in a deleted neighbourhood of a. If lim x→a f (x) and lim x→a g(x) both exist then show that lim x→a f (x) ≤ lim x→a g(x). 3. Suppose that lim x→a f (x) exists (and is ﬁnite). Show that for every ε > 0 there exists δ > 0 such that for every x, y ∈ (a − δ, a + δ)\\{a} it holds that |f (x) − f (y)| < ε. (Note, here it is understood that x, y are in the domain of f , so that f (x) and f (y) are well-deﬁned.) 4. Suppose that lim x→a f (x) = 0 and g(x) is bounded in a deleted neighbourhood of a. Show that lim x→a f (x)g(x) = 0. 5. Suppose that g(x) ≤ f (x) ≤ h(x) holds for every x in a deleted neighbourhood of a. If lim x→a g(x) = lim x→a h(x) = ℓ then show that lim x→a f (x) = ℓ. 6. Determine whether the following limits exist: lim x→0 x cos 1 x , lim x→0 ⌊x⌋ x , lim x→0 x⌊ 1 x ⌋, lim x→∞ x(√x2 + 1 − 3√x3 + 1). 7. Suppose that f is monotonic on an open neighbourhood around a. Show that the one sided limits lim x→a+ f (x) and lim x→a− f (x) must exist (need not be equal). 8. Suppose that f has IVP and f is monotone on an interval [a, b]. Show that f must be continuous on [a, b]. 9. Suppose that f is one-one and f has IVP on an interval [a, b]. Show that f must be continuous and monotone on [a, b]. 1 10. Let f, g be functions such that f (g(x)) is well-deﬁned. If lim x→a g(x) = b and lim y→b f (x) = ℓ, is it necessary that lim x→a f (g(x)) = ℓ ? 11. Let f, g be functions such that f (g(x)) is well-deﬁned. If lim x→a g(x) = b and lim y→b f (x) = ℓ. We assume further that g(x) ̸= b for x in a deleted neighbourhood of a. Prove that lim x→a f (g(x)) = ℓ. 12. Suppose that f is a function which does not vanish in a deleted neighbourhood of a and satisﬁes lim x→a f (x) = 0 and lim x→a f (x)g(x) = ℓ. Show that lim x→a (1 + f (x)) g(x) = e ℓ. 13. Determine, with proof, the value of lim x→∞ (1 + 1 x2 + cos x )x2+x. 14. Suppose that f : (−δ, δ) → R has the property that lim x→0 (f (x) + f (2x)) = 0. Is it necessary that lim x→0 f (x) = 0? 15. For any function f : (−δ, δ) → R show that if lim x→0 f (x) = ℓ then lim x→0 f (|x|) = ℓ. Is the converse true ? 16. Let n ∈ N. Determine, with proof, the value of lim x→0 1 − cos(x) cos(2x) · · · cos(nx) x2 . 17. For x ≥ 1 deﬁne f (x) = ⌊x⌋ + (x − ⌊x⌋) ⌊x⌋. Show that f is continuous and strictly increasing. (Here ⌊x⌋ denotes the largest integer ≤ x.) 18. Suppose that f : R → R is a monotonic function such that lim x→∞ f (2x) f (x) = 1. Prove that for any c ≥ 1, it holds that lim x→∞ f (cx) f (x) = 1. 19. Let f : [0, +∞) → R be a function such that for each a ≥ 0, lim n→∞ f (a + n) = 0. Is it necessary that lim n→∞ f (x) = 0? 20. Suppose that f : (−δ, δ) → (0, ∞) has the property that lim x→0 (f (x) + 1 f (x) ) = 2. Show that lim x→0 f (x) = 1. (It is not given that this limit exists.) 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
