These notes, the ﬁrst in a series of tutorials on number theory, explore N’s most fundamental properties. The set of all integers . . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . is denoted by Z. In this section letters of the Roman alphabet a, b, c, . . . , k, l, m, n, . . . , x, y, z designate integers unless otherwise speciﬁed. The most important property of N is the following axiom (which means that it cannot be proved): Axiom (Least-Integer Principle). A non-empty set S ⊆ N of positive integers contains a smallest element. Theorem 1 (Division algorithm). Given any integers a, b, with a > 0, there exist unique integers q, r such that b = qa + r, 0 ≤ r < a. The number q is called the quotient and the number r is called the remainder. The notation r ≡ b (mod a) is often used. Example 1. 35 ≡ 3 · 11 + 2, −51 ≡ (−8) · 7 + 5; so that 2 ≡ 35 (mod 11) and 5 ≡ −51 (mod 7). An integer b is divisible by an integer a ̸= 0, if there exists an integer c such that b = ac. Equivalently, b is divisible by a if 0 = b (mod a). We also say that a is a divisor of b and write a|b. Let n be a positive integer. Let us denote by d(n) the number of divisors of n. It is clear that 1 and n are always divisors of a number n which is greater than 1. Thus we have d(1) = 1 and d(n) ≥ 2 for n > 1. An integer n is called a prime if d(n) = 2. An integer n > 1, which is not prime is called a composite number. Example 2. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 are primes; 1, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are not primes; 4, 6, 8, 9, 10 are composite numbers. Example 3. Prove that the set of all primes P = {p | p > 2} is split into two disjoint classes: primes of the form 4k + 1 and primes of the form 4k + 3. Similarly, show that P can be split another pair of disjoint classes: primes of the form 6k + 1 and primes of the form 6k + 5. Solution: We will prove the second statement. Let p > 2 be a prime. Let us divide it by 6 with remainder: p = 6k + r, where r = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. When r takes values 0, 2, 3, 4 the right-hand-side is divisible by 2 or 3, hence in this case p cannot be a prime. Exercise 1. Prove that any prime of the form 3k + 1 is of the form 6k + 1 (but for another k, of course). 1 2 Prime factorization Theorem 2 (Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic). Every positive integer n > 1 can be expressed as a product of primes (with perhaps only one factor), that is n = pα1 1 pα2 2 . . . p αr r , where p1, p2, . . . , pn are distinct primes and α1, α2, . . . , αn are positive integers. This factoring is unique apart from the order of the prime factors. Proof. Let us prove ﬁrst that any number n > 1 can be decomposed into a product of primes. If n = 2, the decomposition is trivial and we have only one factor, i.e., 2 itself. Let us assume that for all positive integers, which are less than n, a decomposition exists. If n is a prime, then n = n is the decomposition required. If n is composite, then n = n1n2, where n > n1 > 1 and n > n2 > 1 and by the induction hypothesis there are prime decompositions n1 = p1 . . . pr and n2 = q1 . . . qs for n1 and n2. Then we may combine them n = n1n2 = p1 . . . prq1 . . . qs and get the decomposition for n and prove the ﬁrst statement. To prove that the decomposition is unique, we shall assume the existence of an integer capable of two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions, and from this assumption derive a contradiction. This will show that the hypothesis that there exists an integer with two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions is untenable, and hence the prime decomposition of every integer is unique. We will use the Least-Integer Principle. Suppose that there exists an integer with two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions. Then there will be a smallest such integer n = p1p2 . . . pr = q1q2 . . . qs, (1) where pi and qj are primes. By rearranging the order of the p’s and the q’s, if necessary, we may assume that p1 ≤ p2 ≤ . . . ≤ pr, q1 ≤ q2 ≤ . . . ≤ qs. It is impossible that p1 = q1, for if it were we could cancel the ﬁrst factor from each side of equation (1) to obtain two essentially diﬀerent prime decompositions for a number smaller than n, contradicting the choice of n. Hence either p1 < q1 or q1 < p1. Without loss of generality we suppose that p1 < q1. We now form the integer n′ = n − p1q2q3 . . . qs. (2) Then two decompositions of n give the following two decompositions of n′: n ′ = (p1p2 . . . pr) − (p1q2 . . . qs) = p1(p2 . . . pr − q2 . . . qs), (3) n′ = (q1q2 . . . qs) − (p1q2 . . . qs) = (q1 − p1)(q2 . . . qs). (4) Since p1 < q1, it follows from (4) that n′ is a positive integer, which is smaller than n. Hence the prime decomposition for n′ must be unique and, apart from the order of the factors, (3) and (4) coincide. From (3) we learn that p1 is a factor of n′ and must appear as a factor in decomposition (4). Since p1 < q1 ≤ qi, we see that p1 ̸= qi, i = 2, 3, . . . , s. Hence, it is a factor of q1 − p1, i.e., q1 − p1 = p1m or q1 = p1(m + 1), which is impossible as q1 is prime and q1 ̸= p1. This contradiction completes the proof of the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Exercise 2. Prove that any positive integer of the form 3k + 2 has a prime factor of the same form; similarly for each positive integer of the form 4k + 3 and of the form 6k + 5. Exercise 3. Show that every divisor d of n = p α1 1 pα2 2 . . . p αr r , 2 is of the form d = p β1 1 p β2 2 . . . p βr r , where βi ≤ αi for all i. In particular d(n) = (α1 + 1)(α2 + 1) . . . (αr + 1). Exercise 4. Find the smallest positive integer n with d(n) = 8. Any two numbers which do not have common primes in their prime factorisations are called coprime or relatively prime. Let x be a real number. Then it can be written in a unique way as z + e, where z ∈ Z and 0 ≤ e < 1. The following notation is used: z = ⌊x⌋, z + 1 = ⌈x⌉, e = {x}. We will use here only the ﬁrst function ⌊x⌋, which is called the integral part of x. Example 4. ⌊−2.5⌋ = −3, ⌊π⌋ = 3, ⌊5⌋ = 5. Theorem 3. The smallest prime divisor of a composite number n is less than or equal to ⌊√n⌋. Proof. We prove ﬁrst that n has a divisor which is greater than 1 but less than √n. As n is composite, then n = d1d2, d1 > 1 and d2 > 1. If d1 > √n and d2 > √n, then n = d1d2 > (√n) 2 = n, a contradiction. Suppose, d1 ≤ √n. Then any of the prime divisors of d1 will be less than or equal to √n. But every divisor of d1 is also a divisor of n, thus the smallest prime divisor p of n will satisfy the inequality p ≤ √n. Since p is an integer, p ≤ ⌊ √n⌋. The theorem is proved. Exercise 5. A composite number n does not have prime divisors which are less than or equal to [ 3√n]. Prove that it is either a product of two distinct primes or the square of a prime. Example 5. Given n pairwise relatively prime positive integers, greater than 1 but smaller than (2n − 1)2, prove that at least one of them is prime. Solution: Let a1, a2, . . . , an be the numbers and suppose that they are all composite. Let pi be the smallest prime divisor of ai. Since ai is composite, we must have pi ≤ √ai < 2n − 1. There are n − 2 odd numbers which are greater than 1 and smaller than 2n − 1. Since pi is either odd or 2, we have n − 1 boxes, i.e. possibilities, for it. But we have n such primes to go into these boxes. Thus by the Pigeonhole Principle we obtain a contradiction. 3 Inﬁnitude and distribution of primes Theorem 4 (Euclid). The number of primes is inﬁnite. Proof. Suppose there were only a ﬁnite number of primes p1, p2, . . . , pr. Then form the integer n = 1 + p1p2 . . . pr. Since n > pi for all i, it must be composite. Let q be the smallest prime factor of n. As p1, p2, . . . , pr represent all existing primes, then q is one of them, say q = p1 and n = p1m. Now we can write 1 = n − p1p2 . . . pr = p1m − p1p2 . . . pr = p1(m − p2 . . . pr). We have got that p1 > 1 is a factor of 1, which is a contradiction. 3 Proof. Here is an alternative proof, using a very important idea in number theory: to compare how fast two things grow as n → ∞. We assume on the contrary that there are only ﬁnitely many primes p1, p2, . . . p5. Then we know that any number can be represented in the form pα1 1 p α2 2 . . . p αr r , (5) Let us estimate how many such prime factorizations we might have available to represent numbers smaller than or equal to n. Without loss of generality we assume that p1 < p2 < . . . < pr. Then p1 = 2 and αi ≤ log2 n, since if αi > log2 n, then pαi i > p αi 1 > 2 log2 n = n. Therefore, each αi can take no more than log2 n + 1 diﬀerent values, hence we get no more than (log2 n) r possible prime factorizations (5) for numbers smaller than n. Since (log2 n)r grows much slower than n (proving that needs a wee bit of calculus), we get a contradiction. The distribution of primes is quite irregular. In particular, there are arbitrarily large gaps in the series of primes. Example 6. Given a positive integer k, prove that there exist k consequtive composite integers. Solution: Consider the integers (k + 1)! + 2, (k + 1)! + 3, . . . , (k + 1)! + k, (k + 1)! + (k + 1) Each of them is composite, since (k + 1)! + m is divisible by m. Nevertheless there are still quite a few primes, as the following theorem shows. Its proof is diﬃcult but still elementary, and is covered in Tutorial 5. Theorem 5 (Bertrand’s Postulate, proved by Chebyschef). For every positive integer n > 1 there is a prime p such that n < p < 2n. This is a marvelous tool for solving math olympiad problems. Just look at the following example. Example 7. Prove that n! = m k has no solutions in integers k > 1, m > 1, n > 1. Solution: Let p be the largest prime such that p ≤ n. Since by Bertrand’s Postulate there is a prime q such that p < q ≤ 2p, we must have 2p ≥ q > n. Therefore n is not divisible by p2, and n! is not divisible by p 2 either. Thus k = 1 which is a contradiction. The following three theorems are far from being elementary. Of course, no Jury assumes that students are familiar with these theorems. Nevertheless, some students use them and sometimes a diﬃcult math olympiad problem can be trivialised by doing so. The attitude of the Jury of the International Mathematical Olympiad is to believe that students know what they use. Therefore it pays to understand the statements of these results, even without proof. Theorem 6. Let pi be the ith prime. Then 1 p1 + 1 p2 + . . . + 1 pn −→ ∞ as n → ∞. Theorem 7 (Dirichlet’s Theorem). If a and b are relatively prime positive integers (which means that they don’t have common prime factors in their prime factorisations), then there are inﬁnitely many primes of the form an + b, where n = 1, 2, . . .. Let π(x) denote the number of primes which do not exceed x. Because of the irregular distribution of the primes, we cannot expect a simple formula for π(x). However one of the most impressive results in advanced number theory gives an asymptotic approximation for π(x). Theorem 8 (Prime Number Theorem). lim x→∞ π(x) ln x x = 1, where ln x is the natural logarithm, to base e. 4 4 Problems 1. Prove that the remainder of the square of a prime p > 3 on dividing by 24 is 1. 2. Twin primes are pairs of primes diﬀering by 2. Show that 5 is the only prime belonging to two such pairs. Show also that there is a one-to-one correspondence between twin primes and positive integers n such that d(n2 − 1) = 4, where as above d(k) stands for the number of divisors of k. 3. Prove that, for all n ≥ 2, the last decimal digit (the digit in the units place) of the number 2 2 n + 1 is 7. 4. Find the smallest positive integer n such that n/2 is a square, n/3 is a cube and n/5 is a ﬁfth power. 5. Prove that the equation x2 + x + 1 = py has integer solutions for inﬁnitely many primes p. (Hint: Follow the Euclid proof of inﬁnitude of primes as closely as possible.) 6. Prove that there are inﬁnitely many primes (a) of the form 4n + 3; (b) of the form 6n + 5.
