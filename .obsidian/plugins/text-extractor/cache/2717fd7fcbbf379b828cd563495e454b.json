Then there exists a positive integer N such that if the numbers 1, 2, . . . , N are colored in k colors, one color always contains an arithmetic progression of length n. We will denote the smallest such integer N by W (k; n). Problem 1 Prove van der Waerden's theorem as follows: 1. Show that W (k; 2) = k + 1 for all k. 2. Find a bound for W (k; 3) in terms of W (k0; 2), where k0 is some function of k. 3. In general, \fnd a bound for W (k; n) in terms of W (k0; n \u0000 1) for some function k0 of k and n. Problem 2 Show that each of the following statements is equivalent to van der Waerden's theorem: 1. If k is a positive integer, and the set of all positive integers is colored in k colors, one color always contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. 2. If a0, a1, . . . is an in\fnite sequence of integers satisfying 0 < ak+1 \u0000ak < r for some \fxed r, then the sequence contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. The best bound currently known for W (k; n) is W (k; n) \u0014 22k22n+9 ; a proof along the lines of Problem 1 will yield a much worse bound. van der Waerden's theorem also follows from this harder theorem: Theorem 2 (Szemer\u0013edi) Let n be an integer and let \u000e > 0. Then there exists a positive integer N such that if S is a subset of f1; 2; : : : ; N g with at least \u000eN elements, S always contains an arithmetic progression of length n. Finally, here is a hard olympiad problem whose proof requires van der Waerden's theorem. 3 (Iran 2004) For every real number x, de\fne hxi = min(fxg; f1\u0000xg), where fxg denotes the fractional part of x. Prove that for every irrational number \u000b and every positive real number \u000f there exists a positive integer n such that hn2\u000bi < \u000f.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
