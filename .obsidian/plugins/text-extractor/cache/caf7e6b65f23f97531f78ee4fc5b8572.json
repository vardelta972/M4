In this chapter, we will explore the cases where S is the set of complex numbers or real numbers. Complex polynomials, \u0000\u0000x\u0000 Suppose we have a degree-n polynomial f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 a0 \u0000 a1 x \u0000 a2 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 an xn, where a0, …, an are complex constants and an is non-zero. According to the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can express it as a product of linear factors of the form x \u0000 %i, where %i is a (complex) root of the polynomial. \u0000 If we have a monic polynomial f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 a0 \u0000 a1 x \u0000 a2 x2 \u0000 … \u0000 an xn, where an \u0000 1, then we can express f \u0000x\u0000 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 %1\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 %2\u0000 …\u0000x \u0000 %n\u0000, where %1, …, %n are (not necessarily distinct) roots of the polynomial. [Fundamental theorem of algebra] For example, the polynomial x4 \u0000 1 can be factorised as \u0000x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u0000\u0000, where \u0000 \u0000 \u00001 is the imaginary unit. In general, the polynomial xn \u0000 1 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 1\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 &\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 & 2\u0000 …\u0000x \u0000 & n\u00001\u0000, where & \u0000 \u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000 n is a princi- pal nth root of unity. The roots of unity are positioned at the vertices of a regular n-gon with centre 0 and a vertex at 1. The example for x5 \u0000 1 is shown below. This means that the degree-n curve y \u0000 f \u0000x\u0000 meets the degree-1 line y \u0000 0 in at most n points. There is nothing special about the line y \u0000 0, and this also applies to any line. More remarkably, the polynomial curve can be replaced with any algebraic curve (such as the unit circle, x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 1, which has degree 2). Even more generally, where the line is replaced with another algebraic curve, we have Bezout’s theorem. \u0000 Suppose P and Q are two curves of degrees m and n, respectively. If they intersect in finitely many points, then they intersect in at most m n points. [Bezout’s theorem] Equality occurs if we consider intersections on the complex projective plane (instead of the real plane), and count intersections with appropriate multiplicity (e.g. twice for tangency, thrice for osculation et cetera). The complex projective plane is discussed in later chapters, and it is only necessary at this point to use the weak form of Bezout’s theorem. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 1. Show that two ellipses intersect in at most four points. 2. Consider the regular n-gon with vertices A1, A2, …, An, where n \u0000 5. Let P be a variable point on the circumcircle of the n-gon. Show that the value of f \u0000P\u0000 \u0000 A1 P4 \u0000 A2 P4 \u0000 … \u0000 An P4 remains constant. Difference of three cubes A particularly useful polynomial is x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z. Over the reals, it factorises into \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u0000 \u0000x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 x y \u0000 y z \u0000 z x\u0000, and the quadratic term can be further factorised over the complex numbers. This polynomial recurs in many situations, including olympiad problems. \u0000 The polynomial x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 det x y z z x y y z x \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y \u0000 z\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u0000 y \u0000 \u00002 z\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u00002 y \u0000 \u0000 z\u0000, where \u0000 is a principal cube-root of unity. [Difference of three cubes] This generalises to n variables, instead of merely three. Indeed, the name is derived from the n \u0000 2 case, known as the ‘difference of two squares’, x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 det\u0000 x y y x \u0000 \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 y\u0000. \u0000 det x0 x1 x2 \u0000 xn\u00001 xn\u00001 x0 x1 \u0000 xn\u00002 xn\u00002 xn\u00001 x0 \u0000 xn\u00003 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 x1 x2 x3 \u0000 x0 \u0000 \u0000 n\u00001 r\u00000 \u0000 n\u00001 r\u00000 \u0000 xr \u0000 2 \u0000 \u0000 k r\u0000 . The sums in the product on the right-hand side are the terms of the discrete Fourier transform of \u0000x0, x1, …, xn\u00001\u0000. (Continuous) Fourier transforms were originally discovered to explain how the sound of an entire orchestra can be composed of basic sinusoidal waves. Today, this idea is used to analyse electrical circuits. The discrete Fourier transform can be computed quickly using certain algorithms, forming the basis of the fastest known algorithm for multiplying two large integers. 3. Find the minimum value of x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2, where x, y, z are real numbers such that x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 1. [BMO2 2008, Question 1] Cubic equations For sufficiently small degree, it is possible to solve polynomial equations using radicals (nth roots). For the general quadratic equation, the Babylonian technique of ‘completing the square’ suffices. Solving the cubic equation is a more difficult, multi-step process. If we can immediately find a root %, it is possible to divide by x \u0000 % to reduce the equation to a quadratic. Otherwise, more ingenious techniques are required. 4. Suppose we have an equation a y3 \u0000 b y2 \u0000 c y \u0000 d \u0000 0. Show that this can be converted to an equation of the form x 3 \u0000 p x \u0000 q \u0000 0, where x is a linear function of y. [Reduction to a monic trinomial] Hence, it is only necessary to consider the latter case, as all other cubics can be reduced to it. 5. Show that x3 \u0000 p x \u0000 q \u0000 0 is equivalent to x3 \u0000 a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 3 a b x \u0000 0, where a3 and b3 are the roots of the quadratic equation z2 \u0000 q z \u0000 p3 27 \u0000 0. 6. Hence show that x 3 \u0000 p x \u0000 q \u0000 0 has a root \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 x \u0000 \u0000\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 1 q \u0000 1 q2 \u0000 1 27 p33 \u0000 \u0000 1 q \u0000 1 q2 \u0000 1 27 p33 . [General solution to cubic equations] The general solution to the cubic equation was the quest of many mediæval mathematicians. After a partial solution by Omar Khayyam, the first complete solution was by Niccolò Tartaglia. However, when the quartic was later solved by Lodovico Ferrari, Tartaglia’s solution of the cubic was mistakenly attributed to Gerolamo Car- dano, and is thus referred to as Cardano’s formula. This displeased Tartaglia to a great extent. Due to the existence of formulae for solving the general quadratic, cubic and quartic equations, people imagined that there might be similar algebraic methods for solving any polynomials using radicals. However, this is not the case. Galois theory demonstrates that it is impossible to solve the general quintic, and of course polynomial equations of higher degree. 7. Two parallel planes cut the sphere of unit radius into three equal volumes. Find a cubic equation in rational coefficients, one root of which is the separation d between the two planes. Symmetric polynomials So far, we have mainly considered polynomials in one variable. The difference of three cubes was an exception, as it featured three variables. Indeed, it is what is known as a symmetric polynomial, as interchanging any two of the variables leaves the polynomial unchanged. x2 \u0000 y2 is not symmetric, since interchanging x and y negates the value, rather than preserving it. \u0000x \u0000 y\u00002, however, is symmetric. 8. Suppose we have a symmetric polynomial in two variables, x and y. Show that it can be expressed as a polynomial in s and p, where s \u0000 x \u0000 y and p \u0000 x y. This is a special case of Newton’s theorem of symmetric polynomials: \u0000 Any n-variable symmetric polynomial in x1, x2, …, xn can be expressed as a polynomial in the elementary symmetric polynomials (ESPs), i.e. coefficients of \u0000x \u0000 x1\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 x2\u0000 …\u0000x \u0000 xn\u0000. [Newton’s theorem of symmetric polynomials] Proof: Note that any symmetric polynomial can be multiplied out to yield a sum of terms of the form k \u0000 sym \u0000x1a1 x2a2 … xnan\u0000, where the sigma indicates a symmetric sum. We will represent this as k f \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000. We assume without loss of generality that a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 an, and lexicographically order the terms. (Specifically, f \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000 precedes f \u0000b1, b2, …, bn\u0000 if a1 \u0000 b1, or a1 \u0000 b1 and a2 \u0000 b2, or a1 \u0000 b1 and a2 \u0000 b2 and a3 \u0000 b3, et \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 cetera.) We then proceed via an inductive argument. For a given term k f \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000 of the ordering, assume that all preceding terms can indeed be expressed as polynomials in the ESPs. Suppose that a1 \u0000 a2 \u0000 … \u0000 ah \u0000 ah\u00001. We subtract the symmetric polynomial k f \u00001, 1, …, 1, 0, …, 0\u0000 f \u0000a1 \u0000 1, a2 \u0000 1, …, ah \u0000 1, ah\u00001, ah\u00002, …, an\u0000. Since f \u00001, 1, …, 1, 0, …, 0\u0000 is already an elementary symmetric polynomial, and f \u0000a1 \u0000 1, a2 \u0000 1, …, ah \u0000 1, ah\u00001, ah\u00002, …, an\u0000 is a symmetric polyno- mial of lower degree than the original expression, the term we have subtracted can be expressed as a polynomial in ESPs. The remainder exclusively contains terms that precede f \u0000a1, a2, …, an\u0000, thus can also be expressed as a polynomial in the ESPs. 9. Given real numbers a, b, c, with a \u0000 b \u0000 c \u0000 0, show that a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 c3 \u0000 0 if and only if a5 \u0000 b5 \u0000 c5 \u0000 0. [BMO2 2004, Question 3] \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000 Solutions 1. Ellipses can be represented by quadratic equations in x and y (like all conic sections). As a consequence of Bezout’s theorem, they can intersect in no more than 2 \u00002 \u0000 4 points. 2. Consider an arbitrary point Q in general position on the circumcircle of the n-gon, and consider the curve f \u0000P\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000Q\u0000. It is a quartic curve (by definition) and must intersect the circumcircle in 2 n points (rotations and reflections of Q). Due to Bezout’s theorem, a quartic and circle sharing no common component can only intersect in at most 8 points; however, 2 n \u0000 8, so the quartic must contain the circle. Hence, all points on the circle satisfy f \u0000P\u0000 \u0000 f \u0000Q\u0000. 3. x3 \u0000 y3 \u0000 z3 \u0000 3 x y z \u0000 det x y z z x y y z x is the volume of the equilateral parallelepiped with vertex O \u0000 \u00000, 0, 0\u0000 and adjacent vertices A \u0000 \u0000x, y, z\u0000, B \u0000 \u0000y, z, x\u0000 and C \u0000 \u0000z, x, y\u0000. Suppose we fix x2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 z2 \u0000 r2, the square of the side length, instead of fixing the volume. If O, A and B are constrained to lie in a plane, then the volume is maximised when O C is a normal to this plane. Hence, the volume is maximised relative to the side length when the parallelepiped is a cube with volume r3. As such, the minimum value of r2 for a parallelepiped with unit volume is 1, when \u0000x, y, z\u0000 \u0000 \u00001, 0, 0\u0000. 4. Firstly, we divide by a to obtain x 3 \u0000 b a x2 \u0000 c a x \u0000 d a \u0000 0. Let y \u0000 x \u0000 b 3 a . Then, our cubic becomes \u0000y \u0000 b 3 a \u0000 3 \u0000 b a \u0000y \u0000 b 3 a \u0000 2 \u0000 y \u0000 b 3 a \u0000 d a \u0000 0. By using the binomial expansion of the first two terms, the coefficients in y3 and y2 are one and zero, respectively. 5. We let q \u0000 a3 \u0000 b3 and p \u0000 \u00003 a b. a3 and b3 are the roots of \u0000z \u0000 a3\u0000 \u0000z \u0000 b3\u0000 \u0000 0, which expands to z2 \u0000 \u0000a3 \u0000 b3\u0000 z \u0000 a3 b3 \u0000 0. We already have a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 q, and a3 b3 \u0000 \u0000a b\u00003 \u0000 \u0000 \u0000p 3 \u0000 3 \u0000 \u0000 p3 27 . 6. x3 \u0000 a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 3 a b x \u0000 \u0000x \u0000 a \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u0000 a \u0000 \u00002 b\u0000 \u0000x \u0000 \u00002 a \u0000 \u0000 b\u0000 \u0000 0 has roots x \u0000 \u0000\u0000a \u0000 b\u0000, x \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 a \u0000 \u00002 b\u0000 and x \u0000 \u0000\u0000\u00002 a \u0000 \u0000 b\u0000. Using the Babylonian formula for solving the quadratic equation gives us the values of a3 and b3, whence we can obtain a and b by cube-rooting. 7. The volume enclosed by the two planes is given by \u0000 \u0000 d 2 d 2 \u0000 y2 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000 \u0000 d 2 d 2 \u0000\u00001 \u0000 x2\u0000 \u0000 x \u0000 \u0000\u0000d \u0000 d3 12 \u0000. For this to be 1 3 of the total volume of the sphere, we have \u0000\u0000d \u0000 d3 12 \u0000 \u0000 4 \u0000. This simplifies to d3 \u0000 12 d \u0000 16 3 \u0000 0, one root of which must be the separation between the planes. 8. This is a special case of Newton’s theorem of symmetric polynomials, which is proved later in the chapter. 9. We have a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 c3 \u0000 3 a b c, by the difference of three cubes. Also, a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2 \u0000 \u00002 a b \u0000 2 b c \u0000 2 c a, since \u0000a \u0000 b \u0000 c\u00002 \u0000 0. We can express a5 \u0000 b5 \u0000 c5 as \u0000a \u0000 b \u0000 c\u0000 \u0000a4 \u0000 b4 \u0000 c4\u0000 \u0000 \u0000 sym a4 b. The first term is zero, so a5 \u0000 b5 \u0000 c5 \u0000 \u0000\u0000 sym a 4 b \u0000 a3 b c \u0000 b3 c a \u0000 c3 a b \u0000 \u0000a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 c 3\u0000 \u0000a b \u0000 b c \u0000 c a\u0000. After factorisation, this is then equal to a b c\u0000a 2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2\u0000 \u0000 3 a b c\u0000a b \u0000 b c \u0000 c a\u0000, or 5 2 a b c\u0000a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2\u0000. Except in the trivial case where all variables are zero, a2 \u0000 b2 \u0000 c2 \u0000 0, so a3 \u0000 b3 \u0000 c3 and a5 \u0000 b5 \u0000 c5 are positive real multiples of a b c, thus both have the same sign. \u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
