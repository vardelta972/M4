It is a powerful tool for solving inequality problem. First we give a definition which is a generalization of arithmetic and geometric means. Definition. Let x1, x2, …, xn be positive real numbers and p = (p1, p2, …, pn) ∊ℝn. The p-mean of x1, x2, …, xn is defined by , ! 1 ][ )()2()1( 21∑ ∈ = n n S p n pp xxx n p σ σσσ L where Sn is the set of all permutations of {1,2,…, n}. (The summation sign means to sum n! terms, one term for each permutation σ in Sn.) For example, ∑ = = n i ix n 1 1 )]0,,0,1[( K is the arithmetic mean of x1, x2, …, xn and n n nn xxxnnn /1/1 2 /1 1)]/1,,/1,/1[( LK = is their geometric mean. Next we introduce the concept of majorization in ℝn. Let p = (p1, p2, …, pn) and q = (q1, q2, …, qn) ∊ℝn satisfy conditions 1. p1 ≥ p2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ pn and q1 ≥ q2 ≥ ⋯ ≥ qn, 2. p1 ≥ q1, p1+p2 ≥ q1+q2, … , p1+p2+⋯+pn−1 ≥ q1+q2+⋯+qn−1 and 3. p1+p2+⋯+pn = q1+q2+⋯+qn. Then we say (p1, p2, …, pn) majorizes (q1, q2, …, qn) and write (p1, p2, …, pn) ≻ (q1, q2, …, qn). Theorem (Muirhead’s Inequality). Let x1, x2, …, xn be positive real numbers and p, q ∊ℝn. If p ≻ q, then [p] ≥ [q]. Furthermore, for p ≠ q, equality holds if and only if x1= x2 = ⋯= xn. Since (1,0,…,0) ≻ (1/n,1/n,…,1/n), AM-GM inequality is a consequence. Example 1. For any a, b, c > 0, prove that (a+b)(b+c)(c+a) ≥ 8abc. Solution. Expanding both sides, the desired inequality is a2b+a2c+b2c+b 2a+c 2a+c 2b ≥ 6abc. This is equivalent to [(2,1,0)]≥ [(1,1,1)], which is true by Muirhead’s inequality since (2,1,0)≻(1,1,1). For the next example, we would like to point out a useful trick. When the product of x1, x2, …, xn is 1, we have [(p1, p2, …, pn)] = [(p1–r, p2–r,…, pn–r)] for any real number r. Example 2. (IMO 1995) For any a, b, c > 0 with abc = 1, prove that . 2 3 )( 1 )( 1 )( 1 333 ≥ + + + + + bacacbcba Solution. Multiplying by the common denominator and expanding both sides, the desired inequality is )(2) (2 )(2 23323323334 3434343434 444444 bacacbcbaabc baccabacbbcacba accbba ++++ +++++ ++ 345345345345(3 cabacbbcacba +++≥ .6) 444345345 cbaabcbac +++ This is equivalent to [(4,4,0)]+2[(4,3,1)] + [(3,3,2)] ≥ 3[(5,4,3)] + [(4,4,4)]. Note 4+4+0 = 4+3+1 = 3+3+2 = 8, but 5+4+3 = 4+4+4 = 12. So we can set r = 4/3 and use the trick above to get [(5,4,3)] = [(11/3,8/3,5/3)] and also [(4,4,4)] = [(8/3,8/3,8/3)]. Observe that (4,4,0) ≻ (11/3,8/3,5/3), (4,3,1) ≻ (11/3,8/3,5/3) and (3,3,2) ≻ (8/3,8/3,8/3). So applying Muirhead’s inequality to these three majorizations and adding the inequalities, we get the desired inequality. Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 11, No. 1, Feb. 06 - Mar. 06 Page 2 Example 3. (1998 IMO Shortlisted Problem) For any x, y, z > 0 with xyz = 1, prove that . 4 3 )1)(1()1)(1()1)(1( 333 ≥ ++ + ++ + ++ yx z xz y zy x Solution. Multiplying by the common denominator and expanding both sides, the desired inequality is 4(x 4+y 4+z 4+x 3+y 3+z 3) ≥ 3(1+x+y+z+xy+yz+zx+xyz). This is equivalent to 4[(4,0,0)] + 4[(3,0,0)] ≥ [(0,0,0)] + 3[(1,0,0)] + 3[(1,1,0)] + [(1,1,1)]. For this, we apply Muirhead’s inequality and the trick as follow: [(4,0,0)] ≥ [(4/3,4/3,4/3)] = [(0,0,0)], 3[(4,0,0)] ≥ 3[(2,1,1)] = 3[(1,0,0)], 3[(3,0,0)] ≥ 3[(4/3,4/3,1/3)] = 3[(1,1,0)] and [(3,0,0)] ≥ [(1,1,1)] . Adding these, we get the desired inequality. Remark. For the following example, we will modify the trick above. In case xyz ≥ 1, we have [(p1, p2, p3)] ≥ [(p1–r, p2–r, p3–r)] for every r ≥ 0. Also, we will use the following Fact.

To prove this, we note that (1) [(9,0,0)] ≥ [(7,1,1)] ≥ [(6,0,0)] (2) [(7,5,0)] ≥ [(5,5,2)] (3) 2[(7,5,0)] ≥ 2[(6,5,1)] ≥ 2[(5,4,0)] (4) [(7,5,0)] + [(5,2,2)] ≥ 2[(6,7/2,1)] ≥ 2[(11/2,7/2,3/2)] ≥ 2[(4,2,0)] (5) [(5,5,5)] ≥ [(2,2,2)], where (1) and (3) are by Muirhead’s inequality and the remark, (2) is by Muirhead’s inequality, (4) is by the fact, Muirhead’s inequality and the remark and (5) is by the remark. Considering the sum of the leftmost parts of these inequalities is greater than or equal to the sum of the rightmost parts of these inequalities, we get the desired inequalities. Alternate Solution.

From i = 1 to n, the first nonzero pi – qi is positive by condition 2 of majorization. Then there is a negative pi – qi later by condition 3. It follows that there are j < k such that pj > qj, pk < qk and pi = qi for any possible i between j, k. Let b = (pj+pk)/2, d = (pj–pk)/2 so that [b–d,b+d] = [pk, pj] ⊃ [qk, qj]. Let c be the maximum of |qj–b| and |qk–b|, then 0 ≤ c < d. Let r = (r1,…,rn) be defined by ri = pi except rj = b + c and rk = b – c. By the definition of c, either rj = qj or rk=qk. Also, by the definitions of b, c, d, we get p ≻ r, p ≠ r and r ≻ q. Now ∑ ∈ −=− n kjkj S r k r j p k p j xxxxxrpn σ σσσσσ )(])[]([! )()()()( ,)(∑ ∈ −+−+ −= nS cbcbdbdb vuvux σ σ where xσ is the product of ip ix )(σ for i ≠ j, k and u = xσ(j) , v = xσ(k). For each permutation σ, there is a permutation ρ such that σ(i) = ρ(i) for i ≠ j, k and σ(j) = ρ(k), σ(k) = ρ(j). In the above sum, if we pair the terms for σ and ρ, then xσ = xρ and combining the parenthetical factors for the σ and ρ terms, we have (ub+d v b–d– ub+c v b–c)+(v b+d ub–d –v b+c ub–c) = ub–d v b–d (ud+c – v d+c) (ud–c – v d–c) ≥ 0. So the above sum is nonnegative. Then [p] ≥ [r]. Equality holds if and only if u = v for all pairs of σ and ρ, which yields x1= x2 = ⋯= xn. Finally we recall r has at least one more coordinate in agreement with q than p. So repeating this process finitely many times, we will eventually get the case r = q. Then we are done. Next, for the advanced readers, we will outline a longer proof, which tells more of the story. It is consisted of two steps. The first step is to observe that if c1, c2, …, ck ≥ 0 with sum equals 1 and v1, v2, …, vk ∊ℝn, then .][ 11 ⎥ ⎦ ⎤ ⎢ ⎣ ⎡ ≥ ∑∑ == k i ii k i ii vcvc This follows by using the weighted AM-GM inequality instead in the proof of the fact above. (For the statement of the weighted AM-GM inequality, see Mathematical Excalibur, vol. 5, no. 4, p. 2, remark in column 1). The second step is the difficult step of showing p ≻ q implies there exist nonnegative numbers c1, c2, …, cn! with sum equals 1 such that , ! 1∑ = = n i ii Pcq where P1, P2, …, Pn! ∊ℝ n whose coordinates are the n! permutations of the coordinates of p. Muirhead’s inequality follows immediately by applying the first step and observing that [Pi]=[p] for i=1,2,…, n!.

The idea is to get the 3 terms as close as possible. We have 214 = 70 + 72 + 72 = 2·5·7 + 1·8·9 + 3·4·6. By the AM-GM inequality, S ≥ 3(9!)1/3. Now 9! = 70·72·72 > 70·73·71 > 713. So S > 3·71 = 213. Therefore, 214 is the answer. Problem 242. Prove that for every positive integer n, 7 is a divisor of 3 n+n3 if and only if 7 is a divisor of 3nn3+1.

Problem 244. An infinite set S of coplanar points is given, such that every three of them are not collinear and every two of them are not nearer than 1cm from each other. Does there exist any division of S into two disjoint infinite subsets R and B such that inside every triangle with vertices in R is at least one point of B and inside every triangle with vertices in B is at least one point of R? Give a proof to your answer. (Source: 2002 Albanian Math Olympiad) Solution.(Official Solution) Assume that such a division exists and let M1 be a point of R. Then take four points M2, M3, M4, M5 different from M1, which are the nearest points to M1 in R. Let r be the largest distance between M1 and each of these four points. Let H be the convex hull of these five points. Then the interior of Mathematical Excalibur, Vol. 11, No. 1, Feb. 06 - Mar. 06 Page 4 H lies inside the circle of radius r centered at M1, but all other points of R is outside or on the circle. Hence the interior of H does not contain any other point of R. Below we will say two triangles are disjoint if their interiors do not intersect. There are 3 possible cases: (a) H is a pentagon. Then H may be divided into three disjoint triangles with vertices in R, each of them containing a point of B inside. The triangle with these points of B as vertices would contain another point of R, which would be in H. This is impossible. (b) H is a quadrilateral. Then one of the Mi is inside H and the other Mj, Mk, Ml, Mm are at its vertices, say clockwise. The four disjoint triangles MiMjMk, MiMkMl, MiMlMm, MiMmMi induce four points of B, which can be used to form two disjoint triangles with vertices in B which would contain two points in R. So H would then contain another point of R inside, other than Mi, which is impossible. (c) H is a triangle. Then it contains inside it two points Mi, Mj. One of the three disjoint triangles MiMkMl, MiMlMm, MiMmMk will contain Mj. Then we can break that triangle into three smaller triangles using Mj. This makes five disjoint triangles with vertices in R, each having one point of B inside. With these five points of B, three disjoint triangles with vertices in B can be made so that each one of them having one point of R. Then H contains another point of R, different from M1, M2, M3, M4, M5, which is impossible. Problem 245. ABCD is a concave quadrilateral such that ∠BAD =∠ABC =∠CDA = 45˚. Prove that AC = BD.

Let line BC meet AD at E, then ∠BEA =180˚ −∠ABC −∠BAD = 90˚. Note ∆AEB and ∆CED are 45˚-90˚-45˚ triangles. So AE = BE and CE = DE. Then ∆AEC ≅ ∆BED. So AC = BD.

Prove the inequality . 3 )(6 1 3 3 3 abc cba abc ≤+++ Proofs of Muirhead’s Inequality (continued from page 2) For the proof of the second step, we follow the approach in J. Michael Steele’s book The Cauchy-Schwarz Master Class, MAA-Cambridge, 2004. For a n×n matrix M, we will denote its entry in the j-th row, k-th column by Mjk. Let us introduce the term permutation matrix for σ∊Sn to mean the n×n matrix M(σ) with M(σ)jk = 1 if σ(j)=k and M(σ)jk = 0 otherwise. Also, introduce the term doubly stochastic matrix to mean a square matrix whose entries are nonnegative real numbers and the sum of the entries in every row and every column is equal to one. The proof of the second step follows from two results: Hardy-Littlewood-Polya’s Theorem. If p ≻ q, then there is a n×n doubly stochastic matrix D such that q = Dp, where we write p and q as column matrices. Birkhoff’s Theorem. For every doubly stochastic matrix D, there exist nonnegative numbers c(σ) with sum equals 1 such that .)()(∑ ∈ = nS McD σ σσ Granting these results, for Pi’s in the second step, we can just let Pi= M(σi)p. Hardy-Littlewood-Polya’s theorem can be proved by introducing r as in the first proof. Following the idea of Hardy-Littlewood-Polya, we take T to be the matrix with Tjj= dcd 2 + =Tkk, Tjk= dcd 2 − =Tkj, all other entries on the main diagonal equal 1 and all other entries of the matrix equal 0. We can check T is doubly stochastic and r = Tp. Then we repeat until r = q. Birkhoff’s theorem can be proved by induction on the number N of positive entries of D using Hall’s theorem (see Mathematical Excalibur, vol. 1, no. 5, p. 2). Note N ≥ n. If N = n, then the positive entries are all 1’s and D is a permutation matrix already. Next for N > n, suppose the result is true for all doubly stochastic matrices with less than N positive entries. Let D have exactly N positive entries. For j = 1,…, n, let Wj be the set of k such that Djk > 0. We need a system of distinct representatives (SDR) for W1,…,Wn. To get this, we check the condition in Hall’s theorem. For every collection ,,, 1 mjj WW K note m is the sum of all positive entries in column j1,…,jm of D. This is less than or equal to the sum of all positive entries in those rows that have at least one positive entry among column j1,…,jm. This latter sum is the number of such rows and is also the number of elements in the union of .,, 1 mjj WW K So the condition in Hall’s theorem is satisfied and there is a SDR for W1,…, Wn. Let σ(i) be the representative in Wi, then σ∊Sn. Let c(σ) be the minimum of .,, )()1(1 nnDD σσ K If c(σ) = 1, then D is a permutation matrix. Otherwise, let D’= (1– c(σ))–1(D – c(σ) M(σ)). Then D = c(σ) M(σ) + (1– c(σ)) D’ and D’ is a double stochastic matrix with at least one less positive entries than D. So we may apply the cases less than N to D’ and thus, D has the required sum.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
