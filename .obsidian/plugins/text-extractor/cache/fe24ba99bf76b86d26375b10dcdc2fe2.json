(Addition vs. Multiplication) If a work can be done in either m ways or n ways then the total no. of ways to do it is m + n. If a work can be split in two parts, where the ﬁrst part can be done in m ways and the second part in n ways, then the total no. of ways to do it is mn. 2. The number of ways to permute (arrange in a line) n distinct objects is n! = n(n − 1) · · · 1. We deﬁne 0! = 1 as a convention. Note. In mathematics, empty sums are always deﬁned as 0 and empty products are always deﬁned as 1. That is why it is natural to take 0!=1. 3. Number of ways to pick k objects one-by-one from n distinct objects is nPk = n(n − 1) . . . (n − k + 1) = n! /(n − k)! . Note, the order in which we take the objects matter in this case. 4. Number of ways to choose k objects from n distinct objects is denoted by nCk or (n k) . ( n k ) = n(n − 1) . . . (n − k + 1) k! = nPk k! = n! k! (n − k)! Here we consider the selection as an unordered set, so it is same as picking k objects at once. Note. In some texts, ( n k) is deﬁned as 0 if k > n or k < 0. You may follow such convention, but if you follow, you should mention that. 5. Binomial Theorem : (x + y)n = n∑ k=0 ( n k ) xkyn−k = (n 0 )yn + ( n 1 ) xyn−1 + ( n 2 ) x2yn−2 + · · · + ( n n ) xn = (n 0 )xn + (n 1 )xn−1y + (n 2 )xn−2y2 + · · · + (n n )yn (This is why we call (n k) as ‘binomial coeﬃcients.’) 1 Note. You can prove it by simple combinatorial logic. Hence this is not only true for real numbers, but also true for complex numbers. 6. Following are some properties of binomial coeﬃcients (a) ( n k ) = ( n n − k ) , 0 ≤ k ≤ n. (b) ( n k ) = n k (n − 1 k − 1 ), 1 ≤ k ≤ n. (c) ( n − 1 k − 1 ) + (n − 1 k ) = ( n k ) , 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1. (d) ( n 0 ) + (n 1 ) + · · · + (n n ) = 2 n. (e) ( n 0 ) − (n 1 ) + · · · + (−1) n( n n ) = 0. (f) ( n 0 )(m r ) + (n 1 )( m r − 1 ) + · · · + (n r )(m 0 ) = ( n + m r ). (g) ( n m )( m k ) = (n k )( n − k m − k ) , 0 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ n. (h) ( n 1 ) + 2(n 2 ) + 3( n 3 ) · · · + n( n n ) = n · 2 n−1. Derive above identities by both simple algebra and combinatorial arguments. 7. Permutation with repetitions: Suppose there are k1 objects of one kind, k2 objects of second kind, . . . , km objects of m-th kind. If n = k1 + · · · + km then no. of ways to permute such n objects is given by n! k1! k2! . . . km!. 8. Combination with repetitions: Suppose that we are choosing k objects from n distinct objects where repetition is allowed (i.e., drawing with replacement) and ordering is not considered. This can be done in ( n − 1 + k k ) ways. 9. No. of non-negative integer solutions to the eqn. x1 + x2 + · · · + xr = n is ( n + r − 1 r − 1 ) . No. of positive integer solutions to the eqn. x1 + x2 + · · · + xr = n is ( n − 1 r − 1 ) . 2 Note, in both of the above situations the solutions are ordered, i.e., 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 and 2 + 1 + 3 = 6 are considered as diﬀerent solutions. 10. Circular Permutations: Suppose some objects are to be arranged in a circle. We call two arrangements identical if one of them can be obtained by rotating the other. The number of circular permutations of n distinct objects is (n − 1)! . We are dividing n! by n since each distinct circular permutation can be rotated n times to give n many diﬀerent arrangements on a line. 11. Inclusion and exclusion principle: If A, B are two ﬁnite sets, |A ∪ B| = |A| + |B| − |A ∩ B| . For three sets, |A ∪ B ∪ C| = |A| + |B| + |C| − |A ∩ B| − |B ∩ C| − |C ∩ A| + |A ∩ B ∩ C| . This result can be generalized as: for ﬁnite sets A1, A2, . . . An we have |A1 ∪ A2 ∪ . . . An| = ∑ 1≤k≤n |Ak| − ∑ 1≤i<j≤n |Ai ∩ Aj| + ∑ 1≤i<j<k≤n |Ai ∩ Aj ∩ Ak| − · · · + (−1) n−1|A1 ∩ A2 ∩ . . . ∩ An|. 12. Pigeonhole Principle: If n + 1 pigeons are to be put into n holes, then at least one hole gets more than one pigeon. More generally, if nk + 1 balls are put into n boxes then at least one box receives more than k balls. References: 1. An Excursion in Mathematics. 2.
