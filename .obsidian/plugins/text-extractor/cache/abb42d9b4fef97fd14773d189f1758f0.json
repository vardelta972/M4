Some of the solutions are my own work, but many are from the official solutions provided by the organizers (for which they hold any copyrights), and others were found by users on the Art of Problem Solving forums. These notes will tend to be a bit more advanced and terse than the “official” solutions from the organizers. In particular, if a theorem or technique is not known to beginners but is still considered “standard”, then I often prefer to use this theory anyways, rather than try to work around or conceal it. For example, in geometry problems I typically use directed angles without further comment, rather than awkwardly work around configuration issues. Similarly, sentences like “let R denote the set of real numbers” are typically omitted entirely. Corrections and comments are welcome!

Problem statement Let AXY ZB be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter AB. Denote by P , Q, R, S the feet of the perpendiculars from Y onto lines AX, BX, AZ, BZ, respectively. Prove that the acute angle formed by lines P Q and RS is half the size of ∠XOZ, where O is the midpoint of segment AB. Let T be the foot from Y to AB. Then the Simson line implies that lines P Q and RS meet at T . A B X Y Z P Q R S T Now it’s straightforward to see AP Y RT is cyclic (in the circle with diameter AY ), and therefore ∠RT Y = ∠RAY = ∠ZAY. Similarly, ∠Y T Q = ∠Y BQ = ∠Y BX. Summing these gives ∠RT Q is equal to half the measure of arc dXZ as needed. (Of course, one can also just angle chase; the Simson line is not so necessary.) 3 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.2 USAMO 2010/2, proposed by David Speyer Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1860777. Problem statement There are n students standing in a circle, one behind the other. The students have heights h1 < h2 < · · · < hn. If a student with height hk is standing directly behind a student with height hk−2 or less, the two students are permitted to switch places. Prove that it is not possible to make more than (n 3) such switches before reaching a position in which no further switches are possible. The main claim is the following observation, which is most motivated in the situation j − i = 2. Claim — The students with heights hi and hj switch at most |j − i| − 1 times. Proof. By induction on d = |j − i|, assuming j > i. For d = 1 there is nothing to prove. For d ≥ 2, look at only students hj, hi+1 and hi ignoring all other students. After hj and hi switch the first time, the relative ordering of the students must be hi → hj → hi+1. Thereafter hj must always switch with hi+1 before switching with hi, so the inductive hypothesis applies to give the bound 1 + j − (i + 1) − 1 = j − i − 1. Hence, the number of switches is at most ∑ 1≤i<j≤n (|j − i| − 1) = ( n 3 ) . 4 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §1.3 USAMO 2010/3, proposed by Gabriel Carroll Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1860806. Problem statement The 2010 positive real numbers a1, a2, . . . , a2010 satisfy the inequality aiaj ≤ i + j for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ 2010. Determine, with proof, the largest possible value of the product a1a2 . . . a2010. The answer is 3×7×11×· · ·×4019, which is clearly an upper bound (and it’s not too hard to show this is the lowest number we may obtain by multiplying 1005 equalities together; this is essentially the rearrangement inequality). The tricky part is the construction. Intuitively we want ai ≈ √ 2i, but the details require significant care. Note that if this is achievable, we will require anan+1 = 2n + 1 for all odd n. Here are two constructions: • One can take the sequence such that a2008a2010 = 4018 and anan+1 = 2n + 1 for all n = 1, 2, . . . , 2009. This can be shown to work by some calculation. As an illustrative example, a1a4 = a1a2 · a3a4 a2a3 = 3 · 7 5 < 5. • In fact one can also take an = √2n for all even n (and hence an−1 = √2n − 1√2n for such even n). Remark. This is a chief example of an “abstract” restriction-based approach. One can motivate it in three steps: • The bound 3 · 7 · · · · · 4019 is provably best possible upper bound by pairing the inequalities; also the situation with 2010 replaced by 4 is constructible with bound 21. • We have an ≈ √2n heuristically; in fact an = √2n satisfies inequalities by AM-GM. • So we are most worried about aiaj ≤ i + j when |i − j| is small, like |i − j| = 1. I then proceeded to spend five hours on various constructions, but it turns out that the right thing to do was just require akak+1 = 2k + 1, to make sure these pass: and the problem almost solves itself. Remark. When 2010 is replaced by 4 it is not too hard to manually write an explicit example: say a1 = √3 1.1 , a2 = 1.1 √3, a3 = √7 1.1 and a4 = 1.1√7. So this is a reason one might guess that 3 × 7 × · · · × 4019 can actually be achieved in the large case. Remark. Victor Wang says: I believe we can actually prove that WLOG (!) assume aiai+1 = 2i + 1 for all i (but there are other ways to motivate that as well, like linear programming after taking logs), which makes things a bit simpler to think about. 5 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2 Solutions to Day 2 §2.1 USAMO 2010/4, proposed by Zuming Feng Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1860753. Problem statement Let ABC be a triangle with ∠A = 90◦. Points D and E lie on sides AC and AB, respectively, such that ∠ABD = ∠DBC and ∠ACE = ∠ECB. Segments BD and CE meet at I. Determine whether or not it is possible for segments AB, AC, BI, ID, CI, IE to all have integer lengths. The answer is no. We prove that it is not even possible that AB, AC, CI, IB are all integers. B A C I D E First, we claim that ∠BIC = 135◦. To see why, note that ∠IBC + ∠ICB = ∠B 2 + ∠C 2 = 90◦ 2 = 45◦. So, ∠BIC = 180◦ − (∠IBC + ∠ICB) = 135◦, as desired. We now proceed by contradiction. The Pythagorean theorem implies BC2 = AB2 + AC2 and so BC2 is an integer. However, the law of cosines gives BC2 = BI 2 + CI 2 − 2BI · CI cos ∠BIC = BI 2 + CI 2 + BI · CI · √2. which is irrational, and this produces the desired contradiction. 6 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.2 USAMO 2010/5, proposed by Titu Andreescu Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1860791. Problem statement Let q = 3p−5 2 where p is an odd prime, and let Sq = 1 2 · 3 · 4 + 1 5 · 6 · 7 + · · · + 1 q(q + 1)(q + 2) . Prove that if 1 p − 2Sq = m n for integers m and n, then m − n is divisible by p. By partial fractions, we have 2 (3k − 1)(3k)(3k + 1) = 1 3k − 1 − 2 3k + 1 3k + 1 . Thus 2Sq = ( 1 2 − 2 3 + 1 4 ) + ( 1 5 − 2 6 + 1 7 ) + · · · + ( 1 q − 2 q + 1 + 1 q + 2 ) = ( 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + · · · + 1 q + 2 ) − 3 ( 1 3 + 1 6 + · · · + 1 q + 1 ) = ( 1 2 + 1 3 + 1 4 + · · · + 1 q + 2 ) − ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 q+1 3 ) =⇒ 2Sq − 1 p + 1 = ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ) + ( 1 p + 1 + 1 p + 2 · · · + 1 q + 2 ) − ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 q+1 3 ) Now we are ready to take modulo p. The given says that q − p + 2 = q+1 3 , so 2Sq − 1 p + 1 = ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ) + ( 1 p + 1 + 1 p + 2 + · · · + 1 q + 2 ) − ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 q+1 3 ) ≡ ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ) + ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 q − p + 2 ) − ( 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 q+1 3 ) = 1 1 + 1 2 + · · · + 1 p − 1 ≡ 0 (mod p). So 1 p − 2Sq ≡ 1 (mod p) which is the desired. 7 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 §2.3 USAMO 2010/6, proposed by Zuming Feng, Paul Zeitz Available online at https://aops.com/community/p1860794. Problem statement There are 68 ordered pairs (not necessarily distinct) of nonzero integers on a black- board. It’s known that for no integer k does both (k, k) and (−k, −k) appear. A student erases some of the 136 integers such that no two erased integers have sum zero, and scores one point for each ordered pair with at least one erased integer. What is the maximum possible score the student can guarantee? The answer is 43. The structure of this problem is better understood as follows: we construct a multigraph whose vertices are the entries, and the edges are the 68 ordered pairs on the blackboard. To be precise, construct a multigraph G with vertices a1, b1, . . . , an, bn, with ai = −bi for each i. The ordered pairs then correspond to 68 edges in G, with self-loops allowed (WLOG) only for vertices ai. The student may then choose one of {ai, bi} for each i and wishes to maximize the number of edges adjacent to the set of chosen vertices. 3 7 8 2 −3 −7 −8 −2 First we use the probabilistic method to show N ≥ 43. We select the real number p = √5−1 2 ≈ 0.618 satisfying p = 1 − p2. For each i we then select ai with probability p and bi with probability 1 − p. Then • Every self-loop (ai, ai) is chosen with probability p. • Any edge (bi, bj) is chosen with probability 1 − p2. All other edges are selected with probability at least p, so in expectation we have 68p ≈ 42.024 edges scored. Hence N ≥ 43. For a construction showing 43 is optimal, we let n = 8, and put five self-loops on each ai, while taking a single K8 on the bi’s. The score achieved for selecting m of the ai’s and 8 − m of the bi’s is 5m + (( 8 2 ) − (m 2 )) ≤ 43 with equality when either m = 5 and m = 6. 8 USAMO 2010 Solution Notes web.evanchen.cc, updated 10 August 2023 Remark (Colin Tang). Here is one possible motivation for finding the construction. In equality case we probably want all the edges to either be ai loops or bibj edges. Now if bi and bj are not joined by an edge, one can “merge them together”, also combining the corresponding ai’s, to get another multigraph with 68 edges whose optimal score is at most the original ones. So by using this smoothing algorithm, we can reduce to a situation where the bi and bj are all connected to each other. It’s not unnatural to assume it’s a clique then, at which point fiddling with parameters gives the construction. Also, there is a construction for ⌈2/3n⌉ which is not too difficult to find, and applying this smoothing operation to this construction could suggest a clique of at least 8 vertices too. Remark (David Lee). One could consider changing the probability p(n) to be a function of the number n of non-loops (hence there are 68 − n loops); we would then have E[points] ≥ (68 − n)p(n) + n(1 − p(n) 2). The optimal value of p(n) is then p(n) = { 68−n 2n = 34 n − 1 2 n ≥ 23 1 n < 22. For n > 23 we then have E(n) =(68 − n) ( 34 n − 1 2 ) + n ( 1 − ( 34 n − 1 2 )2) = 5n 4 + 34 2 n − 34 which has its worst case at around 5n2 = 682, so at n = 30 and n = 31. Indeed, one can find E(30) = 42.033 E(31) = 42.040. This gives another way to get the lower bound 43, and gives a hint about approximately how many non-loops one would want in order to achieve such a bound. 9","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
