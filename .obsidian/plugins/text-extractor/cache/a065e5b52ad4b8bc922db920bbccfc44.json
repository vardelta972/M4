Introduction The equation y2 = x3 + k, for k ∈ Z, is called Mordell’s equation 1 on account of Mordell’s long interest in it throughout his life. A natural number-theoretic task is the description of all rational and integral solutions to such an equation, either qualitatively (decide if there are ﬁnitely or inﬁnitely many solutions in Z or Q) or quantitatively (list or otherwise conveniently describe all such solutions). Mordell [5], in 1920, showed that for each k ∈ Z, the equation y2 = x3 + k has only ﬁnitely many integral solutions. The rational solutions present a diﬀerent story: there may be ﬁnitely many or inﬁnitely many, depending on the integer k. Whether or not there are inﬁnitely many rational solutions is connected to one of the most outstanding open problems in number theory, the Birch and Swinnerton–Dyer conjecture. Here we will describe all integral solutions to Mordell’s equation for some selected values of k, and make a few comments at the end about rational solutions. For further examples of the techniques we use to ﬁnd integral solutions, see [1, Chap. 14]. 2. Examples without Solutions To prove y2 = x3 + k has no integral solution for particular values of k, we will use congruence and quadratic residue considerations. Speciﬁcally, we will use the following descriptions of when −1, 2, and −2 are squares modulo an odd prime p: −1 ≡ □ mod p ⇐⇒ p ≡ 1 mod 4, 2 ≡ □ mod p ⇐⇒ p ≡ 1, 7 mod 8, −2 ≡ □ mod p ⇐⇒ p ≡ 1, 3 mod 8. Our ﬁrst two examples will use the criterion for −1 ≡ □ mod p. Theorem 2.1. The equation y2 = x3 + 7 has no integral solutions. Proof. Assume there is an integral solution (x, y). If x is even then y2 ≡ 7 mod 8, but 7 mod 8 is not a square. Therefore x is odd. Rewrite y2 = x3 + 7 as (1) y2 + 1 = x3 + 8 = (x + 2)(x 2 − 2x + 4). The second factor, x2−2x+4 = (x−1)2+3, is positive. Since x is odd, (x−1)2+3 ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore x2 − 2x + 4 is divisible by a prime p ≡ 3 mod 4 (otherwise all of its prime factors are 1 mod 4, but then that means x2−2x+4 ≡ 1 mod 4, which is false). Since p|(x2−2x+4), we get p|(y2 + 1) from (1), so y2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore −1 ≡ □ mod p, which contradicts p ≡ 3 mod 4. This was V. A. Lebesgue’s method [4]. 1Also called Bachet’s equation. 1 2 KEITH CONRAD Here’s another approach, using the factor x + 2 instead of the factor x2 − 2x + 4. Since (as seen above) x is odd and y is even, x3 ≡ x mod 4 (true for any odd x), so reducing y2 = x3 + 7 modulo 4 gives us 0 ≡ x + 3 mod 4, so x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then x + 2 ≡ 3 mod 4. Moreover, x + 2 > 0, since if x ≤ −2 then x3 ≤ −8, so x3 + 7 ≤ −1, which contradicts x3 + 7 being a perfect square. From x + 2 being positive and congruent to 3 mod 4, it has a prime factor p ≡ 3 mod 4, so y2 + 1 ≡ 0 mod p from (1) and we get a contradiction as before. □ Theorem 2.2. The equation y2 = x3 − 5 has no integral solutions. Proof. Assuming there is a solution, reduce modulo 4: y2 ≡ x3 − 1 mod 4. Here is a table of values of y2 and x3 − 1 modulo 4: y y2 mod 4 x x3 − 1 mod 4 0 0 0 3 1 1 1 0 2 0 2 3 3 1 3 2 The only common value of y2 mod 4 and x3 − 1 mod 4 is 0, so y is even and x ≡ 1 mod 4. Then rewrite y2 = x3 − 5 as (2) y2 + 4 = x 3 − 1 = (x − 1)(x2 + x + 1). Since x ≡ 1 mod 4, x2 + x + 1 ≡ 3 mod 4, so x2 + x + 1 is odd. Moreover, x2 + x + 1 = (x + 1/2)2 + 3/4 > 0, so x2 + x + 1 ≥ 3. Therefore x2 + x + 1 must have a prime factor p ≡ 3 mod 4 (same reasoning as in the previous proof). Since p is a factor of x2 + x + 1, p divides y2 + 4 by (2), so y2 + 4 ≡ 0 mod p. Therefore −4 ≡ □ mod p, so −1 ≡ □ mod p. This implies p ≡ 1 mod 4, contradicting p ≡ 3 mod 4. □ Our next two theorems will rely on the condition for when 2 ≡ □ mod p. Theorem 2.3. The equation y2 = x3 − 6 has no integral solutions. Proof. Assume there is an integral solution. If x is even then y2 ≡ −6 ≡ 2 mod 8, but 2 mod 8 is not a square. Therefore x is odd, so y is odd and x3 = y2 + 6 ≡ 7 mod 8. Also x3 ≡ x mod 8 (true for any odd x), so x ≡ 7 mod 8. Rewrite y2 = x3 − 6 as (3) y2 − 2 = x3 − 8 = (x − 2)(x 2 + 2x + 4), with x2 + 2x + 4 ≡ 72 + 2 · 7 + 4 ≡ 3 mod 8. Since x2 + 2x + 4 = (x + 1)2 + 3 is positive, it must have a prime factor p ≡ ±3 mod 8 because if all of its prime factors are ±1 mod 8 then x2 + 2x + 4 ≡ ±1 mod 8, which is not true. Let p be a prime factor of x2 + 2x + 4 with p ≡ ±3 mod 8. Since p divides y2 − 2 by (3), we get y2 ≡ 2 mod p. Thus 2 ≡ □ mod p, so p ≡ ±1 mod 8, which is a contradiction. We can get a contradiction using the factor x−2 also. Since x ≡ 7 mod 8, x−2 ≡ 5 mod 8. Also x − 2 > 0, since if x ≤ 2 and x − 2 ≡ 5 mod 8 then x ≤ −1, but then x3 − 6 is negative so it can’t be a perfect square. From x − 2 being positive and congruent to 5 mod 8, it has a prime factor p ≡ ±3 mod 8 and then y2 ≡ 2 mod p and we get a contradiction in the same way as before. □ Theorem 2.4. The equation y2 = x3 + 45 has no integral solutions. EXAMPLES OF MORDELL’S EQUATION 3 Proof. Assume there is an integral solution. If y is odd then x3 = y2−45 ≡ 1−45 ≡ 4 mod 8, which is impossible. Therefore y is even, so x is odd. Reducing the equation mod 4, 0 ≡ x3 + 1 mod 4. Since x3 ≡ x mod 4 for odd x, x ≡ 3 mod 4. Also, y is not a multiple of 3. If 3|y then the equation y2 = x3 + 45 shows 3 divides x. Write x = 3x′ and y = 3y′, so 9y′2 = 27x′3 + 45, so y′2 = 3x′3 + 5, which implies y′2 ≡ 2 mod 3, and that is impossible. We will now take cases depending on whether x ≡ 3 mod 8 or x ≡ 7 mod 8. (If you know an elementary method that treats both cases in a uniform way, please tell me!) Case 1: x ≡ 3 mod 8. Rewrite y2 = x3 + 45 as (4) y2 − 72 = x3 − 27 = (x − 3)(x2 + 3x + 9). The factor x2 + 3x + 9 = (x + 3/2)2 + 27/4 is positive and is congruent to 3 mod 8, so it has a prime factor p ≡ ±3 mod 8. Feeding this into (4), (5) y2 ≡ 72 ≡ 2 · 6 2 mod p. We can’t have p = 3 (just in case p ≡ 3 mod 8, this is something we need to deal with) since it would imply y2 ≡ 0 mod 3, but we already checked y is not a multiple of 3. Since p is not 3, (5) implies 2 ≡ □ mod p, so p ≡ ±1 mod 8, contradicting p ≡ ±3 mod 8. Case 2: x ≡ 7 mod 8. Rewrite y2 = x3 + 45 as (6) y2 − 18 = x3 + 27 = (x + 3)(x2 − 3x + 9). The factor x2 − 3x + 9 = (x − 3/2)2 + 27/4 is positive and is congruent to 5 mod 8, so it has a prime factor p ≡ ±3 mod 8. From (6) we get y2 ≡ 18 ≡ 2 · 32 mod p. Arguing as in Case 1, we again ﬁnd p ≡ ±1 mod 8, which is a contradiction. □ In our next two theorems we will use the condition for when −2 ≡ □ mod p. Theorem 2.5. The equation y2 = x3 + 6 has no integral solutions. Proof. We follow the method of proof of Theorem 2.3. I thank Shiv Gupta and Tracy Driehaus for pointing this out. Assume there is an integral solution. First we will show x is odd, and in fact x ≡ 3 mod 8. If x is even then y2 ≡ 6 mod 8, which is impossible. Thus x is odd, so y is odd and x3 = y2 − 6 ≡ −5 ≡ 3 mod 8. Since x3 ≡ x mod 8, we have x ≡ 3 mod 8. Rewrite y2 = x3 + 6 as (7) y2 + 2 = x3 + 8 = (x + 2)(x2 − 2x + 4), with x2 − 2x + 4 ≡ 32 − 2 · 3 + 4 ≡ 7 mod 8. For any prime factor p of x2 − 2x + 4, y2 + 2 ≡ 0 mod p, so −2 ≡ □ mod p, and therefore p ≡ 1, 3 mod 8. Then since x2 − 2x + 4 = (x − 1)2 + 3 is positive, x2 − 2x + 4 is 1 or 3 mod 8. We showed before that this number is 7 mod 8, so we have a contradiction. To get a contradiction using the factor x + 2, ﬁrst note that this number is positive, since if x + 2 < 0 then y2 + 2 ≤ 0, which is impossible. For any prime p dividing x + 2, y2 + 2 ≡ 0 mod p, so p ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. Therefore x + 2 ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. However, since x ≡ 3 mod 8 we have x + 2 ≡ 5 mod 8, which is a contradiction. □ Theorem 2.6. The equation y2 = x3 + 46 has no integral solutions. Proof. Assume there is an integral solution. If x is even then y2 ≡ 6 mod 8, which has no solution, so x is odd and y is odd. Thus y2 ≡ 1 mod 8 and x3 ≡ x mod 8, so 1 ≡ x+6 mod 8, making x ≡ 3 mod 8. 4 KEITH CONRAD Now rewrite y2 = x3 + 46 as (8) y2 + 18 = x3 + 64 = (x + 4)(x2 − 4x + 16). Since x ≡ 3 mod 8, the ﬁrst factor on the right side of (8) is 7 mod 8 and the second factor is 5 mod 8. We will get a contradiction using either of these factors. First we work with the quadratic factor x2 − 4x + 16 = (x − 2)2 + 12, which is positive. Since it is 5 mod 8, it must have a prime factor p that is not 1 or 3 mod 8. Indeed, if all the prime factors of x2 − 4x + 16 are 1 or 3 mod 8 then so is x2 − 4x + 16, since {1, 3 mod 8} is closed under multiplication. But x2 −4x+16 ̸≡ 1, 3 mod 8. The prime p, not being 3 mod 8, is in particular not equal to 3. Also, p ̸= 2 since x2 −4x+16 is odd. Since p|(x2 −4x+16) we get by (8) that p|(y2 + 18), so y2 ≡ −18 mod p. Hence −18 ≡ □ mod p, so −2 ≡ □ mod p. This implies p ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. But p ̸≡ 1 or 3 mod 8, so we have a contradiction. To get a contradiction using the factor x + 4, ﬁrst let’s check it is positive. There is no solution to y2 = x3 + 46 when y2 is a perfect square less than 46 (just try y2 = 0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36; there is no corresponding integral x), which means we must have x3 > 0, so x > 0. Thus x + 4 > 1. Since x + 4 ≡ 7 mod 8, x + 4 must have a prime factor p that is not 1 or 3 mod 8, just as before. The prime p is not 2 since x + 4 is odd, and p ̸= 3 since p ̸≡ 3 mod 8. Then y2 ≡ −18 mod p from (8) and we get a contradiction as before. □ Our next example uses the conditions for −1 mod p and −2 mod p to be squares. Theorem 2.7. The equation y2 = x3 − 24 has no integral solutions. Proof. We take our argument from [6, pp. 271–272], which is based on [7, p. 201]. Assuming there is an integral solution (x, y), we show x is even. Rewrite y2 = x3 − 24 as y2 + 16 = x 3 − 8 = (x − 2)(x2 + 2x + 4). The factor x2 + 2x + 4 equals (x + 1)2 + 3, which is at least 3. If x is odd then (x + 1)2 + 3 ≡ 3 mod 4, so (x + 1)2 + 3 has a prime factor p such that p ≡ 3 mod 4. Then y2 ≡ −16 mod p, so −1 ≡ □ mod p. This contradicts the condition p ≡ 3 mod 4. Therefore x is even, so also y is even. From y2 = x3 −24 we get 8|y2, so 4|y. Write x = 2x′ and y = 4y′. Then 16y′2 = 8x′3 −24, which implies 2y′2 = x′3 − 3, so x′ is odd and greater than 1. Rewrite 2y′2 = x′3 − 3 as 2(y′2 + 2) = x′3 + 1 = (x ′ + 1)(x′2 − x ′ + 1). The factor x′2 − x′ + 1 is odd and greater than 1. Let p be a prime factor of it, so y′2 ≡ −2 mod p, which implies p ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. Then x′2 − x′ + 1 is a product of primes that are all 1 or 3 mod 8, so x′2 −x′ +1 ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. But y′2 ≡ 0, 1, or 4 mod 8 ⇒ x′3 = 2y′2 +3 ≡ 3 or 5 mod 8 ⇒ x′ ≡ 3 or 5 mod 8. Then x′2 − x′ + 1 ≡ 1 − x′ + 1 ≡ 2 − x′ ≡ 5 or 7 mod 8. That contradicts x′2 − x′ + 1 ≡ 1 or 3 mod 8. □ As an exercise, show each of the following has no integral solutions by methods like those used above: (1) y2 = x3 − 3 (Hint: y2 + 4 = x3 + 1). (2) y2 = x3 − 9 (Hint: y2 + 1 = x3 − 8). (3) y2 = x3 − 12 (Hint: y2 + 4 = x3 − 8). EXAMPLES OF MORDELL’S EQUATION 5 3. Examples with Solutions We will now look at some instances of Mordell’s equation that have integral solutions. The goal in each case is to ﬁnd all the integral solutions. The main tool we will use is unique factorization (in diﬀerent settings), and after some successes we will see that this technique eventually runs into diﬃculties. We start with the case k = 16: the equation y2 = x3 + 16. There are two obvious integral solutions: (x, y) = (0, ±4). A numerical search does not reveal additional integral solutions, so one might guess2 that (0, 4) and (0, −4) are the only integral solutions. To prove this, we will use unique factorization in Z. Theorem 3.1. The only integral solutions to y2 = x3 + 16 are (x, y) = (0, ±4). Proof. First we determine the parity of an integral solution. Rewrite the equation as x3 = y2 − 16 = (y + 4)(y − 4). If y is odd then (y + 4, y − 4) = 1 (why?), so both y + 4 and y − 4 are cubes because their product is a cube. They diﬀer by 8, and no odd cubes diﬀer by 8. Hence y is even, so x is even. The right side of y2 = x3 + 16 is divisible by 8, so 4|y. Writing y = 4y′, 16y′2 = x3 + 16. Therefore 4|x. Write x = 4x′, so y′2 = 4x′3 + 1, showing y′ is odd. Write y′ = 2m + 1, so m2 + m = x′3. Since m2 + m = m(m + 1) and (m, m + 1) = 1, both m and m + 1 are cubes. The only consecutive cubes are among {−1, 0, 1}, so m or m + 1 is 0. Therefore x′ = 0, so x = 0 and y = ±4. □ For the next few results, we use unique factorization in Z[i] or Z[√−2]. Theorem 3.2. The only x, y ∈ Z satisfying y2 = x3 − 1 is (x, y) = (1, 0). Proof. First we check the parity of an integral solution. Suppose x is even, so y2 + 1 = x3 ≡ 0 mod 8. Then y2 ≡ −1 mod 8. But −1 mod 8 is not a square. We have a contradiction, so x is odd, which means y has to be even. Write the equation y2 = x3 − 1 as x 3 = y2 + 1, which in Z[i] has the factored form (9) x3 = (y + i)(y − i). If the two factors on the right side are relatively prime in Z[i], then since their product is a cube, each factor must be a cube up to unit multiple, by unique factorization in Z[i]. Moreover, since every unit in Z[i] is a cube (1 = 13, −1 = (−1)3, i = (−i)3, −i = i3), unit factors can be absorbed into the cubes. Thus, provided we show y +i and y −i are relatively prime, (9) tells us y + i and y − i are themselves cubes. To see that y + i and y − i are relatively prime, let δ be a common divisor. Since δ divides (y + i) − (y − i) = 2i, N(δ) divides N(2i) = 4. Also N(δ) divides N(y + i) = y2 + 1 = x3, which is odd. Therefore N(δ) divides 4 and is odd, which means N(δ) = 1, so δ is a unit. Now that we know y + i and y − i are relatively prime, we must have (as argued already) y + i = (m + ni)3 2It’s a tricky business to decide when to stop searching: y2 = x3+24 has integral solutions at x = −2, 1, 10, and 8158 (and no others). The equation y2 = x 3 − 999 has integral solutions at x = 10, 12, 40, 147, 174, and 22480 (and no others) [8]. 6 KEITH CONRAD for some m, n ∈ Z. Expanding the cube and equating real and imaginary parts, y = m 3 − 3mn2 = m(m 2 − 3n2), 1 = 3m 2n − n3 = n(3m 2 − n2). The equation on the right tells us n = ±1. If n = 1, then 1 = 3m2 − 1, so 3m2 = 2, which has no integer solution. If n = −1, then 1 = −(3m2 − 1), so m = 0. Therefore y = 0, so x3 = y2 + 1 = 1. Thus x = 1. □ Theorem 3.3. The only x, y ∈ Z satisfying y2 = x3 − 4 are (x, y) = (2, ±2) and (5, ±11). Proof. We rewrite y2 = x3 − 4 in Z[i] as (10) x3 = y2 + 4 = (y + 2i)(y − 2i). We will show that both factors on the right are cubes. Let’s ﬁrst see why this leads to the desired integral solutions. Write y + 2i = (m + ni) 3 for some m, n ∈ Z. Equating real and imaginary parts, y = m(m 2 − 3n2), 2 = n(3m 2 − n2). From the second equation, n = ±1 or n = ±2. In each case we try to solve for m in Z. The cases that work out are n = 1 and m = ±1, and n = −2 and m = ±1. In the ﬁrst case, y = ±(1 − 3) = ±2 and x = 2, while in the second case y = ±(1 − 3 · 4) = ±11 and x = 5. It remains to show in (10) that y + 2i and y − 2i are cubes. Since y2 ≡ x3 mod 2 either x and y are both even or they are both odd. We will consider these cases separately, since they aﬀect the greatest common factor of y + 2i and y − 2i. First suppose x and y are both odd. We will show y + 2i and y − 2i are relatively prime in Z[i]. Let δ be a common divisor, so δ divides (y + 2i) − (y − 2i) = 4i. Therefore N(δ) divides N(4i) = 16. Since N(δ) also divides N(y + 2i) = y2 + 4 = x3, which is odd, we must have N(δ) = 1, so δ is a unit. This means y + 2i and y − 2i are relatively prime, so since their product in (10) is a cube and any unit in Z[i] are cubes, y + 2i and y − 2i are both cubes. Now suppose x and y are both even. Write x = 2x′ and y = 2y′, so 4y′2 = 8x′3 − 4. Dividing by 4, y′2 = 2x′3 − 1. Therefore y′ is odd. We must have x′ odd too, as otherwise y′2 ≡ −1 mod 4, but −1 mod 4 is not a square. Writing 2x′3 = y′2 + 1 = (y′ + i)(y′ − i), the factors on the right each have even norm, so each is divisible by 1 + i. Divide the equation by (1 + i)2 = 2i: −ix′3 = y′ + i 1 + i y′ − i 1 + i . We will show the two factors on the right are relatively prime. Their diﬀerence is 2i/(1+i) = 1 + i, so any common divisor has norm dividing N(1 + i) = 2. Also any common divisor divides x′3, so the norm divides N(x′3) = x′6, which is odd. Thus any common divisor of (y′ + i)/(1 + i) and (y′ − i)/(1 + i) has norm 1, so is a unit. As before, we now know (y′ + i)/(1 + i) is a cube, so y + 2i = 2(y′ + i) = −i(1 + i) 2(y′ + i) = i3(1 + i)3 y′ + i 1 + i is a cube in Z[i]. Similarly, y − 2i is a cube. □ EXAMPLES OF MORDELL’S EQUATION 7 Using Z[i] as in the previous two theorems, show as an exercise that y2 = x3 − 16 has no integral solutions. Theorem 3.4. The only integral solutions to y2 = x3 − 2 are (x, y) = (3, ±5). Proof. Suppose y2 = x3 − 2 with integral x and y. As in the previous proof, ﬁrst we do a parity check on x and y. If x is even then y2 ≡ −2 mod 8, but −2 mod 8 is not a square. Therefore x is odd, so y is also odd. Write the relation between x and y as x 3 = y2 + 2. In Z[ √−2], we can rewrite this as (11) x3 = (y + √−2)(y − √−2). The two factors on the right are relatively prime. Indeed, let δ be a common divisor, so δ divides their diﬀerence (y + √−2) − (y − √−2) = 2 √−2, which means N(δ) divides N(2√−2) = 8. At the same time, N(δ) divides N(y + √−2) = y2 + 2, which is odd since y is odd. So N(δ) must be 1, which means δ is a unit in Z[ √−2], so y + √−2 and y − √−2 are relatively prime in Z[ √−2]. From (11) and unique factorization in Z[ √−2], y + √−2 and y − √−2 are both cubes up to unit multiple. The units in Z[ √−2] are ±1, which are both cubes, and therefore a unit multiple of a cube is also a cube. Hence y + √−2 and y − √−2 are both cubes. Write y + √−2 = (m + n√−2) 3 for some m, n ∈ Z. It follows that y = m 3 − 6mn2 = m(m2 − 6n2), 1 = 3m 2n − 2n3 = n(3m 2 − 2n2). From the second equation, n = ±1. When n = 1 the second equation says 1 = 3m2 − 2, so m = ±1. Then y = ±1(1 − 6) = ±5 and x3 = y2 + 2 = 27, so we recover the solutions (x, y) = (3, ±5). When n = −1 we have 1 = −(3m2 − 2 · 12) = −(3m2 − 2), so 1 = 3m2, which has no solution in Z. □ Remark 3.5. Theorems 3.3 and 3.4 were challenges by Fermat to the British [3, p. 533], [9, pp. 103, 113]. He did not give any details of a proof, though he wrote that he could solve them by his method of inﬁnite descent. Our proof of Theorems 3.3 and 3.4, like that of Theorem 3.2, studies integers of the form y2 + n by factoring them in Z[ √−n], which is an idea due to Euler. Our treatment of y2 = x3 + 16, y2 = x3 − 1, y2 = x3 − 4, and y2 = x3 − 2 relied on features of Z, Z[i], Z[√−2]: they satisfy unique factorization and every unit in them is a cube. We can try the same technique on y2 = x3 + k with other values of k. The next three examples illustrate some new features. Example 3.6. Consider Mordell’s equation with k = 1: y2 = x3 + 1. There are several obvious integral solutions: (x, y) = (−1, 0), (0, ±1), and (2, ±3). We will use unique factorization in Z to try to show these are the only integral solutions. This will need a lot more work than Theorem 3.1, where we previously used unique factor- ization in Z to study y2 = x3 + 16. 8 KEITH CONRAD We rewrite the equation in the form x3 = y2 − 1 = (y + 1)(y − 1). The integers y + 1 and y − 1 diﬀer by 2, so (y + 1, y − 1) is either 1 or 2. First suppose y is even. Then y + 1 and y − 1 are both odd, so (y + 1, y − 1) = 1. (That is, any two consecutive odd integers are relatively prime.) Since y + 1 and y − 1 have a product that is a cube and they are relatively prime, unique factorization in Z tells us that they are both cubes or both the negatives of cubes. The negative of a cube is also a cube (since −1 = (−1)3), so y + 1 and y − 1 are both cubes: y + 1 = a 3, y − 1 = b 3. Subtracting, we have a3 − b3 = 2. Considering how cubes spread apart, the only cubes that diﬀer by 2 are 1 and −1. So a3 = 1 and b3 = −1, meaning a = 1 and b = −1. Therefore y + 1 = 1, so y = 0 and x = −1. The integral solution (−1, 0) of y2 = x3 − 1 is the only one where y is even. Now suppose y is odd, so x is even. We expect to show that the only such integral solutions are (0, ±1) and (2, ±3). Since y + 1 and y − 1 are both even and diﬀer by 2, (y + 1, y − 1) = 2. Either y ≡ 1 mod 4 or y ≡ 3 mod 4. Since (x, y) is a solution if and only if (x, −y) is a solution, by negating y if necessary we may assume y ≡ 1 mod 4. Then y + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4 and y − 1 ≡ 0 mod 4. Dividing the equation x3 = y2 − 1 by 8, we have ( x 2 )3 = y + 1 2 · y − 1 4 . The two factors on the right are relatively prime, since y +1 and y −1 have greatest common factor 2 and we have divided each of them by a multiple of 2. Since the product of (y − 1)/2 and (y + 1)/4 is a cube and the factors are relatively prime, each of them is a cube: y + 1 2 = a 3, y − 1 4 = b 3 with integers a and b. (Actually, at ﬁrst we can say simply that (y + 1)/2 and (y − 1)/4 are cubes up to sign, but −1 = (−1)3 so we can absorb a sign into a and b if signs occur.) Solving each equation for y, (12) 2a3 − 1 = y = 4b 3 + 1, so a3 −2b3 = 1. We can spot right away two integral solutions to a3 −2b3 = 1: (a, b) = (1, 0) and (a, b) = (−1, −1). In the ﬁrst case, using (12) we get y = 1 (so x = 0) and in the second case we get y = −3 (so x = 2). We have found two integral solutions to y2 = x3 + 1 when y ≡ 1 mod 4: (0, 1) and (2, −3). Negating y produces the two solutions (0, −1) and (2, 3) where y ≡ 3 mod 4. Any integral solution of a3 − 2b3 = 1 leads to the integral solution (x, y) = (2ab, 4b3 + 1) of y2 = x3 + 1, so showing the equation y2 = x3 + 1 has no further integral solutions is tan- tamount to showing a3 − 2b3 = 1 has no integral solution besides the two we already found, (1, 0) and (−1, −1). To study a3 − 2b3 = 1 introduces a whole new bag of complications, so we will simply stop and leave this matter unsettled. Example 3.7. Consider y2 = x3 − 5. We have already seen in Theorem 2.2 that this equation has no integral solutions by a method that only uses calculations in Z. Let’s try to show there are no integral solutions using factorizations in Z[ √−5]. We start with a parity check. If x is even then y2 ≡ −5 ≡ 3 mod 8, but 3 mod 8 is not a square. Therefore x is odd, so y is even. EXAMPLES OF MORDELL’S EQUATION 9 Write the equation as x3 = y2 + 5 = (y + √−5)(y − √−5). Suppose δ is a common factor of y + √−5 and y − √−5. First of all, N(δ) divides y2 + 5, which is odd. Second of all, since δ divides (y + √−5) − (y − √ −5) = 2√−5, N(δ) divides N(2√−5) = 20. Therefore N(δ) is 1 or 5. If N(δ) = 5 then 5|(y2 + 5), so 5|y. Then x3 = y2 + 5 ≡ 0 mod 5, so x ≡ 0 mod 5. Now x and y are both multiples of 5, so 5 = x3 − y2 is a multiple of 25, a contradiction. Hence N(δ) = 1, so δ is a unit. This shows y + √−5 and y − √−5 have no common factor in Z[ √−5] except for units. Since y + √−5 and y − √−5 are relatively prime and their product is a cube, they are both cubes (the units in Z[ √−5] are ±1, which are both cubes). Thus y + √−5 = (m + n√−5) 3 for some integers m and n, so y = m3 − 15mn2 = m(m2 − 15n2), 1 = 3m 2n − 5n3 = n(3m2 − 5n2). From the second equation, n = ±1. If n = 1 then 1 = 3m2 − 5, so 3m2 = 6, which has no integral solution. If n = −1 then 1 = −(3m2 − 5), so 3m2 = 4, which also has no integral solution. We appear to have recovered the fact that y2 = x3 − 5 has no integral solutions. Alas, there is an error in Example 3.7. When we wrote certain numbers in Z[√−5] as cubes, we were implicitly appealing to unique factorization in Z[√ −5], which is in fact false. A counterexample to unique factorization in Z[ √−5] is 6 = 2 · 3 = (1 + √−5)(1 − √−5). That doesn’t mean the numbers in Z[ √−5] that we wanted to be cubes might not be cubes, but our justiﬁcation for those conclusions is certainly faulty. It is true in Z[ √−5] that if αβ is a cube and α and β only have common factors ±1 then α and β are both cubes, but to explain why requires additional techniques to circumvent the lack of unique factorization. Example 3.8. Consider y2 = x3 − 26. Two obvious integral solutions are (3, ±1). Let’s use factorizations in Z[ √−26] to see if (3, ±1) are the only integral solutions. If x is even then y2 ≡ −26 ≡ 6 mod 8, but 6 mod 8 is not a square. Therefore x is odd, so y is odd too. Rewrite the equation as x3 = y2 + 26 = (y + √−26)(y − √−26). Let δ be a common factor of y + √ −26 and y − √−26 in Z[ √−26]. Then N(δ) divides y2 + 26, which is odd. Also δ divides the diﬀerence (y + √−26) − (y − √−26) = 2 √−26, so N(δ) divides 4 · 26 = 8 · 13. Since N(δ) is odd, we see that N(δ) is 1 or 13. There is no element of Z[√ −26] with norm 13, so N(δ) = 1. Therefore δ = ±1, so y + √−26 and y − √−26 have only ±1 as common factors. If we assume Z[√−26] has unique factorization, then since y + √−26 and y − √−26 multiply to a cube and they have only ±1 as common factors, each of them is a cube. Write y + √−26 = (m + n√−26) 3, so y = m 3 − 78mn2 = m(m 2 − 78n2), 1 = 3m 2n − 26n3 = n(3m2 − 26n2). The second equation tells us n = ±1. If n = 1 then 1 = 3m2 − 26, so 3m2 = 27, which tells us m = ±3. Then y = (±3)(9 − 78) = ±207 and x3 = 2072 + 26 = 42875 = 353, so x = 35. 10 KEITH CONRAD We have discovered new integral solutions to y2 = x3 − 26, namely (x, y) = (35, ±207). If n = −1 then 1 = −(3m2 − 26), so 3m2 = 25, which has no integral solutions. Having looked at both possible values of n, we discovered two unexpected integral so- lutions, but we missed the obvious integral solutions (3, ±1)! How could that happen? The reason is that our argument was based on the assumption of unique factorization in Z[ √−26], but there is not unique factorization in Z[ √−26]. A counterexample is 27 = 3 · 3 · 3 = (1 + √−26)(1 − √ −26). This illustrates the failure of unique factorization because 3, 1 + √−26, and 1 − √−26 are all irreducible in Z[ √−26] (this follows from the fact that there is no element of Z[√−26] with norm 3) and one factorization has three factors while the other has two factors. It is true that the only integral solutions to y2 = x3 − 26 are (3, ±1) and (35, ±207), but a valid proof has to get around the lack of unique factorization in Z[ √−26]. As an exercise, for the Mordell equations y2 = x3 + k below try to ﬁnd all the integral solutions assuming that Z[√k] has unique factorization, and then do a computer search to discover an integral solution that was missed. (1) y2 = x3 − 53. (2) y2 = x3 − 61. (3) y2 = x3 − 109. (4) y2 = x3 − 118. 4. Rational solutions The following table describes all the integral solutions for the cases of Mordell’s equation we have looked at. (The examples k = 1, 2, and −26 were not fully justiﬁed above.) k Z-solutions of y2 = x3 + k 1 (−1, 0), (0, ±1), (2, ±3) −1 (1, 0) −2 (3, ±5) −4 (2, ±2), (5, ±11) −5 None 6 None −6 None 7 None 16 (0, 4), (0, −4) −24 None −26 (3, ±1), (35, ±207) 45 None 46 None In each case there are a ﬁnite number of integral solutions. If we look instead at rational solutions, we might not get anything new, but we could get a lot more that is new. The next table summarizes the situation. EXAMPLES OF MORDELL’S EQUATION 11 k Q-solutions of y2 = x3 + k 1 (−1, 0), (0, ±1), (2, ±3) −1 (1, 0) −2 Inﬁnitely many −4 Inﬁnitely many −5 None 6 None −6 None 7 None 16 (0, 4), (0, −4) −24 None −26 Inﬁnitely many 45 None 46 Inﬁnitely many The equations that have more rational solutions than integral solutions are y2 = x3 − 2, y2 = x3 − 4, y2 = x3 − 26, and y2 = x3 + 46. Examples of non-integral rational solutions to these equations are given in the following table. k Q-solution of y2 = x3 + k −2 (129/100, 383/1000) −4 (106/9, 1090/27) −26 (705/4, 18719/8) 46 (−7/4, 51/8) To emphasize the distinction between classifying integral and rational solutions, we return to y2 = x3 + 16. We proved the only integral solutions are (0, ±4). This does not tell us whether or not there are also rational solutions that are not integral solutions. It turns out there are no further rational solutions, and here is an application. If a3 + b3 = c3 with nonzero integers a, b, and c, then the nonzero rational numbers x = 4bc/a2 and y = 4(a3 + 2b3)/a3 satisfy y2 = x3 + 16. (This is taken from [2].) Therefore proving the only rational solutions to y2 = x3 + 16 are (0, ±4) forces x = 0, but x = 4bc/a2 ̸= 0, so this would give a proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem for exponent 3. References [1] S.
