This method generalizes. • Pythagorean triples. • Pell’s equation/recurrences/inﬁnite descent • If you’re looking to construct a solution, try clever algebraic substitutions. • Don’t be afraid to use the quadratic formula! • Quadratic Reciprocity • Look beyond Z: factorizations in Z[i] and Z[ω]. 1 (IMO 1982). Prove that if n is a positive integer such that the equation x3 − 3xy2 + y3 = n has a solution in integers x, y, then it has at least three such solutions. Show that the equation has no solutions in integers for n = 2891. 2 (Crux). Prove that the product of ﬁve consecutive integers is never a perfect square. 3 (IMO 1996). The positive integers a and b are such that the numbers 15a + 16b and 16a − 15b are both squares of positive integers. What is the least possible value that can be taken on by the smaller of these two squares? 4 (IMO Shortlist 2002). Let P be a cubic polynomial given by P (x) = ax3 + bx2 + cx + d, where a, b, c, d are integers and a ̸= 0. Suppose that xP (x) = yP (y) for inﬁnitely many pairs x, y of integers with x ̸= y. Prove that the equation P (x) = 0 has an integer root. 1 MOP 2010, Blue Group Diophantine Equations June 11, 2010 5 (IMO Shortlist 2001). Consider the system x + y = z + u, 2xy = zu. Find the greatest value of the real constant m such that m ≤ x/y for any positive integer solution (x, y, z, u) of the system, with x ≥ y. 6 (IMO Shortlist 2002). Is there an integer n such that the equation 1 a + 1 b + 1 c = m a+b+c has inﬁnitely many solutions in positive integers a, b, c? 7. Prove that there exists an integer m ≥ 2002 and m distinct positive integers a1, a2, . . . , am such that m∏ i=1 a2 i − 4 m∑ i=1 a2 i is a perfect square. 8 (TST 2001). Find all pairs of non-negative integers m, n such that (m + n − 5) 2 = 9mn. 9 (TST 2002). Find in explicit form all ordered pairs of positive integers m, n such that mn − 1 divides m2 + n2. 10. Suppose that x, y are positive integers such that both x(y + 1), y(x + 1) are perfect squares. Show that exactly one of x, y is a perfect square. 11 (IMO Shortlist 2000). Show that for inﬁnitely many n, there exists a triangle with integer sidelengths such that semiperimeter is n times its inradius. 12 (Bulgaria ’01). Let p be a prime number congruent to 3 modulo 4, and consider the equation (p + 2)x2 − (p + 1)y2 + px + (p + 2)y = 1. Prove that this equation has inﬁnitely many solutions in positive integers, and show that if (x, y) = (x0, y0) is a solution of the equation in positive integers, then p | x0. 13. Suppose that x, y are positive integers such that both x(y + 1), y(x + 1) are perfect squares. Show that exactly one of x, y is a perfect square. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
