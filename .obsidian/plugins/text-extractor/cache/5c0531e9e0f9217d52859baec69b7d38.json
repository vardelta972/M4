In the previous notes, many techniques on counting are covered. However, one method that is absent is the idea of recurrence relations. The idea is simple. If we have some parameter n, and an is the number of certain objects in relation to n, then we may be able to derive a recurrence relation for an. This will enable us to calculate an for small values of n. Let us look at an example. Example. How many anagrams of the word ‘orange’ are there such that no letter is in its original position? Solution. This problem can be interpreted as follows. We would like to ﬁnd the number of permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with no ﬁxed points. Recall that if S is a set and f : S → S is a permutation of S, then i ∈ S is a ﬁxed point of f if f (i) = i. We consider the more general problem with n in place of 6. Let an be the number of permutations of {1, 2, . . . , n} with no ﬁxed points. We shall derive a recurrence relation for an. The number of permutations ﬁxing at least one element is n! − an. Also, for 1 ≤ k ≤ n − 1, the number of permutations ﬁxing exactly k elements is ( n k)an−k, since there are ( n k) choices for the positions of the k ﬁxed elements, and there are an−k ways to position the other n − k elements so that there is no ﬁxed point among them. There is also one permutation ﬁxing every element (the identity permutation). It follows that n! − an = 1 + ∑n−1 k=1 (n k) an−k, and hence the required recurrence relation is an = n! − 1 − n−1∑ k=1 (n k )an−k. In particular, we have a1 = 0, a2 = 2! − 1 − (2 1 ) a1 = 2 − 1 − 0 = 1, a3 = 3! − 1 − (3 1 ) a2 − ( 3 2 )a1 = 6 − 1 − 3 · 1 − 0 = 2, a4 = 4! − 1 − (4 1 ) a3 − (4 2 ) a2 − ( 4 3 )a1 = 24 − 1 − 4 · 2 − 6 · 1 − 0 = 9, a5 = 5! − 1 − ( 5 1 ) a4 − (5 2 ) a3 − (5 3 ) a2 − ( 5 4 )a1 = 120 − 1 − 5 · 9 − 10 · 2 − 10 · 1 − 0 = 44, 1 a6 = 6! − 1 − ( 6 1 )a5 − ( 6 2 ) a4 − ( 6 3 ) a3 − (6 4 ) a2 − (6 5 ) a1 = 720 − 1 − 6 · 44 − 15 · 9 − 20 · 2 − 15 · 1 − 0 = 265. Problems In this set of problems, some can be tackled by using recurrence relations, while others can be tackled by the methods that were discussed in ‘Combinatorics’. 1. How many anagrams of the word ‘mathematics’ are there where no two vowels are adjacent? 2. How many integers in the set {1, 2, 3, . . . , 1000000} are neither perfect squares, nor perfect cubes, nor perfect fourth powers? 3. Find the number of permutations {a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6} of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that, for no integer k with 1 ≤ k ≤ 5, we have {a1, a2, . . . , ak} forming a permutation of {1, 2, . . . , k}. 4. How many permutations of {1, 2, 3, . . . , n} are there such that no three consecutive terms are either increasing or decreasing, when (a) n = 7; (b) n = 8? For example, for n = 7, such a permutation can be {1, 6, 4, 7, 2, 5, 3}. 5. For a positive integer n, let P (n) be the number of partitions of n. For example, P (4) = 5, with the partitions being 1 + 1 + 1 + 1, 1 + 1 + 2, 2 + 2, 1 + 2, and 4. The diversity of a partition is the number of distinct terms in the partition. Let Q(n) be the sum of the diversities of all the partitions of n. For example, Q(4) = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7. Prove that for all positive integers n, Q(n) = 1 + P (1) + P (2) + · · · + P (n − 1). 6. A1A2A3 · · · A20 is a regular 20-gon. How many non-isosceles triangles are there, whose vertices are three of the vertices of A1A2A3 · · · A20, but whose sides are not sides of A1A2A3 · · · A20? 7. How many ways can the number 1000000 be expressed as a product of three positive integers? Products which only diﬀer in the order of the factors are not considered to be diﬀerent. 8. How many pairwise non-congruent triangles are there with integer sides and perimeter 2010? 2 9. Show that the number of 3-element subsets {a, b, c} of {1, 2, . . . , 63} with a + b + c < 95 is less than the number of those with a + b + c ≥ 95. 10. The numbers 1 to 64 are written on an 8 × 8 chessboard so that 1 to 8 are written from left to right in the ﬁrst row, 9 to 16 are written from left to right in the second row, and so on. Minus signs are then inserted in front of some of the numbers, so that there are exactly four in each row and exactly four in each column. Prove that the sum of all of the resulting numbers is 0. 11. Find the number of 4 × 4 arrays, whose entries are from the set {0, 1, 2, 3}, and which are such that the sum of the numbers in each of the four rows and in each of the four columns is divisible by 4. 12. A type 1 sequence is a sequence with each term 0 or 1 which does not have 0, 1, 0 as consecutive terms. A type 2 sequence is a sequence with each term 0 or 1 which does not have 0, 0, 1, 1 or 1, 1, 0, 0 as consecutive terms. Show that there are twice as many type 2 sequences of length n + 1 as type 1 sequences of length n. 13. The numbers 1, 2, . . . , n2 are arranged in an n × n array, so that the numbers in each row increase from left to right, and the numbers in each column increase from top to bottom. For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let ai be the number of possible values of the entry in the ith row and ith column. Prove that a1 + a2 + · · · + an = 1 3n(n2 − 3n + 5). 14. Let p be a permutation of the set Sn = {1, 2, 3, . . . , n}. An element j ∈ Sn is called a ﬁxed point of p if p(j) = j. Let fn be the number of permutations having no ﬁxed points, and gn be the number with exactly one ﬁxed point. Show that |fn − gn| = 1. 15. Given a permutation σ = {a1, a2, . . . , an} of {1, 2, . . . , n}, an ordered pair (ai, aj) is called an inversion of σ if 1 ≤ i < j ≤ n and ai > aj. Let m(σ) denote the number of inversions of the permutation σ. Find the average of m(σ) as σ varies over all permutations. 16. Let pn(k) be the number of permutations of the set {1, . . . , n}, n ≥ 1, which have exactly k ﬁxed points. Prove that n∑ k=0 kpn(k) = n! (Remark: For a set S and a permutation f : S → S, an element i in S is called a ﬁxed point of the permutation f if f (i) = i.) 17. A fair dice is thrown n times. Find the probability that the sum of the scores is divisible by 5. 3 18. Let L = {(x, y) : x, y ∈ Z} be the set of all lattice points in the plane. A path of length n is a chain P0, P1, . . . , Pn of points in L such that Pi−1Pi = 1 for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. Let F (n) be the number of distinct paths beginning at P0 = (0, 0) and ending at any point Pn on the line y = 0. Prove that F (n) = ( 2n n ) . 19. On the circumference of a circle, 2n points are marked and equally spaced. How many ways are there to join these points in pairs with n chords so that no two chords intersect within the circle? 20. For a positive integer n, a partition of n is an increasing sequence of positive integers with sum n. For example, the partitions of 5 are: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 1, 1, 2; 1, 1, 3; 1, 4; 5; 1, 2, 2; and 2, 3. If p is a partition, let f (p) be the number of 1s in p, and g(p) be the number of distinct integers in p. Show that ∑ f (p) = ∑ g(p), where each sum is taken over all partitions of n. For example, when n = 5, we have ∑ f (p) = 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 12, and ∑ g(p) = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 12. 4","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
