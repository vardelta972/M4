These applications in- clude results in additive number theory and in the study of graph coloring problems. Many of these are known results, to which we present uniﬁed proofs, and some results are new. 1 Introduction Hilbert’s Nullstellensatz (see, e.g., [58]) is the fundamental theorem that asserts that if F is an algebraically closed ﬁeld, and f, g1, . . . , gm are polynomials in the ring of polynomials F [x1, . . . , xn], where f vanishes over all common zeros of g1, . . . , gm, then there is an integer k and polynomials h1, . . . , hm in F [x1, . . . , xn] so that f k = n∑ i=1 higi. In the special case m = n, where each gi is a univariate polynomial of the form ∏s∈Si(xi − s), a stronger conclusion holds, as follows. Theorem 1.1 Let F be an arbitrary ﬁeld, and let f = f (x1, . . . , xn) be a polynomial in F [x1, . . . , xn]. Let S1, . . . , Sn be nonempty subsets of F and deﬁne gi(xi) = ∏s∈Si(xi − s). If f vanishes over all the common zeros of g1, . . . , gn (that is; if f (s1, . . . , sn) = 0 for all si ∈ Si), then there are polynomials h1, . . . , hn ∈ F [x1, . . . , xn] satisfying deg(hi) ≤ deg(f ) − deg(gi) so that f = n∑ i=1 higi. Moreover, if f, g1, . . . gn lie in R[x1, . . . , xn] for some subring R of F then there are polynomials hi ∈ R[x1, . . . , xn] as above. ∗Department of Mathematics, Raymond and Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel and Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA.

Suppose the degree deg(f ) of f is ∑n i=1 ti, where each ti is a nonnegative integer, and suppose the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 x ti i in f is nonzero. Then, if S1, . . . , Sn are subsets of F with |Si| > ti, there are s1 ∈ S1, s2 ∈ S2, . . . , sn ∈ Sn so that f (s1, . . . , sn) ̸= 0. In this paper we prove these two theorems, which may be called Combinatorial Nullstellensatz, and describe several combinatorial applications of them. After presenting the (simple) proofs of the above theorems in Section 2, we show, in Section 3 that the classical theorem of Chevalley and Warning on roots of systems of polynomials as well as the basic theorem of Cauchy and Davenport on the addition of residue classes follow as simple consequences. We proceed to describe additional applications in Additive Number Theory and in Graph Theory and Combinatorics in Sections 4,5,6,7 and 8. Many of these applications are known results, proved here in a uniﬁed way, and some are new. There are several known results that assert that a combinatorial structure satisﬁes certain combinatorial property if and only if an appropriate polynomial associated with it lies in a properly deﬁned ideal. In Section 9 we apply our technique and obtain several new results of this form. The ﬁnal Section 10 contains some concluding remarks and open problems. 2 The proofs of the two basic theorems To prove Theorem 1.1 we need the following simple lemma proved, for example, in [13]. For the sake of completeness we include the short proof. Lemma 2.1 Let P = P (x1, x2, . . . , xn) be a polynomial in n variables over an arbitrary ﬁeld F . Suppose that the degree of P as a polynomial in xi is at most ti for 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and let Si ⊂ F be a set of at least ti + 1 distinct members of F . If P (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = 0 for all n-tuples (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 × S2 × . . . × Sn, then P ≡ 0. Proof. We apply induction on n. For n = 1, the lemma is simply the assertion that a non-zero polynomial of degree t1 in one variable can have at most t1 distinct zeros. Assuming that the lemma holds for n − 1, we prove it for n (n ≥ 2). Given a polynomial P = P (x1, . . . , xn) and sets Si satisfying the hypotheses of the lemma, let us write P as a polynomial in xn- that is, P = tn∑ i=0 Pi(x1, . . . , xn−1)x i n, 2 where each Pi is a polynomial with xj-degree bounded by tj. For each ﬁxed (n − 1)-tuple (x1, . . . , xn−1) ∈ S1 × S2 × . . . × Sn−1, the polynomial in xn obtained from P by substituting the values of x1, . . . , xn−1 vanishes for all xn ∈ Sn, and is thus identically 0. Thus Pi(x1, . . . , xn−1) = 0 for all (x1, . . . , xn−1) ∈ S1 × . . . × Sn−1. Hence, by the induction hypothesis, Pi ≡ 0 for all i, implying that P ≡ 0. This completes the induction and the proof of the lemma. 2 Proof of Theorem 1.1. Deﬁne ti = |Si| − 1 for all i. By assumption, f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for every n-tuple (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 × S2 × . . . × Sn. (1) For each i, 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let gi(xi) = ∏ s∈Si(xi − s) = x ti+1 i − ti∑ j=0 gijx j i . Observe that, if xi ∈ Si then gi(xi) = 0- that is, x ti+1 i = ∑ti j=0 gijx j i . (2) Let f be the polynomial obtained by writing f as a linear combination of monomials and replacing, repeatedly, each occurrence of x fi i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), where fi > ti, by a linear combination of smaller powers of xi, using the relations (2). The resulting polynomial f is clearly of degree at most ti in xi, for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and is obtained from f by subtracting from it products of the form higi, where the degree of each polynomial hi ∈ F [x1, . . . , xn] does not exceed deg(f ) − deg(gi) (and where the coeﬃcients of each hi are in the smallest ring containing all coeﬃcients of f and g1, . . . , gn.) Moreover, f (x1, . . . , xn) = f (x1, . . . , xn), for all (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 ×. . .×Sn, since the relations (2) hold for these values of x1, . . . , xn. Therefore, by (1), f (x1, . . . , xn) = 0 for every n-tuple (x1, . . . , xn) ∈ S1 ×. . .×Sn and hence, by Lemma 2.1, f ≡ 0. This implies that f = ∑n i=1 higi, and completes the proof. 2 Proof of Theorem 1.2. Clearly we may assume that |Si| = ti+1 for all i. Suppose the result is false, and deﬁne gi(xi) = ∏s∈Si(xi − s). By Theorem 1.1 there are polynomials h1, . . . , hn ∈ F [x1, . . . , xn] satisfying deg(hj) ≤ ∑n i=1 ti − deg(gj) so that f = n∑ i=1 higi. By assumption, the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 x ti i in the left hand side is nonzero, and hence so is the coeﬃcient of this monomial in the right hand side. However, the degree of higi = hi ∏s∈Si(xi − s) is at most deg(f ), and if there are any monomials of degree deg(f ) in it they are divisible by x ti+1 i . It follows that the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 x ti i in the right hand side is zero, and this contradiction completes the proof. 2 3 3 Two classical applications The following theorem, conjectured by Artin in 1934, was proved by Chevalley in 1935 and extended by Warning in 1935. Here we present a very short proof using our Theorem 1.2 above. For simplicity, we restrict ourselves to the case of ﬁnite prime ﬁelds, though the proof easily extends to arbitrary ﬁnite ﬁelds. Theorem 3.1 (cf., e.g., [52]) Let p be a prime, and let P1 = P1(x1, . . . , xn), P2 = P2(x1, . . . , xn), . . . , Pm = Pm(x1, . . . , xn) be m polynomials in the ring Zp[x1, . . . , xn]. If n > ∑m i=1 deg(Pi) and the polynomials Pi have a common zero (c1, . . . , cn), then they have another common zero. Proof. Suppose this is false, and deﬁne f = f (x1, . . . , xn) = m∏ i=1(1 − Pi(x1, . . . , xn) p−1) − δ n∏ j=1 ∏ c∈Zp,c̸=cj(xj − c), where δ is chosen so that f (c1, . . . , cn) = 0. (3) Note that this determines the value of δ, and this value is nonzero. Note also that f (s1, . . . , sn) = 0 (4) for all si ∈ Zp. Indeed, this is certainly true, by (3), if (s1, . . . , sn) = (c1, . . . , cn). For other values of (s1, . . . , sn), there is, by assumption, a polynomial Pj that does not vanish on (s1, . . . , sn), implying that 1 − Pj(s1, . . . , sn)p−1 = 0. Similarly, since si ̸= ci for some i, the product ∏c∈Zp,c̸=ci(si − c) is zero and hence so is the value of f (s1, . . . , sn). Deﬁne ti = p − 1 for all i and note that the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 x ti i in f is −δ ̸= 0, since the total degree of m∏ i=1(1 − Pi(x1, . . . , xn) p−1) is (p − 1) ∑m i=1 deg(Pi) < (p − 1)n. Therefore, by Theorem 1.2 with Si = Zp for all i we conclude that there are s1, . . . , sn ∈ Zp for which f (s1, . . . , sn) ̸= 0, contradicting (4) and completing the proof. 2 The Cauchy-Davenport Theorem, which has numerous applications in Additive Number Theory, is the following. Theorem 3.2 ([20]) If p is a prime, and A, B are two nonempty subsets of Zp, then |A + B| ≥ min{p, |A| + |B| − 1}. 4 Cauchy proved this theorem in 1813, and applied it to give a new proof to a lemma of Lagrange in his well known 1770 paper that shows that any integer is a sum of four squares. Davenport formulated the theorem as a discrete analogue of a conjecture of Khintchine (which was proved a few years later by H. Mann) about the Schnirelman density of the sum of two sequences of integers. There are numerous extensions of this result, see, e.g., [45]. The proofs of Theorem 3.2 given by Cauchy and Davenport are based on the same combinatorial idea, and apply induction on |B|. A diﬀerent, algebraic proof has recently been found by the authors of [10], [11], and its main advantage is that it extends easily and gives several related results. As shown below, this proof can be described as a simple application of Theorem 1.2. Proof of Theorem 3.2. If |A| + |B| > p the result is trivial, since in this case for every g ∈ Zp the two sets A and g − B intersect, implying that A + B = Zp. Assume, therefore, that |A| + |B| ≤ p and suppose the result is false and |A + B| ≤ |A| + |B| − 2. Let C be a subset of Zp satisfying A + B ⊂ C and |C| = |A| + |B| − 2. Deﬁne f = f (x, y) = ∏c∈C(x + y − c) and observe that by the deﬁnition of C f (a, b) = 0 for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B. (5) Put t1 = |A| − 1, t2 = |B| − 1 and note that the coeﬃcient of xt1yt2 in f is the binomial coeﬃcient (|A|+|B|−2 |A|−1 ) which is nonzero in Zp, since |A| + |B| − 2 < p. Therefore, by Theorem 1.2 (with n = 2, S1 = A, S2 = B), there is an a ∈ A and a b ∈ B so that f (a, b) ̸= 0, contradicting (5) and completing the proof. 2 4 Restricted sums The ﬁrst theorem in this section is a general result, ﬁrst proved in [11]. Here we observe that it is a simple consequence of Theorem 1.2 above. We also describe some of its applications, proved in [11], which are extensions of the Cauchy Davenport Theorem. Let p be a prime. For a polynomial h = h(x0, x1, . . . , xk) over Zp and for subsets A0, A1, . . . , Ak of Zp, deﬁne ⊕h k∑ i=0 Ai = {a0 + a1 + . . . + ak : ai ∈ Ai, h(a0, a1, . . . , ak) ̸= 0}. Theorem 4.1 ([11]) Let p be a prime and let h = h(x0, . . . , xk) be a polynomial over Zp. Let A0, A1, . . . , Ak be nonempty subsets of Zp, where |Ai| = ci + 1 and deﬁne m = ∑k i=0 ci − deg(h). If the coeﬃcient of ∏k i=0 x ci i in (x0 + x1 + · · · + xk) mh(x0, x1, . . . , xk) 5 is nonzero (in Zp) then | ⊕h k∑ i=0 Ai| ≥ m + 1 (and hence m < p). Proof Suppose the assertion is false, and let E be a (multi-) set of m (not necessarily distinct) elements of Zp that contains the set ⊕h ∑k i=0 Ai. Let Q = Q(x0, . . . , xk) be the polynomial deﬁned as follows: Q(x0, . . . , xk) = h(x0, x1, . . . xk) · ∏ e∈E(x0 + . . . + xk − e). Note that Q(x0, . . . , xk) = 0 for all (x0, . . . , xk) ∈ (A0, . . . , Ak). (6) This is because for each such (x0, . . . , xk) either h(x0, . . . , xk) = 0 or x0 + . . . + xk ∈ ⊕h ∑k i=0 Ai ⊂ E. Note also that deg(Q) = m + deg(h) = ∑k i=0 ci and hence the coeﬃcient of the monomial x c0 0 · · · x ck k in Q is the same as that of this monomial in the polynomial (x0 + . . . + xk)mh(x0, . . . , xk), which is nonzero, by assumption. By Theorem 1.2 there are x0 ∈ A0, x1 ∈ A1, . . . , xk ∈ Ak such that Q(x0, x1, . . . , xk) ̸= 0, contradicting (6) and completing the proof. 2 One of the applications of the last theorem is the following. Proposition 4.2 Let p be a prime, and let A0, A1, . . . , Ak be nonempty subsets of the cyclic group Zp. If |Ai| ̸= |Aj| for all 0 ≤ i < j ≤ k and ∑k i=0 |Ai| ≤ p + (k+2 2 ) − 1 then |{a0 + a1 + . . . + ak : ai ∈ Ai, ai ̸= aj for all i ̸= j}| ≥ k∑ i=0 |Ai| − ( k + 2 2 ) + 1. Note that the very special case of this proposition in which k = 1, A0 = A and A1 = A − {a} for an arbitrary element a ∈ A implies that if A ⊂ Zp and 2|A| − 1 ≤ p + 2 then the number of sums a1 + a2 with a1, a2 ∈ A and a1 ̸= a2 is at least 2|A| − 3. This easily implies the following theorem, conjectured by Erd˝os and Heilbronn in 1964 (cf., e.g., [25]). Special cases of this conjecture have been proved by various researchers ([49], [43], [50], [29]) and the full conjecture has recently been proved by Dias Da Silva and Hamidoune [21], using some tools from linear algebra and the representation theory of the symmetric group. Theorem 4.3 ([21]) If p is a prime, and A is a nonempty subset of Zp, then |{a + a ′ : a, a ′ ∈ A, a ̸= a ′}| ≥ min{p, 2|A| − 3}. 6 In order to deduce Proposition 4.2 from Theorem 4.1 we need the following Lemma which can be easily deduced from the known results about the Ballot problem (see, e.g., [44]), as well as from the known connection between this problem and the hook formula for the number of Young tableaux of a given shape. A simple, direct proof is given in [11]. Lemma 4.4 Let c0, . . . , ck be nonnegative integers and suppose that ∑k i=0 ci = m + (k+1 2 ), where m is a nonnegative integer. Then the coeﬃcient of ∏k i=0 x ci i in the polynomial (x0 + x1 + . . . + xk) m ∏ k≥i>j≥0(xi − xj) is m! c0!c1! . . . ck! ∏ k≥i>j≥0(ci − cj). 2 Let p be a prime, and let A0, A1, . . . , Ak be nonempty subsets of the cyclic group Zp. Deﬁne ⊕ k i=0Ai = {a0 + a1 + . . . + ak : ai ∈ Ai, ai ̸= aj for all i ̸= j}. In this notation, the assertion of Proposition 4.2 is that if |Ai| ̸= |Aj| for all 0 ≤ i < j ≤ k and ∑k i=0 |Ai| ≤ p + (k+2 2 ) − 1 then | ⊕ k i=0 Ai| ≥ k∑ i=0 |Ai| − ( k + 2 2 ) + 1. Proof of Proposition 4.2. Deﬁne h(x0, . . . , xk) = ∏ k≥i>j≥0(xi − xj), and note that for this h, the sum ⊕k i=0Ai is precisely the sum ⊕h ∑k i=0 Ai. Suppose |Ai| = ci + 1 and put m = k∑ i=0 ci − ( k + 1 2 ) (= k∑ i=0 |Ai| − ( k + 2 2 ) ). By assumption m < p and by Lemma 4.4 the coeﬃcient of ∏k i=0 x ci i in h · (x0 + . . . + xk) m is m! c0!c1! . . . ck! ∏ k≥i>j≥0(ci − cj), which is nonzero modulo p, since m < p and the numbers ci are pairwise distinct. Since m = ∑k i=0 ci + deg(h), the desired result follows from Theorem 4.1. 2 An easy consequence of Proposition 4.2 is the following. See [11] for the detailed proof. 7 Theorem 4.5 Let p be a prime, and let A0, . . . , Ak be nonempty subsets of Zp, where |Ai| = bi, and suppose b0 ≥ b1 . . . ≥ bk. Deﬁne b′ 0, . . . , b′ k by b′ 0 = b0 and b′ i = min{b′ i−1 − 1, bi}, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. (7) If b′ k > 0 then | ⊕ k i=0 Ai| ≥ min{p, k∑ i=0 b′ i − ( k + 2 2 ) + 1}. Moreover, the above estimate is sharp for all possible values of p ≥ b0 ≥ . . . ≥ bk. The following result of Dias da Silva and Hamidoune [21] is a simple consequence of (a special case of) the above theorem. Theorem 4.6 ([21]) Let p be a prime and let A be a nonempty subset of Zp. Let s∧A denote the set of all sums of s distinct elements of A. Then |s∧A| ≥ min{p, s|A| − s2 + 1}. Proof. If |A| < s there is nothing to prove. Otherwise put s = k + 1 and apply Theorem 4.5 with Ai = A for all i. Here b′ i = |A| − i for all 0 ≤ i ≤ k and hence |(k + 1) ∧A| = | ⊕ k i=0 Ai| ≥ min{p, k∑ i=0(|A| − i) − ( k + 2 2 ) + 1} = min{p, (k + 1)|A| − ( k + 1 2 ) − ( k + 2 2 ) + 1} = min{p, (k + 1)|A| − (k + 1) 2 + 1}. 2 Another easy application of Theorem 4.1 is the following result, proved in [10]. Proposition 4.7 If p is a prime and A, B are two nonempty subsets of Zp, then |{a + b : a ∈ A, b ∈ B, ab ̸= 1}| ≥ min{p, |A| + |B| − 3}. The proof is by applying Theorem 4.1 with k = 1, h = x0x1 − 1, A0 = A, A1 = B, and m = |A| + |B| − 4. It is also shown in [10] that the above estimate is tight in all nontrivial cases. Additional extensions of the above proposition appear in [11]. 5 Set addition in vector spaces over prime ﬁelds A triple (r, s, n) of positive integers satisﬁes the Hopf-Stiefel condition if ( n k ) is even for every integer k satisfying n − r < k < s. 8 This condition arises in Topology. However, studying the combinatorial aspects of the well known Hurwitz problem, Yuzvinsky [59] showed that it has an interesting relation to a natural additive problem. he proved that in a vector space of inﬁnite dimension over GF (2), there exist two subsets A, B ⊂ V satisfying |A| = r, |B| = s and |A + B| ≤ n if and only if the triple (r, s, n) satisﬁes the Hopf-Stiefel condition. Eliahou and Kervaire [23] have shown very recently that this can be proved using the algebraic technique of [10], [11], and generalized this result to an arbitrary prime p, thus obtaining a common generalization of Yuzvinsky’s result and the Cauchy Davenport Theorem. Here is a description of their result, and a quick derivation of it from Theorem 1.2. It is worth noting that the same result also follows from the main result of Bollob´as and Leader in [18], proved by a diﬀerent, more combinatorial, approach. Let us say that a triple (r, s, n) of positive integers satisﬁes the Hopf-Stiefel condition with respect to a prime p if ( n k ) is divisible by p for every integer k satisfying n − r < k < s. (8) Let βp(r, s) denote the smallest integer n for which the triple (r, s, n) satisﬁes (8). We note that it is not diﬃcult to give a recursive formula for βp(r, s), which enables one to compute it quickly, given the representation of r and s in basis p. Theorem 5.1 ([23], see also [18]) If A and B are two ﬁnite nonempty subsets of a vector space V over GF (p), and |A| = r, |B| = s, then |A + B| ≥ βp(r, s). Proof. We may assume that V is ﬁnite, and identify it with the ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq of the same cardinality over GF (p). Viewing A and B as subsets of Fq, deﬁne C = A + B, and assume the assertion is false and |C| = n < βp(r, s). As in the previous section, deﬁne Q(x, y) = ∏ c∈C(x + y − c), where Q is a polynomial over Fq, and observe that Q(a, b) = 0 for all a ∈ A, b ∈ B. By the deﬁnition of βp(r, s) there is some k satisfying n − r < k < s such that (n k) is not divisible by p. Therefore, the coeﬃcient of xn−kyk in the above polynomial is not zero, and since |A| = r > n − k, |B| = s > k there are, by Theorem 1.2, a ∈ A and b ∈ B such that Q(a, b) ̸= 0, contradiction. This completes the proof. 2 The authors of [23] have also shown that the estimate in Theorem 5.1 is sharp for all possible r and s. In fact, if A is the set of r vectors whose coordinates correspond to the p-adic representation 9 of the integers 0, 1, . . . , r − 1, and B is the set of s vectors whose coordinates correspond to the p-adic representation of the integers 0, 1, . . . , s−1, it is not too diﬃcult to check that A+B is the set of of all vectors whose coordinates correspond to the p-adic representation of the integers 0, 1, . . . , βp(r, s)−1. For more details and several extensions, see [23]. 6 Graphs, subgraphs and cubes A well known conjecture of Berge and Sauer, proved by Ta´skinov [53], asserts that any simple 4- regular graph contains a 3-regular subgraph. This assertion is easily seen to be false for graphs with multiple edges, but as shown in [6] one extra edge suﬃces to ensure a 3-regular subgraph in this more general case as well. This follows from the case p = 3 in the following result, which, as shown below, can be derived quickly from Theorem 1.2. Theorem 6.1 ([6]) For any prime p, any loopless graph G = (V, E) with average degree bigger than 2p − 2 and maximum degree at most 2p − 1 contains a p-regular subgraph. Proof. Let (av,e)v∈V,e∈E denote the incidence matrix of G deﬁned by av,e = 1 if v ∈ e and av,e = 0 otherwise. Associate each edge e of G with a variable xe and consider the polynomial F = ∏ v∈V [1 − (∑ e∈E av,exe) p−1] − ∏ e∈E(1 − xe), over GF (p). Notice that the degree of F is |E|, since the degree of the ﬁrst product is at most (p − 1)|V | < |E|, by the assumption on the average degree of G. Moreover, the coeﬃcient of ∏e∈E xe in F is (−1)|E|+1 ̸= 0. Therefore, by Theorem 1.2, there are values xe ∈ {0, 1} such that F (xe : e ∈ E) ̸= 0. By the deﬁnition of F , the above vector (xe : e ∈ E) is not the zero vector, since for this vector F = 0. In addition, for this vector, ∑ e∈E av,exe is zero modulo p for every v, since otherwise F would vanish at this point. Therefore, in the subgraph consisting of all edges e ∈ E for which xe = 1 all degrees are divisible by p, and since the maximum degree is smaller than 2p all positive degrees are precisely p, as needed. 2 The assertion of Theorem 6.1 is proved in [6] for prime powers p as well, but it is not known if it holds for every integer p. Combining this result with some additional combinatorial arguments, one can show that for every k ≥ 4r, every loopless k-regular graph contains an r-regular subgraph. For more details and additional results, see [6]. Erd¨os and Sauer (c.f., e.g., [16], page 399) raised the problem of estimating the maximum number of edges in a simple graph on n vertices that contains no 3-regular subgraph. They conjectured that for every positive ϵ this number does not exceed n1+ϵ, provided n is suﬃciently large as a function 10 of ϵ. This has been proved by Pyber [47], using Theorem 6.1. He proved that any simple graph on n vertices with at least 200n log n edges contains a subgraph with maximum degree 5 and average degree more than 4. This subgraph contains, by Theorem 6.1, a 3-regular subgraph. On the other hand, Pyber, R¨odl and Szemer´edi [48] proved, by probabilistic arguments, that there are simple graphs on n vertices with at least Ω(n log log n) edges that contain no 3-regular subgraphs. Thus Pyber’s estimate is not far from being best possible. Here is another application of Theorem 1.2, which is not very natural, but demonstrates its versatility. Proposition 6.2 Let p be a prime, and let G = (V, E) be a graph on a set of |V | > d(p − 1) vertices. Then there is a nonempty subset U of vertices of G such that the number of cliques of d vertices of G that intersect U is 0 modulo p. Proof. For each subset I of vertices of G, let K(I) denote the number of copies of Kd in G that contain I. Associate each vertex v ∈ V with a variable xv, and consider the polynomial F = ∏ v∈V (1 − xv) − 1 + G, where G = [ ∑ ∅̸=I⊂V (−1) |I|+1K(I) ∏ i∈I xi] p−1 over GF (p). Since K(I) is obviously zero for all I of cardinality bigger than d, the degree of this polynomial is |V |, as the degree of G is at most d(p − 1) < |V |. Moreover, the coeﬃcient of ∏v∈V xv in F is (−1)|V | ̸= 0. Therefore, by Theorem 1.2, there are xv ∈ {0, 1} for which F (xv : v ∈ V ) ̸= 0. Since F vanishes on the all 0 vector, it follows that not all numbers xv are zero, and hence that G(xv : v ∈ V ) ̸= 1, implying, by Fermat’s little Theorem that ∑ ∅̸=I⊂V (−1) |I|+1K(I) ∏ i∈I xi ≡ 0( mod p). However, the left hand side of the last congruence is precisely the number of copies of Kd that intersect the set U = {v : xv = 1}, by the Inclusion-Exclusion formula. Since U is nonempty, the desired result follows. 2 The assertion of the last proposition can be proved for prime powers p as well. See also [8], [4] for some related results. Some versions of these results arise in the study of the minimum possible degree of a polynomial that represents the OR function of n variables in the sense discussed in [54] and its references. We close this section with a simple geometric result, proved in [7] answering a question of Komj´ath. As shown below, this result is also a simple consequence of Theorem 1.2. 11 Theorem 6.3 ([7]) Let H1, H2, . . . , Hm be a family of hyperplanes in Rn that cover all vertices of the unit cube {0, 1}n but one. Then m ≥ n. Proof. Clearly we may assume that the uncovered vertex is the all zero vector. Let (ai, x) = bi be the equation deﬁning Hi, where x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), and (a, b) is the inner product between the two vectors a and b. Note that for every i, bi ̸= 0, since Hi does not cover the origin. Assume the assertion is false and m < n, and consider the polynomial P (x) = (−1) n+m+1 m∏ j=1 bj n∏ i=1(xi − 1) − m∏ i=1[(ai, x) − bi]. The degree of this polynomial is clearly n, and the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 xi in it is (−1)n+m+1 ∏m j=1 bj ̸= 0. Therefore, by Theorem 1.2 there is a point x ∈ {0, 1}n for which P (x) ̸= 0. This point is not the all zero vector, as P vanishes on it, and therefore it is some other vertex of the cube. But in this case (ai, x) − bi = 0 for some i (as the vertex is covered by some Hi), implying that P does vanish on this point, a contradiction. 2 The above result is clearly tight. Several extensions are proved in [7]. 7 Graph Coloring Graph coloring is arguably the most popular subject in graph theory. An interesting variant of the classical problem of coloring properly the vertices of a graph with the minimum possible number of colors arises when one imposes some restrictions on the colors available for every vertex. This variant received a considerable amount of attention that led to several fascinating conjectures and results, and its study combines interesting combinatorial techniques with powerful algebraic and probabilistic ideas. The subject, initiated independently by Vizing [57] and by Erd˝os, Rubin and Taylor [27], is usually known as the study of the choosability properties of a graph. Tarsi and the author developed in [13] an algebraic technique that has already been applied by various researchers to solve several problems in this area as well as problems dealing with traditional graph coloring. In this section we observe that the basic results of this technique can be derived from Theorem 1.2, and describe various applications. More details on some of these applications can be found in the survey [2]. We start with some notation and background. A vertex coloring of a graph G is an assignment of a color to each vertex of G. The coloring is proper if adjacent vertices receive distinct colors. The chromatic number χ(G) of G is the minimum number of colors used in a proper vertex coloring of G. An edge coloring of G is, similarly, an assignment of a color to each edge of G. It is proper if adjacent edges receive distinct colors. The minimum number of colors in a proper edge-coloring of 12 G is the chromatic index χ′(G) of G. This is clearly equal to the chromatic number of the line graph of G. If G = (V, E) is a (ﬁnite, directed or undirected) graph, and f is a function that assigns to each vertex v of G a positive integer f (v), we say that G is f -choosable if, for every assignment of sets of integers S(v) ⊂ Z to all the vertices v ∈ V , where |S(v)| = f (v) for all v, there is a proper vertex coloring c : V 7→ Z so that c(v) ∈ S(v) for all v ∈ V . The graph G is k-choosable if it is f -choosable for the constant function f (v) ≡ k. The choice number of G, denoted ch(G), is the minimum integer k so that G is k-choosable. Obviously, this number is at least the classical chromatic number χ(G) of G. The choice number of the line graph of G, which we denote here by ch′(G), is usually called the list chromatic index of G, and it is clearly at least the chromatic index χ′(G) of G. As observed by various researchers, there are many graphs G for which the choice number ch(G) is strictly larger than the chromatic number χ(G). A simple example demonstrating this fact is the complete bipartite graph K3,3. If {u1, u2, u3} and {v1, v2, v3} are its two vertex-classes and S(ui) = S(vi) = {1, 2, 3} \\ {i}, then there is no proper vertex coloring assigning to each vertex w a color from its class S(w). Therefore, the choice number of this graph exceeds its chromatic number. In fact, it is not diﬃcult to show that, for any k ≥ 2, there are bipartite graphs whose choice number exceeds k. Moreover, in [2] it is proved, using probabilistic arguments, that for every k there is some ﬁnite c(k) so that the choice number of every simple graph with minimum degree at least c(k) exceeds k. In view of this, the following conjecture, suggested independently by various researchers including Vizing, Albertson, Collins, Tucker and Gupta, which apparently appeared ﬁrst in print in the paper of Bollob´as and Harris ([17]), is somewhat surprising. Conjecture 7.1 (The list coloring conjecture) For every graph G, ch′(G) = χ′(G). This conjecture asserts that for line graphs there is no gap at all between the choice number and the chromatic number. Many of the most interesting results in the area are proofs of special cases of this conjecture, which is still wide open. An asymptotic version of it, however, has been proven by Kahn [38] using probabilistic arguments: for simple graphs of maximum degree d, ch′(G) = (1 + o(1))d, where the o(1)-term tends to zero as d tends to inﬁnity. Since in this case χ′(G) is either d or d + 1, by Vizing’s theorem [56], this shows that the list coloring conjecture is asymptotically nearly correct. The graph polynomial fG = fG(x1, x2, . . . , xn) of a directed or undirected graph G = (V, E) on a set V = {v1, . . . , vn} of n vertices is deﬁned by fG(x1, x2, . . . , xn) = Π{(xi−xj) : i < j , {vi, vj} ∈ E}. This polynomial has been studied by various researchers, starting already with Petersen [46] in 1891. See also, for example, [51], [40]. 13 A subdigraph H of a directed graph D is called Eulerian if the indegree d− H (v) of every vertex v of H is equal to its outdegree d+ H (v). Note that we do not assume that H is connected. H is even if it has an even number of edges, otherwise, it is odd . Let EE(D) and EO(D) denote the numbers of even and odd Eulerian subgraphs of D, respectively. (For convenience we agree that the empty subgraph is an even Eulerian subgraph.) The following result is proved in [13]. Theorem 7.2 Let D = (V, E) be an orientation of an undirected graph G, denote V = {1, 2, , . . . , n} and deﬁne f : V 7→ Z by f (i) = di + 1, where di is the outdegree of i in D. If EE(D) ̸= EO(D), then D is f -choosable. Proof (sketch): For 1 ≤ i ≤ n, let Si ⊂ Z be a set of di + 1 distinct integers. The existence of a proper coloring of D assigning to each vertex i a color from its list Si is equivalent to the existence of colors ci ∈ Si such that fG(c1, c2, . . . , cn) ̸= 0. Since the degree of fG is ∑n i=1 di, it suﬃces to show that the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 x di i in fG is nonzero in order to deduce the existence of such colors ci from Theorem 1.2. This can be done by interpreting this coeﬃcient combinatorially. It is not too diﬃcult to see that the coeﬃcients of the monomials that appear in the standard representation of fG as a linear combination of monomials can be expressed in terms of the orien- tations of G as follows. Call an orientation D of G even if the number of its directed edges (i, j) with i > j is even, otherwise call it odd. For non-negative integers d1, d2, . . . , dn, let DE(d1, . . . , dn) and DO(d1, . . . , dn) denote, respectively, the sets of all even and odd orientations of G in which the outdegree of the vertex vi is di, for 1 ≤ i ≤ n. In this notation, one can check that fG(x1, . . . , xn) = ∑ d1,...,dn≥0 (|DE(d1, . . . , dn)| − |DO(d1, . . . , dn)|)Π n i=1x di i . Consider, now, the given orientation D which lies in DE(d1, . . . , dn) ∪ DO(d1, . . . , dn). For any orientation D2 ∈ DE(d1, . . . , dn) ∪ DO(d1, . . . , dn), let D ⊕ D2 denote the set of all oriented edges of D whose orientation in D2 is in the opposite direction. Since the outdegree of every vertex in D is equal to its outdegree in D2, it follows that D ⊕ D2 is an Eulerian subgraph of D. Moreover, D ⊕ D2 is even as an Eulerian subgraph if and only if D and D2 are both even or both odd. The mapping D2 −→ D ⊕ D2 is clearly a bijection between DE(d1, . . . , dn) ∪ DO(d1, . . . , dn) and the set of all Eulerian subgraphs of D. In case D is even, it maps even orientations to even (Eulerian) subgraphs, and odd orientations to odd subgraphs. Otherwise, it maps even orientations to odd subgraphs, and odd orientations to even subgraphs. In any case, \f \f \f \f|DE(d1, . . . , dn)| − |DO(d1, . . . , dn)| \f \f \f \f = |EE(D) − EO(D)|. 14 Therefore, the absolute value of the coeﬃcient of the monomial Πn i=1x di i in the standard representation of fG = fG(x1, . . . , xn) as a linear combination of monomials, is |EE(D) − EO(D)|. In particular, if EE(D) ̸= EO(D), then this coeﬃcient is not zero and the desired result follows from Theorem 1.2. 2 An interesting application of Theorem 7.2 has been obtained by Fleischner and Stiebitz in [28], solving a problem raised by Du, Hsu and Hwang in [22], as well as a strengthening of it suggested by Erd˝os. Theorem 7.3 ([28]) Let G be a graph on 3n vertices, whose set of edges is the disjoint union of a Hamilton cycle and n pairwise vertex-disjoint triangles. Then the choice number and the chromatic number of G are both 3. The proof is based on a subtle parity argument that shows that, if D is the digraph obtained from G by directing the Hamilton cycle as well as each of the triangles cyclically, then EE(D) − EO(D) ≡ 2(mod 4 ). The result thus follows from Theorem 7.2. Another application of Theorem 7.2 together with some additional combinatorial arguments is the following result, that solves an open problem from [27]. Theorem 7.4 ([13]) The choice number of every planar bipartite graph is at most 3. This is tight, since ch(K2,4) = 3. Recall that the list coloring conjecture (Conjecture 7.1) asserts that ch′(G) = χ′(G) for every graph G. In order to try to apply Theorem 7.2 for tackling this problem, it is useful to ﬁnd a more convenient expression for the diﬀerence EE(D) − EO(D), where D is the appropriate orientation of a given line graph. Such an expression is described in [2] for line graphs of d-regular graphs of chromatic index d. This expression is the sum, over all proper d-edge colorings of the graph, of an appropriately deﬁned sign of the coloring. See [2] for more details, and [35] for a related discussion. Combining this with a known result of [55] (which asserts that for planar cubic graphs of chromatic index 3 all proper 3-edge colorings have the same sign), and with the Four Color Theorem, the following result, observed by F. Jaeger and M. Tarsi, follows immediately: Corollary 7.5 For every 2-connected cubic planar graph G, ch′(G) = 3. Note that the above result is a strengthening of the Four Color Theorem, which is well known to be equivalent to the fact that the chromatic index of any such graph is 3. As shown in [24], it is possible to extend this proof to any d-regular planar multigraph with chromatic index d. 15 Another interesting application of the algebraic method described above appears in [33], where the authors apply it to show that the list coloring conjecture holds for complete graphs with an odd number of vertices, and to improve the error term in the asymptotic estimate of Kahn for the maximum possible list chromatic index of a simple graph with maximum degree d. Finally we mention that Galvin [30] proved recently that the list coloring conjecture holds for any bipartite multigraph, by an elementary, non-algebraic method. 8 The permanent lemma The following lemma is a slight extension of a lemma proved in [12]. As shown below, it is an immediate corollary of Theorem 1.2 and has several interesting applications. Lemma 8.1 (The permanent lemma) Let A = (aij) be an n by n matrix over a ﬁeld F , and suppose its permanent P er(A) is nonzero (over F ). Then for any vector b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn) ∈ F n and for any family of sets S1, S2, . . . , Sn of F , each of cardinality 2, there is a vector x ∈ S1 ×S2 ×. . .×Sn such that for every i the ith coordinate of Ax diﬀers from bi. Proof. The polynomial P (x1, x2, . . . , xn) = n∏ i=1[ n∑ j=1 aijxj − bj] is of degree n and the coeﬃcient of ∏n i=1 xi in it is P er(A) ̸= 0. The result thus follows from Theorem 1.2. 2 Note that in the special case Si = {0, 1} for every i the above lemma asserts that if the permanent of A is non-zero, then for any vector b, there is a subset of the column-vectors of A whose sum diﬀers from b in all coordinates. A conjecture of Jaeger asserts that for any ﬁeld with more than 3 elements and for any nonsingular n by n matrix A over the ﬁeld, there is a vector x so that both x and Ax have non-zero coordinates. Note that for the special case of ﬁelds of characteristic 2 this follows immediately from the Permanent Lemma. Simply take b to be the zero vector, let each Si be an arbitrary subset of size 2 of the ﬁeld that does not contain zero, and observe that in characteristic 2 the permanent and the determinant coincide, implying that P er(A) ̸= 0. With slightly more work relying on some simple properties of the permanent function, the conjecture is proved in [12] for every non-prime ﬁeld. It is still open for prime ﬁelds and, in particular, for p = 5. Let f (n, d) denote the minimum possible number f so that every set of f lattice points in the d- dimensional Euclidean space contains a subset of cardinality n whose centroid is also a lattice point. 16 The problem of determining or estimating f (n, d) was suggested by Harborth [34], and studied by various authors. It is convenient to reformulate the deﬁnition of f (n, d) in terms of sequences of elements of the abelian group Zd n. In these terms, f (n, d) is the minimum possible f so that every sequence of f members of Zd n contains a subsequence of size n the sum of whose elements (in the group) is 0. By an old result of Erd˝os, Ginzburg and Ziv [26], f (n, 1) = 2n − 1 for all n. The main part in the proof of this statement is its proof for prime values of n = p, as the general case can then be easily proved by induction. Proposition 8.2 ([26]) For any prime p, any sequence of 2p − 1 members of Zp contains a subse- quence of cardinality p the sum of whose members is 0 (in Zp). There are many proofs of this result. Here is one using the permanent lemma. Given 2p − 1 members of Zp, renumber them a1, a2, . . . , a2p−1 such that 0 ≤ a1 ≤ . . . ≤ a2p−1. If there is an i ≤ p − 1 such that ai = ai+p−1 then ai + ai+1 + . . . + ai+p−1 = 0, as needed. Otherwise, let A denote the p − 1 by p − 1 all 1 matrix, and deﬁne Si = {ai, ai+p−1} for all 1 ≤ i ≤ p − 1. Let b1, . . . , bp−1 be the set of all elements of Zp besides −a2p−1. Since P er(A) = (p − 1)! ̸= 0, by Lemma 8.1, there are si ∈ Si such that the sum ∑p−1 j=1 si diﬀers from each bj and is thus equal to −a2p−1. Hence, in Zp, a2p−1 + p−1∑ i=1 si = 0, completing the proof. 2 Kemnitz [39] conjectured that f (n, 2) = 4n − 3, observed that f (n, 2) ≥ 4n − 3 for all n and proved his conjecture for n = 2, 3, 5 and 7. As in the one dimensional case, it suﬃces to prove this conjecture for prime values p. In [5] it is shown that f (p, 2) ≤ 6p − 5 for every prime p. The details are somewhat complicated, but the main tool is again the Permanent Lemma mentioned above. An additive basis in a vector space Zn p is a collection C of (not necessarily distinct) vectors, so that for every vector u in Zn p there is a subset of C the sum of whose elements is u. Motivated by the study of universal ﬂows in graphs, Jaeger, Linial, Payan and Tarsi [36] conjectured that for every prime p there exists a constant c(p), such that any union of c(p) linear bases of Zn p contains an additive basis. This conjecture is still open, but in [9] it is shown that any union of ⌈(p − 1) loge n⌉ + p − 2 linear bases of Zn p contains such an additive basis. Here, too, the permanent lemma plays a crucial role in the proof. The main idea is to observe how it can be applied to give equalities rather than inequalities (extending the very simple application described in the proof of Proposition 8.2 above.) Here is the basic approach. For a vector v of length n over Zp, let v∗ denote the tensor product of v with the all one vector of length p − 1. Thus v∗ is a vector of length (p − 1)n obtained by 17 concatenating (p − 1) copies of v. In this notation, the following result follows from the permanent lemma. Lemma 8.3 Let S = (v1, v2, . . . , v(p−1)n) be a sequence of (p − 1)n vectors of length n over Zp, and let A be the (p − 1)n by (p − 1)n matrix whose columns are the vectors v∗ 1, v∗ 2, . . . , v∗ (p−1)n. If P er(A) ̸= 0 (over Zp), then the sequence S is an additive basis of Zn p . Proof. For any vector b = (b1, b2, . . . , bn), let ub be the concatenation of the (p − 1) vectors b + j, b + 2j, . . . , b + (p − 1)j, where j is the all one vector of length n. By the Permanent Lemma with all sets Si = {0, 1}, there is a subset I ⊂ {1, 2, . . . , (p − 1)n} such that the sum ∑ i∈I v∗ i diﬀers from ub in all coordinates. This supplies (p − 1) forbidden values for every coordinate of the sum ∑ i∈I vi, and hence implies that ∑ i∈I vi = b. Since b was arbitrary, this completes the proof. 2 In [9] it is shown that from any set consisting of all elements in the union of an appropriate number of linear bases of Zn p it is possible to choose (p − 1)n vectors satisfying the assumptions of the lemma. This is done by applying some properties of the permanent function. The details can be found in [9]. The following conjecture seems plausible, and would imply, if true, that the union of any set of p bases of Zn p is an additive basis. Conjecture 8.4 For any p nonsingular n by n matrices A1, A2, . . . , Ap over Zp, there is an n by pn matrix C such that the pn by pn matrix M ′ =              A1 A2 . . . Ap−1 Ap A1 A2 . . . Ap−1 Ap . . . . . . . . . . A1 A2 . . . Ap−1 Ap C              has a nonzero permanent over Zp. We close this section with a simple result about directed graphs. A one-regular subgraph of a digraph is a subgraph of it in which all outdegrees and all indegrees are precisely 1 (that is: a spanning subgraph which is a union of directed cycles.) Proposition 8.5 Let D = (V, E) be a digraph containing a one-regular subgraph. Then, for any assignment of a set Sv of two reals for each vertex v of V , there is a choice c(v) ∈ Sv for every v, so that for every vertex u the sum ∑ v: (u,v)∈E c(v) ̸= 0. Proof. Let A = (au,v) be the adjacency matrix of D deﬁned by au,v = 1 iﬀ (u, v) ∈ E and au,v = 0 otherwise. By the assumption, the permanent of A over the reals is strictly positive. The result thus follows from the permanent lemma. 2 18 9 Ideals of polynomials and combinatorial properties There are several known results that assert that a combinatorial structure satisﬁes a certain combi- natorial property if and only if an appropriate polynomial associated with it lies in a properly deﬁned ideal. Here are three known results of this type, all applying the graph polynomial deﬁned in Section 7. Theorem 9.1 (Li and Li, [40]) A graph G does not contain an independent set of k + 1 vertices if and only if the graph polynomial fG lies in the ideal generated by all graph polynomials of unions of k pairwise vertex disjoint complete graphs that span its set of vertices. Theorem 9.2 (Kleitman and Lov´asz, [41], [42]) A graph G is not k colorable if and only if the graph polynomial fG lies in the ideal generated by all graph polynomials of complete graphs on k + 1 vertices. Theorem 9.3 (Alon and Tarsi, [13]) A graph G on the n vertices {1, 2, . . . , n} is not k colorable if and only if the graph polynomial fG lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials xk i −1, (1 ≤ i ≤ n). Here is a quick proof of the last theorem, using Theorem 1.1. Proof of Theorem 9.3. If fG lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials xk i − 1 then it vanishes whenever each xi attains a value which is a kth root of unity. This means that in any coloring of the vertices of G by the kth roots of unity, there is a pair of adjacent vertices that get the same color, implying that G is not k-colorable. Conversely, suppose G is not k-colorable. Then fG vanishes whenever each of the polynomials gi(xi) = xk i −1 vanishes, and thus, by Theorem 1.1, fG lies in the ideal generated by these polynomials. 2 As described in Section 7, there are several interesting combinatorial consequences that can be derived from (some versions of) Theorem 9.3, but even without any consequences, such theorems are interesting in their own. One reason for this is that these theorems characterize coN P -complete properties, which, according to the common belief that the complexity classes N P and coN P diﬀer, cannot be checked by a polynomial time algorithm. Using Theorem 1.1 it is not diﬃcult to generate results of this type. We illustrate this with two examples, described below. Many other results can be formulated and proved in a similar manner. It would be nice to deduce any interesting combinatorial consequences of these results or their relatives. The bandwidth of a graph G = (V, E) on n vertices is the minimum integer k such that there is a bijection f : V 7→ {1, 2, . . . , n} satisfying |f (u) − f (v)| ≤ k for every edge uv ∈ E. This invariant has been studied extensively by various researchers. See, e.g., [19] for a survey. 19 Proposition 9.4 The bandwidth of a graph G = (V, E) on a set V = {1, 2, . . . , n} of n vertices is at least k + 1 if and only if the polynomial QG,k(x1, . . . , xn) = ∏ 1≤i<j≤n (xi − xj) ∏ ij∈E,i<j ∏ k<|l|<n(xi − xj − l) lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials {gi(xi) = n∏ j=1(xi − j), 1 ≤ i ≤ n}. Proof. If QG,k lies in the above mentioned ideal, then it vanishes whenever we substitute a value in {1, 2, . . . , n} for each xi. In particular, it vanishes when we substitute distinct values for these variables, implying that there is some edge ij ∈ E for which |xi − xj| > k, and hence the bandwidth of G exceeds k. Conversely, assume the bandwidth of G exceeds k. We claim that in this case QG,k(x1, . . . , xn) vanishes whenever each xi attains a value in {1, 2, . . . , n}. Indeed, if two of the variables attain the same value, the ﬁrst product ( ∏1≤i<j≤n(xi − xj)) in the deﬁnition of QG,k vanishes. Else, the numbers xi form a permutation of the members of {1, 2, . . . , n} and thus, by the assumption on the bandwidth, there is some edge ij ∈ E for which |xi − xj| > k, implying that the polynomial vanishes in this case as well. Therefore, QG,k vanishes whenever each xi lies in {1, 2, . . . , n} and thus, by Theorem 1.1, it lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials gi(xi), completing the proof. 2 A hypergraph H is a pair (V, E), where V is a ﬁnite set, whose elements are called vertices, and E is a collection of subsets of V , called edges. It is k-uniform if each edge contains precisely k vertices. Thus, a 2-uniform hypergraph is simply a graph. H is 2-colorable if there is a vertex coloring of H with two colors so that no edge is monochromatic. Proposition 9.5 The 3-uniform hypergraph H = (V, E) is not 2-colorable if and only if the polyno- mial ∏ e∈E[( ∑ v∈e xv) 2 − 9] lies in the ideal generated by the polynomials {x2 v − 1 : v ∈ V }. Proof. The proof is similar to the previous one. If the polynomial lies in that ideal, then it vanishes whenever each xv attains a value in {−1, 1}, implying that some edge is monochromatic in each vertex coloring by {−1, 1}, and hence implying that H is not 2-colorable. Conversely, if H is not 2-colorable, then in every vertex coloring by the numbers −1 and +1 some edge is monochromatic, implying that the polynomial vanishes in each such point, and thus showing, by Theorem 1.1, that it lies in the above ideal. 2 20 Note that since the properties characterized in any of the theorems in this section are coN P - complete, it is possible to use the usual reductions and obtain, for each coN P -complete problem, a characterization in terms of some ideals of polynomials. In most cases, however, the known reductions are somewhat complicated, and would thus lead to cumbersome polynomials which are not likely to imply any interesting consequences. The results mentioned here are in terms of relatively simple polynomials, and are therefore more likely to be useful. 10 Concluding remarks The discussion in Section 7 as well as that in Section 9 raises the hope that the polynomial approach might be helpful in the study of the Four Color Theorem. This certainly deserves more attention. Further results in the study of the List Coloring Conjecture (Conjecture 7.1) using the algebraic technique are also desirable. Most proofs presented in this paper are based on the two basic theorems, proved in Section 2, whose proofs are algebraic, and hence non-constructive in the sense that they supply no eﬃcient algorithm for solving the corresponding algorithmic problems. In the classiﬁcation of algorithmic problems according to their complexity, it is customary to try and identify the problems that can be solved eﬃciently, and those that probably cannot be solved eﬃciently. A class of problems that can be solved eﬃciently is the class P of all problems for which there are deterministic algorithms whose running time is polynomial in the length of the input. A class of problems that probably cannot be solved eﬃciently are all the N P -complete problems. An extensive list of such problems appears in [31]. It is well known that if any of them can be solved eﬃciently, then so can all of them, since this would imply that the two complexity classes P and N P are equal. Is it possible to modify the algebraic proofs given here so that they yield eﬃcient ways of solving the corresponding algorithmic problems? It seems likely that such algorithms do exists. This is related to questions regarding the complexity of search problems that have been studied by several researchers. See, e.g., [37]. In the study of complexity classes like P and N P one usually considers only decision problems, i.e., problems for which the only two possible answers are ”yes” or ”no.” However, the deﬁnitions extend easily to the so called ”search” problems, which are problems where a more elaborate output is sought. The search problems corresponding to the complexity classes P and N P are sometimes denoted by F P and F N P . Consider, for example, the obvious algorithmic problem suggested by Theorem 6.1 (for p = 3, 21 say). Given a simple graph with average degree that exceeds 4 and maximum degree 5, it contains, by this theorem, a 3-regular subgraph. Can we ﬁnd such a subgraph in polynomial time ? It seems plausible that ﬁnding such a subgraph should not be a very diﬃcult task. However, our proof provides no eﬃcient algorithm for accomplishing this task. The situation is similar with many other algorithmic problems corresponding to the various results presented here. Can we, given an input graph satisfying the assumptions of Theorem 7.3 and given a list of three colors for each of its vertices, ﬁnd, in polynomial time, a proper vertex coloring assigning each vertex a color from its class ? Similarly, can we color properly the edges of any given planar cubic 2-connected graph using given lists of three colors per edge, in polynomial time ? These problems remain open. Note, however, that any eﬃcient procedure that ﬁnds, for a given input polynomial that satisﬁes the assumptions of Theorem 1.2, a point (s1, s2, . . . , sn) satisfying its conclusion, would provide eﬃcient algorithms for most of these algorithmic problems. It would thus be interesting to ﬁnd such an eﬃcient procedure. See also [1] for a related discussion for other algorithmic problems. Another computational aspect suggested by the results in Section 9 is the complexity of the representation of polynomials in the form that shows they lie in certain ideals. Thus, for example, by Proposition 9.5, a 3-uniform hypergraph is not 2-colorable iﬀ the polynomial associated with it in that proposition is a linear combination with polynomial coeﬃcients of the polynomials x2 v − 1. Since the problem of deciding whether such a given input hypergraph is not 2-colorable is coN P -complete, the existence of a representation like this that can be checked in polynomial time would imply that the complexity classes N P and coN P coincide, and this is believed not to be the case by most researchers. In this paper we developed and discussed a technique in which polynomials are applied for deriving combinatorial consequences. There are several other known proof-techniques in Combinatorics which are based on properties of polynomials. The most common and successful one is based on a dimension argument. This is the method of proving an upper bound for the size of a collection of combinatorial structures satisfying certain prescribed properties by associating each structure with a polynomial in some space of polynomials, showing that these polynomials are linearly independent, and then deducing the required bound from the dimension of the corresponding space. There are many interesting results proved in this manner; see, e.g., [32], [14], [15] and [3] for surveys of results of this type. 22 References [1] N.
