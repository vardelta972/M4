Let B′ and C ′ denote respectively the reﬂection of B and C in the internal angle bisector of ∠A. Show that the triangles ABC and AB′C ′ have the same incentre. Solution: Join BB′ and CC ′. Let the internal angle bisector ℓ of ∠A meet BB′ in E and CC ′ in F . Since B′ is the reﬂection of B in ℓ, we observe that BB′ ⊥ ℓ and BE = EB′. Hence B′ lies on AC. Similarly, C ′ lies on the line AB. Let D be the point of intersection of BC and B′C ′. Observe that BB′ ∥ C ′C. Moreover the triangles ABC is congruent to AB′C ′: this follows from the observation that AB = AB′ and AC = AC ′ and the included angle ∠A is common. Hence BC ′ = B′C so that C ′CB′B is an isosceles trapezium. This means that the intesection point D of its diagonal lies on the perpendicular bisector of its parallel sides. Thus ℓ passes through D. We also observe that CD = C ′D. Let I be the incentre of △ABC. This means that CI bisects ∠C. Hence AI/ID = AC/CD. But AC = AC ′ and CD = C ′D. Hence we also get that AI/ID = AC ′/C ′D. This implies that C ′I bisects ∠AC ′B′. Therefore the two angle bisectors of △AC ′B′ meet at I. This shows that I is also the incentre of △AC ′B′. 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Suppose there are real numbers s ̸= t such that P (s) = t and P (t) = s. Prove that b − st is a root of the equation x2 + ax + b − st = 0. Solution: We have s 2 + as + b = t, t2 + at + b = s. This gives (s 2 − t2) + a(s − t) = (t − s). Since s ̸= t, we obtain s + t + a = −1. Adding the equations, we obtain s 2 + t2 + a(s + t) + 2b = (s + t). Therefore (s + t) 2 − 2st + a(s + t) + 2b = (s + t). Using s + t = −(1 + a), we obtain (1 + a) 2 − 2st − a(1 + a) + 2b = −1 − a. Simpliﬁcation gives st = 1+a+b = P (1). This shows that x = 1 is a root of x2+ax+b−st = 0. Since the product of roots is b − st, the other root is b − st. 3. Find all integers a, b, c such that a2 = bc + 1, b 2 = ca + 1. Solution: Suppose a = b. Then we get one equation: a 2 = ac + 1. This reduces to a(a − c) = 1. Therefore a = 1, a − c = 1; and a = −1, a − c = −1. Thus we get (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 0) and (−1, −1, 0). If a ̸= b, subtracting the second relation from the ﬁrst we get a 2 − b2 = c(b − a). This gives a + b = −c. Substituting this in the ﬁrst equation, we get a2 = b(−a − b) + 1. Thus a 2 + b 2 + ab = 1. Multiplication by 2 gives (a + b) 2 + a 2 + b2 = 2. Thus (a, b) = (1, −1), (−1, 1), (1, 0), (−1, 0), (0, 1), (0, −1). We get respectively c = 0, 0, −1, 1, −1, 1. Thus we get the triples: (a, b, c) = (1, 1, 0), (−1, −1, 0), (1, −1, 0), (−1, 1, 0), (1, 0, −1), (−1, 0, 1), (0, 1, −1), (0, −1, 1). 4. Suppose 32 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? Solution: One can choose 3 objects out of 32 objects in (32 3 ) ways. Among these choices all would be together in 32 cases; exactly two will be together in 32 × 28 cases. Thus three objects can be chosen such that no two adjacent in (32 3 ) − 32 − (32 × 28) ways. Among these, furthrer, two objects will be diametrically opposite in 16 ways and the third would be on either semicircle in a non adjacent portion in 32 − 6 = 26 ways. Thus required number is (32 3 ) − 32 − (32 × 28) − (16 × 26) = 3616. 5. Two circles Γ and Σ in the plane intersect at two distinct points A and B, and the centre of Σ lies on Γ. Let points C and D be on Γ and Σ, respectively, such that C, B and D are collinear. Let point E on Σ be such that DE is parallel to AC. Show that AE = AB. Solution: If O is the centre of Σ, then we have ∠AEB = 1 2 ∠AOB = 1 2 (180 ◦ − ∠ACB) = 1 2 ∠EDB = 1 2 (180◦ − ∠EAB) = 90 ◦ − 1 2 ∠EAB . But we know that ∠AEB + ∠EAB + ∠EBA = 180 ◦. Therefore ∠EBA = 180 ◦ − ∠AEB − ∠EAB = 180 ◦ − 90◦ + 1 2 ∠EAB − ∠EAB = 90 ◦ − 1 2 ∠EAB. This shows that ∠AEB = ∠EBA and hence AE = AB. 2 6. Find all real numbers a such that 4 < a < 5 and a(a − 3{a}) is an integer. (Here {a} denotes the fractional part of a. For example {1.5} = 0.5; {−3.4} = 0.6.) Solution: Let a = 4 + f , where 0 < f < 1. We are given that (4 + f )(4 − 2f ) is an integer. This implies that 2f 2 + 4f is an integer. Since 0 < f < 1, we have 0 < 2f 2 + 4f < 6. Therefore 2f 2 + 4f can take 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5. Equating 2f 2 + 4f to each one of them and using f > 0, we get f = −2 + √6 2 , −2 + √8 2 , −2 + √10 2 , −2 + √12 2 , −2 + √14 2 . Therefore a takes the values: a = 3 + √6 2 , 3 + √8 2 , 3 + √10 2 , 3 + √12 2 , 3 + √14 2 . ———-00———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
