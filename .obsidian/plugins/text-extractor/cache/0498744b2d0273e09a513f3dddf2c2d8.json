For example, 2 + 3x, x4 − 101x + 2, 4x2 − 2πx + √ 3 etc. The coeﬃcients can be anything, but the powers of x must be non-negative integers. Thus 5/x, x + √x are not polynomials. If you consider the expression 5xy + x2√y, then it will be a polynomial in x, but not a polynomial in y. Consider the polynomial a0+a1x+a2x2+· · ·+anxn. Note that a0, a1, . . . , an are constants (independent of the variable x), they are called coeﬃcients, and the condition an ̸= 0 imposed to ensure that there is no ambiguity about what is the largest power of x in the polynomial. The term an is called the leading coeﬃcient and n is called the degree of this polynomial. When n = 2, the polynomial a0 + a1x + a2x2 is called a quadratic polynomial. When n = 3, it is called a cubic polynomial. Here a0, a1, a2 are just a notation for the coeﬃcients, you can also denote them as ax2 + bx + c or px2 + qx + r whatever. We write b(x) = x2 + 3x + 4 to indicate that x2 + 3x + 4 is a polynomial, as a function of x. Now what does that mean? It means that, when you plug in any value of x, b(x) returns the value of the expression x2 + 3x + 4 for that particular value of x. For example, b(1) = 12 + 3 × 1 + 4 = 8, b(1/2) = (1/2) 2 + 3(1/2) + 4. Obviously, here b can be replaced by any letter, like f, g etc. Let us begin with the quadratic polynomial: p(x) = ax2 +bx+c where a ̸= 0. The roots of the quadratic equation ax2 +bx+c = 0 are called zeros of the polynomial p(x) = ax2 +bx+c and we know that they are given by the quadratic formula −b ± √ b2 − 4ac 2a . D = b2 −4ac is called the discriminant of the quadratic equation. It determines the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation, e.g. the roots are real and distinct when D > 0, real and equal if D = 0, and non-real complex numbers when D < 0. Let us call the roots as α and β. Say, α = −b+ √b2−4ac 2a and β = −b−√b2−4ac 2a . We observe that α + β = −b/a and αβ = c/a. (Check!) For example, the roots of x2 − 4x + 1 = 0 are 2 + √3 and 2 − √3. Note that the sum of the roots is 4 and the product of the roots is 1. Fact. If α, β are the roots of ax2 + bx + c = 0, then α + β = −b/a and αβ = c/a. Here I emphasize on the fact that a, b, c are just names of the coeﬃcients, you should keep in mind their roles (a is the leading coeﬃcient, b is the coeﬃcient of x and c is the constant term) while applying the above fact. This idea of relating sum and product of the roots to 1 the coeﬃcients is very important. Example 1. If a, b, c are all odd integers, show that the equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 cannot have any rational root. Solution: We will show that b2 − 4ac is not a perfect square. Recall that if n is any odd integer, then n2 must be of the form 8k + 1. Here a, b, c are odd. So b2 = 8l + 1 for some l. Also, let ac = 2y + 1. b2 − 4ac = 8l + 1 − 4(2y + 1) = 8 × something − 3. But if b2 − 4ac were a square, it must have the form 8k + 1. Therefore, D = b2 − 4ac is not a perfect square. Since D is an integer which is not a perfect square, we can conclude that √ D is not rational, implying that the roots −b ± √D 2a are not rational. Example 2. Suppose that a, b are integers and b ̸= −1. Show that if x2 + ax + b + 1 = 0 has an integer root then a2 + b2 must be composite. Solution: Let the roots be α and β. Then, α + β = −a and αβ = b + 1. Since sum of the roots is an integer, so if one of the roots is an integer then the other one must also be an integer. It is given that (at least) one of them is integer. Hence we may assume that both α and β are integers. Next, observe that a2 + b2 = (α + β) 2 + (αβ − 1)2 = α2 + β2 + α2β2 + 1 = (α2 + 1)(β2 + 1). We are asked to show that a2 + b2 is composite and we derived a factorization of it. Are we done? No, because we have to show that α2 + 1 and β2 + 1 are both greater than 1. Since α and β are integers, α2 + 1 and β2 + 1 are already ≥ 1. So the only way in which one of them can be equal to 1 is when α or β is 0. But αβ = b + 1 ̸= 0. Therefore, each of these factors is > 1 and we are through. Example 3. Suppose that k is a real number such that the equations x2 − 4x + k = 0 and x2 + kx − 4 = 0 have exactly one root in common. Find the value of k. Solution: Suppose that the common root is r. Since r satisﬁes both the equation, we have r2 − 4r + k = 0 and r2 + kr − 4 = 0. Subtract the 2nd equation from the 1st equation (to get rid of the term r2) and get −(4 + k)r + k + 4 = 0 =⇒ (k + 4)(r − 1) = 0. This implies that either k = −4 or r = 1. If k = −4 then the two equations are identical, which is not allowed. Therefore, we must have r = 1. Putting r = 1 in any of the two equations, we get k = 3. Example 4. Solve the equation 6x4 − 25x3 + 12x2 + 25x + 6 = 0. Solution: Observing the symmetry in the equation, it would be a good idea to divide the equation by x2. Since x = 0 does not satisfy the equation, we may divide by x2 without losing any root. Performing that, we get 6x2 − 25x + 12 + 25 x + 6 x2 = 0, or, 2 6 ( x2 + 1 x2 ) − 25 ( x − 1 x ) + 12 = 0. Note that x2 + 1 x2 = (x − 1 x)2 + 2. Hence the above equation is equivalent to 6 ( x − 1 x )2 + 12 − 25 (x − 1 x ) + 12 = 0. Now if we put t = (x − 1 x) then the last equation will be a quadratic equation in t, which you can solve (do it!). Indeed, it becomes 6t 2 − 25t + 24 = 0, which has the solutions t = 3 2, 8 3. Going back to x, we have two cases to solve: (i) x − 1 x = 3 2, and (ii) x − 1 x = 8 3. Solving these, we get x = 2, − 1 2, 3 and − 1 3. (Answer) Theorems on division and divisibility First we shall discuss the division algorithm for polynomials, then the remainder theorem and the factor theorem. Suppose I give you two polynomials, say a(x) = x − 3, and b(x) = 2x3 + 4x2 + 5x − 1. What do we mean when we say divide b(x) by a(x)? Suppose a, b are integers. When I say divide b by a, what do you do? You express b as aq + r where q and r are integers, such that 0 ≤ r < |a|. Similarly, for polynomials, when I say divide b(x) = 2x3 +4x2 +5x−1. by a(x) = x−3, I mean that express b(x) = a(x)q(x)+r(x) where q(x) and r(x) are polynomials and 0 ≤ deg r(x) < deg a(x). Following ﬁgure shows how to carry out this long division. Division algorithm for integers: Given any two integers a, b where a ̸= 0, there exist unique integers q and r such that b = aq + r where 0 ≤ r < |a|. Division algorithm for polynomials: Given any two polynomials a(x), b(x) where a(x) is not the zero polynomial, there exist unique polynomials q(x) and r(x) such that b(x) = a(x)q(x) + r(x) where 0 ≤ deg r(x) < deg a(x). Remarks. (i) In context of the above, we assume that degree of the zero polynomial can be taken as 0. (ii) If b(x) = a(x)q(x) + r(x) where r(x) is the remainder, then deg b(x) = deg a(x) + deg q(x). 3 What can you say about the remainder if a(x) is a linear polynomial (i.e. if deg a(x) = 1)? The above theorem forces that deg r(x) must be zero, implying that r(x) must be a constant polynomial. What will be the remainder if you divide a polynomial p(x) by x−a? The above discussion tells us that the remainder will be a constant, say r. So we can write p(x) = (x − a)q(x) + r for some polynomial q(x) and some constant r. Putting x = a, we get p(a) = 0 × q(a) + r, which gives r = p(a). Remainder Theorem. When we divide a polynomial p(x) by x − a, the remainder we get is p(a). Example: Find the remainder when the polynomial 2x3 + 4x2 + 5x − 1 is divided by x − 3. Answer: Using the above theorem, the remainder should be the value of p(x) = 2x3 + 4x2 + 5x − 1 at x = 3, i.e. p(3) = 2 × 3 3 + 4 × 3 2 + 5 × 3 − 1 = 104. Recall, we say that ‘x = a is a zero of the polynomial p(x)’ or ‘a root of the equation p(x) = 0’ if the value of the polynomial at x = a is zero, i.e. if p(a) = 0. For example, the zeros of the polynomial x2 − 4 are ±2. According to the remainder theorem, we can write any polynomial p(x) as p(x) = (x − a)q(x) + p(a). Therefore, if p(a) = 0 then (x − a) will be a factor of p(x), i.e. p(x) = (x − a)q(x) for some polynomial q(x). Factor Theorem. If p(a) = 0, then (x − a) will be a factor of p(x), i.e. p(x) = (x − a)q(x) will hold for some polynomial q(x). Next let us solve a few problems involving the concepts above. Example 5. If x = 2 is a root of the equation mx 3 − 12x2 + 10x − m = 0 then ﬁnd the other roots. Since x = 2 is a root, we can put x = 2 in this equation to get the value of m. (m × 2 3 − 12 × 2 2 + 10 × 2 − m = 0 =⇒ m = 4.) Therefore, our polynomial of interest is p(x) = 4x3 − 12x2 + 10x − 4. Applying the factor theorem, we know that x − 2 will be a factor of p(x), i.e. p(x) = (x − 2)q(x) for some polynomial q(x). We have to ﬁnd this q(x) using long division/vanishing method. Performing that, we get 4x3 − 12x2 + 10x − 4 = (x − 2)(4x2 − 4x + 2). Now the other roots of p(x) = 0 can be found from the equation 4x2−4x+2 = 0. Using the quadratic formula, x = −b±√b2−4ac 2a we ﬁnd that the other roots are (1 ± √ −1)/2 = (1 ± i)/2. Example 6. Suppose that f (x) is a polynomial that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by x − 1 and leaves a remainder of 4 when divided by x + 2. What is the remainder when f (x) is divided by (x − 1)(x + 2)? 4 In view of the remainder theorem, we can say that the remainder obtained when f (x) is divided x − 1 is f (1) and the remainder obtained when f (x) is divided by x + 2 is f (−2). Hence we must have f (1) = 1 and f (−2) = 4 (according to the question). Now we can assume that the remainder obtained when f (x) is divided by (x − 1)(x + 2) is ax + b for some constants a and b. Then, f (x) = (x − 1)(x + 2)q(x) + (ax + b), for every x. Putting x = 1 and x = −2, we get a pair of simultaneous equations for a and b, which we can solve! Details are provided below. Putting x = 1, we get f (1) = a × 1 + b, i.e. a + b = 1. Putting x = −2, we get f (−2) = a × (−2) + b, i.e. −2a + b = 4. Solving these two equations, viz. a + b = 1 and −2a + b = 4, we get a = −1, b = 2. Therefore, the required remainder, ax + b, is −x + 2. Wrong approach: We start with assuming that the remainder is r, so that f (x) = (x − 1)(x + 2)q(x) + r. Now putting x = 1 you get r = f (1) = 1 and if you put x = −2, you get r = f (−2) = 4. This is absurd! The fallacy here lies in the assumption that the remainder must be a constant, r. Moral: If we are dividing by a quadratic, we must start with the assumption that the remainder is of the form ax + b. Note that we are not ruling out the possibility that the remainder can be a constant – we are allowing a to be 0 here. Example 7. Suppose that p(x) is a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients such that p(a) = p(b) = p(c) = p(d) = 3. Where a, b, c, d are distinct integers. Show that it is not possible to have p(n) = 5, for any integer n. Consider the polynomial f (x) = p(x) − 3. Since a, b, c, d are zeros of this polynomial, we can say that (x − a), (x − b), (x − c), (x − d) are factors of this polynomial f (x). Since a, b, c, d are distinct, we can say that (x − a)(x − b)(x − c)(x − d) is a factor of f (x). So we can assume that f (x) = (x − a)(x − b)(x − c)(x − d)q(x) for some polynomial q(x). Let, if possible, p(n) = 5 for some integer n. Then, f (n) = 5 − 3 = 2. On the other hand, f (n) = (n − a)(n − b)(n − c)(n − d)q(n). Combining these, we get (n − a)(n − b)(n − c)(n − d)q(n) = 2. Does this give any contradiction? If we can show that q(n) is an integer, then we get a contradiction, because 2 can be written as the product of at most 3 distinct integers, while there are at least 4 distinct integers in the LHS above (since a, b, c, d are distinct). Now we shall argue why q(x) must be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Recall that q(x) is the quotient when f (x) is divided by its factor (x − a)(x − b)(x − c)(x − d). Since the leading coeﬃcient of this divisor polynomial is 1 and since f (x) = p(x) − 3 has integer coeﬃcients, so it follows from our algorithm of long division that the quotient must have integer coeﬃcients. (Moral: If we divide an integer polynomial b(x) by another integer polynomial a(x) whose leading coeﬃcient is 1, then the quotient ought to be a polynomial with integer coeﬃcients. Polynomials with leading coeﬃcient 1 are called monic polynomials.) 5 Some problems 1. Suppose that the roots of x2 + αx − a = 0 are β, γ, and the roots of x2 + βx − b = 0 are γ, α. If 2(a + b + c) = α2 + β2 + γ2, then show that the roots of x2 + γx − c = 0 are α, β. Solution: Since β, γ are the roots of x2 + αx − a = 0, we have β + γ = −α and βγ = −a. And since γ, α are the roots of x2 + βx − b = 0, we have γ + α = −β and γα = −b. Note that it suﬃces to show that α + β = −γ and αβ = −c. The ﬁrst one is obvious, because we got α + β + γ = 0 above. Now let us show the latter one, i.e., αβ = −c. We have α + β + γ = 0. Squaring it and using the given condition that 2(a + b + c) = α2 + β2 + γ2, we get 2(a + b + c) + 2(αβ + βγ + γα) = 0. Now using βγ = −a and γα = −b, we obtain that αβ = −c, which ﬁnishes the solution. 2. Let f (x) = x3 − 3x + b and g(x) = x2 + bx − 3. Find all possible values of the real number b such that the equations f (x) = 0 and g(x) = 0 have a common root. Solution: Let r be the common root. Then, r3 − 3r + b = 0 and r2 + br − 3 = 0. We multiply the second equation by r and subtract it from the ﬁrst equation and obtain (r3 − 3r + b) − r(r2 + br − 3) = 0 or, b(1 − r2) = 0. Therefore, either b = 0, or r = ±1. Note that, when b = 0, the two equations have two common roots, viz., ±√3. And in the other case, we have r = ±1. Putting these values into any of the two equations, we get required values for b, which are 2 and −2. Ans: b = 0, 2, −2. 3. In an attempt to discover a formula for the Fibonacci numbers, Alex ﬁnds a cubic poly- nomial h(x) such that h(1) = 1, h(2) = 1, h(3) = 2 and h(4) = 3. What is the value of h(5)? Fibonacci numbers: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, · · · (any term = sum of last two terms). Solution: Note that, for x = 2, 3, 4, h(x) takes the same value as x − 1. So, if we consider the polynomial h(x) − (x − 1), we can say that x = 2, 3, 4 are the zeros of this polynomial. Since h(x) is a cubic polynomial, so is h(x) − (x − 1). Therefore, 2, 3, 4 are the only zeros of the polynomial h(x) − (x − 1). Hence we can say that h(x) − (x − 1) = k(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4) for some constant k. Putting x = 1, we get k = −1/6. Thus, our polynomial h is given by h(x) = (x − 1) − 1 6(x − 2)(x − 3)(x − 4). Finally, h(5) = 3. 6 Vieta’s Formulae Earlier we saw how to relate the sum and product of the two zeros of a quadratic polynomial with its coeﬃcients. Next we shall see the same for cubic equations. Suppose that r, s, t are the zeros of the cubic polynomial ax3 + bx2 + cx + d. In light of the factor theorem, we can say that this polynomial must be same as a(x − r)(x − s)(x − t). Note, this last polynomial can be expanded as a(x3 − (r + s + t)x2 + (rs + st + tr)x − rst). Since this polynomial must be identical to the polynomial ax3 +bx2 +cx+d, we can compare the coeﬃcients in each of these polynomials to conclude that r + s + t = −b/a, rs + st + tr = c/a, and rst = −d/a. Similar calculation holds for polynomials of higher degree as well. If α, β, γ, δ are the roots of the equation ax4 + bx3 + cx2 + dx + e = 0 then you can show that α + β + γ + δ = − b a , αβγ + βγδ + γδα + δαβ = − d a, αβ + αγ + · · · + γδ = c a , αβγδ = e a. These formulae, that connects the sum of roots, product of roots, sum of the roots taken two at a time etc. with the coeﬃcients, are known as Vieta’s formulae. Next we’ll see the general form of such formulae, for an n-th degree polynomial. Fundamental theorem of Algebra Any polynomial p(x) with real (or even with complex) coeﬃcients of degree n has exactly n many complex roots (counted with multiplicities) and can be expressed as p(x) = c(x − r1)(x − r2) · · · (x − rn). Writing p(x) = ∑n k=0 akxk and comparing the coeﬃcients, we get the general form of Vieta’s formulae, for an n-th degree polynomial, which is given below. General form of Vieta’s formulae The sum of the roots taken k at a time is given by (−1) k · coeﬃcient of xn−k leading coeﬃcient , where n is the degree of the polynomial. Try the following problems now. 4. Suppose that 1, 2, 3 are the roots of x4 + ax2 + bx + c = 0. Find the value c. Solution: Since the coeﬃcient of x3 is 0, Vieta’s theorem tells us that the sum of the roots is 0. Since the sum of the given three roots is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, the 4-th root must be −6. Using Vieta’s theorem once again, we can say that the product of the roots is (−1) 4 c 1 = c. Hence c = 1 × 2 × 3 × (−6) = −36 . 7 5. Find the sum of the reciprocals of the roots of the equation 2x4 − 3x3 + 2x2 − 4x + 6 = 0. Solution: Let α, β, γ, δ be the roots. Note that 1 α + 1 β + 1 γ + 1 δ = αβγ + βγδ + γδα + δαβ αβγδ . By Vieta’s theorem, the numerator equals (−1) 3 coeﬀ. of x leading coeﬀ. = − (−4) 2 = 2, and the denom- inator equals (−1) 4 constant coeﬃcent leading coeﬃcient = 6 2 = 3. So, the required sum equals 2/3. 6. Let p, q, r be the roots of the polynomial 5x3 − 11x2 + 7x + 35. Evaluate p3 + q3 + r3. Solution: By Vieta’s theorem, p + q + r = 11 5 , pq + qr + rp = − 7 5, pqr = − 35 5 = −7. Now, (p + q + r) 3 = p3 + q3 + r3 + 3(pq + qr + rp)(p + q + r) − 3pqr. Using this identity, we can ﬁnd the value of p3 + q3 + r3. 7. Suppose that the polynomial f (x) = x3 − 3x2 − ax + 15 has three roots, two of which sum to 8. What is the value of a? Solution: Let those two roots be r and 8 − r. Since sum of the roots is 3, the third root must be 3 − 8 = −5. Next, the product of the roots must be −15, which gives r(8 − r)(−5) = (−15) =⇒ r(8 − r) = 3. Again, by Vieta’s theorem, we have (−5)r + (−5)(8 − r) + r(8 − r) = −a =⇒ a = 5 × 8 − r(8 − r) = 5 × 8 − 3 =⇒ a = 37 . 8. Show that for all real numbers x, y, z satisfying x + y + z = 0 and xy + yz + zx = −3, the value of the expression x3y + y3z + z3x is a constant. Explanation: The value of the three variables x, y, z cannot be uniquely determined from two given conditions. You need to show that for any possible choice of x, y, z (satisfying the two given conditions), the value of x3y + y3z + z3x will remain a constant. Solution: Let us consider a cubic polynomial, whose roots are x, y, z. Such a polynomial is (t − x)(t − y)(t − z). By Vieta’s theorem/direct factorization, this polynomial equals t 3 − (x + y + z)t 2 + (xy + yz + zx)t − xyz = t 3 − 3t − xyz. Since x, y, z are zeros of this polynomial, we can say that x3 − 3x − xyz = 0 =⇒ x3y = 3xy + xyz · y y3 − 3y − xyz = 0 =⇒ y3z = 3yz + xyz · z z3 − 3z − xyz = 0 =⇒ z3x = 3zx + xyz · x Adding up those three equations, we get x3y + yz + z3x = 3(xy + yz + zx) = −9, which is a constant. 8","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
