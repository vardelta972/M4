The Real Numbers Readers are assumed to be familiar with the real numbers: 2, 47, –3, 1 3 , 2 , 3 5 , π, e, … Just like there are many ways to classify people (according to gender, age, personality, nationality, etc.), there are many ways to classify real numbers. In this set of notes we will study various subsets of the real numbers . One of the most important subsets of is the set of natural numbers {1, 2, 3, …}, which is usually denoted by .The study of the natural numbers, or more generally the integers , forms a whole branch of mathematics known as number theory. In studying subsets of we are often interested in ‘how large’ the set is. Intuitively we feel that is ‘small’ relative to . Although both sets are infinite, we see that there are ‘many more’ real numbers than natural numbers. We shall use the ‘size’ of as a standard to compare the relative sizes of infinite subsets of . In the light of this, we make the following definition. Definition 1.1. (Countable Set) An infinite set S is said to be countable if there exists a bijective function . Otherwise it :fS → is said to be uncountable. In the light of the above definition, a countable set has the ‘same size’ as . (Some people prefer to define also all finite sets to be countable, and call infinite countable sets countably infinite.) Example 1.1. Is countable? Solution. The answer is yes. Indeed, We can define a bijective mapping from to as follows: Page 1 of 12 Mathematical Database Page 2 of 12 01 1 2 2 3 3 1 234 5 6 7 − −− ↓ ↓ ↓ ↓↓↓ ↓ The term ‘countable’ is so called because if a set S is countable, then there is a bijective mapping from S to . Consequently, just like we can ‘enumerate’ the elements of , we can enumerate the elements of S. This was illustrated in the previous example. Although there are ‘more’ integers than natural numbers (in the sense that all natural numbers are integers but not all integers are natural numbers), they are still of the ‘same size’ (in the sense that both and are countable). However, it can be shown is uncountable. Furthermore, it can be shown that every infinite set has a countable subset. Hence uncountable sets are ‘larger’ than countable sets. In studying subsets of , we are often interested to know whether they are countable. The set of real numbers is more than just a set. We have the familiar addition and multiplication on . These two operations are closed. That is, whenever m and n are real numbers, and are also real numbers. This is also one of the properties we are interested in when studying subsets of . m n+ m n⋅ 2. The Rational Numbers We said that is closed under addition and multiplication. Moreover, every element x ∈ has an additive inverse –x, and every non-zero real number has a multiplicative inverse 1x− . Thus is also closed under subtraction and division (division by zero is, by convention, not allowed). These, together with many nice properties (existence of additive identity 0 and multiplicative identity 1, commutativity and associativity of addition and multiplication, the distributive laws of multiplication over addition, etc), constitute an algebraic structure which we shall call a field. does not have an additive identity. More precisely, there does not exist an element ‘0’ in for which for all . Even if we include the element 0 and consider the set , elements in the set have no additive inverse. So, although the set is closed under addition, it is not closed under subtraction. So we may instead consider the set of integers. Then is closed under addition, subtraction and multiplication. Yet multiplicative inverses do not exist (for 00n n+= + =n n ∈ {0}∪ Mathematical Database Page 3 of 12 1instance you cannot find an integer k for which 2k = , so the element ‘2’ has no multiplicative inverse in ). These together with the many nice properties mentioned before make into an algebraic structure which we shall call a ring. To make into a field, we need to include the multiplicative inverses of its elements. In order that division be closed, we need to include all quotients of integers. This constitute the rational numbers, and the set of all rational numbers is usually denoted by . Definition 2.1. (Rational Number) A real number x is said to be rational if it can be written in the form m x n = where m, n are integers with . Otherwise it is said to be irrational. 0n ≠ In the light of the above definition, it is easy to see that is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The details are left as an exercise. By definitions, all ‘fractions’ are rational numbers, and all integers are rational numbers. But if a number is not written in such form, how can we determine whether it is rational? Clearly, all terminating decimals are rational, for we can write a terminating decimal as a fraction with denominator being a power of 10. For instance, 1234 1.234 1000 = . How about non-terminating decimals? Some non-terminating decimals are recurring, where the digits repeat at certain periods. For instance, 0.3333 0.3= … . We are familiar with this number and we know that it is equal to 1 3 . Indeed, when a ‘fraction’ is written as a decimal, it is either terminating or recurring. We leave the details as an exercise. Conversely, is every recurring decimal a rational number? The answer is affirmative. Indeed, we have the following theorem which helps us easily convert a recurring decimal into a fraction. Mathematical Database Page 4 of 12 Theorem 2.1. Every recurring decimal is rational. Indeed, if 12 1 20. khx aa a b b b= (i.e. 12 kaa a is the non-recurring part and 12 hbb b is the recurring part), then we have 12 1 2 1 2 digits digits 99 99 00 00 kh hk aa a b b b aa a x − = k Proof. Let 1 2 12 12 120. 0.h h h hy b b b bb b b b b bb b== . Then 12 12 1 2 1 210 . h h hhhy b bb b b b b bb b b b= . Upon subtraction, we have 12(10 1) h hyb b b−= so that 12 10 1 h h bb b y = − Consequently, 12 1 2 12 1 2 digits 12 12 1 2 12 1 2 12 12 1 2 12 digits digits 0. 0. 0.00 00 10 10 (10 1) 10 (10 1) 10 (10 1) 99 99 00 00 kh kh k k kk h kh kh kh k kh kh k hk xa a a b b b aa a b b b aa a y aa a b b b aa a b b b aa a aa a b b b aa a = =+ =+ −× + = − − = − − = Q.E.D. Example 2.1. Convert the following recurring decimals into fractions. Mathematical Database Page 5 of 12 (a) 0.1221 (b) 0.123456 Solution. (a) 1221 37 0.1221 9999 303 == (b) 123456 12 3429 0.123456 999900 27775 − == It can be shown that all decimals which are neither terminating nor recurring (e.g. 0.12345678910111213…) are irrational. Thus we have established a simple way to classify all decimals as either rational or irrational. But there are numbers which are neither fractions nor decimals. But we may still be able to determine whether they are rational, as illustrated by the examples below. Example 2.2 Determine whether the following numbers are rational. (a) 2 (b) 3log 5 Solution. (a) Suppose 2 is rational and write 2 m n = where m, n are positive integers with 0n ≠ . Cancelling common factors if necessary, we may assume that m and n are relatively prime. Squaring both sides and transposing terms, we get 222nm= . Hence is even, so m is even. Consequently is divisible by 4. This forces to be even, and hence n must also be even. This contradicts the assumption that m and n are relatively prime. It follows that 2m 2m 2n 2 must be irrational. (b) Suppose is rational and write 3log 5 3log 5 m n = where m, n are positive integers with 0n ≠ . This implies 35 m n = . Mathematical Database Page 6 of 12 Raising both sides to the power n, we get 35 mn= which is clearly impossible as the left hand side is divisible by 3 but the right hand side is not. So must be irrational. 3log 5 We leave it as an exercise to show that when n and k are positive integers, k n is either an integer or irrational. It is known that the numbers π and e are both irrational. We include in the exercises proofs of the fact that π and e are irrational. As mentioned before, when studying subsets of we are interested in knowing its ‘relative size’. Indeed, although is an ‘extension’ of , they have the ‘same size’. This is given in the theorem below. Theorem 2.2. is countable. Proof. To prove the theorem we need only find a bijective mapping from to . Equivalently, we need to think about how to ‘arrange the elements of in a row’. Note also that every rational number of the form m n can be identified with the point (m, n) on the plane, so we are essentially trying to enumerate the lattice points on the plane. The idea is based on the diagram below. We leave it to the reader to complete the details of the proof. Q.E.D. Mathematical Database Page 7 of 12 Despite the fact that is countable, hence ‘much smaller’ than , it is dense in . This is given more precisely below. Theorem 2.3. is dense in . That is, between any two real numbers a and b, with a , there is a rational b< number p such that . ap b< < Proof. Set and choose a natural number N, large enough so that db a=− 1 N d< . Then ()Nb Na N b a Nd−= − = >1, so there is an integer M between Na and Nb, i.e. Na M Nb< < . Thus M ab N < < and hence M N is the desired rational number. Q.E.D. 3. The Irrational Numbers We have seen some examples of irrational numbers: 2 , , π, e, etc. In this section, we will study some properties of irrational numbers. 3log 5 Since is countable but is not, the set of irrational numbers, being , must be uncountable (why?). Hence the set of irrational numbers is ‘larger’ than the set of rational numbers. \\ Like , the set of irrational numbers is dense in . More precisely, if a and b are two real numbers, a , there is an irrational number q such that aq b< b< < . The proof is similar to that of Theorem 2.3, and we leave it to the reader. While is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division, the set of irrational numbers is not closed under any of these operations. For instance, 2 is irrational, but 22 0=− is rational. So the set of irrational numbers is not closed under subtraction. The reader should provide a counterexample for the other operations. Mathematical Database Page 8 of 12 How about taking powers? If p and q are irrational, is it true that qp must also be irrational? The answer is no, and there is a nice way of showing this. Consider the number 2 2 . Is it rational? Well, if it is, then we are done because we have provided an example where p and q are irrational but qp is rational. If it is not, then we consider the number 2 2 2⎛ ⎞ ⎜ ⎟ ⎝⎠ . Now both 2 2 and 2 are irrational, yet () 2 22 2 2⎛⎞ 2= =⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ is rational! Therefore, no matter whether 2 2 is rational or not, we can provide a counterexample to show that qp may not be irrational even if both p and q are irrational. 4. The Algebraic Numbers We have seen numerous examples of irrational numbers: 2 , 3 5 , 5 7 + 2 e, π, etc. Of these, you may feel that 2 , 3 5 and 5 7 2+ are ‘nicer’. At least we are able to express them in terms of surds (or ‘radicals’). Because of this, we know that by ‘certain operations’ we can make them into a rational number. For instance, if we write 5 7 2x =+ , then we have 5 5 5 52 10 5 72 72 72 (7) 2 14 47 0 x x x x xx =+ =+ −= −= −+ = In other words, x is a zero of the polynomial 10 514 47xx− + . This leads us to the following definition. Definition 4.1. (Algebraic number) A real number is said to be an algebraic number if it is a zero of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Remark. The concept of algebraic numbers can be defined not only for the real numbers but also the complex numbers. For instance, the complex number i is algebraic since it is a zero of the polynomial . 2 1x + Mathematical Database Page 9 of 12 The set of all algebraic numbers is often denoted by A . While we use the concept of ‘radicals’ to motivate the definition of an algebraic number, it should be noted that not all algebraic numbers can be expressed by a finite sequence of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and taking radicals starting from rational numbers. (Incidentally, real numbers which can be such expressed are said to be arithmetic numbers and the set of all arithmetic numbers is often denoted by B .) This result can be explained by theories in abstract algebra, and this in some sense explains why there can be no general formula for equations of degree 5 or higher. It can be shown that the set of algebraic numbers is closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. In other words, A forms a field under the usual addition and multiplication. It can be shown that A is countable. Since is uncountable, this implies that there are real numbers which are not algebraic, and these are known as transcendental numbers, which are our focus in the next section. 5. The Transcendental Numbers In the previous section we remarked that irrational numbers like 2 , 3 5 , 5 7 2+ are ‘nicer’ than irrational numbers like e and π, and we characterized certain numbers to be algebraic. We also remarked that the countability of A implies the existence of numbers which are not algebraic, and which we call transcendental. In fact, the numbers e and π were shown to be transcendental. The earliest proofs were due to Hermite in 1873 and Lindemann in 1882 respectively. Before that, Liouville established in 1851 established conditions for a number to be algebraic, with which he proved that the number 1! 2! 3!10 10 10 −− −+ ++ is transcendental. In general, it is not easy to determine whether a given number is transcendental. Despite that we know e and π are transcendental, whether e π+ is transcendental still remains an open problem.
