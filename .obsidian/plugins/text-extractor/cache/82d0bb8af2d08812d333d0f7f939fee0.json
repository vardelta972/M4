Prove that 4p \u0000 3 is a perfect square. 2. For any n real numbers a 1 ,a 2 ,. .., a n prove that n X i=1 n X j=1 a i a j i + j \u0000 0. 3. Let f :[0, 1) ! R be a function such that lim t!0 + f (t)=0, and for any x, y \u0000 0 and 0  \u0000  1,f satisﬁes f (\u0000x +(1 \u0000 \u0000)y)  \u0000f (x)+(1 \u0000 \u0000)f (y). Show that the function g(x)= f (x)/x is increasing (0, 1). 4. 1700 students participated in a true-false test. Knowing that 15 questions were given the test, that none of the students has answered two consecutive questions correctly, and that all of them have answered all the questions, do there exist two identical answer-sheets? 5. Point D lies inside 4ABC such that \\DAC = \\DCA =30 \u0000 and \\DBA =60 \u0000 . Point E is the midpoint of segment BC. Point F lies on segment AC with AF = 2FC. Prove that DE ? EF. 6. Let a 0 ,a 1 ,a 2 ,. .. be an increasing sequence of nonnegative integers such that ev- ery nonnegative integer can be expressed uniquely in the form a i +2a j +4a k , where i, j and k are not necessarily distinct.
