Let B′ denote the reﬂection of B in the internal angle bisector ℓ of ∠A. Show that the circumcentre of the triangle CB′I lies on the line ℓ, where I is the incentre of ABC. Solution: Let the line ℓ meet the circumcircle of ABC in E. Then E is the midpoint of the minor arc BC. Hence EB = EC. Note that ∠EBC = ∠EAC = A/2 and ∠IBC = B/2. Hence ∠BIE = ∠ABI + ∠BAI = B/2 + A/2. We also have ∠IBE = ∠IBC + ∠CBE = B/2 + A/2. Therefore ∠BIE = ∠IBE, so that EB = EI. Since AE is the perpendicular bisector of BB′, we also have EB = EB′. Thus we get EB′ = EC = EI. This implies that E is the circumcentre of △CB′I 2. Let P (x) = x2 + ax + b be a quadratic polynomial where a is real and b ̸= 2 is rational. Suppose P (0) 2, P (1) 2, P (2) 2 are integers. Prove that a and b are integers. Solution: We have P (0) = b. Since b is rational and b2 = P (0) 2 is an integer, we conclude that b is an integer. Observe that P (1) 2 = (1 + a + b) 2 = a 2 + 2a(1 + b) + (1 + b)2 ∈ Z P (2) 2 = (4 + 2a + b)2 = 4a 2 + 4a(4 + b) + (4 + b) 2 ∈ Z Eliminating a 2, we see that 4a(b − 2) + 4(1 + b) 2 − (4 + b) 2 ∈ Z. Since b ̸= 2, it follows that a is rational. Hence the equation x2 + 2x(1 + b) + (1 + b) 2 − (a 2 + 2a(1 + b) + (1 + b)2) = 0 is a quadratic equation with integer coeﬃcients and has rational solution a. It follows that a is an integer. 3. Find all integers a, b, c such that a2 = bc + 4, b 2 = ca + 4. Solution: Suppose a = b. Then we get one equation: a 2 = ac + 4. This reduces to a(a − c) = 4. Therefore a = 1, a − c = 4; a = −1, a − c = −4; a = 4, a − c = 1; a = −4, a − c = −1; a = 2, a − c = 2; a = −2, a − c = −2. Thus we get (a, b, c) = (1, 1, −3), (−1, −1, 3), (4, 4, 3), (−4, −4, −3); (2, 2, 0), (−2, −2, 0). If a ̸= b, subtracting the second relation from the ﬁrst we get a 2 − b2 = c(b − a). This gives a + b = −c. Substituting this in the ﬁrst equation, we get a2 = b(−a − b) + 4. Thus a 2 + b 2 + ab = 4. Multiplication by 2 gives (a + b) 2 + a 2 + b2 = 8. Thus (a, b) = (2, −2), (−2, 2), (2, 0), (−2, 0), (0, 2), (0, −2). We get respectively c = 0, 0, −2, 2, −2, 2. Thus we get the triples: (a, b, c) = (1, 1, −3), (−1, −1, 3), (4, 4, 3), (−4, −4, −3), (2, 2, 0), (−2, −2, 0), (2, −2, 0), (−2, 2, 0), (2, 0, −2), (−2, 0, 2), (0, 2, −2), (0, −2, 2). 4. Suppose 40 objects are placed along a circle at equal distances. In how many ways can 3 objects be chosen from among them so that no two of the three chosen objects are adjacent nor diametrically opposite? Solution: One can choose 3 objects out of 40 objects in (40 3 ) ways. Among theese choices all would be together in 40 cases; exactly two will be together in 40 × 36 cases. Thus three objects can be chosen such that no two adjacent in (40 3 ) − 40 − (40 × 36) ways. Among these, furthrer, two objects will be diametrically opposite in 20 ways and the third would be on either semicircle in a non adjacent portion in 40 − 6 = 34 ways. Thus required number is ( 40 3 ) − 40 − (40 × 36) − (20 × 34) = 7720. 5. Two circles Γ and Σ intersect at two distinct points A and B. A line through B intersects Γ and Σ again at C and D, respectively. Suppose that CA = CD. Show that the centre of Σ lies on Γ. Solution: Let the perpendicular from C to AD intersect Γ at O. Since CA = CD we have that CO is the perpendicular bisector of AD and also the angular bisector of ∠ACD. From the for- mer, it follows that OA = OD, and from the latter it follows that ∠OCB = ∠OCA and hence OA = OB. Thus we get OA = OB = OD. This means O is the circumcentre of triangle ADB. This shows that O is the centre of Σ. 6. How many integers m satisfy both the following properties: (i) 1 ≤ m ≤ 5000; (ii) [√m ] = [√m + 125] ? (Here [x] denotes the largest integer not exceeding x, for any real number x.) Solution: Let [√m ] = [√m + 125] = k. Then we know that k2 ≤ m < m + 125 < (k + 1)2. Thus m + 125 < k2 + 2k + 1 ≤ m + 2k + 1. This shows that 2k + 1 > 125 or k > 62. Using k2 ≤ 5000, we get k ≤ 70. Thus k ∈ {63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70}. We observe that 632 = 3969 and 642 = 63 2 + 127. Hence [√ 632 + 125] = [√632 + 1 + 125 ] = 63, 2 but [√632 + 2 + 125 ] = 64. Thus we get two values of m such that [√m ] = [√m + 125] for k = 63. Similarly, 65 2 = 64 2 + 129 so that [√ 642 + 125] = [√ 642 + 1 + 125 ] = [√642 + 2 + 125 ] = [√642 + 3 + 125 ] = 64, but [√642 + 4 + 125 ] = 65. Thus we get four values of m such that [√m] = [√m + 125] for k = 64. Continuing, we see that there are 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16 values of m respectively for k = 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70. Together we get 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 = 2 × 8 × 9 2 = 72 values of m satisfying the given requirement. ———-0000———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
