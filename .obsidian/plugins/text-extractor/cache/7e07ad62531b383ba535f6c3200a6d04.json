Not all metric spaces are complete, but it is a fact that all metric spaces can be “completed”, in a way that preserves the essential structure of the metric space. If the space in question is a normed linear space this process completes the space to a Banach space, and an inner product space is completed to a Hilbert space. The Space of Cauchy Sequences Consider a metric space M with metric d, and suppose that M is not complete. Let S denote the set of all Cauchy sequences in M . We’re going to turn S into a metric space in its own right, one that naturally contains a copy of M . Let X = {xn} and Y = {yn} be elements of S (whether the sequences in question have limits in M is irrelevant). We will say that the sequences X and Y are “equivalent” if lim n!1 d(xn, yn) = 0. (1) For example, if M denotes the rational numbers with the usual metric d(x, y) = |x − y|, let X = {2/1, 3/2, 4/3, 5/4, . . .}, Y = {3/1, 4/2, 5/3, 6/4, . . .}. Both sequences are Cauchy, and moreover since xn = 1 + 1/n and yn = 1 + 2/n, the nth terms diﬀer in magnitude by 1/n and so d(xn, yn) → 0 and the sequences are equivalent. That both sequences have limits in M is irrelevant. It’s easy to check that the notion of equivalence deﬁned by equation (1) is in fact an equivalence relation, that is, any element X of S is equivalent to itself (the reﬂexive property), X equivalent to Y implies Y is equivalent to X (symmetric) and X equivalent to Y and Y equivalent to Z implies X equivalent to Z (transitivity). 1 An \\Almost\" Metric Deﬁne a function ∆ from S × S to lR as ∆(X, Y ) = lim n!1 d(xn, yn). (2) The function ∆ is supposed to be a “ﬁrst-stab” at a metric on S, but there are a couple of issues. First, does the limit on the right in equation (2) exist? Second, will ∆ really be a metric? To answer the ﬁrst question, note that by the triangle inequality we have d(xn, yn) ≤ d(xn, xm) + d(xm, ym) + d(ym, yn). (3) From equation (3) we have d(xn, yn) − d(xm, ym) ≤ d(xn, xm) + d(ym, yn), and reversing the roles of m and n (and using symmetry of the metric) we ﬁnd that |d(xn, yn) − d(xm, ym)| ≤ d(xn, xm) + d(ym, yn). (4) Since both sequences are Cauchy, for any ϵ > 0 we can choose NX so that d(xn, xm) < ϵ/2 for m, n ≥ Nx, and also NY so that d(yn, ym) < ϵ/2 for m, n ≥ Ny. Let N = max(NX, NY ). From equation (4) we have then have |d(xn, yn) − d(xm, ym)| < ϵ for all m, n ≥ N , i.e., {d(xn, yn)} is a Cauchy sequence in lR, and hence the limit in equation (2) converges, since lR is complete. Ok, so ∆ is well deﬁned on S × S—but is it a metric? It certainly satisﬁes ∆ ≥ 0 and ∆(X, Y ) = ∆(Y, X). The triangle inequality follows from the triangle inequality for d, for ∆(X, Y ) = lim n!1 d(xn, yn) ≤ lim n!1 d(xn, zn)+ lim n!1 d(zn, yn) = ∆(X, Z)+∆(Z, Y ) where Z = {zn} is any other Cauchy sequence. But unfortunately ∆(X, Y ) = 0 (i.e., X and Y are equivalent) doesn’t imply that X = Y ; the example above shows that. Fixing the Metric What we do to overcome this shortcoming is divide S up into its equiv- alence classes via the equivalence relation (1). Let M \u0003 denote the set of 2 equivalence classes of S; we’ll use X \u0003 and Y \u0003 to denote typical elements of M \u0003; note that if X \u0003 ∈ M \u0003 then X \u0003 is a subset of S, consisting elements (Cauchy sequences in M ) which are all equivalent to each other. We will deﬁne a metric d \u0003 on M \u0003, as d\u0003(X \u0003, Y \u0003) = ∆(X, Y ) (5) where X is any element in X \u0003 and Y any element in Y \u0003. The function d\u0003 is well-deﬁned, independent of the choice of X and Y . To see this, let X2 ∈ X \u0003 and Y2 ∈ Y \u0003. Then ∆(X, Y ) ≤ ∆(X, X2) + ∆(X2, Y2) + ∆(Y2, Y ) = ∆(X2, Y2) since ∆(X, X2) = ∆(Y, Y2) = 0, so that ∆(X, Y ) ≤ ∆(X2, Y2). A similar argument also shows ∆(X2, Y2) ≤ ∆(X, Y ) so that ∆(X, Y ) = ∆(X2, Y2). The right side of equation (5) is thus independent of the choice of X and Y , and so d \u0003 is well-deﬁned. We now ﬁnd that if d \u0003(X \u0003, Y \u0003) = 0 then ∆(X, Y ) = 0 for any X ∈ X \u0003, Y ∈ Y \u0003, so that X \u0003 and Y \u0003 must be the same equivalence class, i.e., X \u0003 = Y \u0003. The work we did above with ∆ shows that d \u0003 also satisﬁes the other properties required of a metric. The space M \u0003 is indeed a metric space. In general, to carry out any computation involving X \u0003 and Y \u0003 in M \u0003, we choose representatives X and Y (Cauchy sequences) in the appropriate equivalence classes and do the computation with these representatives. We then justify that the speciﬁc choices for X and Y didn’t matter. The space M \u0003 very naturally contains a copy of the original metric space M . Speciﬁcally, for any x ∈ M , the sequence (x, x, x, . . .) is in S, and hence belongs to an equivalence class X \u0003 in M \u0003. Moreover, if y ∈ M corresponds to (y, y, y, . . .) in S and to Y \u0003 in M \u0003 then we ﬁnd that d\u0003(X \u0003, Y \u0003) = d(x, y). The new metric corresponds to the old if we identify each element of M with the equivalence class of its “constant” sequence. Put more mathematically, the mapping ϕ : y → (y, y, y, . . .) \u0003 from M to M \u0003 is an isometry (distance preserving map), where the “∗” means “equivalence class of”. Density 3 The original metric space M (or more appropriately, the image ϕ(M ) of M under the isometry ϕ : y → (y, y, y, . . .) \u0003) is dense in M \u0003. This is easy to prove: let Y \u0003 be an element of M \u0003, and Y ∈ S any element of Y \u0003 (i.e., a representative for the equivalence class Y \u0003). Y is itself a Cauchy sequence in M . Suppose Y = {y1, y2, y3, . . .} Let Yk = ϕ(yk). It’s not hard to see that Yk converges to Y , so that Y \u0003 k → Y \u0003 (and note that Y \u0003 k ∈ ϕ(M )). Is M \u0003 Complete? We’ve constructed a new metric space M \u0003 with metric d\u0003, and M lives naturally inside M \u0003—but is M \u0003 complete? Yes! But be warned, the argu- ment, though not technically diﬃcult, is a bit abstract. We have to consider Cauchy sequences of M \u0003, that is, Cauchy sequences of equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in M ! To show M \u0003 is complete, suppose we have a Cauchy sequence X \u0003 k in M \u0003; we need to ﬁnd an element of M \u0003 to which X \u0003 k converges. For each k choose a representative Xk ∈ X \u0003 k , and let Xk = {xk1, xk2, xk3, . . . , xkj, . . .} (note the xkj are elements of the original metric space M ). Note that to say that X \u0003 k is Cauchy means that for any ϵ > 0 we can ﬁnd some R such that ∆(Xm, Xn) < ϵ for m, n ≥ R, i.e., lim j!1 d(xmj, xnj) < ϵ (6) for all m, n ≥ R. Now we’ll use a kind of diagonalization argument. Since for each ﬁxed k the sequence {xk1, xk2, xk3, . . . , xkj, . . .} is Cauchy in M (with respect to the second index j) we can ﬁnd some Nk such that d(xkp, xkq) < 1/k for p, q ≥ Nk. Choose any xkj with j ≥ Nk and call that element yk. We then have d(yk, xkj) < 1/k (7) for j ≥ Nk. For each k let Yk denote the constant sequence Yk = (yk, yk, yk, . . .) (8) 4 which is clearly Cauchy (and so Yk ∈ S). Let Y \u0003 k denote the equivalence class to which Yk belongs in M \u0003. An immediate consequence of inequality (7) is that ∆(Xk, Yk) ≤ 1/k, and hence d\u0003(X \u0003 k , Y \u0003 k ) ≤ 1/k. (9) Given the last inequality, if we can ﬁnd a limit for Y \u0003 k in M \u0003 then X \u0003 k will converge to the same limit. A limit for Y \u0003 k isn’t too hard. Let Y = {y1, y2, y3, . . .} (10) The sequence {y1, y2, y3, . . .} is Cauchy. To see this, note that from the triangle inequality we have d(ym, yn) ≤ d(ym, xmj) + d(xmj, xnj) + d(xnj, yn). (11) From equation (7) we can choose some M2 large enough so that d(ym, xmj) < ϵ/3 and d(xnj, yn) < ϵ/3 for m, n ≥ M2 and for all j suﬃciently large. From equation (6) we can also, by increasing the value of M2 if necessary, guarantee that d(xmj, xnj) < ϵ/3 by taking j suﬃciently large. As a result we ﬁnd from inequality (11) that d(ym, yn) < ϵ for m, n ≥ M2 and so {ym} is Cauchy. Thus Y as deﬁned by equation (10) is a Cauchy sequence in M and so belongs to S. It’s also obvious that Yk deﬁned by equation (8) converges to Y (since ∆(Yk, Y ) = limj d(yk, yj); since {yj} is Cauchy, d(yk, yj) can be made small by taking j, k large), and so Y \u0003 k converges to Y \u0003 where Y \u0003 denotes the equivalence class for Y in M \u0003. From equation (9) we conclude that X \u0003 k → Y \u0003 ∈ M \u0003. The metric space M \u0003 is called the completion of M . Banach and Hilbert Spaces As we’ve seen, any inner product space is a normed linear space, and any normed linear space is a metric space. We can thus carry out this completion procedure. For a normed linear space we ﬁnd that the completion is itself a normed linear space, i.e., and Banach space. Moreover, the mapping ϕ be- comes an isometric isomorphism from M onto ϕ(M )—a distance preserving map that also preserves algebraic structure, e.g, ϕ(x + y) = ϕ(x) + ϕ(y). In the case of an inner product space we end up with a Hilbert space, and the 5 inner product is also preserved in a natural way. Exercises: 1. Let M = {1, 1/2, 1/3, 1/4, . . .} ⊂ lR. We can consider M to be a metric space with the usual norm d(x, y) = |x − y|. But S is not a complete metric space. Let’s set an = 1/n. (a) Specify a Cauchy sequence in M which has no limit in M . (b) Show that d(an, x) ≥ 1 n2+n for any x ∈ M with x ̸= an. (c) Show that the only Cauchy sequences in M are those sequences xn which are of • Type 1: Eventually constant (so xn = ar for some r and all n ≥ N ) or; • Type 2: Sequences such that for each R > 0 there exists some N > 0 such that for each n ≥ N we have xn = ar for some r ≥ R. Here r may depend on n. (d) The completion of M consists of the equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences in M . A type 1 equivalence class corresponds to an element in already in M . What’s the natural interpretation of the type 2 sequence? Hint: it’s a real number. 2. Show that any uniformly continuous function T from a metric space M to a complete metric space M2 can be extended to a continuous mapping from M \u0003 to M2. Hint: any point x\u0003 ∈ M \u0003 is a limit of a sequence xk in M . Use continuity to deﬁne the extension. 3. Give an example to show that the word “uniformly” in the last problem cannot be omitted. Hint: M = (0, 1). 4. Suppose that we try to complete a metric space M that is already complete. Show that in this case ϕ is an invertible map that yields a one-to-one correspondence between M and M \u0003. 5. Is the completion of a metric space unique? Yes, up to isomorphism. To see this let M be a metric space and M \u0003 and M \u0003\u0003 be complete metric spaces with metrics d \u0003 and d\u0003\u0003 such that there exists isometric maps 6 ϕ1 and ϕ2 such that ϕ1(M ) is dense in M \u0003 and ϕ2(M ) is dense in M \u0003\u0003. Show that there is an isometric one-to-one map ψ from M \u0003 onto M \u0003\u0003 with ψ(ϕ1(x)) = ϕ2(x) for all x ∈ M , and d\u0003\u0003(ψ(x), ψ(y)) = d\u0003(x, y) for all x, y ∈ M \u0003. Thus up to the mapping ψ, M \u0003 = M \u0003\u0003 7","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
