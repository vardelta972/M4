Given trapezoid AY CD with parallel sides AY and CD, assume that there exist points E on line AD outside segment AD, and F inside segment Y C such that ∠Y CE = ∠ADF . Denote by I the point of intersection of AY and EF , and by J the point of intersection of CD and EF . Let K be the midpoint of segment EF , assume it does not lie on line CD. Prove that I belongs to the circumcircle of CDK if and only if K belongs to the circumcircle of AY J. 2. Let a0, a1, a2, . . . be a sequence of positive integers such that the greatest common divisor of any two consecutive terms is greater than the preceding term; in symbols, gcd(ai, ai+1) > ai−1. Prove that an ≥ 2n for all n ≥ 0. 3. Prove that for any four positive real numbers a, b, c, d the inequality (a − b)(a − c) a + b + c + (b − c)(b − d) b + c + d + (c − d)(c − a) c + d + a + (d − a)(d − b) d + a + b ≥ 0 holds. Determine all cases of equality. 1","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
