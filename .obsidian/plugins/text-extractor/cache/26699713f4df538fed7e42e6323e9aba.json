The left hand side can be factored as n∏ i=1 (1 − x2 i ) = n∏ x=1 (1 − xi) · n∏ x=1(1 + xi). Now, by AM-GM, 1 − xi = ∑ j̸=i xj ≥ (n − 1) n−1 √∏ j̸=i xj and 1 + xi = xi + n∑ j=1 xj ≥ (n + 1) n+1 v u u √xi n∏ j=1 xj. Multiplying all these inequalities, we obtain the desired result. (2) Factor n into prime powers n = ∏k i=1 p mi i for pi odd primes. Then it is well known that ϕ(n) = ∏m i=1 (p mi−1 i · (pi − 1)). now, if mi > 1 for some i, then pi | ϕ(n), which is a contradiction since ϕ(n) is a power of 2. For a prime pi ̸= 2, we learn that pi − 1 is a power of 2, and hence we can write pi = 2 ci + 1. We claim that ci has no odd prime factor. Suppose not, so that ci = qh for q an odd prime. Then pi = (2 h) q +1 q and is therefore divisible by 2h +1. But pi is prime, so we have a contradiction. Thus, we can write ci = 2 di for some non-negative integers di. Wlog, we can assume d1 < d2 < · · · < dk. Now, expanding the product for n, we get a sum of terms of the form 2m0+ ∑ i∈S 2 di where S is a (possibly empty) subset of {1, . . . , k}. Since every positive integer can be written as a sum of distinct powers of 2 in a unique way, we can just read oﬀ the binary expansion for n. In particular, we learn that the binary expansion of n has 1’s showing up in consecutive blocks of size 2r, where r is the maximal non-negative integer for which d1 = 0, d2 = 1, . . . , dr = r − 1. Moreover, the number of such blocks is a power of 2. Note that the same conclusion follows for n + 1 as well, by an identical analysis. Now, the binary expansion for n + 1 takes the right-most block of 1’s in the binary expansion of n and turns them into 0, and changes the 0 immediately to the left into a 1, so that . . . 011 . . . 1 → . . . 100 . . . 0. This either keeps the number of blocks the same, or decrease it by 1. 1 2 SOLUTIONS TO MOCK OLYMPIAD If it decreases the number of blocks by 1, then since the numbers of blocks in both n and n + 1 are powers of 2, we must have that n + 1 has exactly one such block and n has exactly 2 such blocks. However, if the sizes of the blocks for n are 2 r, then the gaps between these blocks is also of size at least 2 r. Thus we must have 2r = 1, and so n must be 101 in binary, and so n = 5. Now assume that n and n + 1 have the same number of blocks. If this number is 1, then we have that n + 1 is a power of 2, as desired. If the number of blocks is larger than 1, then as the rightmost block of n + 1 is now of size 1, all the blocks are of size 1. Thus d1 > 0. Now write n + 1 = 2 · ∏r j=1(22 ej +1) where ej are distinct, increasing positive integers (positive since the rightmost 1 in the binary expansion of n + 1 is isolated.) Then the second right-most 1 in n + 1 is in position 2e1 + 1, but it also is in position 2 d1. But since e1, d1 > 0, this is a contradiction. This completes the proof. (3) We claim that M CKB is a cyclic quadrilateral. To see this, note ∠KCM = ∠KCA + ∠ACM = π − ∠KOA + π − ∠ACD (ACKO is cyclic ) = ∠KOB + ∠DBO (ACDB is cyclic ) = π − ∠KDB + ∠BDO (OKDB is cyclic and |OB| = |OD|) = π − ∠KDO = π − ∠KBM (OKDB is cyclic ) Chasing angle again, we have ∠M KO = ∠M KB − ∠BKO = ∠M CB − ∠ODB (OKDB and M CKB are cyclic ) = ∠M CA + ∠ACB − ∠OBD (|OB| = |OD|) = ∠M AC + π/2 − π + ∠DCA (ABDC is cyclic ) = π/2 which proves ∠M KO is a right angle. (4) First, note that every string v of size n consisting of 1 and −1 exists exactly once in the original matrix. Let f (v) be the changed string, where some number of entries become 0. Now, consider the set C consisting of the strings of size n consisting of 0 and 1. For each vertex s in C, let vs denote the string where its i’th entry is 1 − 2si, where si is the i’th entry of s. Note that s + vs is still a string in C, and so is s + f (vs). Set g(s) = s + f (vs). Now, starting at an arbitrary vertex s0 of G, deﬁne si = g(si−1) for i ≥ 1. Then as C is ﬁnite, we must get sa = sa+m for some minimal positive integer m. But then sa = sa+m = sa + f (vsa ) + f (vsa+1) + · · · + f (vsa+m−1 ) SOLUTIONS TO MOCK OLYMPIAD 3 and so 0 = f (vsa ) + f (vsa+1) + · · · + f (vsa+m−1). since m was chosen to be minimal, we must have that this is a sum of distinct rows of the altered matrix, and this completes the proof.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
