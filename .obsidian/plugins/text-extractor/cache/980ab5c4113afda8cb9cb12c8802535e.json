To accommodate the case of no real roots, i.e., to provide solutions to those quadratic equations, the concept of complex numbers was invented. One may expect that as complex numbers are never encountered in our daily routines, the studies of complex numbers are impractical. However, complex numbers are actually extremely useful tools in many applications like factorization and proofs of trigonometric identities. In this set of notes, we will illustrate the basic concepts and some of the applications of complex numbers with examples. 1. Basic Terms and Concepts As noted, the interests in complex numbers originated from studies of the roots of quadratic equations. As an illustration, consider the equation 2 10x + = . This equation does not admit real roots because for all real number x, 2 10 1 1 0x + ≥+ = > . Yet, if we set 1i =− , then 2 11 1 0i += − + = is a root of the equation. Definition 1.1. (Imaginary unit) The imaginary unit is defined by 1i =− . Based on the imaginary unit, we develop a set of numbers called the complex numbers. The general form of a complex number z is z = a + bi, where a and b are real numbers. Definition 1.2 (Real and imaginary parts of a complex number) For a complex number z = a + bi, where ,ab ∈ , a is called the real part of z and b is called the imaginary part of z. These are denoted as Re(z) = a and Im(z) = b respectively. Illustration. If z = 3 + 5i, then the real part of z is 3 and the imaginary part is 5. We write Re(z) = 3 and Im(z) = 5. Illustration. All real numbers x can be represented in the form of a complex number by setting a = Mathematical Database Page 2 of 25 x and b = 0. Hence, ⊂ , where represents the set of real numbers and the set of complex numbers. In particular, if Im(z) = 0, then z is a real number. On the contrary, if Re(z) = 0 and ()Im 0z ≠ , z is called a purely imaginary number. In general, we cannot compare complex numbers with each other as in real numbers. For example, we say 6 > 4, but we cannot say which of 6i and 4i is larger or smaller. However, we can say that they are unequal. In fact, two complex numbers are said to be equal iff both their real parts and imaginary parts are equal. 2. Arithmetic Operations Basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. For two complex numbers 11 1za b i= + and 22 2za b i= + , we have ()( ) ( )( )12 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2zz a b i a b i a a b b i+= + + + = + + + , ()( ) ( )( )12 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2zz a b i a b i a a b b i−= + − + = − + − , 1 2 1 1 2 2 12 1 2 12 1 2 2 1 2 12 2 1 1 2 1 2 12 12 2 1 ()( ) () ( ) , z z a b i a bi a a a b i b a i b ibi a a a b i a bi bb i a a b b a b a b i = ++ = + + + = +++ = − + + and if 2 0z ≠ , ()( ) ()( ) ( )( ) () () ( ) 11 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 211 1 22 22 2 2 2 2 2 22 1 2 12 2 1 12 1 2 12 2 1 12 2 2 22 22 22 22 22 . ab i a b i a a b b a b a b iza b i za b i a b i a b i ab i aa b b a b a b i aa b b a b a b i ab ab ab +− + + −+ == = ++ − − ++ − +− == + ++ + Example 2.1.

The Argand Diagram, Modulus and Argument Maybe it is too abstract to just talk about complex numbers. A better understanding of this number system can be obtained by drawing diagrams. In this section, we will discuss the Argand diagrams of complex numbers. The Argand diagrams are also of core importance in the application of complex numbers on some geometry problems. An Argand diagram consists of two axes: a horizontal one, like the x-axis in the rectangular coordinate system, called the real axis, and a vertical one, like the y-axis, called the imaginary axis. The point (x, y) in an Argand diagram represents the complex number x + yi. In figure 1, the complex numbers represented by the points A, B, C and D are 1 + i, 2 – 3i, 3 – 2i and -3 + i respectively. By convention the number zero is represented by the origin O. Another way to interpret Argand diagrams is by way of vectors. For example, the complex numbers mentioned above are said to be associated with the vectors OA , OB , OC and OD respectively. Readers might have noticed that 1 + i + 2 – 3i = 3 – 2i, which in the notation of vectors is represented by OA OB OA AC OC+= + = . A C B D 3 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 1 2 -1 -2 -3 -4 Re Im Figure 1: Argand Diagram Mathematical Database Page 5 of 25 From the perspectives of the Argand diagram and vectors, we can define some more properties of complex numbers. The length of the vector in the Argand diagram, r, is called the modulus of the associated complex number, while the angle the vector made with positive real axis, θ , is said to be an argument of the complex number. Hence we have, if 0z ≠ , 22x yi r x y+ == + , cosxr θ= and sinyr θ= . An immediate result of the above is that tan y x θ = . Since ()cos cos 2kθ θπ=+ and ( )sin sin 2kθ θπ=+ for any integer k, there are infinitely many possible values for the argument of a complex number. And this leads to the following definition. Definition 3.1. The principal value of the argument of a complex number z = x + yi is the angle θ such that r cos xθ = , r sin yθ = and π θπ−< ≤ . We usually denote the principal argument by Arg z, and the set of arguments by arg z = Arg z + 2kπ . Example 3.1. Find the modulus and the principal value of the argument of the complex number 1 + i. Solution. We now have x = y = 1. Hence, modulus 2211 2r== + = . Besides, 11tan tan 1 y x −−⎛⎞ =⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ has only two possible values, 4 π and 3 4 π − in the interval ( ],π π− . We have cos 1 4 rx π == and sin 1 4 ry π == , but 3 cos 1 4 rx π⎛⎞ − =− ≠⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ and 3 sin 1 4 ry π⎛⎞ −= − ≠⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . Hence, the principal value of the argument of the complex number 1 + i is 4 π .

Draw the points 1Z and 2Z , representing 1z and 2z respectively, on the Argand diagram. What is the relationship between 1OZ and 2OZ ? 4. Other Forms of Representation The concepts of modulus and argument are important in dealing with representations of complex numbers. In this section, we will introduce the polar form and the exponential form, both of which are associated with representing complex numbers in terms of their moduli and arguments. The Polar Form Definition 4.1. (The polar form) Suppose r and θ are respectively the modulus and argument of the complex number z. Then the polar form of z is ()cos sinriθ θ+ , or abbreviated as cisr θ . Illustration. The polar form of the complex number 1 + i is 2cos sin 44 π π⎛⎞ +⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ , or in short, 2cis 4 π . Example 4.1. Express, in polar form, the following complex numbers: Mathematical Database Page 7 of 25 (a) 3 i+ (b) 1sin cosiθ θ+− for 3 22 π π θ−≤ ≤ . Solution. (a) Let 3zi=+ . Then () 2 231 3 1 2r =+ = + =. 15 tan (rejected) or 663 π π θθ=⇒ = − Hence, the polar form of z is cis 2 cos sin 66 ri π π θ ⎛⎞ =+⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . (b) Let 1sin cosziθ θ=+ − . Then, 21 cos sin 1 2 cos 1 2 sin cos 2 2 42 42 42 2cos cos sin 2cos cos sin . 42 42 42 42 24 24 zi i ii π π πθ πθ πθ θθ πθ πθ πθ πθ θ π θ π ⎡⎤⎛ ⎞ ⎛ ⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ =+ − − − = + − − − − −⎜ ⎟ ⎜ ⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎢⎥ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝ ⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠⎣⎦ ⎡⎤ ⎡ ⎤⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ ⎛⎞ =− − − − = − − + −⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟ ⎜⎟⎢⎥ ⎢ ⎥ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠ ⎝⎠⎣⎦ ⎣ ⎦ Since 3 22 π π θ−≤ ≤ , we have 24 2 2 π πθ π −≤ − ≤ , i.e., 2cos 0 42 πθ⎛⎞ − ≥⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ .

The polar form of representation is especially useful when we perform multiplication and division of complex numbers. Theorem 4.1. Let 1z and 2z be two complex numbers. Then for ()arg 0iz ≠ , 1. 12 1 2zz z z= and () () ( )12 1 2arg arg argzz z z=+ . 2. If 2 0z ≠ , 11 22 zz zz = and () ( ) 1 12 2 arg arg arg z zz z ⎛⎞ =−⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . Proof.

(The exponential form) Suppose r and θ are respectively the modulus and argument of the complex number z. Then the exponential form of z is ire θ .

(Complex conjugate) Suppose z = a +bi is a complex number, where ,ab ∈ . Then the complex conjugate of z is defined as za bi=− . Thus the complex conjugate of a complex number is the mirror image of the original number across the real axis. There are some nice properties associated with complex conjugate pairs. Theorem 5.1. For any complex number z, we have 1. zz= . 2. () ( )arg argzz=− . 3. ()2Rezz z+= . 4. ()2Imzz i z−= . 5. 2 zz z= . 6. zz= . Proof. The theorem follows easily from the definition and its proof is left as an exercise. Q.E.D. An implication of this theorem is that if z is real, then ()2Im 0zz i z− ==. Likewise, if z is purely imaginary, then ()2Re 0zz z+ ==. The converses of these are also true, with the only exception that the number zero is real but 2Re(0) = 0. These facts are often useful in proving some of the properties of some numbers in questions. Example 5.1. Mathematical Database Page 11 of 25 Suppose 1w = and 1 zw w =+ . Prove that z is a real number. Solution. By property 5 of theorem 5.1, we have 2 211ww w= ==. Hence, 1 w w = as 0w ≠ . Therefore, () 1 2Rezw w w w w =+ =+ = must be a real number. Theorem 5.2. For complex numbers 1z and 2z , we have 1. 12 12zz zz+= + . 2. 12 12zz zz−= − . 3. 12 12zz zz⋅= ⋅ . 4. 11 22 zz zz ⎛⎞ =⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ , if 2 0z ≠ . Proof. The proofs of the first two properties are left as an exercise. For property 3, we let 11 1za b i= + and 22 2za b i= + . Then 11 1za b i= − and 22 2za b i=− . Hence, ()( )( )( ) () ( )()( ) 1 2 1 1 2 2 1 2 12 12 2 1 12 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 2 1 2. zz a b i a b i a a b b a b a b i a a bb a b a b i a bi a b i z z ⋅= − − = − − + =− + + = + + = For property 4, using previous results, 11 22 1 22 zz zz z zz ⎛⎞ ⋅ =⋅ =⎜⎟ ⎝⎠ . And the theorem follows. Q.E.D. Example 5.2. Let z = x + yi. If 65z −= and 5z = , find the possible values of x and y. Solution. From property 5 of theorem 5.1 and property 3 of theorem 5.2, Mathematical Database Page 12 of 25 ()( )()() 2256 6 6 6 6zz z z z=− = − − = − −, ( ) () 2 2 25 6 6 36 6 36 5 6 2 Re 36. zz z z z z z z =− − + = − + + =− ⋅ + Hence, () ()12 Re 36 Re 3zx z=⇒ = =. On the other hand, 22 2253zx y y== + = +. Thus, 22 2 253 4y = −= . The possible values of y are therefore 4± . We started our discussion of complex numbers on solving algebraic equations. In fact, there is a nice relationship between the complex conjugates in solving equations. Theorem 5.3. If z is a zero of a real polynomial (polynomial with real coefficients), then so is z . Proof. Suppose z is a zero of the real polynomial 1 10 nn nnax a x a − −++ . From property 3 of theorem 5.2, () k kzz z z z z z z= ⋅ ⋅⋅ = ⋅ ⋅⋅ = for positive integer k. Besides, since the ka ’s are real, we have kkaa= . Then, () () 1 11 10 1 0 1 0 1 10 00 nn nn n n nn n n n n nn nn az a z a a z a z a a z a z a az a z a − −− −− − − − ++ = + + = + + =+ + = = Thus, z is also a zero of the polynomial. Q.E.D. This theorem implies that for a real polynomial, either both members of a complex conjugate pair are the zeros, or both are not. In fact, a real polynomial can only have an even number of complex zeros. Example 5.3. Given that 3 + i is a root of the equation 43 2510 0xx x ax b− ++ + = , where a and b are real numbers. Find a and b. Solution. Mathematical Database Page 13 of 25 Since 3 + i is a root, its conjugate, 3 – i, is also a root. By factor theorem, 43 2510x xx ax b−+ + + is divisible by both x – (3 + i) and x – (3 – i), i.e., by ( )( ) 233 6 10xi x i x x− −− + = − + . Upon long division by 2 610xx−+ , the remainder of 43 2510x xx ax b− ++ + is () ( )26 60ax b++ − . Thus, we have a + 26 = 0 and b – 60 = 0, i.e., a = –26 and b = 60. Exercise 1. Prove theorem 5.1. 2. Prove the first two properties of theorem 5.2. 3. Let k be a real constant and z be a complex number with 1z = . Prove that 1zk kz+= + . 4. Given that 1 + 3i is a root of the equation 4230xx ax b+ ++ = . Find a and b and factorize 423x xax b++ + . 6. De Moivre’s Theorem Performing multiplications and divisions on complex numbers can be very tedious and error- prone, as we have to deal with both the real and imaginary parts. If we employ the polar form and exponential form, the operations will be much simpler. Furthermore, if the operations involve rational powers of complex numbers, the operations can be eased with the De Moivre’s theorem. Theorem 6.1. (De Moivre’s Theorem for Integral Index) For any integer n, ()cos sin cos sin n in i nθ θθ θ+= + . Proof. We shall prove the theorem for non-negative n by induction first. For n = 0 or 1, the result is obvious. Mathematical Database Page 14 of 25 Suppose for n = k, ()cis cis k kθ θ= . Then when n = k+1, by theorem 4.1, () () ( ) 1 cis cis cis cis cis cis 1 kk kkθ θθ θ θ θ + == = + . So, by mathematical induction, the theorem is true for all non-negative integer n.

Applications As shown in the last section, complex numbers find their use in proving trigonometric identities. Besides, it is also useful in solving geometry problems. This application arises from the geometric representation of complex numbers on the Argand diagram. For instance, the complex number z = x + yi can represent the vector OZ xi y j=+ . On the other hand, the resultant vector from the subtraction of vectors can also be represented by the subtraction of the corresponding complex numbers. The modulus of the resulting complex number is the length of the resultant vector and the argument represents the angle between the resultant vector and the x-axis. In this section, we will illustrate the applications of complex numbers with a couple of examples. Example 7.1. Mathematical Database Page 19 of 25 If the points 1A , 2A , 1B and 2B are associated with the complex numbers 1a , 2a , 1b and 2b respectively, express the angle between the line segments 11AB and 22AB in terms of 1a , 2a , 1b and 2b .

Then OP is represented by p and PA is represented by p – (6 + 8i). Then, following from the result of Example 7.1, () () () () () 3 angle between and is or 22 3 arg or 68 2 2 is purely imaginary 68 2Re 0. 68 68 68 OP PA OP PA p pi p pi pp p pi pi pi ππ ππ ⊥ ⇔ ⎛⎞ ⇔=⎜⎟⎜⎟−+⎝⎠ ⇔ −+ ⎡⎤ ⎛ ⎞ ⇔+ = =⎜⎟⎢⎥ ⎜⎟−+ −+ −+⎣⎦ ⎝ ⎠ Notice that () () () () () ( )() ( ) () ( ) () ( ) () () ( ) 222 22 22 68 68 68 6 8 6 868 26 826 2 8 0. 68 68 pp pp x yi x yi p ip i p i x y i x y ipi xy x yxx y y i xy xy ⎡⎤ +− += + = +⎢⎥ −+ −+ −+ −+ − − − −−+⎡⎤⎣⎦ ⎣⎦ +−−−− − == = −+ − − + − Hence, OP PA⊥ . We conclude this set of notes with a discussion on the triangle inequality, a well-known theorem which can be readily applied to complex numbers as well. Theorem 7.1 (Triangle Inequality) For any two complex numbers 1z and 2z , we have 12 1 2zz z z+≤ + . Equality holds iff 1Z , 2Z and O are collinear, and 1Z and 2Z are on the “same side” of O. Proof. In a triangle 12Z ZO , the sum of lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side, i.e., we have 12 1 2''Z OZ O Z Z+≥ , where equality holds iff 1Z , 2 'Z and O are collinear, and 1Z and 2 'Z are on the opposite side of O. In terms of complex numbers, 12 1 2''zz z z+≥ − . Taking 22'zz=− , we have 12 1 2 1 2zz z z z z+≤ + − = + . Note that 2Z , 2 'Z and O are always collinear and 2Z and 2 'Z are on the opposite side of O. Hence, equality holds iff 1Z , 2Z and O are Mathematical Database Page 21 of 25 collinear and 1Z and 2Z are on the “same side” of O. Q.E.D. In fact, for 2n ≥ , we have 12 1 2nnzz z z z z++ + ≤ + + + . This follows from induction on n and theorem 7.1. Example 7.3. Suppose 12 1 nn nwz w z wz −++ + = for some w such that 1w ≤ .
