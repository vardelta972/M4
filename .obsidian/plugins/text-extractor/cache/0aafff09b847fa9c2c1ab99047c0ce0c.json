In applications and in pure math, the complex numbers are everywhere. Their versatility arises from the multitude of possible interpretations of their meaning. They may be considered ordered pairs of real numbers with an unusual multiplication rule, points in the Argand plane, two-dimensional vectors, spiral similarities, or even matrices. Oftentimes, as Hadamard said, the shortest path to the solution of a problem can be found by expressing it in the language of the complex numbers, even if at ﬁrst glance the problem may seem to be very far removed. 1 Conjugates For a complex number z = a + bi, the number z = a − bi is called the complex conjugate of z. You will have seen and worked with these before, but it is useful to see how some of the important facts are derived. These are: 1. z = z iﬀ z ∈ R; for all z, we have z = z; and the modulus of z is √ zz. 2. The conjugate of a sum is the sum of the conjugates: z1 + z2 = z1 + z2. 3. The conjugate of a product is the product of the conjugates: z1 · z2 = z1 · z2 4. If z = re iθ, then z = re −iθ. 5. The formulas ℜ(z) = z + z 2 , and ℑ(z) = z − z 2i are valid for all z ∈ C. Note that a special case of this is the exponential form for sin and cos. Using these important conjugate facts, we will solve two problems. 1. Prove the identity |z1| 2 + |z2| 2 = |z1 + z2|2 + |z1 − z2|2 2 for all complex numbers z1, z2 ∈ C. 2. Prove that if |z1| = |z2| = 1 and z1z2 ̸= −1, then z1 + z2 1 + z1z2 is a real number. 1The shortest path between two truths in the real domain passes through the complex domain. 1 2 Matrices A complex number is a 2 × 2 matrix of the form ( a −b b a ) where a, b are real numbers. Addition of complex numbers is simply matrix addition; multiplication is just matrix multiplication. Letting 1 and i denote the complex numbers ( 1 0 0 1 ) , ( 0 −1 1 0 ) respectively, every complex number z can be written just one way as z = a · 1 + b · i. Note that the modulus of a complex number is simply the square root of its determinant, as |a + bi| = √( a −b b a ) = √ a2 + b2. All complex numbers (their matrices) excluding 0 are therefore invertible, and we can deﬁne z/w via the map ϕ(z/w) = zw−1. While this is a particular matrix representation of the complex numbers, it is not the only one. See if you can ﬁnd another by looking at matrices J such that J 2 = −I. 3 Geometric Properties When you have to resort to analytic geometry, complex numbers can sometimes greatly simplify the situation. This is a consequence of the fact that we can consider a complex number to be a vector or a geometric transformation. Recall that we add two complex numbers via vector addition (z = a + bi, w = c + di gives z + w = (a + c) + (b + d)i). Multiplication then acts as a spiral similarity, because if we have z = re iθ, w = ρeiϕ, then zw = rρe i(θ+ϕ). If we use complex numbers as our coordinates, we get a very nice formula for rotation by θ about an arbitrary point a: z′ = a + eiθ(z − a) To see why this is true, translate a to the origin, which makes z → z − a. Multiplying by eiθ rotates everything by θ, and then we translate the point back by adding a. Another very useful formula is an analog of a vector version: if A, B, C are complex numbers representing the vertices of a triangle, then the centroid of the triangle is at G = A + B + C 3 Even some more useful things to remember are facts about particular n-th roots of unity. Say we want to rotate an object in a geometric diagram by 60◦. Multiplication by the sixth root of unity ε = eiπ/3 will do that, but we’ll need a way of simplifying expressions involving powers of ε. That’s also pretty simple, though – just factor ε6 − 1 = 0 and remove the extraneous factors. For example, ε6 − 1 = (ε2 − 1)(ε4 + ε2 + 1) = 0, and ε2 − 1 ̸= 0, so ε4 + ε2 + 1 = (ε2 − ε + 1)(ε2 + ε + 1) = 0. Finally, ε2 + ε + 1 ̸= 0, so the one relation left is that ε2 = ε − 1. This is simple enough but has extremely important applications in geometry. Take any triangle and construct equilaterals on its sides. How would you prove that the centroids of these three equilateral triangles form another equilateral triangle? 2 4 Problems 1. Find the value of ( 1 + i tan π 8044 1 − i tan π 8044 )2011. 2. If x, y, z are complex numbers of modulus 1 such that x + y + z = 1 xyz = 1 then ﬁnd |(2 + x)(2 + y)(2 + z)|. 3. Let a, b be two distinct points in the complex plane. For all z on the line determined by a and b, (answer true or false) we have  z z 1 a a 1 b b 1   = 0. 4. Andre was walking to TJ one day, but he was given very strange directions. He was told to walk one mile to the northwest, then half a mile to the northeast, a fourth of a mile southeast, and so on. Find the distance of TJ from where Andre started walking. 5. A function f is deﬁned on the complex numbers by f (z) = (a+bi)z, where a and b are positive numbers. The function has the property that the image of each point in the complex plane is equidistant from that point and the origin. Given that |a + bi| = 8 and that b 2 = m/n, where m and n are relatively prime positive integers. Find m + n. 6. Set ak = tan ( √2 + kπ 2011 ) for k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , 2011.
