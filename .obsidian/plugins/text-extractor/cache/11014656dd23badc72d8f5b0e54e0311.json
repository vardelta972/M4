Groups of functions. Let f : R → R and g : R → R be two functions. Then the composition of f and g, written f ◦ g, is the function deﬁned by (f ◦ g)(x) = f (g(x)). Note that the domain of f ◦ g consists of all x from the domain of g such that g(x) belongs to the domain of f . Exercise 1. Find the domains of f ◦ g and g ◦ f , where f (x) = 1 − x2, g(x) = √x. Exercise 2. For the functions f (x) = x − 2 3x + 4 , g(x) = 2x − 3 5x − 1 ﬁnd f ◦ g and g ◦ f and their domains. Exercise 3. Find functions f, g such that f ◦ g ̸= g ◦ f . Prove that for all functions f, g, h it is true that (f ◦ g) ◦ h = f ◦ (g ◦ h). Exercise 4. Let f (x) = x √1 − x2 . Find the n-fold composition f (n)(x) = f ◦ f ◦ f ◦ . . . ◦ f (x). We say that two functions f and g commute if f ◦ g = g ◦ f . Exercise 5. Prove that for every function f the functions f (n) andf (m) commute for all m, n. The function e(x) = x has the property that e ◦ f = f ◦ e = f for any other function f ; e is sometimes called the identity function. A function g is called the inverse of f if f ◦ g = g ◦ f = e or equivalently f (g(x)) = g(f (x)) = x for all x ∈ R. In this case we denote the inverse of f by f −1. A set G of functions is called a group if 1. e ∈ G; 2. If f, g ∈ G, then f ◦ g ∈ G; and, 3. If f ∈ G, then f −1 ∈ G. Exercise 6. Prove that the set G of linear functions f (x) = ax + b, a ̸= 0, b arbitrary, is a group. Exercise 7. Prove that the functions g1 = x, g2 = 1 − x form a group. Write down the “multiplication table” for this group. Exercise 8. Prove that the functions g1 = x, g2 = 1 1 − x , g3 = x − 1 x form a group. Write down the “multiplication table” for this group. 1 Exercise 9. Prove that the functions g1 = x, g2 = x − 1 x + 1 , g3 = − 1 x , g4 = x + 1 1 − x form a group. Write down the “multiplication table” for this group. We will use Exercise 7 to solve the functional equation 2f (1 − x) + 1 = xf (x). We substitite 1 − x for x. As these two functions form a group we will again have an equation relating f (x) and f (1 − x). Namely, 2f (x) + 1 = (1 − x)f (1 − x). Now, making f (1 − x) the subject of the ﬁrst equation and substituting it into the second, we get 2f (x) + 1 = (1 − x)f (1 − x) = (1 − x) · 1 2 (xf (x) − 1) and f (x) = x − 3 x2 − x + 4 . This is a consequence of the original equation. Therefore we have to check that this function is indeed a solution. This can be easily done. I am not doing it here but it is a necessary part of the solution! Exercise 10. Solve the functional equation 2xf (x) + f ( 1 1−x ) = 2x. Exercise 11. Solve the functional equation xf (x) + 2f ( x−1 x+1 ) = 1. 2 Cauchy’s equation. The equation F (x + y) = F (x) + F (y) is called the Cauchy equation. It is clear that any linear homogeneous function F (x) = ax satisﬁes this equation. Exercise 12. Let F (x) be any function satisfying the Cauchy equation. Prove that for a = F (1) we have F (x) = ax for all rational numbers x. Exercise 13. Prove that a continuous function satisfying the Cauchy equation must be a function F (x) = ax for all real numbers x and a = F (1). But apart from linear functions there are many discontinuous solutions to the Cauchy equation. In 1905 the German mathematician G. Hamel published in Mathematische Annalen the following result: he constructed a subset G ⊆ R with the property that every real number x ∈ R can be uniquely represented as a ﬁnite linear combination x = n1g1 + n2g2 + · · · + nkgk of some g1, g2, . . . gk ∈ G with nonzero integer coeﬃcients n1, n2, . . . nk. The construction of this set G, which is known now as Hamel’s basis, is quite tricky and cannot be given here. Using this basis we can construct inﬁnitely many solutions to the Cauchy equation, as follows. Let us put an arbitrary real number a(g) in correspondence to an element g ∈ G and deﬁne F (x) = n1a(g1) + n2a(g2) + · · · + nka(gk). 2 To prove that F (x) satisﬁes the Cauchy equation let us take also y = m1g1 + m2g2 + · · · + mkgk. Without loss of generality we may assume that y is a linear combination of the same elements of G because we can always add some additional terms with zero coeﬃcients. As x + y = (n1 + m1)g1 + (n2 + m2)g2 + · · · + (nk + mk)gk we have F (x + y) = (n1 + m1)a(g1) + (n2 + m2)a(g2) + · · · + (nk + mk)a(gk) = F (x) + F (y), so F satisﬁes the Cauchy equation, as claimed. Discontinuous solutions are strangely behaved, and very hard to imagine. In fact, the graph of any discontinuous solution to the Cauchy equation is everywhere dense in the plane! As an example, we will prove one result about discontinous solutions. Theorem 1. Let F (x) be a function satisfying the Cauchy equation. Suppose that F (x) is bounded from above at least on one interval (p, p + s), where s is a positive number. Then F (x) = ax for all real numbers x, where a = F (1). Proof. If the function F (x) is bounded on the interval (p, p + s), then it is bounded from above on the interval (0, s). Indeed, for an arbitrary x ∈ (0, s) there exists an upper bound M such that F (p + x) < M . Thus F (p + x) = F (p) + F (x) < M and F (x) < M − F (p) for an arbitrary x ∈ (0, s). We may assume that s is rational. Let us consider now another function G(x) = F (x) − F (s) s x. Clearly this function also satisﬁes the Cauchy equation and it is also bounded on the interval (0, s). In addition we have G(s) = 0 and hence G(x + s) = G(x) + g(s) = G(x) which means that s is a period of G(x)! It follows now that the function G(x) is bounded on the whole real line as every value of G(x) is equal to some value of this function on the interval (0, s). The function G(x) must now be identically zero. Indeed, if G(x0) ̸= 0, then G(nx0) = nG(x0), so G gets arbitrary large for large n which contradicts the fact that G(x) is bounded. Thus F (x) = F (s) s x = F (1)x. The theorem is proved. Exercise 14. Analyse the Cauchy equation F (x + y) = F (x)F (y) by reducing it to the Cauchy equation by means of logarithmic transformation. 3 Problems 1.

(IMO 1973) A nonempty set G of linear functions f (x) = ax + b, where a and b are real numbers, does not contain constant functions and has the following properties: (i) For arbitrary f, g ∈ G, we have f ◦ g ∈ G, i.e. the set G is closed under composition of functions; (ii) If f (x) = ax + b ∈ G, then f −1(x) = 1 a (x − b) ∈ G; and, (iii) For every f ∈ G there exists a number af ∈ R such that f (af ) = af . Prove that there exists a number a ∈ R such that f (a) = a for all f ∈ G. 4. (APMO 1989) Determine all functions from the reals to the reals for which (i) f (x) is strictly increasing; and, (ii) f (x) + g(x) = 2x for all real x, where g(x) is the composition inverse function to f (x). (Note: f and g are said to be composition inverses, if f (g(x)) = x and g(f (x)) = x for all real x.) 5.
