Plugging in y = 1 gives f (x + 1) − f (x) = 1. We con- clude that f (n) = n + 1 for all integers n. Now, letting y = n gives f (nx) = nf (x) − (n − 1). Given x, choose n which makes nx an integer. Then f (nx) = nx + 1 and we are left with f (x) = x + 1 for all rational numbers x □ Problem 2, Solution by Nicholas Triantaﬁllou: By induction f (x + n) = f (x) + n. Given x ∈ Q+, let n ∈ Z + such that both nx2 and n2x are integers. Then, f ((x + n) 3) = f (x3 + 3x2n + 3xn2 + n3) = f (x)3 + 3x2n + 3xn2 + n 3 = (f (x) + n) 3 = f (x)3 + 3f (x)2n + 3f (x)n2 + n3 implies f (x) = x or f (x) = −x − n but f (x) > 0 so we conclude that f (x) = x for all x ∈ Q + □ Problem 3, Solution by Sam Keller: Letting m = 1 gives f (f (n)+2) = f (n) + 4. Since f (2) = 4, we deduce that f (2k) = 2k + 2 for all positive integers k. Now, let f (3) = c. Because f is injective, c is odd. For all odd k > c, we get f (k) = k + 2. So f (5) is either an odd number less than c or it is c + 2. If f (5) = l < c, then f (m) = m + 2 for all odd positive integers m ≥ l. But c − 2 ≥ l is an odd integer so f (c − 2) = c = f (3) and by injectivity we get c = 5. However then 5 is in the image of f and so f (5) = 7 which is not less than c = 5, a contradiction. In the other case, f (5) = c + 2, but c is in the image of f so f (c) = c + 2 so by injectivity we get c = 5. It then follows that f (1) = 2 and f (x) = x + 2 for all other positive integers x □ Problem 4, Solution by Zhifan Zhang: Note that f (1) = 1 and f ( 1 x ) = 1 f (x) . Also f (x) = f (−x). For a non-zero rational number x, f (x) ̸= 0 since otherwise the ﬁrst condition would force all the images of rationals to be 0, contradicting the third condition. Now, given positive integers x, y using the ﬁrst two conditions it is not diﬃcult to show that f (x ± y) ≤ max{f (x), f (y)}. We can generalize this to f (mx+ny) ≤ max{f (x), f (y)} for all integers m and n. Hence, f (gcd(x, y)) ≤ max{f (x), f (y)}. For dis- tinct primes p and q this gives 1 ≤ max{f (p), f (q)}. However, f (1) = 1 so by the second condition, f (x) ≤ 1 for all positive integers. Thus max{f (p), f (q)} = 1 for all distinct primes p and q. So all but one of the primes are sent to 1. Factoring 2003 and 2002 and using the third condition we see that this prime is one of 2,7,11, or 13. If it is 2, then we get f ( 2004 2003 ) = 1 4 . In all the other cases f ( 2004 2003 ) = 1 □ Problem 5, Solution by Wenyu Cao: Letting x = y = 0, we get f (0) = 0. For x ̸= 0, let g(x) = e f (x) x . Then our equation becomes g(xy) = g(x)g(y). Since f is continuous, so is g and by Cauchy’s Equation, g(x) = xc for some real c, which implies that f (x) = cx ln |x| with the convention that 0 ln 0 = 0 □ 2008 BLUE MOP, FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS-II AL˙I G ¨UREL 3 Problem 6, Solution by Matthew Superdock: Suppose f (f (a)) = 0 for some real number a. Since x + f (x) = f (f (x)) for all real x, we have a + f (a) = 0 ⇒ f (a) = −a and then f (f (a)) = 0 ⇒ f (−a) = 0. Hence, we also have −a + f (−a) = f (f (−a)) ⇒ f (0) = −a. But 0 + f (0) = f (f (0)) ⇒ −a = f (−a) = 0. Therefore a = 0, and note that f (f (0)) = f (0) and f is injective so f (0) = 0 and f (f (0)) = 0, indeed □ Problem 7, Solution by Minseon Shin: Plugging-in (x, y) → (x, −x) in f (xy + x + y) = f (xy) + f (x) + f (y) gives f (−x) = −f (x). So, in particular f (0) = 0. Plugging-in (−x, −y) gives f (xy − x − y) = f (xy) − f (x) − f (y) and so f (xy + x + y) + f (xy − x − y) = 2f (xy). When x = y y−1 , this becomes f ( 2y2 y−1 ) = 2f ( y2 y−1 ). On the other hand, when x = −y y+1 we get f ( 2y2 y+1 ) = 2f ( y2 y+1 ). Since any real number can be written in one of the forms y2 y±1 , we conclude that for all real x, we have f (2x) = 2f (x). Plugging-in (x, y) → (x, 1) in the original equation, we get f (2x + 1) = 2f (x) + f (1). Plugging-in (x, y) → (xy + x + y, y), we get f (2xy + 2x + 2y + 1) = 2f (xy) + 2f (x) + 2f (y) + f (1). We proceed by rearranging the terms and using the functional equation one more time: f (x(2y + 1) + x + (2y + 1)) = 2f (xy) + 2f (x) + 2f (y) + f (1) ⇒ f (2xy + x) + f (x) + f (2y + 1) = 2f (xy) + 2f (x) + 2f (y) + f (1) ⇒ f (2xy + x) + f (x) + 2f (y) + f (1) = f (2xy) + 2f (x) + 2f (y) + f (1) ⇒ f (2xy + x) = f (2xy) + f (x) Finally plugging-in y → y 2x above, we get the desired result: f (x + y) = f (x) + f (y) □ Problem 8, Solution by Joshua Pfeﬀer: First observe that f is both injective and surjective. Now, (x, y) = (1, 1) gives f (1) = 1. Then, y = 1 gives f (f (x)) = 1 x . Plugging-in f (y) for y we get f ( x y ) = f (x) f (y) . Equiva- lently, f (xy) = f (x)f (y). Note that these two conditions f (xy) = f (x)f (y) and f (f (x)) = 1 x together imply the original functional equation. Hence, it is enough to construct a multiplicative function satisfying f (f (x)) = 1 x . Let pj be the j-th prime and for any positive integer k let f (p2k−1) = p2k and f (p2k) = 1 p2k−1 . Extend f to a multiplicative function deﬁned on Q + using prime factorization and observe that it satisﬁes both conditions □","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
