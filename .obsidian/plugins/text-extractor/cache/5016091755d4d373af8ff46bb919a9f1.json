A positive integer n is called Corona if its digits are non-decreasing from left to right (For example, 1123445 is Corona). Prove that, ∀ n ∈ N, ∃ an n−digit natural number which is Corona as well as a perfect square. 2. Determine all functions f : R → R such that f (x)f (x + y) ≤ f (x2) + xy holds ∀ x, y ∈ R. 3. Using combinatorial argument. prove that F 2 1 + F 2 2 + ... + F 2 n = FnFn+1 ∀ n ∈ N where F1 = F2 = 1, Fn+2 = Fn+1 + Fn, n ≥ 1. (Hint: Think in terms of area of some rectangle) 4. Find all functions f : N → N such that f (n!) = (f (n))! and ∀ m ̸= n, m − n|f (m) − f (n). 5. Let {an} and {bn} be two sequences of positive integers such that a0, b0 ≥ 2 and an+1 = g.c.d(an, bn) + 1 and bn+1 = l.c.m(an, bn) − 1 Show that the sequence {an} is eventually periodic. 6. Prove that ∃ inﬁnitely many odd n ∈ N such that n! + 1 is composite. 7. Let S = {−100, −99, ..., 99, 100}. Let f, g : S → Z be two funtions. Prove that ∃ k ∈ Z such that the number of solutions (x, y) ∈ S × S to the equation f (x) − g(y) = k is odd. 8. Let a, b, c ≥ 0 and a + b + c ≥ 3. Prove that a4 + b3 + c2 ≥ a3 + b2 + c. (Hint: AM-GM) 9. For a positive integer n, we deﬁne ′height ′ of n to be S(n) n where S(n) is the sum of divisors of n. Show that given any two natural numbers N, k, ∃ k consecutive natural numbers such that ′height ′ of each of them is greater than N (You may use the fact that sum of reciprocals of primes diverges). (Hint: sum of reciprocals of primes ignoring the ﬁrst k primes must also diverge ∀ k; Chinese Remainder Theorem; P.S.: This is a tough problem) 10. Let P be an interior point of a triangle of area ∆. Through P, draw 3 lines parallel to the 3 sides partitioning the triangle into 3 smaller triangles and 3 parallelograms. Let the areas of the smaller triangles be a, b and c. Show that √∆ = √a + √b + √c. (Hint: a few constructions and then use similarity) 11. Modi and Mamata play a game of dividing a triangular cake between themselves. Modi chooses any point inside the triangle. Then, Mamata makes a straight cut passing through that point and chooses one of the two pieces. Find the proportion of the cake that each of the players can guarantee for himself/herself (each of them wants as much as possible). 12. Find all functions f : N → N such that f (a) + b|a2 + f (a)f (b) ∀ a, b ∈ N. (Hint: Focus on p and f (p) where p is a prime) 13. In ∆ABC, we have a2 + b2 + c2 = 1. Let ma, mb and mc denote the lengths of the medians passing through A, B and C respectively. Prove that a2 ma + b2 mb + c2 mc ≥ 2 (Hint: Apollonius’ Theorem; AM-GM) 14. Find all functions f : N → N such that (f (a) + b)(f (b) + a) is a perfect square ∀ a, b ∈ N (Hint: Try to show f (n) ̸= f (n + 1), f (n) ̸= f (n + 2); next show that f (n + 1) − f (n) = 1; P.S.:This is a tough problem) 15. Prove that every monic polynomial with real coeﬃcients of degree n can be expressed as average of two monic polynomials with real coeﬃcients of degree n each having n real roots. (Hint: Interpolation and Intermediate Value Theorem) 16. Let P be the set of primes. Find all functions f : P → P such that f (p) f (q) + qp = f (q) f (p) + pq holds ∀ p, q ∈ P. (Hint: Show that f (2) = 2; consider the function g(n) = 2n − n 2) 17. Every point in a plane is assigned some real number. It is found that for any triangle, the number at its incenter is the arithmetic mean of numbers at the vertices. Prove that every point has been assigned the same number. (Hint: Consider an isosceles trapezium) 18. Let n be a positive integer. Using combinatorial argument, show that n∑ i=0 n∑ j=0 (n + i + j)! n! i! j! 1 3i+j = 3 n (Hint: Bring 3n to the denominator of LHS, now think in terms of probability) 19. Show that there exists an inﬁnite set of points on X-Y plane indexed by ..., P−3, P−2, P−1, P0, P1, P2, P3, ... such that Pi, Pj and Pk are collinear if and only if i + j + k = 2020. 20. Let n ∈ N. We colour every lattice point on X-Y plane by one of n colours. Show that there exists a rectangle such that each of its four vertices are of same colour and its sides are parallel to the X and Y axes. 21. Let n ∈ N. We colour every positive integer by one of n colours. Show that there exist distinct positive integers a, b, c, d such that: (i) they are of same colour (ii) ad=bc (iii) b a is a power of 2 and c a is a power of 3 holds simultaneously. (Hint: Same as the previous problem) 22. Let f : Q + → R be a function such that f (x)f (y) ≥ f (xy) and f (x+y) ≥ f (x)+f (y) hold ∀x, y ∈ Q +. Furthermore, ∃ a ∈ Q+, a > 1 such that f (a) = a. Show that f (x) = x ∀ x ∈ Q +. (Hint: You may follow these steps: (1.) f (x) > 0 ∀x; (2.) ∃ arbitrarily small t with f (t) ≥ t; (3.) f (x) ≥ x ∀x ∈ Q + (4.) f (x) = x ∀x ≤ a (5.) f (x) = x ∀x P.S.: This is a tough problem) 23. Let (P1, P2, ..., P2n) be a permutation of the vertices of a regular 2n-gon. Show that among the line segments P1P2, P2P3, ..., P2nP1, there exist two which are parallel. (Hint: Suppose A1A2...A2n is the original polygon. What is the relation between i, j, k, l if AiAj is parallel to AkAl?) 24. Dolund has partitioned N into 2 classes: good or bad. Now, if his friend Vivekamunnon wants to know whether a particular natural number is good or bad, Dolund won’t directly tell him the answer. Instead, he will only answer questions of the form: ”W hat is the sum of all good divisors of n?” where n is any natural number. Show that, given any k < 10 6, Vivekamunnon can determine whether k is good or bad by asking at most 4 questions. (Hint: Use the fact that σ(n) is multiplicative; consider a few cases like: (1.) k is prime; (2.) k is a power of a prime; (3.) k has a least two distinct prime factors; Principle of Inclusion- Exclusion) 25. We call a function f : R → R Corona if f (x) + f (y) 2 ≥ f (x + y 2 ) + 2020 |x − y| holds ∀ x, y ∈ R. Prove that no Corona function exists. (Hint: Consider an A.P with 5 terms. Apply the given condition on the terms and arrive at a contradiction) Stay home, stay safe. Don’t die.","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
