A rather small part of this note has appeared in section 4.8 of this book, supple- mented with applications. What follows is the original note (slightly edited), focusing rather on variations and possible extensions of the Vornicu-Schur inequality than on applications. There are more such variations than you might think, and most of these are rarely applied because of their low renownedness. I hope that it will be a source of inspiration to …nd new results and new approaches to older inequalities. The Schur inequality, as well as some of its generalizations subsumed under the name \"Vornicu-Schur inequality\", are known to have some e¢ cient and unexpected applications to proving inequalities. Here we are going to discuss some known ideas in this …eld and some possible ways to proceed further. First a convention: In the following, we will use the sign P for cyclic sums. This means, in particular, that if a; b; c are three variables, and x; y; z are three variables \"corresponding\" to a; b; c; and if f is a function of six variables, then X f (a; b; c; x; y; z) = f (a; b; c; x; y; z) + f (b; c; a; y; z; x) + f (c; a; b; z; x; y) : For instance, X a b x2z = a b x2z + b c y2x + c az2y: 1. The Vornicu-Schur inequality There are di¤erent things referred to as Vornicu-Schur inequality; here is a possible collection of results: Theorem 1 (Vornicu-Schur inequality, more properly called Vornicu- Schur-Mildorf inequality, or just generalized Schur inequality). Let a; b; c be three reals, and let x; y; z be three nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds if one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y: b) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and z \u0000 y: c) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x + z \u0000 y: d) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ax \u0000 by: e) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and cz \u0000 by: f) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ax + cz \u0000 by: g) The reals x; y; z are sidelengths of a triangle. h) The reals x; y; z are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. 1 i) The reals ax; by; cz are sidelengths of a triangle. j) The reals ax; by; cz are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. k) There exists a convex function t : I ! R+; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; such that x = t (a) ; y = t (b) ; z = t (c) : Hereby, we denote by R+ the set of all nonnegative reals. Proof of Theorem 1. It is clear that Theorem 1 a) and b) follow from Theorem 1 c) (since each of the inequalities x \u0000 y and z \u0000 y yields x + z \u0000 y), and that Theorem 1 d) and e) follow from Theorem 1 f) (since each of the inequalities ax \u0000 by and cz \u0000 by implies ax + cz \u0000 by; as the reals a; b; c are nonnegative). Hence, we won’t have to give separate proofs for Theorem 1 a), b), d), e). c) Since a \u0000 b \u0000 0 and a \u0000 c \u0000 b \u0000 c (both because of a \u0000 b \u0000 c), we have x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 x (a \u0000 b) (b \u0000 c) = \u0000x (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) : Since c \u0000 a \u0000 b \u0000 a and c \u0000 b \u0000 0 (again since a \u0000 b \u0000 c), we have z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 z (b \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) = \u0000z (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) : Hence, x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 \u0000x (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) \u0000 z (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) = (y \u0000 (x + z)) (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) = ((x + z) \u0000 y) (b \u0000 c) (a \u0000 b) : Since (x + z) \u0000 y \u0000 0 (since x + z \u0000 y) and b \u0000 c \u0000 0 and a \u0000 b \u0000 0 (since a \u0000 b \u0000 c), it follows that x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0: This proves Theorem 1 c). f) Since the reals cz; by; ax are nonnegative and we have ab \u0000 ca \u0000 bc (since a \u0000 b \u0000 c) and cz + ax \u0000 by; we can apply Theorem 1 c) to the reals ab; ca; bc; cz; by; ax instead of a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively. We obtain cz (ab \u0000 ca) (ab \u0000 bc) + by (ca \u0000 bc) (ca \u0000 ab) + ax (bc \u0000 ab) (bc \u0000 ca) \u0000 0; or, equivalently, abcz (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) + abcy (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + abcx (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; or, equivalently, z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; and Theorem 1 f) is proven. g) This follows from Theorem 1 c), because we can WLOG assume that a \u0000 b \u0000 c and then have x + z \u0000 y by the triangle inequality, because x; y; z are the sidelengths of a triangle. Theorem 1 g) also follows from h) with a little work, but let us also give an independent proof for Theorem 1 g): Since x; y; z are the sidelengths of a triangle, by the triangle inequalities we have y + z > x; z + x > y; x + y > z; so that y + z \u0000 x > 0; 2 z + x \u0000 y > 0; x + y \u0000 z > 0: Thus, x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) = X x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) = X 1 2 ((z + x \u0000 y) + (x + y \u0000 z)) (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) = 1 2 \u0000X (z + x \u0000 y) (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + X (x + y \u0000 z) (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 = 1 2 \u0000X (y + z \u0000 x) (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) + X (y + z \u0000 x) (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) \u0000 = 1 2 X (y + z \u0000 x) ((c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) + (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a)) = 1 2 X (y + z \u0000 x) (b \u0000 c) 2 \u0000 0; and Theorem 1 g) is proven. h) We have to prove that u2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + v2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + w2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0; where u; v; w are the sidelengths of a triangle. Since u; v; w are the sidelengths of a triangle, the triangle inequality yields v < u+w; so that v2 < (u + w) 2 : We can WLOG assume that a \u0000 b \u0000 c; then, b \u0000 c \u0000 0 and b \u0000 a \u0000 0; so that (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) \u0000 0: Thus, v2 < (u + w) 2 becomes v2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) \u0000 (u + w) 2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) : Hence, u2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + v2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + w2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 u2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + (u + w) 2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + w2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) = u2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + \u0000u2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + 2uw (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + w2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) \u0000 + w2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) = u2 ((a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a)) + 2uw (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + w2 ((b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b)) = u2 (b \u0000 a) 2 + 2 \u0000 u (b \u0000 a) \u0000 w (b \u0000 c) + w2 (b \u0000 c) 2 = (u (b \u0000 a) + w (b \u0000 c)) 2 \u0000 0; and Theorem 1 h) is proven. i) Since the reals ax; by; cz are sidelengths of a triangle and therefore positive, and x; y; z are nonnegative, it follows that a; b; c are positive. Now, we can obtain Theorem 1 i) by applying Theorem 1 g) to the reals ab; ca; bc; cz; by; ax instead of a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively (the exact proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1 f)). j) Since the reals ax; by; cz are squares of the sidelengths of a triangle and therefore positive, and x; y; z are nonnegative, it follows that a; b; c are positive. Now, we can obtain Theorem 1 j) by applying Theorem 1 h) to the reals ab; ca; bc; cz; by; ax instead of a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively (the exact proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1 f)). k) If two of the reals a; b; c are equal, then everything is trivial, so we can assume that the reals a; b; c are pairwisely distinct. WLOG assume that a > b > c: Then, b \u0000 c > 0 and a \u0000 b > 0; and b = ba \u0000 bc a \u0000 c = (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c a \u0000 c = (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) : 3 Since b \u0000 c > 0 and a \u0000 b > 0; and since the function t is convex on the interval I containing the reals a; b; c; we have t (b) = t \u0000 (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) \u0000 \u0000 (b \u0000 c) t (a) + (a \u0000 b) t (c) (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) : But if we had t (b) > t (a) and t (b) > t (c) ; then we would have t (b) = (b \u0000 c) t (b) + (a \u0000 b) t (b) (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) > (b \u0000 c) t (a) + (a \u0000 b) t (c) (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) : Hence, the inequalities t (b) > t (a) and t (b) > t (c) cannot both hold; hence, either t (a) \u0000 t (b) or t (c) \u0000 t (b) : Since x = t (a) ; y = t (b) ; z = t (c) ; this becomes: Either x \u0000 y or z \u0000 y: If x \u0000 y; we can apply Theorem 1 a); if z \u0000 y; we can apply Theorem 1 b). Thus, Theorem 1 k) is proven. The Vornicu-Schur inequality is also called the generalized Schur inequality, since the actual Schur inequality easily follows from it: Theorem 2 (Schur inequality). a) Let a; b; c be three positive reals, and r a real. Then, the inequality ar (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + br (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + cr (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds. b) Let a; b; c be three reals, and r an even nonnegative integer. Then, the inequality ar (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + br (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + cr (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds. Proof of Theorem 2. a) We can WLOG assume that a \u0000 b \u0000 c: If r \u0000 0; then a \u0000 b yields ar \u0000 br; so the inequality in question follows from Theorem 1 a); if r \u0000 0; then b \u0000 c yields cr \u0000 br; so the inequality in question follows from Theorem 1 b). b) This follows from Theorem 1 k), applied to the convex function t : R ! R+ de…ned by t (u) = ur: The main strength of the Vornicu-Schur inequality is that the various criteria cover a lot of di¤erent cases. When you face a (true) inequality of the type P x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; chances are high that the terms x; y; z satisfy one of the criteria of Theorem 1. Even apparent curiousities like Theorem 1 h) can be of use: Exercise. Prove that for any three nonnegative reals a; b; c; we have \u0000b2 \u0000 c2\u00002 + \u0000c2 \u0000 a2\u00002 + \u0000a2 \u0000 b2\u00002 \u0000 4 (b \u0000 c) (c \u0000 a) (a \u0000 b) (a + b + c) : Hint. Rewrite this inequality in the form P (a + b) 2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0: Exercise. Prove that if a; b; c are sidelengths of a triangle, then a2b (a \u0000 b) + b2c (b \u0000 c) + c2a (c \u0000 a) \u0000 0: [This is IMO 1983 problem 6.] Hint. Rewrite this as P c (a + b \u0000 c) (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0: Now, this follows from Theorem 1 g) once it is shown that c (a + b \u0000 c) ; a (b + c \u0000 a) ; b (c + a \u0000 b) are the sidelengths of a triangle. Exercise. Prove that if a; b; c are sidelengths of a triangle, and t \u0000 1 is a real, then (t + 1) X a3b \u0000 X ab3 + tabc (a + b + c) : 4 Hint. This inequality was posted on MathLinks and received pretty ugly proofs. But we can do better: First, show that it is enough to prove it for t = 1; now, for t = 1; it becomes P b (b + a) (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; what follows from P b2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0 and P ba (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0: The …rst of these inequalities follows from Theorem 1 h); the second one is equivalent to P a2b (a \u0000 b) \u0000 0; what is the previous exercise. 2. A generalization with odd functions There is a simple generalization of parts a), b), c), g), k) of Theorem 1: Theorem 3. Let J \u0000 R be an interval, and let p : J ! R be an odd, monotonically increasing function such that p (t) \u0000 0 for all nonnegative t 2 J and p (t) \u0000 0 for all nonpositive t 2 J: Let a; b; c be three reals, and let x; y; z be three nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality x \u0000 p (a \u0000 b) \u0000 p (a \u0000 c) + y \u0000 p (b \u0000 c) \u0000 p (b \u0000 a) + z \u0000 p (c \u0000 a) \u0000 p (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds if the numbers a \u0000 b; a \u0000 c; b \u0000 c; b \u0000 a; c \u0000 a; c \u0000 b lie in the interval J and one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y: b) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and z \u0000 y: c) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x + z \u0000 y: d) The reals x; y; z are sidelengths of a triangle. e) There exists a convex function t : I ! R+; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; such that x = t (a) ; y = t (b) ; z = t (c) : The proof of this theorem is analogous to the proofs of the respective parts of Theorem 1 (for the proof of Theorem 3 d), we have to apply Theorem 3 c)). As a particular case of Theorem 3, the following result (due to Mildorf?) can be obtained: Theorem 4. Let k be a nonnegative integer. Let a; b; c be three reals, and let x; y; z be three nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality x (a \u0000 b) k (a \u0000 c) k + y (b \u0000 c) k (b \u0000 a) k + z (c \u0000 a) k (c \u0000 b) k \u0000 0 holds if one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y: b) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and z \u0000 y: c) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x + z \u0000 y: d) The reals x; y; z are sidelengths of a triangle. e) There exists a convex function t : I ! R+; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; such that x = t (a) ; y = t (b) ; z = t (c) : Proof of Theorem 4. If k is even, then k-th powers are always nonnegative and thus the inequality in question is obviously true. If k is odd, then the function p : R ! R de…ned by p (t) = t k is an odd, monotonically increasing function such that p (t) \u0000 0 for all nonnegative t 2 R and p (t) \u0000 0 for all nonpositive t 2 R: And thus, the assertion of Theorem 4 follows from Theorem 3. Exercise. a) For any triangle ABC; prove the inequality x sin A \u0000 B 2 sin A \u0000 C 2 + y sin B \u0000 C 2 sin B \u0000 A 2 + z sin C \u0000 A 2 sin C \u0000 B 2 \u0000 0 5 aa) for x = y = z = 1: ab) for x = sin A0; y = sin B0; z = sin C 0; where A0; B0; C 0 are the angles of another triangle A0B0C 0: ac) for x = sin A 2 ; y = sin B 2 ; z = sin C 2 : b) For an acute-angled triangle ABC; prove the inequality x sin (A \u0000 B) sin (A \u0000 C) + y sin (B \u0000 C) sin (B \u0000 A) + z sin (C \u0000 A) sin (C \u0000 B) \u0000 0 ba), bb), bc), for the same values of x; y; z as in a). bd) for x = cos A; y = cos B; z = cos C: c) Prove ba), bb), bc) not only for an acute-angled triangle ABC; but also for a triangle ABC all of whose angles are \u0000 120 \u0000: d) Create some more inequalities of this kind. 3. The convexity approach All the conditions given in Theorem 1 for the inequality P x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0 to hold are just su¢ cient, none of them is necessary. We could wonder how a necessary and su¢ cient condition looks like. The answer is given by the following result: Theorem 5. Let a; b; c; x; y; z be six reals. a) The inequality x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds if we can …nd a convex function u : I ! R; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; which satis…es x = (b \u0000 c) 2 u (a) ; y = (c \u0000 a) 2 u (b) ; z = (a \u0000 b) 2 u (c) : b) The inequality x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0 holds if we can …nd a concave function u : I ! R; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; which satis…es x = (b \u0000 c) 2 u (a) ; y = (c \u0000 a) 2 u (b) ; z = (a \u0000 b) 2 u (c) : c) If the reals a; b; c are pairwisely distinct, then the \"if\" in parts a) and b) can be replaced by \"if and only if\". Proof of Theorem 5. a) If two of the reals a; b; c are equal, then everything is trivial, so we can assume that the reals a; b; c are pairwisely distinct. We can WLOG assume that a > b > c: The inequality in question, P x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; rewrites as X (b \u0000 c) 2 u (a) \u0000 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0; what is equivalent to X (b \u0000 c) 2 u (a) \u0000 (\u0000 (a \u0000 b) (c \u0000 a)) \u0000 0; what is equivalent to \u0000 (b \u0000 c) (c \u0000 a) (a \u0000 b) \u0000 X (b \u0000 c) u (a) \u0000 0: Since a > b > c; we have b\u0000c > 0; c\u0000a < 0; a\u0000b > 0; so that \u0000 (b \u0000 c) (c \u0000 a) (a \u0000 b) > 0; so this inequality is equivalent to P (b \u0000 c) u (a) \u0000 0: Now, b = ba \u0000 bc a \u0000 c = (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c a \u0000 c = (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) : 6 Since b \u0000 c > 0 and a \u0000 b > 0; and since the function u is convex on the interval I containing the reals a; b; c; we have u (b) = u \u0000 (b \u0000 c) a + (a \u0000 b) c (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) \u0000 \u0000 (b \u0000 c) u (a) + (a \u0000 b) u (c) (b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b) ; so that (b \u0000 c) u (a) + (a \u0000 b) u (c) \u0000 ((b \u0000 c) + (a \u0000 b)) u (b) = \u0000 (c \u0000 a) u (b) ; so that (b \u0000 c) u (a) + (c \u0000 a) u (b) + (a \u0000 b) u (c) \u0000 0; or, equivalently, P (b \u0000 c) u (a) \u0000 0: Theorem 5 a) is proven. The proof of Theorem 5 b) is analogous to the proof of Theorem 5 a), and the proof of Theorem 5 c) is left to the reader. One of the consequences of Theorem 5 is: Theorem 6. Let a; b; c be three positive reals, and r a real. Then, for r \u0000 1 and for r \u0000 0 we have ar (b \u0000 c) 2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + br (c \u0000 a) 2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + cr (a \u0000 b) 2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0; while for 0 \u0000 r \u0000 1 we have ar (b \u0000 c) 2 (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + br (c \u0000 a) 2 (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + cr (a \u0000 b) 2 (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0: Proof of Theorem 6. Apply Theorem 5 to x = (b \u0000 c) 2 u (a) ; y = (c \u0000 a) 2 u (b) ; z = (a \u0000 b) 2 u (c) ; where u : R+! R+ is the function de…ned by u (t) = t r: For r \u0000 1 and for r \u0000 0; the function u is convex, so we can apply Theorem 5 a); for 0 \u0000 r \u0000 1; the function u is concave and we must apply Theorem 5 b). Note that Theorem 6 for r \u0000 0 has been stated by Spanferkel on MathLinks. 4. Vornicu-Schur and SOS In the proof of Theorem 1 g), we noticed the identity X x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) = 1 2 X (y + z \u0000 x) (b \u0000 c) 2 : This identity relates the Vornicu-Schur inequality to the SOS principle. Indeed, The- orems 1 a), b), c), g) can be easily proven using SOS with this identity. Therefore, a number of proofs done using Vornicu-Schur can be rewritten using SOS, and vice versa. Exercise. Prove using Theorem 1 c) (though this is overkill) the following inequal- ity: If a; b; c; x; y; z are six nonnegative reals satisfying a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y \u0000 z; then x (b \u0000 c) 2 (b + c \u0000 a) + y (c \u0000 a) 2 (c + a \u0000 b) + z (a \u0000 b) 2 (a + b \u0000 c) \u0000 0: 5. One more degree of freedom 7 Here is an example of how certain criteria for P x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0 can be ex- tended to more free parameters: Theorem 7. Let a; b; c; x; y; z be six nonnegative reals, and u and v two reals. a) If u \u0000 1 and v \u0000 1; and the number arrays (a; b; c) and (x; y; z) are equally sorted, then x (a \u0000 ub) (a \u0000 vc) + y (b \u0000 uc) (b \u0000 va) + z (c \u0000 ua) (c \u0000 vb) \u0000 0: b) If u \u0000 1 and v \u0000 1; and the number arrays (a; b; c) and (x; y; z) are oppositely sorted, then x (a \u0000 ub) (a \u0000 vc) + y (b \u0000 uc) (b \u0000 va) + z (c \u0000 ua) (c \u0000 vb) \u0000 0: Proof of Theorem 7. a) We have to prove that P x (a \u0000 ub) (a \u0000 vc) \u0000 0: Since u \u0000 1; we have u = 1 \u0000 U for some real U \u0000 0; and similarly v = 1 \u0000 V for some real V \u0000 0: Thus, X x (a \u0000 ub) (a \u0000 vc) = X x (a \u0000 (1 \u0000 U ) b) (a \u0000 (1 \u0000 V ) c) = X x ((a \u0000 b) + U b) ((a \u0000 c) + V c) = X (x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + x (a \u0000 b) V c + xU b (a \u0000 c) + xU bV c) = X (x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + V x (a \u0000 b) c + U x (a \u0000 c) b + U V xbc) = X x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + V X x (a \u0000 b) c + U X x (a \u0000 c) b + U V X xbc: Since the number arrays (a; b; c) and (x; y; z) are equally sorted, we can WLOG as- sume that a \u0000 b \u0000 c and then have x \u0000 y; so that Theorem 1 a) yields P x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) \u0000 0: Also, trivially, P xbc \u0000 0: Hence, in order to prove that P x (a \u0000 ub) (a \u0000 vc) \u0000 0; it will be enough to show that P x (a \u0000 b) c \u0000 0 and P x (a \u0000 c) b \u0000 0: ButP x (a \u0000 b) c = P x (ca \u0000 bc) = P x\u0000ca\u0000P x\u0000bc \u0000 0; because P x\u0000ca \u0000 P x\u0000bc by the rearrangement inequality (in fact, since the number arrays (a; b; c) and (x; y; z) are equally sorted, and the number arrays (a; b; c) and (bc; ca; ab) are oppositely sorted, it follows that the number arrays (bc; ca; ab) and (x; y; z) are oppositely sorted, so that P x \u0000 ca \u0000 P x \u0000 bc). Similarly, P x (a \u0000 c) b \u0000 0: Hence, the proof of Theorem 7 a) is complete. The proof of Theorem 7 b) is analogous. Note that about certain particular cases, more can be said: Exercise. If a; b; c are three nonnegative reals, and k a real, then prove that (a \u0000 kb) (a \u0000 kc) a + (b \u0000 kc) (b \u0000 ka) b + (c \u0000 ka) (c \u0000 kb) c \u0000 0: 6. More variables? A very natural question to ask is whether the Vornicu-Schur inequality (with any of its criteria) can be extended to more than three variables. Few is known about this yet. The …rst result of this kind is probably problem 1 of the IMO 1971: Exercise. a) Let n be a positive integer. Show that the inequality nX i=1 Y 1\u0000j\u0000n; j6=i (ai \u0000 aj) \u0000 0 8 holds for every n reals a1; a2; :::; an if and only if n = 2; n = 3 or n = 5: b) Why doesn’t this change if we replace \"reals\" by \"positive reals\"? Apart from this, I have not seen any notable success in extending Vornicu-Schur to several variables. Any new result would be a considerable progress here, since there are few methods known to prove inequalities for several variables and a generalized Schur inequality will be a new one. 7. Sum \u0000 Sum \u0000 Sum \u0000 Sum inequalities Here is a quite useful consequence of Theorem 1: Theorem 8. Let a; b; c be three reals, and let x; y; z be three nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality (azx + bxy + cyz) (axy + byz + czx) \u0000 (yz + zx + xy) (bcyz + cazx + abxy) holds if one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y: b) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and z \u0000 y: c) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x + z \u0000 y: d) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ax \u0000 by: e) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and cz \u0000 by: f) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ax + cz \u0000 by: g) The reals x; y; z are sidelengths of a triangle. h) The reals x; y; z are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. i) The reals ax; by; cz are sidelengths of a triangle. j) The reals ax; by; cz are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. k) There exists a convex function t : I ! R+; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; such that x = t (a) ; y = t (b) ; z = t (c) : Proof of Theorem 8. According to Theorem 1, each of the conditions a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) yields x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b) \u0000 0: Now, (azx + bxy + cyz) (axy + byz + czx) \u0000 (yz + zx + xy) (bcyz + cazx + abxy) = X azx \u0000 axy + X azx \u0000 byz + X azx \u0000 czx \u0000 X yz \u0000 bcyz \u0000 X yz \u0000 cazx \u0000 X yz \u0000 abxy = xyz X xa2 + xyz X zab + X z2x2ca \u0000 X y2z2bc \u0000 xyz X zca \u0000 xyz X yab = xyz X xa2 + xyz X xbc + X y2z2bc \u0000 X y2z2bc \u0000 xyz X xab \u0000 xyz X xca = xyz X \u0000xa2 + xbc \u0000 xab \u0000 xca \u0000 = xyz X x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) = xyz |{z} \u00000; since x; y; z are nonnegative (x (a \u0000 b) (a \u0000 c) + y (b \u0000 c) (b \u0000 a) + z (c \u0000 a) (c \u0000 b)) | {z } \u00000 ; and thus (azx + bxy + cyz) (axy + byz + czx) \u0000 (yz + zx + xy) (bcyz + cazx + abxy) : 9 This proves Theorem 8. Often, Theorem 8 is easier to apply in the following form: Theorem 9. Let a; b; c be three reals, and let x; y; z be three nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality (ay + bz + cx) (az + bx + cy) \u0000 (x + y + z) (xbc + yca + zab) holds if one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and x \u0000 y: b) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and z \u0000 y: c) We have a \u0000 b \u0000 c and yz + xy \u0000 zx: d) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ay \u0000 bx: e) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and cy \u0000 bz: f) The reals a; b; c are nonnegative and satisfy a \u0000 b \u0000 c and ayz + cxy \u0000 bzx: g) The reals yz; zx; xy are sidelengths of a triangle. h) The reals yz; zx; xy are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. i) The reals ayz; bzx; cxy are sidelengths of a triangle. j) The reals ayz; bzx; cxy are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. k) There exists a convex function t : I ! R+; where I is an interval containing the reals a; b; c; such that yz = t (a) ; zx = t (b) ; xy = t (c) : Proof of Theorem 9. The conditions a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) of Theorem 9 are equivalent to the conditions a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) of Theorem 8 for the reals yz; zx; xy instead of x; y; z: Hence, if one of the conditions a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) of Theorem 9 is ful…lled, then we can apply Theorem 8 to the reals yz; zx; xy instead of x; y; z; and we obtain (a \u0000 xy \u0000 yz + b \u0000 yz \u0000 zx + c \u0000 zx \u0000 xy) (a \u0000 yz \u0000 zx + b \u0000 zx \u0000 xy + c \u0000 xy \u0000 yz) \u0000 (zx \u0000 xy + xy \u0000 yz + yz \u0000 zx) (bc \u0000 zx \u0000 xy + ca \u0000 xy \u0000 yz + ab \u0000 yz \u0000 zx) : This simpli…es to x2y2z2 (ay + bz + cx) (az + bx + cy) \u0000 x2y2z2 (x + y + z) (xbc + yca + zab) : Hence, we obtain (ay + bz + cx) (az + bx + cy) \u0000 (x + y + z) (xbc + yca + zab) unless one of the reals x; y; z is 0: However, in the case when one of the reals x; y; z is 0; Theorem 9 is pretty easy to prove. Thus, Theorem 9 is completely proven. Another useful corollary of Theorem 8 is: Theorem 10. Let a; b; c; x; y; z be six nonnegative reals. Then, the inequality (ay + bz + cx) (az + bx + cy) \u0000 (yz + zx + xy) (bc + ca + ab) holds if one of the following (su¢ cient) conditions is ful…lled: a) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and x \u0000 y: b) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and z \u0000 y: c) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and x + z \u0000 y: 10 d) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and a \u0000 b: e) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and c \u0000 b: f) We have x a \u0000 y b \u0000 z c and a + c \u0000 b: g) The reals x; y; z are sidelengths of a triangle. h) The reals x; y; z are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. i) The reals a; b; c are sidelengths of a triangle. j) The reals a; b; c are the squares of the sidelengths of a triangle. Proof of Theorem 10. Applying Theorem 8 to the nonnegative reals x a ; y b ; z c ; a; b; c instead of a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively, we see that, if these reals x a ; y b ; z c ; a; b; c satisfy one of the conditions a), b), c), d), e), f), g), h), i), j), k) of Theorem 8, the inequality \u0000 x a ca + y b ab + z c bc\u0000 \u0000 x a ab + y b bc + z c ca\u0000 \u0000 (bc + ca + ab) \u0000 y b \u0000 z c \u0000 bc + z c \u0000 x a \u0000 ca + x a \u0000 y b \u0000 ab\u0000 holds. This inequality simpli…es to (ay + bz + cx) (az + bx + cy) \u0000 (yz + zx + xy) (bc + ca + ab) : This is exactly the inequality claimed by Theorem 10. Now, the conditions a), b), c), g), h) of Theorem 8, applied to the nonnegative reals x a ; y b ; z c ; a; b; c instead of a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively, are equivalent to the conditions d), e), f), i), j) of Theorem 10 for the reals a; b; c; x; y; z: Hence, Theorem 10 d), e), f), i), j) is proven. In order to prove Theorem 10 a), b), c), g), h), we apply Theorem 10 e), d), f), i), j) to the nonnegative reals z; y; x; c; b; a instead of the reals a; b; c; x; y; z; respectively. Thus, Theorem 10 is completely proven. Exercise. Prove that, if we replace \"six nonnegative reals\" by \"six reals\" in The- orem 10, then Theorem 10 g), h), i), j) will still remain true.
