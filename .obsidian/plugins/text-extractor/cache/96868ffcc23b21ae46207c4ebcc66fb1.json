Construct a polynomial f (x) = a0 + a1x + . . . + anxn where a0, a1, . . . , an are all integers such that f (i + ω) = 0. 2. Let a be a ﬁxed real number. Consider the equation (x + 2)2(x + 7)2 + a = 0, x ∈ R, where R is the set of real numbers. For what values of a, will the equation have exactly one double-root? 3. Let A and B be variable points on x-axis and y-axis respectively such that the line segment AB is in the ﬁrst quadrant and of a ﬁxed length 2d. Let C be the mid-point of AB and P be a point such that (a) P and the origin are on the opposite sides of AB and, (b) P C is a line segment of length d which is perpendicular to AB. Find the locus of P . 4. Let a real-valued sequence {xn}n≥1 be such that lim n→∞ nxn = 0. Find all possible real values of t such that limn→∞ xn(log n)t = 0. 5. Prove that the largest pentagon (in terms of area) that can be inscribed in a circle of radius 1 is regular (i.e., has equal sides). 6. Prove that the family of curves x2 a2 + λ + y2 b2 + λ = 1 satisﬁes dy dx (a 2 − b 2) = (x + y dy dx ) (x dy dx − y). 1 7. Consider a right-angled triangle with integer-valued sides a < b < c where a, b, c are pairwise co-prime. Let d = c − b. Suppose d divides a. Then (a) Prove that d ≤ 2. (b) Find all such triangles (i.e. all possible triplets a, b, c) with perime- ter less than 100. 8. A ﬁnite sequence of numbers (a1, . . . , an) is said to be alternating if a1 > a2, a2 < a3, a3 > a4, a4 < a5, . . . . or a1 < a2, a2 > a3, a3 < a4, a4 > a5, . . . .
