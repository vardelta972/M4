How many 6 digit numbers are there with at least one odd digit? Solution: The no. of 6 digit numbers are there with at least one odd digit is the total no. of 6 digit numbers - the no. of 6 digit numbers with only even digits. The total no. of 6 digit numbers = = . The no. of 6 digit numbers with only even digits = = Therefore, the required counting will be - = . Problem 2. Suppose that 3 students of class I, 4 students of class II and 5 students of class III sit in a row. In how many ways can they sit such that students of the same class are sitting together? Solution: If the students of same class are to be seated together, then essentially we would have 3 blocks, one for each class. Now the ordering of these blocks can be done in 3! ways and within the blocks, we can also permute the students of that class. Hence the required count will be 3! 3! 4! 5!. (Here blue corresponds to the permutations within the blocks and red corresponds to the permutation of the blocks.) Problem 3. In how many ways can one move from A (0, 0) to B (6, 4) if he is allowed to move only one step to the right or one step upwards at every move ? (One sample path is shown in red below.) Solution: What are the common characteristics of all such paths? Some of you told me that they all have 10 steps. Can we be a little more precise? All these paths have 6 right steps and 4 up steps. Thus, each path is essentially a permutation of 6 R’s and 4 U’s. For example, the path shown in the above ﬁgure can be coded as: R R R R U U U R U R. Thus, the number of paths is essentially the number of permutations of 6 R’s and 4 U’s. The no. of such permutations is (see below). 9 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 × 10 9 × 10 5 4 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 4 × 5 5 . 9 × 10 5 4 × 5 5 887500 × × × 10 C 4 Page of 1 4 In how many ways can we permute 6 R’s and 4 U’s? One way of thinking: Among the 10 places in total, we can select 4 places (which can be in ways) to put the 4 U’s and then the remaining 6 places will be ﬁlled up by the 6 R’s. Therefore the no. of such permutations is . Another way of thinking: Among the 10 places in total, we can select 6 places (which can be in ways) to put the 6 R’s and then the remaining 4 places will be ﬁlled up by the 4 U’s. Therefore the no. of such permutations is . This does not contradict the above, because = 10!/6!4! = . Problem 4. In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘RUSSEL’? Solution: If the two S’s were different, then the number of permutations would have been 6!. But here USLSER and USLSER are the same. In a similar manner, for any ﬁxed permutation of RUSSEL, we can reshuffle the two S’s, yielding the same permutation (but they would have been different had the two S’s were different). Hence, the actual number of permutations should be 6!/2. Problem 5. In how many ways can you permute the letters of ‘honeybee’? Solution: If the three e’s were different, then the number of permutations would have been 8!. But here the three e’s are same, so permuting them results in no new permutation. Thus, every permutation with 3 identical e’s correspond to 3! many permutations with 3 distinct e’s. Hence, the actual number of permutations should be 8!/3!. Problem 6. (a) In how many ways can you permute the letters of ‘RUSSELL’? Solution: If the two S’s and the two L’s were different, then the number of permutations would have been 7!. But here we have two identical S’s and two identical L’s. Hence we have to divide by 2! and 2!, giving the no. of permutations to be = 7!/2!2!. (b) In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘RUSSELL’ such that the two S’s are not adjacent? Solution: It equals the total no. of permutations (which is 7!/2!2!) minus the no. of permutations where the two S’s are adjacent. If the two S’s are to be adjacent we can consider the ‘SS’ as one block, hence the no. of permutations where the two S’s are adjacent is given by = no. of permutations of (R,U,SS,E,L,L) = 6!/2!. Hence the number of permutations of the letters of the word ‘RUSSELL’ such that the two S’s are not adjacent is given by = 7!/2!2! - 6!/2!. 10 C 4 10 C 4 10 C 6 10 C 6 10 C 4 10 C 6 Page of 2 4 (c) In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘RUSSELL’ such that the two L’s are not adjacent? Solution: Same as above (part (b)). (d) In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘RUSSELL’ such that the two L’s are not adjacent and the two S’s are not adjacent? Solution: This would be given by the total no. of permutations - the no. of permutations containing SS - the no. of permutations containing LL + the no. of permutations where SS and LL are both present = 7!/2!2! - 6!/2! - 6!/2! + 5!. (The last one is calculated in this way: no. of permutations of {R, U, SS, E, LL}, which is 5!.) (e) In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘RUSSELL’ such that no two among the L’s and S’s are adjacent (i.e., no SS, SL, LS, or LL)? Solution: Here S, S, L, L must be placed between the gaps around R, U, and E. First place the letters R, U, E, which can be done in 3! ways. After placing R, U, and E, we can place the two S’s and the two L’s in 4!/2!2! ways. Ans: 3! = 36. Another way of doing the last part: __ R __ U __ E __ 4 gaps, choose two, where S’s will be placed and in remaining two L’s will be placed, so this can be done in 4C2 ways. Problem 7. In how many ways can you permute the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, F, G, G, such that no two among F’s and G’s are adjacent? Solution: A, B, C, D, E, F, F, G, G __ A __ B __ C __ D __ E __ 5! . Problem 8. Suppose you go to a shop to buy 5 ice-cream cups. The shop has ice- cream cups of 3 ﬂavours, say {Chocolate, Mango, Vanilla}. In how many ways can you buy 5 ice-cream cups? Note that the cups of same ﬂavour are identical. Solution: Note that once we ﬁx the combination to be chosen, the ice-creams of that combination can be bought in only one way. For example, the no. of ways we can buy the combination {M, M, V, V, C} is just 1. So only what matters is the composition, i.e., how many ice-creams of each ﬂavour are to be chosen. Now we shall ﬁnd the total number of such composition. Suppose that the number of ice-creams of ﬂavours Mango, Chocolate and Vanilla are x, y, and z, respectively. Then all we need to ﬁnd is the number of non-negative integer × 4 C 2 → → × 6 C 2 × 4 C 2 Page of 3 4 solutions to the equation x + y + z = 5. (Each solution correspond to a unique composition.) How to ﬁnd the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation x + y + z = 5? Each solution can be represented as a permutation of 2 sticks and 5 balls, as shown below. Conversely, each permutation of 2 sticks and 5 balls give us a valid solution (also shown above). Thus the number of solutions equals the number of ways to permute 2 sticks and 5 ones, which is given by = 7!/2!5!, because among 7 empty places, we have to choose 2 places to put the sticks and the remaining 5 places would be ﬁlled up by the balls. Hence the number of ways to buy 5 ice- creams from the shop is given by = 7 6/2 = 21. Here are some problems that you must try at home: P1. There are 8 CCTV cameras in a shop. Find the number of ON-OFF patterns of the cameras if at least three cameras have to be ON all the times. P2. In how many ways can you permute the letters of the word ‘MISSISSIPPI’? In how many of them no two S’s are adjacent? P3. Find the number of 6-digit natural numbers whose digits are chosen from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and each digit (that appears) appears at least twice. For instance, 123213, 111144 are valid, but 111223 is not. P4. Suppose 5 friends go to a shop to buy ice-cream cups. The shop has ice- cream cups of 4 ﬂavours, say {Chocolate, Mango, Vanilla, Strawberry}. In how many ways can they buy 5 ice-cream cups (1 for each)? Note that the cups of same ﬂavour are identical.
