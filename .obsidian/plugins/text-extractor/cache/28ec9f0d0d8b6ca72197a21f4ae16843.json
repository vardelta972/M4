Hmm this is pretty tricky and I wish I actually knew what it meant but here is an application anyway. (Adapted from Gabriel Dospinescu, 2010 MR U160). Let p be a prime and let n, s be positive integers. Prove that vp   ∑ p|k,0≤k≤n(−1)kks(n k )   ≥ vp(n!). hf dkal; f Solution: Let the sum be S. Then by a roots of unity ﬁlter and the Stirling number representation of ks (deﬁne 00 = (0 0 ) = 1), pS = p−1∑ j=0 n∑ k=0 (n k ) ks(−ωj)k = p−1∑ j=0 n∑ k=0 (n k ) (−ωj) k s∑ ℓ=0 S(s, ℓ) (k ℓ )ℓ! = p−1∑ j=0 min(s,n)∑ ℓ=0 S(s, ℓ)ℓ! n∑ k=0 ( k ℓ )(n k )(−ωj)k = p−1∑ j=0 min(s,n)∑ ℓ=0 S(s, ℓ)ℓ! (n ℓ ) n∑ k=ℓ ( n − ℓ k − ℓ )(−ωj)k = p−1∑ j=0 min(s,n)∑ ℓ=0 S(s, ℓ)ℓ! (n ℓ ) (−ωj)ℓ(1 − ωj)n−ℓ. If j = 0 and ℓ < n, then we get a zero term. Also, if s ≥ n, then from the ℓ = n terms we get n! p−1∑ j=0(−ωj) n = pn!(−1)n[p|n], which is a multiple of p1+vp(n!). Thus it suﬃces to show that for 1 ≤ j ≤ p − 1, vp (ℓ! (n ℓ ) (1 − ωj) n−ℓ) > vp(n!) for all 0 ≤ ℓ ≤ min(s, n − 1). But using the extension of vp to the ring of algebraic numbers ¯Q (i.e. vp(x) = 1 d vp(f (0)), where f is the minimal polynomial of x), the LHS is just vp(n!) − n − ℓ − sp(n − ℓ) p − 1 + n − ℓ p − 1 > vp(n!), 1 Victor Wang Interesting arguments, ideas so we’re done (note that n − ℓ ≥ 1 =⇒ sp(n − ℓ) > 0 in this case).[/hide] Edit: Two more applications (also from PFTB)! (Gabriel Dospinescu). Let p > 2 be a prime number and let m and n be multiples of p, with n odd. For any function f : {1, 2, . . . , m} → {1, 2, . . . , n} satisfying ∑m k=1 f (k) ≡ 0 (mod p), consider the product ∏m k=1 f (k). Prove that the sum of these products is divisible by ( n p )m. (Yes, we can strengthen it easily.) (St. Petersburg 2003). Let p be a prime and let n ≥ p and a1, a2, . . . , an be integers. Deﬁne f0 = 1 and fk the number of subsets B ⊆ {1, 2, . . . , n} having k elements and such that p divides ∑ i∈B ai. Show that f0 − f1 + f2 − · · · + (−1) nfn is a multiple of p. 2. (MathOverﬂow, July 2012) By Newton interpolation (or other standard methods), one can easily determine the number and structure (the latter to a lesser extent) of sequences (a1, a2, . . . , an) (mod n) represented by integer polynomials given the prime factorization of n (note that we can reduce to the prime power case by the Chinese remainder theorem). For instance, see this AoPS thread. However, for such f ∈ Z[x] we have strong restrictions like u − v | f (u) − f (v) for integers u, v. IMO it’s then natural to wonder about (e.g. the new structure of valid f ) for rational polynomials in general, where standard interpolation methods (in certain mods) aren’t as clean. (Mostly copied from my comment below.) To this end, consider a pair of positive integers (n, m) with n, m > 1 such that for every sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ) n, there exists an integer-valued polynomial f ∈ Q[x] satisifying f (x) ≡ ai (mod m) whenever x ≡ i (mod n). First, it is easy to show that n, m must be powers of the same prime. Indeed, if there exist distinct primes p, q such that p | n and q | m, then for some suﬃciently large integer ℓ, we have q | f (x+n)−f (x) and q | f (x + qℓ) − f (x) for every x. But gcd(n, qℓ) | n/p, so by Bzout’s identity, q | f (x + n/p) − f (x) for all x and thus the ai(n/p) must all be congruent (mod q) in order for f to exist. On the other hand, if n = p i and m = pj for some prime p and positive integers i, j, then given a sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an), consider the polynomial g(x) = ∑n k=1 akxk. By a simple induction on d ≥ 0, we can show (using ﬁnite diﬀerences) that a degree d polynomial f (for convenience, say deg 0 = −1) satisfying the desired properties exists iﬀ d is the smallest number such that the division of (x − 1)d+1g(x) by x n − 1 gives a remainder r(x) with coeﬃcients all divisible by m (call d + 1 the *order* of the sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an), so the all-zero sequence has order 0). Since (x − 1)n = xn − 1 in Fp, we have (x − 1) jn = (xn − 1)u(x) + pjv(x) for some polynomials u, v with integer coeﬃcients, so the order of any sequence is ﬁnite and at most jn. However, this leads to the following two questions: ¿ 1. For ﬁxed p, i, j, what is the maximum possible order M of a sequence (a1, a2, . . . , an) ∈ (Z/mZ) n? (Resolved in the update.) ¿ 2. How many sequences are there of order r, where r ∈ [0, M ] is a ﬁxed integer? ¿ 3. Is there a reasonably nice way to describe the sequences of a ﬁxed order r (possibly in terms of one of the corresponding polynomials f, g)? Looking at small cases, it seems that the answer to 1 should be pi + (j − 1)ϕ(pi), where ϕ denotes Euler’s totient function. **Update:** OK, I think I have a (messy) proof that the answer to question 1 is indeed p i +(j −1)ϕ(p i), but it doesn’t seem to lend itself to 2 or 3 in any way. Fix p, i. First note that since (x − 1)pk = xpk − 1 (in Fp) for k = i and k = i − 1, we have (x − 1)ϕ(pi) = Φpi(x) in Fp as well, so (x − 1)ϕ(pi) = Φpi(x) + pT (x) for some integer polynomial T of degree at most ϕ(pi) − 1, where Φt denotes the tth cyclotomic polynomial. Observe that T (1) = −1, so 1 is not a root of T in Fp. Using this key fact, we will induct on j ≥ 1 to construct a sequence of integer polynomials Pj, Qj such that (x − 1)pi+(j−1)ϕ(pi) = (xpi − 1)Pj(x) + pj(x − 1)Qj(x), 2 Victor Wang Interesting arguments, ideas vp(Qj(1)) = i − 1, and in Fp, (x − 1) pi−1−1∥Qj(x) (i.e. 1 is a root of multiplicity pi−1 − 1). For j = 1, we simply take P1(x) = 1 and Q1(x) = (x−1)pi −(xpi −1) p(x−1) , where clearly Q1(1) = −p i−1 =⇒ vp(Q1(1)) = i − 1. Showing (x − 1) pi−1−1∥Qj(x) is slightly harder, but not too bad. It’s easy to show by counting prime factors that (pi k ) is divisible by p for all 1 ≤ k ≤ pi − 1 and not divisible by p2 iﬀ p i−1 | k. Furthermore, by Babbage’s theorem we have ( pi kpi−1) ≡ (p k) (mod p 2) for 1 ≤ k ≤ p − 1. Hence for p = 2, we just need to show that (x − 1)pi−1∥xpi−1 − 1 in F2, which is obvious; for p > 2 odd, we need to show (x − 1) pi−1∥ p−1∑ k=1 x kpi−1 k = (p−1∑ k=1 xk k )pi−1 in Fp (note that kp = k by Fermat’s little theorem). But if h(x) = ∑p−1 k=1 xk k , then h(1) ≡ 0 (mod p) while h ′(1) ≡ p − 1 (mod p), so 1 is a simple root of h and we’re done with the base case. Now assuming the result for some j ≥ 1 (so that xpi−1 −1 x−1 | Qj(x) in Fp), we can write Qj(x) = xpi−1 −1 x−1 R(x) + pS(x) for two integer polynomials R, S with deg S < pi−1 − 1. (*) Then (x − 1) pi+jϕ(pi) = (x − 1)pi+(j−1)ϕ(pi)(x − 1)ϕ(pi) can be written as (xpi − 1)Pj(x)(x − 1)ϕ(pi) + pj+1(x − 1)T (x)Qj(x) + pjΦpi(x)(x − 1)Qj(x) or equivalently after substitution, (xpi − 1)(Pj(x)(x − 1)ϕ(pi) + p jR(x)) + p j+1(S(x)Φpi(x) + T (x)Qj(x)), so we can take Pj+1(x) = Pj(x)(x − 1)ϕ(pi) + p jR(x) and Qj+1(x) = S(x)Φpi(x) + T (x)Qj(x). As (x − 1)pi−1 | (x − 1) ϕ(pi) = Φpi(x) in Fp and T (1) = −1, we see that (x − 1)pi−1−1∥Qj+1(x). It remains to show that vp(Qj+1(1)) = i − 1. By (*) and the deﬁnition of Qj+1, we ﬁnd Qj+1(1) = Φpi(1)S(1)+T (1)Qj(1) = pS(1)−Qj(1) = −p i−1R(1), so vp(Qj+1(1)) ≥ i−1. However, if pi | Qj+1(1), then p | R(1), so writing (*) in Fp we have Qj(x) = (x − 1)p i−1−1R(x). But then (x − 1) pi−1 | Qj(x), contradicting our inductive hypothesis. Thus our induction is complete. Clearly this construction shows that the order of any sequence is at most M = pi + (j − 1)ϕ(p i). On the other hand, it is easy to show that the order of (1, 0, . . . , 0) is M . Indeed, note that g(x) = x for this sequence, and suppose x(x − 1) M −1/(xpi − 1) leaves a remainder with coeﬃcients all divisible by p j. From the induction statement, we have (x − 1)M −1 = xpi − 1 x − 1 Pj(x) + pjQj(x), so writing Pj(x) = (x − 1)U (x) + V for an integer V , we get pj | V . But then plugging in 1 to this equation, 0 = (0)U (1) + (pi)V + p jQj(1), whence pi | Qj(1), contradiction. 3 Victor Wang Interesting arguments, ideas 3. (Classical umbral calculus) Using linear operators, one can deal with recurrences more easily. This is a powerful idea, for instance, when computing recurrences mod prime powers. For instance, we can apply this to the Touchard polynomials Tn(x) = ∑n k=1 S(n, k)xk, using the identity Tn+1(x) = x ∑n k=0 (n k)Tk(x) and deﬁning the linear operator L(xn) = Tn(x). We can, of course, set particular values of x, e.g. ±1 for the Bell and Uppuluri-Carpenter numbers, respectively. Then using the Frobenius endomorphism we can get some nice recurrences. This also applies to linear recurrences, e.g. for any starting values, an = an−1 + an−p has period dividing p2 − 1. However, this can also be done with generating functions, noting that the sequence must be purely periodic. 4.
