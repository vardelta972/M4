Sequences (an), (bn), (cn), and (dn) satisfy the following conditions: an+1 = an + bn, bn+1 = bn + cn, cn+1 = cn + dn, dn+1 = dn + an, for n = 1, 2, . . .. If the sequences are periodic1, prove that a2 = b2 = c2 = d2 = 0. 2. Let m, n be positive integers. Show that the number of positive integers x such that n∑ i=1 ⌊ x 2i ⌋ = x − m is at most 2n. 3. In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD with AB = AD, points M, N lie on the sides BC and CD respectively so that BM + N D = M N . Lines AM and AN meet the circumcircle of ABCD again at points P and Q respectively. Prove that the orthocenter of the triangle AP Q lies on the segment M N . 4. Let n ≥ 3 be an odd integer. Amy has coloured the squares in an n × n grid white and black. We will call a sequence of squares S1, S2, . . . , Sm a “path” if all these squares are the same colour, if Si and Si+1 share an edge for all i ∈ {1, 2, . . . , m − 1}, and if no other squares in the sequence share an edge. Prove that if both the white squares and black squares form a single path, then one of these paths must begin or end at the center of the grid. For example, the grid on the left is a valid colouring, but the other two are invalid. In the middle grid, the white squares loop back and touch themselves, and in the right grid, the black squares are disconnected. 1A sequence (tn) is said to be “periodic” if there exists a positive integer p for which tn+p = tp for all n. 1 of 5 Winter Camp 2011 Mock Olympiad Solutions 2 Solutions 1. If a sequences (tn) is periodic, note that |tn| must be upper-bounded by some constant2. Speciﬁcally, if the sequence has period p, then an ∈ {a1, a2, . . . , ap} for all n, and hence |an| ≤ max(a1, a2, . . . , ap). In our case, this means the sequence (an + bn + cn + dn) is bounded (since (an), (bn), (cn), and (dn) are all bounded). Substituting the given recurrence in for n ≥ 1, we have an+1 + bn+1 + cn+1 + dn+1 = 2(an + bn + cn + dn). To prevent |an + bn + cn + dn| from getting arbitrarily large, an + bn + cn + dn must be 0 for all n. If n ≥ 2, we then have: an+2 = an+1 + bn+1 = an + 2bn + cn = an−1 + 3bn−1 + 3cn−1 + dn−1 = 2bn−1 + 2cn−1 = 2bn. Similarly bn+2 = 2cn, cn+2 = dn, and dn+2 = 2an. Therefore, an+8 = 2bn+6 = 4cn+4 = 8dn+2 = 16an, and so |an| will become arbitrarily large unless a2 = 0. Thus, a2 = 0. The same reasoning also implies b2 = c2 = d2 = 0. Source: Yugoslavia 1992. 2. Let f (x) = x − ∑n i=1 ⌊ x 2i ⌋. Any integer x can be written uniquely in the form a · 2n + b for non-negative integers a, b with b < 2n, Using this notation, we have: f (x) = f (a · 2n + b) = a · 2 n + b − n∑ i=1 ⌊ a · 2n + b 2i ⌋ = a · 2 n + b − n∑ i=1 a · 2n−i − n∑ i=1 ⌊ b 2i ⌋ = a · 2 n + f (b) − n∑ i=1 a · 2n−i = a + f (b). Now ﬁx a positive integer m. For any b, there is at most one a such that f (x) = a + f (b) = m. Since there are only 2n legal values of b, there are at most 2n values of x for which f (x) = m. Comment: You can think of ⌊ x 2i ⌋ as stripping oﬀ the last i binary digits from x. Given this, it is natural to consider a binary representation of x. The main insight is to group the last n digits, and handle everything else separately. Source: Adapted from Iran 2008. 3. Let H be the point on N M such that N H = N D and M H = M B. 2This is not true for most aperiodic sequences. For example, if tn = n for all n, there is no such thing as maxn |tn|. For any constant C you choose, I can ﬁnd an n such that |tn| > C. 2 of 5 Winter Camp 2011 Mock Olympiad Solutions A B C D M N M’ P Q H Lemma: H is the reﬂection of D across line AQ. Proof of Lemma: Let M ′ be the point on ray −−→ N D such that DM ′ = BM . Then ∠ADM ′ = ∠ABM since ABCD is cyclic, and we are given that AB = AD. Therefore, △ADM ′ ∼= △ABM by side-angle-side. It follows that AM ′ = AM . Furthermore, M ′N = DM ′ + N D = BM + N D = M N , and so △M ′AN ∼= △M AN by side-side-side. In particular, ∠AN D = ∠AN M ′ = ∠AN M = ∠AN H. The lemma now follows from the fact that N H = N D. By the same argument, H is the reﬂection of B across AP , and so ∠P AQ = 1 2 · ∠BAD. Finally, the Lemma implies ∠AQH = ∠AQD = 1 2 · ∠DCB = 1 2 · (180◦ − ∠DAB) = 90◦ − ∠QAP , and so P H is perpendicular to AQ. Similarly, QH is perpendicular to AP . Therefore, H is the orthocenter of △AP Q, as required. Solution #2: Deﬁne H as in the previous solution. Let BH and DH intersect the cir- cumcircle of ABCD again at points Q′ and P ′. Also let α = ∠HDN = ∠DHN and let β = ∠M BH = ∠HBM . Then ∠N HQ′ = β and ∠Q′DC = ∠Q′BC = ∠HBM = β. Therefore, ∠HDQ′ = ∠DHQ′ = α + β, and so Q′D = Q′H. Since N D = N H as well, Q′N is perpendicular to DH, and also Q′N bisects ∠DQ′H = ∠DQ′B. This means that Q′N must meet the circumcircle at the midpoint of arc BD, but this midpoint is exactly A since AB = AD. Therefore, A, N, Q′ are collinear and hence Q′ = Q. Similarly P ′ = P . We already showed line P HD is perpendicular to line AN Q, and similarly line QHB is perpendicular to line AM P , which means H is the orthocenter of △AP Q. Comment: When you see one length is the sum of two others, it is often useful to divide into two lengths like we did here. A good straightedge and compass diagram should also tell you exactly where H is. Source: International Zhautykov Olympiad 2010. 4. Let us begin by making some deﬁnitions: • Call the four corner vertices of the grid corner points. • Call any point on the boundary of the grid where we switch between white and black squares a transition point. • Each path must have two endpoint squares where it begins and ends. Call the centers of these four squares origin points. 3 of 5 Winter Camp 2011 Mock Olympiad Solutions Lemma: Let A be an origin point. Then there exist two line segments ℓ1 and ℓ2 connecting A to either a boundary point or a corner point, and satisfying the following conditions: (1) ℓ1 and ℓ2 form a 45◦ angle with the gridlines, (2) ℓ1 and ℓ2 are perpendicular to each other, and (3) ℓ1 and ℓ2 do not pass through any other origin points. Proof of Lemma: First note that no 2 × 2 square can form a checkerboard pattern with two opposite squares being white, and the other two being black. If this happened, then the two white squares would have to be connected by a single path, but this path would disconnect the two black squares, which is not allowed. Now consider the endpoint A of a single path. Assume without loss of generality that A is white, and let B be the one white square adjacent to A: B 1 A 1 3 2 1 2 3 4 3 3 4 X Y \u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000\u0000 \u0000\u0000 \u0000 @ @ @ @ @ In the picture above, the squares labeled 1 must all be black since A is assumed to be an endpoint. The squares labeled 2 must also be black to avoid a 2 × 2 checkerboard. But now the squares labeled 2 already have two black neighbours, so the squares labeled 3 must be white. And then the squares labeled 4 must be white to avoid a 2 × 2 checkerboard. This same argument can be extended until we reach squares on the boundary, say X and Y . Since X and Y already have two neighbours of the same colour, they must either be at a corner of the grid, or the other square they are adjacent to must be of the opposite colour. Thus, the lines through the center of A and the centers of X, Y must end at either a corner point or a transition point. Note that this is true even if A itself is on the boundary. It is clear that these two lines are perpendicular and form a 45◦ angle with the gridlines. Finally, they cannot pass through another origin point because each square between A and X, Y must have two neighbours of the same colour. Next, let us consider the boundary of the grid. Suppose it has two disjoint white components W1 and W2. Then there must also be two disjoint black components B1 and B2. W1 and W2 must be part of the same path, but this path would have to disconnect B1 and B2, which is not allowed. Therefore, the boundary contains only one white component and only one black component, and hence there are exactly two transition points. Consider the following eight 45◦ diagonals: one emerging onto the grid from each corner point (call these corner diagonals), and two emerging onto the grid from each transition point (call these transition diagonals). By the Lemma, each origin point must be at the intersection of two perpendicular diagonals. Since there are only eight diagonals altogether, each diagonal can be used by only one origin point, and there are four origin points, each diagonal must be used. If two transition diagonals are used by the same origin point, then another origin point must use two corner diagonals to compensate, and hence be in the center of the grid. The problem is solved in that case. 4 of 5 Winter Camp 2011 Mock Olympiad Solutions Otherwise, every transition diagonal must intersect a corner diagonal at an origin point. Let A, B, C, D be the four corners of the grid, and let P be a transition point. Without loss of generality, we can assume that P lies on side AB. If each grid square has side length 1, then AB has odd length, so either AP or P B is even. Assume further without loss of generality that AP is even. But then the diagonal through P parallel to BD never intersects BD, and it intersects AC only on the corner of a square. Therefore, it cannot possibly intersect a corner diagonal at an origin point, and we have the desired contradiction.
