Let p(x) = a0 + a1x + · · · + anxn, where a0an ̸= 0, and suppose that p has n real roots (counting multiplicities). Prove that the number of sign changes in the sequence (a0, a1, . . . , an) is precisely the number of positive roots of p. 2.

Let q(x) be a polynomial with real coeﬃcients. Prove that the number of real roots of q is congruent modulo 2 to the degree of q. 4.
