Do there exist 2013 consecutive composite numbers? 2. Do there exist 2013 consecutive numbers that cannot be written as the sum of two squares? 3.

(USAMO 2006/3) For an integer m, let p(m) be the largest prime divisor of m (by convention, set p(±1) = 1 and p(0) = ∞). Find all polynomials f with integer coeﬃcients such that the sequence {p(f (n2)) − 2n}n≥0 is bounded above. (In particular, this requires f (n2) ̸= 0 for n ≥ 0). 15. (ISL 2005 N7) Let P (x) be an integer polynomial of degree at least 2. Prove that there exists a positive integer m such that P (m!) is composite. 16. (Stormer’s Theorem 1). Let Sk be the set of integers whose prime factors are all less than k. Then Sk contains ﬁnitely many pairs of consecutive integers. 17. (Zgimondy’s Theorem 2). Choose relatively prime integers a > b > 0 such that a + b is not a power of two and (a, b) ̸= (2, 1). Then for all n > 1, there is a prime p which divides an − bn but not a k − bk for any k < n. 1Surprisingly, this has applications in music theory. 2This is quite hard to prove, but can sometimes be a useful sledgehammer for solving problems like these. 2","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
