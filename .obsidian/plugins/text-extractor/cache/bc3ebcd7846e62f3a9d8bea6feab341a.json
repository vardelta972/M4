There are 3 cities, A, B and C. To go to city B from A you can use any of 5 buses or 3 trains. And to move to city C from city B, you can use any of 3 buses or 4 trains. Then in how many ways can you go to city C from city A? Solution: We can go to city B from city A in (5+3) = 8 many ways. And we can go to city C from city B in (3+4) = 7 many ways. Now for each of the 8 choices of routes from city A to city B, we can pick any of the 7 choices to go to city C from city B. Hence the total number of ways to go to city C from city A is 8 7 = 56. When to add and when to multiply? If we can do the same job in either a many ways or b many ways, then total no. of doing it will be (a + b). And when we can do one part of the job in a many ways and another part of the job in b many ways, independently of the former, then the total no. of ways to do the whole job will be a b. Problem 2. In how many ways can you make a ﬂag with 4 stripes if you have 10 stripes, each having a different colour? Note that the ordering of the stripes will be important, i.e., different ordering leads to different ﬂags. Solution: The topmost stripe can be chosen in 10 ways. The next one can be chosen in 9 ways. The third one in 8 ways and the last one in 7 ways. Therefore the total no. of ways to make the ﬂag will be 10 9 8 7 = 5040. Notation: For natural number n, we denote by n! the product . Hence 10 9 8 7 = 10!/6! = 10!/(10 - 4)!. We also denote this by . Problem 3. In how many ways can you choose 5 students from a class of 12 students and arrange them in a line? Solution: 12 11 10 9 8 = 12!/7! = 12!/(12 - 5)! = . Keep in mind: counts the number of arrangements of r objects chosen from n distinct objects.

Solution: Way 1: It should be n (n - 1) … 1 = n!. Way 2: We are selecting n objects from n distinct objects and arranging them on a line, so this should be . Since this should match with the count n! in way 1, we must deﬁne 0! = 1. Remark. You might wonder that in , the ‘P’ stands for what? Answer: P stands for ‘permutation’, which is another word for arrangement. Problem 5. Suppose you went to a sweet shop where 4 types of ice-creams are available, say {Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Mango}. In how many ways can you choose 2 different ice-creams? Solution: We have to pick two distinct ice-creams, say {A, B}, from {V, C, S, M}. We have 4 choices for A and after choosing that, we have 3 choices left for B. So do we have, in total, 4 3 ways? No, because choosing {Chocolate, Vanilla} is same as {Vanilla, Chocolate}. Thus, in our previous counting (4 3), each way of choosing 2 ice-creams is counted twice. So, the actual number of ways to choose 2 ice-creams will be = 4 3/2 = 6. These 6 ways are shown below. {V, C}, {V, S}, {V, M} {C, S}, {C, M} {S, M} Note: If you and your brother/sister went to the shop and wished to have one ice- cream each, then ordering of the two ice-creams would have mattered, and then the total number of ways for you two to get the ice-creams will be 4 3 = 12. Problem 6. Suppose n people go to a party. If each of them shakes hand with each other, then ﬁnd the total number handshakes. Solution: Each of the n persons shakes hand with (n - 1) other persons. So if we sum up the number of handshakes done by each person, we get n(n-1). Note that in this counting, we have counted each handshake twice (if persons A and B shake hand, then that handshake is counted both for A and B). Hence the total number of handshakes should be n(n-1)/2. Another way: In how many ways can we choose two persons? Suppose the chosen persons are {A, B}. Now there are n choices to choose A and after that there are (n-1) ways to choose B. But since {A, B} is same as {B, A}, so the total number of ways to choose two persons from n persons should be = n(n - 1)/2. × × × n P n = n!/(n − n)! = n!/0! n P r × × × × Page of 2 4 Problem 7. Suppose you have a (convex) polygon with n sides. Find its number of diagonals. Solution: From each vertex we have (n-3) diagonals passing through it. Therefore, if we sum up the no. of diagonals passing through all the vertices, we get n(n - 3). But, in this counting, each diagonal gets counted twice (if the diagonal is AB then it is counted both for vertices A and B). Therefore, the number of diagonals should be n(n-3)/2. Another way: First we count the number of ways to choose a pair of vertices of the polygon, which is given by n(n-1)/2. Now joining the two chosen vertices may result either in a side or a diagonal. Since there are n sides, the number of diagonals of the polygon is given by = total no. of pairs of vertices - the number of sides = (n(n-1)/2) - n = n(n-3)/2. Problem 8. Suppose you went to a sweet shop where 4 types of ice-creams are available, say {Vanilla, Chocolate, Strawberry, Mango}. In how many ways can you choose 3 different ice-creams? Solution: To choose 3 among 4 is same as not choosing just one among the 4, which can be done in 4 ways. So answer is 4. Problem 9. Suppose you went to a sweet shop where 8 types of ice-creams are available. In how many ways can you choose 4 different ice-creams? Solution: The number of ways to choose 4 different ice-creams from those 8 ﬂavours and arrange them is given by 8 7 6 5 = . But in this problem, arrangement does not matter. Consider any particular set of 4 different ﬂavours, say {a, b, c, d}. Can you say how many times were it counted in the previous counting (with arrangements)? Ans: 4!. Now, in order to ﬁnd the number of ways to choose 4 ice-creams, we think in the following manner. First choose 4 different ice-creams and then distribute them. After choosing 4 ice-creams we can distribute them in 4! ways. So, if Z be the number of ways to choose the 4 ice-creams, then the total number ways to choose and distribute will be 4! Z. But we already know that the number of ways to choose and distribute is given by the number 8 7 6 5. Therefore, 4! Z = 8 7 6 5. Hence our desired count Z is given by 8 7 6 5 / 4! = /4! = 70. We also denote this count /4! by . × × × 8 P 4 × × × × × × × × × 8 P 4 8 P 4 8 C 4 Page of 3 4 Keep in mind: counts the number of ways to choose r distinct objects from n distinct objects (0 r n). Another notation for : (“n choose r”). Note that, = . While solving numerical problems, using the second formula is found to be easier. Problem 10. There are 2 girls and 7 boys in a chess club. A team of four persons must be chosen for a tournament, and it must contain at least one girl. In how many ways can this be done? Solution: There can be either 1 girl or 2 girls in the team. If both the girls are in the team, then the team can be formed by choosing 2 boys from 7 boys, which can be done in = ways. If there is only 1 girl in the team, then she can be chosen in 2 ways and now we have to choose 3 boys from 7 boys, which can be done in ways. Therefore the total number of ways to form the team is given by + = 7 6/2 + 7 5 2 = 21 + 70 = 91. Counting is best learnt by solving problems on your own. Practice from: 1.
