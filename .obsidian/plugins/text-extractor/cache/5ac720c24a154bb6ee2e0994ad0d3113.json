Algebraic Equations and Systems of Equations Preliminaries In the problems below the original systems of equations should be simplified and reduced to equivalent systems whose all solu- tions either are known or can readily be found. In some cases itis necessary to introduce redundant equations which are a priori satisfied by the solutions of the original systems but may have, inthe general case, some extraneous solutions. Then the values of the unknowns thus obtained must be tested by substituting them into the original systems. In some problems one should use Vieta's theorem for the equation of the third degree x3+px2--qx+r=0. (1) The theorem establishes the following relations between the coef- ficients p,q and rof the equation and its roots x1, x2 and x3: X, + x2 + x3 = - p,x,x2 1x2x3 ± x3x1 = q,x1x2x3 = - r.(2) Formulas (2)are derived by equating the coefficients in the equal powers of x on both sides of the identity x3 -l- px2 -1- qx -}- r (x-x1) (x-x2) (x-x3).

Algebraic Inequalities Preliminaries } (a > 0). (a > 0, b > 0). Here are some inequalities which are used for solving the prob- lems below. For any real a and b we have a2+b2>21abl. (1) Inequality (1) is a consequence of the obvious inequality (a t b)2> 0. Relation (1) turns into an equality only ifI a I _ I b I. If ab>0, then dividing both sides of inequality (1) by ab we obtain (2) If u > 0 and v > 0, then,putting u = a2 and v = b2 in (1) we obtain 2\">Vuv. (3) 2 In inequalities (2) and (3) the sign of equality appears only for a= b and (u = v). In addition,letus indicate some properties of the quadratic trinomial y=ax2+bx+c (4) which are used in some problems below. The representation of trinomial (4) in the form y-arx + b \\2- bz-4ac (5) 2a4a PROBLEMS ALGEBRA 21 implies thatifthe discriminant of the trinomialsatisfl@s thL condition D=b2-4ac < 0 (in this case the roots of the trinomial are nonreal), then,for allx,th? trinomial takes on values of the same sign which coincides with the sign of the coefficient a in the second power of x. If D=0 the trinomial vanishes only for x=-2a and retains its sign for all the other values of x. Finally,if D > 0 (inthis case the trinomial has real distinct roots x, and x2),it follows from the factorization y = a (x-xl) (xx2), that the trinomial attains the values whose sign is opposite to that of a only for x satisfying the condition x,<x<x2. For all the other values of x different from x, and x2 the trino- mial has the same sign as a. Thus, a trinomial always retains the sign of the coefficientin x2 except for the case when its roots x, and xE are real and x,<x<x2. 96.

Denote and Al _ 1 1 Y7+Ya Yb+YC A2= 1- 1 Ya+Yb 11+Ya . Let us show that Al=A;. If d=0 then a=b=c and A1_=A2=0. Therefore we suppose that d0. Rationalizing the denominators we obtain _rc-11aYc2j`b-Yc-YaA1- 2d+d 2d and A2-11-b-Ya_ d 2d 2d Thus, A1= A2 which completes the proof. 2.If the common difference d of the given progression is equal to zero the validity of the formula is obvious. Therefore we suppose that d ;6 0. Denote the left-hand side member of the desired equality by S. Rationalizing the denominators we get Ya2-Yat+ YTa-Ya2...+11'a-Yan-1 a2-a1a3-a2 an-an-t Since, by the hypothesis, a2-a1=a3-a2= ...=an-an_1=d we obviously obtain San-Ya1 d Now we can write S_an-a1_(n-1)dn-l Yars+Yat7dd(Yan+Ya1)a+Yan which is what we set out to prove. 3.

At n=3 we have 1 -}- 1=2.Whence, I-I I_1 alaia2a3a1a3 ala2a1a3alaia3a2 and consequently a3-a2=a2-a1. Therefore itis sufficient to show that an-an-1 =a,-l-an-2 for any n>4. Let us write down, in succession, the equality given in the for- mulation of the problem for the cases n-2, n-I and n: I 1_n-3 1 a2a2 } a2a3 an-2a1 an-2 () 1 1 1_n-2 -f--+ - ... -{ a1 a2aa3an-2an-1al an-1 1 I 1n-1 aiaz + a2a3+ ...+an_1 an = alan Subtracting termwise equality (2) from (3) and (1) from (2) we get I_1n-2)an-l -an an-lan alan=alas-lan and (2) (3) 1 1 =(n-2) an-2an-1 an-tan-1alan-2alan-lan-2 Reducing the fractions to a common denominator and cancelling we find al-an-1=(n-2) (an-r-an), a1-a8_1 =(n-2) (an-2-an-1). Hence, an-l-an=an_2-an-1 which is the required result. 5. We shall use the method of induction, Note that the equality holds for n=2 since a2-al=a3-a2 and, consequently, a1-2a2+a3=0. Suppose that the desired formula is valid for a certain n or, in other words, for any arithme- tic progression x1, x2,. xn+rthe equality x1-Cnx2+Cnx3 +... +(i) n-l Cn-lxn+(-1)n Cnxn+1 =°(1) holds. Now passing to n+ l we use the identity kkk-1 Cn = Cn-1 -(- Cn-1 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 89 which results in al -Cn+la2 + Cn+l as + ... +(-1)n Cn+1an+ 1 + (-1)n+1 Cn+lan+2= [al-Cna2+ ...+(-1)n Cna,+1]--[a2-Cna$+...+(-I)n-1Cn-tan+]. +(-1)n Cna,+2] By the hypothesis, both expressions in square brackets are equalto zero because they are of form (1). Therefore, the desired formula is validfor n+1 as well. Thus, the assertion is proved. 6. We carry out the proof by induction. For n=3 it readily follows that a2-3 (al+d)2+3 (a1+2d)2-(a1+3d)2=0. Suppose we have already established that for a certain n and any arithmetic progression x1, x2,..., xn+1the identity Xi-Cnx2 {...(-I)nCnxn+1=0 holds. Then passing to n+ 1 as in the preceding problem we obtain al - Cn+1 a2 + Cn+l as ++ (- I )n Cn+l an+l + +(-l)n+1Cn+lan+2=[ai-CnaZ+... I (-1)nCna,+1]- - [a2 - Cn a2 -{- ... + (-1)n Cn an+2 J = 0, and thus the required formula has been proved. It should be noted that for an arithmetic progression al, a2,, an, an+1 the more general formula ai-Cna2+Cna3-...+(-1)n-1C-1an+ (-1)°Cnan+1=0 holds where k> 1is an integer. 7. By the well-known property of the terms of an arithmetic progression we have 2 logm x =log, x+ logk x. Whence we obtain (see (3), page 25) 21 logs mlogs n + log., k and, consequently,_logs mlog' In 2 log, n+1og.,k' Using formula (2) given on page 24 we deduce 2 = log, m + logk m. Let us rewrite this equality as log, n2 =log, in + log, (nl ogr, rn\\ Now, raising we obtain n2=mnlog\"m or 1 n2=(kn)I09hM which is what we set out to prove. 8. Let al + a2 +. + an=C. (1) +an+kn 90 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Denote the common difference of the progression by d. We are only interested in the case d ? 0 since for d=0 all terms of the progression are equal and the equality (1) is automatically fulfilled. Using the formula for the sum of terms of an arithmetic progression we get from (1) the equality 2[a1+a1+d(n-1)]=k2[ai+nd+al+(n-Fkn-I)d]c from which, after cancelling 2 and rearranging the terms, we find (2a1- 2alkc - d -[- cdk) + n (d - (.dk2 - 2cdk) = 0. Since this equality holds for any n we conclude that 2a1-2a1kc-d+cdk=0 and d-cdk2-2cdk=0. Cancelling out d 7L- 0 in the second equality we obtain 1C= k(k+2) The first equalitiy can be represented in the form (2a1-d)(1-ck)=0. (2) By virtue of (2), the second factorisdifferent from zero and hence d = 2a1. Thus, if d0 equality (I) can be validforall n only in the case of the progression a, 3a, 5a, ...(a 9 0). (3) Now itiseasyto verifydirectlythat progression (3) in fact satisfies the condition of the problem. Thus, the sought-for progression is given by (3). 9. Let d be the common difference of the progression. We have b2=X,2+(xl-[-d)2-F-...+[x,-[-(n-1) d]2=nxi+2x1d(l+2+... +(n-1)]-]- zzz e_2 n(n-1)(2n--1)2+d [12... { (n-1) ]-nxl { n(n-l)xld [6d and, besides a=nx1+2d. Eliminating x1 from these equations,after some simple transformations we obtain d2 n (n2-1) = b2-a 12 n Hence, d= f1/112 (nb2-a2) 02w-l) x,is then defined in either case by the formula x1=n l a-n(2 1)d Thus, there are two progressions satisfying the conditions of the problem for n2b2-a2 4 0.

Let q be the common ratio of the progression. Then am+n =a19m+n-1=A am-n=atgm n-1=B. Whence q2\" A =B and, hence, q=?YB. Now we have (2j,,T)fl am=am-nqn=BB n-m-m2 CA\\-n2n2n an=am+nq-m= AB=AB 13.

For x=1 we thus obtain Sn(n+1)(n+2) 2 16.Let us denote the desired sum by Sn.

By the hypothesis, we haveI q [ < Iand, consequently, qn=k(qn+l+qn{2-}-...)-kqn+r 1 I - q (1) 94 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Hence, l-q=kq and thus,if the problem has a solution, we have Iq=k+1 (2) Itis, however, easily seen that if, conversely, equality (2) implies thatI q I < 1, then the equality (2) implies equality (1), and the corresponding progression satisfiesthe condition of the problem. Thus, the problem is solvable for any k satisfying the inequality k+ II< 1. The latter holds for k > 0 and k <-2. 21. The proofis carried out by complete induction. Let us first consider a sequence of three terms x1, x2, xs. Opening brackets in the formula (x1-}- x2) (xe +xs) _ (xlxz +xaxz )2, we find that azzz x2'I\" X1 X3 - 2x1X2x3 = 0, whence (x2-x1x3)2=0, and, consequently, x1x3=x2. If xl0 this implies that the numbers x1, x2, x3 form a geometric progression. Now assume that the sug- gested assertion is proved for a sequence consisting of k(k>3) terms X1, X2,.... Xk. (1) Letqbe the common ratioof the progression. Consider a sequence of k+ 1 terms X1, X2,..., Xk, Xk+1 (2) Let us write down the corresponding condition (xix2+...{ xk_1 } zk) (x2-+3 I...} x} xk+il = = (x1x2 + x2x3 + ... + xk -1xk + xkxk +1)2(3) and put, for brevity, X2+x2+xk-1=az. Note thata0 since x10. By the induction hypothesis we have xz=qx,; x3=qx2;.;xk=qxk-1 (4) Therefore equality (3) can be rewritten as (a2 + xk) (g2a2 + xk+1) _ (qa2 + xkxk+l)2. Opening the brackets and grouping the terms we see that (xkq-xk+1)2a2 =0. Since a A 0,then alongside with (4) we get xk+l=qxk. Hence, the sequence x1, x2,..., xk,x1,+1isa geometric progression with the same common ratio x2 9 = X1 Itfollows thata sequence composed of first n terms of the given sequence is a geometric progression for any natural n. Therefore, the given infinite sequ- ence is also a geometric progression which is what we set out to prove. 22. Let a1=b1=a. Then, by virtue of the condition a2=b2, we have a+d=aq, (1) where d and q are the common difference and ratio of the corresponding prog- ressions. Note that the condition a > 0 for all n implies that the difference d must be non-negative. Since, in addition, a1a2 we conclude that d > 0. Therefore, formula (1) implies q=1-I-a > 1. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 95 Now we have to prove that a+(n-1)d < aqn-' (2) for n > 2. Since, by equality (1), d=a(q-1), relation (2) is equivalent to the inequality a(n-l)(q-1) < a(qn-1-1). Dividing both sides by the positive quantity a (q- 1) we obtain n-I < I+q+...+gn-2. Since q > 1, this inequality holds true. The problem has thus been solved. 23. By the hypothesis, we have a1>0,a-=q>0 andb2-b, =d>0, i where q is the common ratio of the geometric progression and d the difference of the arithmetic progression. Taking advantage ofthefactthat an=a,qn-1 and bn=b1+(n-1) we obtain logo an-bn=(n-l) (log, q-d)+log,, a1-b1. For the difference on the left-hand side to be independent of n itisnecessary and sufficient that log,, q-d=O. Solving this equation we find a=qd. (I) Consequently, the number a exists and is defined dy formula (I). 2. Algebraic Equations and Systems of Equations 24. Rewrite the system in the form (x+y)(x2-xy+y2)=l,1 (1) y(x+y)2=2, f (2) and divide the first equation by the second.Discarding the denominator and then collecting similar terms we obtain y2-3xy+2x2=0. (3) Solving quadratic equation (3) in y we get the two roots y=x and y=2x and thus obtain two new equations. Solving then each ofthese equations simulta- neously with equation (2) we find real solutions of the corresponding systems. There are only two solutions: x1= ,Vy'=2V 4 and x2 = 3 V3,y2=3 V3. Each of these pairs of numbers satisfiesthe original system aswell. This can be verified either by the direct substitution or by analyzing the method by which the solutions were found. 25. Let us transform the equations of the system to the form (x+y)2-xy=4, (x-{-y)+xy=2. Whence we obtain(x+y)2+(x+y)=6 96 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and, hence, either x+y=2 or x+y=-3. Combining either of the latter equa- tions with the second equation of the original system we arrive atthe follow- ing two systems of equations- x+y- 2,x+y=-3. xy_p} {1)xy=5 {2) System (1) has two solutions and xi = 2,yt =0 x2 = 0,yz = 2. System (2) also has two solutions 311 3iY11x3=-2+i1 2,y3=- 22 and 3111311lx4=-2-i 2 ,Y4-2+i2 . Itis obvious that each solution of the original system belongs to the set of solutions of the above system. A simple argument shows thatthe converse is also true. By the way, itis still easier to verifyitby, adirectsubstitution. Thus, the problem has four solutions. 26. Transform the equations of the system to the form (x+y) [(x+ y)2-3xyl =5a3, xy(x+y)=a3, and then put x+y=u and xy=v. Substituting xy(x+y)=a3 into the first equation we find u3=8a3. Since we are onlyinterestedinrealsolutions, we have u=2a. From the second equation we now find a3Iv=u=2 a2. Thus, we have arrived at the following system of equations in x annt y: x+y=2a,xy= 2 a2. Solving this system we get and xi =a2+12 ,yi =a2-12 2 2 xz=a2-2 12,y2=a2+ 2 Y2. These numbers also satisfy the original system and consequently thelatter has two real solutions. 27. Reducing the equations to a common denominator we then transform the system to the form (x+y) [(x+y)2-3xy1=12xy, 3 (x+y)=xy Putting x+y=u, xy=v and substituting xy=v=3(x+y)=3u into the first equation we see that u (u2-9u)=36u. (1) SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 97 Note thatu # 0 (ifotherwise,the second equation would imply xy=0 which contradicts the originalequation).Therefore,itfollows from equation (1) that either u= 12 or u=-3. In the first case (u = 12) we get the system x--y=12, xy = 36, whence x=y=6. In the second case (u=-3) we have x+y=-3, xy=-9. This system has two solutions x=2 (+ Y5-I),y=2 (+ Y5-I) The three solutions thus found satisfy the original system as well. Thus, the system has three solutions. 28. Squaring the second equation and subtracting itfrom thefirst equation we obtain xy (x2+y'2-xy)=21. (1) Whence, by virtue of the second equation of the system, we derive xy=3. Substituting y into the second equation of the system, we arrive at the biquadratic equationx4-10x2+9=0. It follows that xi =3, x2=-3, x3=1, x4=-l and therefore the corresponding values of y are yl=1, Y2=-11 y3=3, y4=-3. A direct verification shows that all the four pairs of numbers are solutions of the original system. Conse- quently, the system has four solutions: xt =3,yj = l;x2 = -3,y2 = -l; x3=1,y3=3;x4=-1,y4=-3. 29. Transform the system to the form (x- y)(x2 + y2 + xy - 19) = 0, (x+y) (x2+y2-xy-7)=0. The original system is thus reduced to the following four systems of equa. tions: x-y=0, x-yO, x+ y =0, }IOx2+ y2-xy-7=0, I 2() x2+y2+xy-190, x2+y2-f-xy-19=0, x-y=0, (3)x2+y2-xy-7=0.} (4) The first system has a single solution x=0, y=0. The second one has two solutions x=± ]/'7, y=+ y7. Thethirdsystemalso has two solutions x=+ V T9, y= T 3119. Now taking the fourth system we note that the addi- tion and subtraction of both equations leads to the equivalent system xy=6, x2 + y2 = 13. This system has four solutions: x=±2,y= f3 and x= f3,y= ±2. 4-323 98 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Thus, the system under consideration has nine solutions: (0, 0),(Y7, (Y19. - Y19),(- Y19,f9), (2, 3), (-2, -3),(3, 2),(-3, -2). 30. Transforming the system to the form 2(x+y)=5xy, 8(x+ y) [(x+y)2-3xyl =65, substituting x+y found from the firstequation into the second one and put- ting xy=v we get 250-12V2_13=0. This equationis obviously satisfied by v= 1.Dividing the left-hand side by v-1 we arrive at the equation 25v2+13v+13=0. The latter equation has no real roots. Thus, there is only one possibility: v=1. Substituting this value into the first equation we obtain the system xy=1, 5x+y= 2 Hence, xa = 2, y, = 2 and x2 = 2 ,y2 = 2. Both pairs of numbers also satisfy the original equation.Thus,the system has two and only two real solutions. 31. Adding together the equations and then subtracting the second equation from the first one we get the equivalent system (x-y)(x2+y2+xy)=7, (1)(x-y)xy=2. j Representing the first equation in the form (x- y)3+3xy (x-y)=7, we see that, by virtue of the second equation, (x-y)3=1. Since we are only interested in real solutions we have x-y=1. Taking this into account we easily deduce xy = 2. Solving then the system xy = 2, x-y= I, we find its two solutions xd = 2,yi = 1;X2=-\"Y2 = -2. It can be readilyverified that bothpairsof numbers satisfy the original system. Thus, the system has two real solutions. 32. Transforming the second equation to the form (x2 + y2)2- 2x2y2 = 7 and putting x2+y2=u, xy=v we rewrite this equation as u2 - 2v2 = 7. Squaring the first equation of the system we get another relationship between u and v: u+2v=1. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA -.f9 Eliminating u from the last two equations we obtain v2-2v-3=0, whence t'1=3, Then the corresponding values of u are u1 =-5 andu2=3. Since u=x2+y2 and we are only interestedinrealsolutionsofthe original equation, the first pair of the values of u and v should be discarded. The second pair leads to the system x2 + y2 = 3, xy=-1. This system has four real solutions (1+Y5 1-j1i - jf ' I+If5 22I'(t 2 2 (-I2 ,-1 -j151\\-1 2Y5 -1 2Y5 2 Itis easy, however, to ver`,ify that the original systemissatisfiedonly by the first two of them. Thus, tale problem has two real solutions. 33. Raising the first equation to the fifth power and subtracting the second equation from the result we get, after some simplifications, the equation xy (x3 + y3) + 2x2y2 + 6 = 0. (1) From the first equation after it has been cubed it follows that x3+y3= 1-3xy which makes it possible to transform equation (1) to the form x2y2-xy-6=0. Solving the latter equation we obtain (xy)i =3,(xy)2=-2. Combining these relations with x+y=1 we find the four pairs of numbers (2, -1);(-1, 2);(1+i yll,1-i jrll } and(I__iJITT \\ 1 2 1+i rl11 2/ It can be easily checked that they all satisfy the original system of equations. 34. Transform the equations of the given system to the form (x2-y2)2+x2y2= 13, It x2-y2+2xy= 1. Substituting x2-y2 found from the second equation into the first one we get 5 (xy)2 - 4xy - 12 = 0. It follows that 6 (xy)1=2,(xy)2=-5 (I) Since we are only interested inthe solutions for which xy : 0, there is only one possibility, namelyxy=2. 4* 100 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Substituting y expressed from the latter relationinto the second equation we get x4+3x2-4=0. Among all the roots of this equation there are only two realrootsx, = Iand x2=-1. By virtue of (2), the corresponding values of y are y, =2 and y2=-2. Both pairs of the numbers (x, y) satisfy the original system as well. Thus, the problem has two solutions x1=1,y1=2 and x2=-1Y22. 35. Opening the brackets in the equations of the system and putting x+y=u, xy=v we rewrite the system in the form u2+v2-2v=9, UV-U=3. (1) If now both sides of the second equation are multiplied by 2 and then the cor- responding sides of thefirstequation are added to and subtracted from the obtained result, then system (1)is replaced by the equivalent system (u+v)\"-2 (u+v)= 15, (u-v)2+2(u-v)=3.} (2) From the first equation of system (2) we find (u-l-v)1=5;(u+v)2=- 3. From the second equation we get (u-v)1=-3;(u-v)?=1. Thus, the determination of all solutions of system (2) is reduced to solving the following four systems: Uv=5, }(3)U +v= 5 ± (4))u_u=-3, uv= 1, u+v=-3, }(5)u+v=-3, (6) u-v=-3, u-v=1. The solutions of systems (3), (4), (5) and (6) are, respectively, u1=1,v,=4; u2 = 3,v2 = 2; u3=-3,vs=0; and U4=- 1,v4=-2. To find all the solutions of the original system we now have to solve the fol- lowing four systems of two equations which only differ in their right-hand sides: x+y=1,(7)x+y=3, } (8)xy=4, r xy=2, x+y3, } (9)x+y=- 1,l (10) xy=0, xy2. j Solving these equations we findallthe solutionsof the original system. We obviously obtain eight solutions: (I+i 215 2i Jf 1-5 (22 -i215), (2,1),(1, 2),(-3, 0),(0,\\-3),(1, -2),(-2, 1). SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 101 36. Note first that according to the meaning of the problem we have x v 0 and y 0 0. Multiplying the left-hand and right-hand sides of the equations we obtain x4-y4=6. (t) Multiplying either equations by xy and adding them together we obtain x4 - y4 + 2x2y2 = 7xy. (2) By (1) and (2), we now can write 2x2y2-7xy+ 6= 0, whence (xy)r = 2;(xy)a = 1 (3) Thus, every solution of the original system satisfies equation (1) and one of the equations (3). We cantherefore combine eachofthe equations(3) with equation (1) and solve the corresponding systems. But this leads to an equation of eighth degree and complicates the solutionof th_ problem. Therefore we shallapply another technique. Note thatifeither equationof the original system is again multiplied by xy and thenthe second equation is subtracted from the first one this results in the equation x4+ y4 = 5xy, (4) which is also satisfied by every solution of the original system. Let us consider the two possibilities: (1) Let xy = 2 (5) in accordance with (3).Then, by (4), we have x4+y4=10. Combining this equation with (1) and solving the resulting system we find x4 = 8, and, hence, 4 4-xi = 1/8,X2=-V8,xa = i8,,x4 = - i/ 8. By virtue of (5), the corresponding values of y are ,2,ya = -2,yi = 8 (2) In the second case we have 3xy=2. ya = - iV2,y4 = iV2. Equation (4) then results in the relation x4+y4= 12. Combining itwith we obtain x4 =4 7.I t follows that (6) (1) 427 427_427 4427X5=4,x6=- V4, X7_i Y4'xe - Y4 and the corresponding values of y are 3 T 3Y5Y 4 ,yeV4 'Y7=-i VT,Y 844 Thus, every solution of the original system belongs to the set of the eight pairs of numbers thus found.Itis, however, readily seen thatall the eight pairs of 102 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS numbers satisfy the original system. Consequently, all the solutions of the system have been found. 37. Let us rewrite the second equation in the form (x2 + y2)z- 2x2y2 = bx2 y2. Substituting the expression x2+y2=axy found from the first equation we obtain (az-2-b) x2y2=0. There are two possible cases here: (1) az-2-b0. Itis easily seen that in this case the system has only one solution x=0, y-0. (2) a2-2-b=0. If this condition is satisfied, the second equation is obtai- ned by squaring both sides of the first equation. Therefore, if any x and y form a pair of numbers satisfying the first equation, the same pair satisfies the second equation as well. Consequently, the system has an infinitude of solutions. 38. Let us transform the left-hand side to the form x+a x+aa x-ax-a x-ab x+a_ x+b x+bbx-b) +x-bx-bax+b) -0' Noting that the expressions in the brackets differ by the factor- b we obtain x+aa x-ax+ab x-a (x+bbx-b)x+bax-b) -0' For ab the latter equality implies [x2-(a+b) x-abl [x2+(a+b) x-ab] =0, and thus we find the four roots of the original equation: (a+b) f(a+b)z+4ab 2 X3= -(a+ b) f }/- a+b)z+4ab 4 2 If a=b the equation is satisfied by any x. 39. Putting3 - 4=t we transform the equation to the form 3t2-101+8=0. Whence we obtain t1=2andtz= 4 3' Solving then the two quadratic equations for x we find the four roots of the original equation: xt=3+Y21,xz=3-j21,x3=6,xa=-2. 40. Let us putx+y=u andx-y-v xy xy Then the equations of the system can be written as ui. 1= 1 Ua+a (1) SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 103 Solving either equation we find u1=a,u,= 1a (2) and vl=b,v2= (3) Now we have to solve the four systems of form (1) whose right-hand sides con- tain all the possible combinations of the values of u and v determined by for- mulas (2) and (3). Write system (1) in the form t1_ Y+x`u' II-=v. y - xj (4) This yields x2 (u-v), (5) y=2 (u+v). It follows from formula(5) that for system(4),and, hence, for the original system to be solvable, the numbers a and b must satisfy, besides ab0, some additional conditions implied by the form of the equations of the original system. Let lal ? Ibl. (6) Then, substitutingthe values u=a, v=b and then u= T' v=intothe right-hand sides of formulas (5) we find two solutions, namely _2 2 andz - 2abtab xl yl=a+6+b2-ba'Y2=a+b Furthermore, let (7) Then substituting the values u=a, v= b and then u= a , v=b into the right- hand sides of formulas (5) we find two more solutions: 2b 2b 2a 2a x,ab1,ys=ab-I-1 andxg=1-ab' ya°I -{- ab Thus, if both conditions (6) and (7) are fulfilled the system has four solutions; if one of the conditions is violated then the system has only two solutions and, finally,ifboth conditions are violated (which may happen only in the case a I = I b I =1) then the system has no solutions at all. 41. As is easily seen, the numbers x1=4.5 and x2=5.5 satisfy the equation. Therefore, the polynomial (x-4.5)4-}-(x-5.5)4-I is divi- sible by the product (x-4.5) (x-5.5). To perform the division and reduce the problem to a quadratic equation itis convenient to representthe above poly- nomial in the form [(x-4.5)4- l I+(x-5.5)4. 104 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Factoring the expression in the square brackets by the formula a4-1=(ce-1)(a+1)( 2 }1){a-I)(a3a2 [ a }I), we come to the equation (x-5.5) {(x-4.5)3+(x-4.5)2+(x--X4.5)+1}+ (x-5.5)4=0. Now taking the common factor outside the brackets we obtain (x-5.5) {(x-4.5)3+(x-4.5)2+(x-4.5)+1+ [(x-4.5)-1)3}= Hence, we have=(x-5.5)(x-4.5) {2 (x-4.5)2-2 (x-4.5)+4}=0. 10 f 1 117 x1= 5.5,x2 = 4.5,x3.4 = 2 42. From the second equation of the system we conclude that y-5=1 x-10, and, consequently, y> 5.Thereforethe first equation can be rewritten in the form y-5=1-I x-11. Adding this equation to the second one we get 2 (y-5) = 1, Whence we find I1 y= From the second equation we now obtain1 x-1 I=_ and, hence, x-1= 2 Therefore x1= 2 and x2= 2 The system thus has two solutions x1= 2 ,y12 andx2 = 2 43. Grouping the terms we reduce the left-hand side to the form (2x+y-I)2+(x+2y+ 1)2=0. Thus we obtain 2x+y-1=0, x+2y+1=0, whence it follows that x=1,y=- 1. Let us demonstrate another method of solution. Arranging the summands in the left-hand side in the ascending powers of x we get the following quadratic equation in x:5x2+(8y-2) x+(5y2+2y+2)=0. (1) For real values of y this equation has real roots if and only if its discriminant is non-negative, i.e. (8y-2)2-4.5 (5y2+2y+2) :0. (2) Removing the brackets we transform this inequality to the form -36 (y + l )20. The latter is fulfilled only for y=-1, and then equation (1) implies that x= 1. 44. We transform the equation to the form [x+2 cos (xy)12+4 [1-cost (xy)]=0. Both summands being non-negative, we have x+ 2 .cos (xy) = 0, cost (xy) =1. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 105 It follows that cos (xy) _ ± I.In the case of the plus sign we have the system cos (xy) = 1,x+ 2 cos (xy) = 0. Whence we find x=-2 and y=kn where k=0, +1, ±2, .... In the case of the minus sign we have cos (xy)=-1,x+2cos(xy)=0. This implies x=2 and y=2 (2m+1) where m=0, +1, +2, ....Thus, the equation has two infinite sequences of different real solutions, the value of x in either sequence being the same. 45. Eliminating z from the system we obtain 2xy-(2-x-y)2=4 or i. e. x2- 4x+ 4+y2-4y + 4 = 0, (x-2)2+(y-2)2=0. For real numbers x and y thelatter equality holds only for x=2 and y=2. From the first equation of the system we find z=-2. The system thus has only one real solution: x=2,y=2,z=-2, 46. First method. Note that from the given x and y the value of z is uni- quely determined by the first equation in the form z = x2 + y2 (I) Substituting this value of z into the second equation we get x2+x+y2-t-y=a. The latter equation is equivalent to the equation 12 12 1 x+2+ y) 2= a+ 2 (2) If now a+ -T < 0, then equation (2) has no real solutions because real x and y result in a non-negative number on the left-hand side. But if a+-,- > 0, equa- tion (2) and, consequently, the whole system, has obviously more than one solution. Consequently, a unique realsolution exists only if a-{ 2 =0. In this case equation (2) takes the form 1z x+ 2) +(y+ 2)z=0 and has the only real solution x=-2 y=-Finding then z from equa- tion (1) we conclude that the given system has a unique real solution only for a=- 2 , namely: 1 1 1x=-2,y=-2, z=2. 106 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Second method. Itiseasily seenthat ifthe given system has a solution x = xo, y = yo, z = zo,then it also has another solution x= yo,y = xo, z = zo. Therefore, for the solution tobe unique itis necessarythat x= y. Under this condition the system takes the form 2x2 = z, 2x+z = a. Eliminating z we obtain the quadratic equation for x: 2x2+2x-a=0. For this equation also to have a unique real root itis necessary and suf- ficient that the discriminant of the equation be equal to zero: D=22-4X2(-a)=4(l+2a)=0. Hence a= -2 , and the corresponding value of x is equal to 2 .Thus, we arrive at the former result. 47.Let xo, yo be a solution of the system. By virtue of the first equation we have [(xo f yo) - a]2 =xoyo + 212+ 2, (1) xoyo and, according to the second equation, 22+2 } V.(Xo2+Y2)2=xoyo-- (2) X xoyo Removing the square brackets on the left-hand side of equality(l) and sub- tracting equality (2) from it we get -2a (xo + yo) + a2 = -b2. Hence, we obtain 2 xo F yoa= 2ab2 Since a and b are real, the assertion has been proved. 48. Itis readily seen that the system always has the solution x=1,y=l,z=1. Itis also obvious that in the case a=b=c (1) (2) all the three equations take the form x+y+z=3, and the system has an infi- nitude of solutions. Let us show that if condition (2) is not fulfilled,i. e.if among a, b, c there are unequal numbers, then solution (1)is unique. First adding together all the three equations of the given system we obtain (a+b+c) (x+y-;-z) =3 (ad-b+c). Cancelling out a+b-Fc we recieve x+y+z=3. (3) Whence, we find z= 3 - x - y.Substituting this expression into thefirst two equations of the system we obtain (a-c)x-f (b-c) y=a-I-b-2c, (4) (b-a)x+(c-a) y=-2a+b+c.} SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 107 Multiplying the first of these equations by c-a, the second by c-b and adding them together we get [- (a-c)2+(b-a) (c-b)l x=(a-I-b-2c) (c-a) +(c-b) (-2a+b+c).(5) Equation (5) being satisfied by x= 1, the coefficient in x must identically coin- cide with the right-hand side of the equation for all a, b and c. Opening the brackets in both expressions we see that they actually coincide and are equal: - 2 [2a2-4ac+2c2-2bc+2b2+2ac-2abJ=- 2 [(a-c)2+(b-c)2+(a-b)21. Thus, if there are unequal numbers among a, b and c, the equation (5) is satis- fied only by x= l . From equations (4) it then readily follows that y = 1, and from relation (3) we see that z=1. Thus, if the condition (a-c)2+(b-c)2+(a-b)20, holds, the system has the unique solution x=1,y=1,z=1. 49. Adding together all the equations we get (a+2) (x+y+z)= 1 +a+a2. (1) If a # -2, we have x_L-[- z=ya+2 Combining this equation with each equation of the original system and solving the systems thus obtained we find, for a ;6 1, the values l -1- a I (a -[-1)2X= -a+2+2, y=a+2 ,z= a+2 . For a=-2 the systemis inconsistent because equality (1) is not fulfilled for any x, y and z. For a=1 the system is indefinite and any three numbers satis- fying the condition x+y+z=l form its solution. 50. Itis easily seen that if among the numbers a1, a2, a3 two numbers are equal to zero, the system has an infinite number ofsolutions. Indeed, let, for instance, a2=0 and a3=0. Putting then x=0 and choosing y and z so that the equation y+z=1 is satisfied we thus satisfy all the three equations of the system. Therefore, when establishing the condition foruniqueness we may suppose that at least two numbers are different from zero. Let, for example, a2 ?6 0anda3 ?: 0. (1) Subtracting thefirstequation from the second and the second equation from the third one we find a1x=a2y=a3z. It follows, by virtue of (1), that x,z=al X. at a3 Substituting these expressions into the first equation we get (2) x(1+al+al+al I =1. \\\\ aza3 (3) 1 +a +a2 This equation is solvable only if the expression inthe brackets is different from zero. Taking into account (1) we arrive at the condition D = a1a2+ a2a3+ ala3+ ala2a3 94- 0. (4) lO$ PROBLEMS IN IELEMENTARY MAHTEMATICS If this condition is fulfilled, we find from (3) and (2) the values D 3, y=aa®3 a1 2x=aa2 D (5) These three numbers yield a solution of the system, and this solution is unique according to the method by which itis obtained. Thus, (4) is a necessary conditionfor the system to be solvable and have a unique solution. It can be readily veryfied thatif we assumed another pair of numbers a1, a3, or al, a2 to be different from zero, an analogous argument would again lead us to condition (4) and to the same solution (5). Furthermore, since from con- dition (4) it follows that at least one of the three pairs of the numbers is non- zero, the above condition is not only necessary but also sufficient. 51. Let us multiply the equations by a, -b, -c and -d, respectively, and then add them together. We get (a2+b2+c2+d2)x=ap-bq--cr-ds which implies ap-bq-cr-dsx- a2+b2+c2+d2 Analogously, we find bp+aq-dr +cscp+dq+ar-bs = a2+ b2+c2+d2 ,Z- a2+b2+C3+d2 dp-cq+br+as a2+b2+c2-f-d2 52. Adding together all equations of the system we find ...2 (al+a2+... +a.) xlIx2I+X.= (l) n (n+1) Let us denote the right-hand side of this equation by A. Now subtracting the second equation from the first one we get By virtue of (1), we can write A-(a1-a2) xl =n Generally, xk(l<k<n-1) is obtained by subtracting the (k+l) th equation from the kth equation. Similarly, we obtain A-(ak-ak+r) xk =n Finally, subtracting the first equation from the last one we get A-(an-a1)xn =n The values thus found can be expressed by the general formula A-(ai-ai+1)(1<n),x; n (2) whereisunderstood as being equal to a1. The direct substitution shows thatthe setof numbers (2)in fact satisfies all the equations of the system. Thus, the given system has a unique solution. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 109 53. Adding up all the equalities and dividing the result by 3 we obtain X1+X2+X3-}-...+ xI00=0 (1) The felt-handsideof the new equality contains a hundred of summands, and it can be represented in the form (X1+X2+X3)+(X4+X6+X6)±...-} (Xe7+X98+X99)+X100=0. But each of the sums in the brackets is equal to zero by virtue of the original equalities. Therefore, x100=0. Similarly, transposing x100 to the first place and representing equality (1) in the form (X100+X1+X2)+(X3+X4+x6) r+(x96+X97+X98)+X99=0 ue find that x99=0. Transferring then x99 to the first placa and regrouping the :cmmands in triads we conclude that x98=0 an.] so on. Thus, which is what we set out to prove. 54. Adding together the equalities we get (x+y+z)2-(x+y+z)- l2 =0. (1) Putting x+y+z=t we find from equation (1) that t1=-3,t2= 4 (2) Substitutingthe sum y+z=t-x intothefirstequationoftheoriginal system we get whence we obtainx2+x (t-x)-x=2, x=1211 (3) Analogously, substituting x+z=t-y into the second equation and x+y = = t-z into the third equation we receive (4) and 6Z=-[-Ia (5) Substituting the two values of t [see (2)] into formulas (3), (4) and (5) we find the two solutions of the original system: 2 C3'3' 2 55. We rewrite the system in the form x+y=7z, x2+y2 = 37---[- z2, (1) x3+y3=1+z3 Squaring thefirstequation and eliminating x2+y2 by means of the second equation we find which implies (7 + z)2 = 37 + z2 + 2xy, xy=6-]-7z 110 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Further, we obtain (7 ± x)3 = x3 + y3 + 3xy (x + y), that is x3+y3=(7+z)3-3 (6+7z) (7+z)=z3- 18z +217. (2) Comparing (2) with the last equation of system (1) we find that z = 12. But then we have x±y= 19, xy=90. Solving this system of two equations we receive x1=9, y1=10,Z,=-12,and x2=10, Y2=91 Z2=12. Itisreadilyverified by substitution that these two sets of numbers satisfy the original system as well. Thus, the original system has two solutio-is. 56. Dividing the first equation by the second one and by the third we obtain y+z5z+x4 x+y = 3'x+y- 3 Multiplying both equations by x+y we find 5x+2y-3z-0, x+4y-3z=0.} These equations imply that y=2x and z=3x. Substituting the latter expressions into the first equation of the original system we see that x2=I. Finally, we get xj=l, yi=2, za=3 and xz=-1, y2=-2, z2=-3. The direct verification shows that both solutions satisfy the original system as well. 57. Noting thatthedifference of every two equations of the system can be factorized, we form the differences between the first and second equations and between thefirstand third ones. Combining (<ie two equations thus obtained with the third equation of the original system w, arrive at the following system.- (U-W) (u±w-1)=0, ' }(v-w) (v+w-1)=O 'w2+u2+v=2. (1) Itisobvious that any solution of the original system satisfies system (I). Since,converselyall equations of the original system can be obtained by addition and subtraction of the equations of system (1), any solution of system (1) is a solution of the original system, and, hence, these two systems are equivalent. System (1) can be decomposed into the following four systems: u-W=0, v-w=0,(2) u-w=0' o+tv-1 = 0,(3) cw2+u2+v=2, w2+u2+v=2, u+w-l =0, ,u+w-1=0 v-w=0,(4) 1=0,V-4-w- (5)) w2+u2+v=2, w2+u2+v=2, Itapparently follows that all the solutions of the above four systems and only they are the solutions of the original system. Each of the four systems is readily reduced to a quadratic equation and has two solutions. Below, omitting SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA Ill the calculations, we give the corresponding solutions (u, v, w). The solutions of system (2): (-1-{17-l+Y177-I+V 4 4 4 C-1-Vi7-1-if 7-1-y 17 4 4 4 The solutions of system (3): (1, 0,1).1' 2'-2 The solutions of system (4): (0,1,1); The solutions of system (5): (1,, 1, 0); C 2, __2_T' 1 13_2' _2' 2 Thus the original system has the total of eight solutions. 58. Subtracting the first equation from the second we get z2-y2+x(z-y)=3 whence we find (z-y)(x+y+z)=3. Subtracting the second equation from the third we similarly find (y-x) (x+y+z)=3. From the two latter equations it follows that z-y=y-x. (I) Now we rewrite the original system in the form (x- y)2 =1-3xy, (x-z)2 = 4-3xz, (2) (y-z)2=7-3yz. From (1) we conclude that the right-hand sides of the first and third equations of system (2) are equal, i. e. I-3xy=7-3yz, whence it follows that 2z-x=-. (3) y According to (1) we have z+x=2y, (4) and therefore, solving (3) and (4) as simultaneous equations we find x=y- I'z=y+y. Substituting the expression of x thus obtained into the first equation of the ori- ginal system we obtain 3y4-4y2+ 1 =0, which implies YI,2=+11Y3,4=+ 112 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS As a result, we find the following four sets of numbers: (0,1, 2),(0, -1, -2)1 2 1 4 Y3 ,Y3 'Y3 21 4 CY3' Y3'Y3 The corresponding verification shows that theyall satisfy the original system. 59. Multiplying the left-hand and right-hand sides of the equations we get (xlx2...xn)n-2 = ala2...a., whence 11-2 x1x2 ... X, =ar a2 ... a,. Let us rewrite the kth equation of the system in the form 2akxk = xrx2.. xn. It follows, by virtue of (1), that n-2 xk ala2...a.(k= 1, 2,..,n). al? (1) The substitution into the original system indicates that this set of numbers sa- tisfies it. Thus, the problem has a unique solution. 60. First note that for a= 1the system takes the form (x+ y+z)2 = k2, (x+y+z)2 = 12, (7t+y-i- z)2 = m2. The latter system is solvable only if the additional condition k2=12=m2 (1) holds. In this case we obviously obtain an infinite number of solutions. In what follows we may thus suppose that 1. Adding together all equations of the system and putting, for brevity, x+Y+Z=t we get (2) V (a+ 2)=0+12+M2. By the hypothesis, the right-hand side is positive and therefore for a=-2 the system has no solutions at all. For a #-2 (3) we find k2 +12 -+- m2 t = 4j- 2±afi - () SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA Now, transforming the equations of the system to the form t2+t (a-1)x=k2, t' +t (a-1)y=12 t2+t (a-1)z=m2, 113 and solving them we determine, according to (4), two sets of values of x and y: a+2 k2(a+l)-12-m2x_ - k2+12+m2(a+2) (a-1) y- a-{-212 (a+1)-k2-m2 k2+12-+2(a+2) (a-1) -ha+2rn2(a+1)-k2-12 k2 f-12+m2(a+2) (a-1) Finally, we check by substitution that both triplets of numbers satisfy the ori- ginal system. Thus, in the general case when a - 1 and a-2 the system has two different solutions. 61. Squaring the first equation and subtracting the second equation from the resulting relation we find xy+yz+zx=11. The third equation then implies that (xy)2 + 3xy-10=0- Solving this equation we get (xy)1=2,(xy)2=-5. Now there can be two possibilities here: (1) Let (1) (2) xy=2 (3) Eliminating x-(-y from the first and third equations of the original system we arrive at the following equation in z: z2-6z+9=0. Hence, 2(1)=3. The first equation of the original system then gives x+y=3. Combining this equation with equation (3) and solving them we get xlM=1yil2, x211=2 y21'=1. (2) Now, in conformity with (2), we suppose that xy = -5. From the first and third equations we then obtain z2-6z+16=0. (4) This equation has no real roots and, consequently, we may not consider the case (4). Thus, the set of possible solutions (x, y, z) consists of (1, 2, 3)and(2,1, 3). 114 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Substituting these values intothe original system we check that both triplets satisfy it. Thus, all real solutions of the system have been found. 62. One can easily note that the left-hand sides of the equations can be facto- rized which brings the system to the form (x+y) (x+z)= a, 1 (x+y)(y+z)=b,( (1) (x+ z) (y+z)=c ) Let us put, for brevity, x+y=u,x+z=v.y+z=ray. Then we can write uv=a, uw = b, ow=c. Multiplying all the equations we find (uvw)2 = abc, whence avw=+Vatic.. (2) (3) Now all the solutions of system (2) are found without difficulty. First taking the plus sign in formula (3) and then the minus sign we conclude that system (2) has two solutions, namely rabcVaticVatic u1=vi =Wl = (4)c b a dan - Vatic u=- V=v - Vatic=W 5)2c b2 a2 ( Now we have only to solve the two systems of equations obtained after the va- lues (4) and (5) have been substituted into the right-hand sides of the equations x+y=u, x--z=v,l (6) y+z=W.f Adding together equations (6) we get x+y+z= u+2+W. Whence, by vir tue of (6),it readily follows that x_u-f-v-w_u-v-j-rvz_-u+v-I-W 2y2 2 (7) Thus, the original system has only two solutions which are determined by for- mulas (7) after the values (4) and (5) have been substituted into them. 63. Adding together all the equations we find a2 + b2 + c2 (1)xy+xz Iyz=2 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA By virtue of the equations of the system we now easily obtain xy = xz = yz = a2+b2-c2 2 2-b2+,2a = a, 2=P1 - a2+b2+c2 2=Y. 115 (2) For brevity we have denoted the obtained fractions by a, 0 and y. It should also be notedthat ifthe original systemissolvable, all the three numbers a. S and y aredifferent from zero.Indeed,let,forinstance, a=0. Then Py=xyz2 =0. Adding the first equation of system (2) to the second and third ones wd get a2 = P,V = Y which implies a2b2=0 and thus, according tothe conditions of the problem, we arrive atacontradiction.Hence, a4y 56 0. System (2) therefore coincides with system(2) of the preceding problem. Consequently, it has two solutions xl = and yi -- Y2 = (4) It can be readily verified that the same two sets of numbers satisfy theorigi- nal system as well. Thus, all the solutions of the system are given by formu- las (3) and (4). 64. Let us put xy+XZ+yz=t3 (1) Then the system is written in the form y3+z3 =2at3, 1 z3+x3 =2bt3, (2) X3 +y3= 2c13. J Adding together all equations of this system we find that X3 + y3 + Z3 = (a + b + c) P. (3) Subtracting in succession the equations of system (2)from thelatter equation we obtain x3=(b+c-a) P, y3=(c-(-a-b)t3,z3=(a+b-c)13, whence we find x-= 3Vy= z= 3Va-i- b-c t .(4) Substituting these expressions into Vequation (1) we conclude that either E=0 or t2=3 (b+c-a) (c+a-b) + V (b+c-a) (a+b-c) + + 3l(c-f-a-b) (a-l-b-c). Substituting these values of tinto formulas (4) we find two solutions of the original system. YaFYZ=I1(3) !a 116 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 65. Put x+y=u.x+z=v,y+z=w. Then the system is rewritten in the form u-i-v =auv, (1)u+w=buw, v+w=cuw.I Obviously, system (1) has the following solution: U=0'V=0'W=0. (2) Note furthermore, thatif u=0 then the first equation (1) implies v=0 and the third equation implies w=0. Therefore we shall only limit ourselves to the cases when From system (1) we finduvrv PE 0. W +u=c This system has the same form as system (6) in Problem 62. Applying the same method we obtain Ia+b-c u2 1a-b-F-c u =2 (3) 1-a+b+c Hence, system (1) can have a solution other than solution (2) only if the addi- tional condition a+b-c=a? 0,a-b+c=p 0 0, (4) -a+b+c=y 94- 0 holds. If condition (4) Is fulfilled, we obtain from formulas (3) the expressions 2 2?u=v= - ,w= Y , (5)a To compete the solution we have to solve the following two systems: x+y= 2 x+ y01 x+z=0,( (6)x+z= y+z =0, Jy+z= Y . (7) System (7) appears onlyif condition (4) is fulfilled. Either system has exactly qne solution. Namely, the solution of system (6) is x=0,y=0,z=0, SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 117 and system (7) has the solution I 1 1 I 1 1 lo; Thus, the original system has only azero solution x=y=z=0, and ifthe additional condition (4) is fulfilled, there appears one more solution determined by formulas (8) and (4). 66. The form ofthe second equationof the systemindicates that x #1 0, y0 and z ;6 0.Reducing thefractions on the left-hand side of the second equation to a common denominator we get, by virue of the third equation, the relation xyz = 27. (1) Multiplying then the third equation by z and taking into account (1), we can write 27 + (x + y) z2 = 27z. Substituting the expression x+y= 9-z found from the first equation of the system into the latter equation we obtain z3-9z2+27z-27 =0, i e. (z-3)3=0. Therefore z=3. Substituting this value both in the first equa- tion andin(1) we findthat x=3 and y=3. This resultis, by the way, quite obvious since all the unknowns are involved symmetrically into the equa- tions ofthe system. Thus, ifth° system is solvable, the only solution is the triplet of numbers x=3, y=3, z=3. The direct substitution into the original system confirms that this set of numbers is in fact a solution. Thus, the system is solvable and has the unique solution x=3,y=3,z=3. 67. Substituting the quantity x+y found from thefirst equation into the second one we get xy+z (a-z)=a2. Expressing xy from this equation and substituting it into the third equation we obtain z3-az2+a2z-aa=0. The left-hand side of the latter equation is readily factorized: (z-a) (z-al) (z+ai)=0. It follows that z1 =a,Z2 = at,Z3 - - ai. Substituting z=a into the first and second equations we arrive at the system x+y=0,xy=a2 whose solutionis x- +ia, y= T- ia.It isreadily verified that both triplets of numbers (x, y, z) of the form (ia, -ia, a)and(-ia, ia, a) satisfy the original system. Analogously, we find two more pairs of solutions corresponding to the values z2 and z3: (a, - la, ia),(- ia, a, ia)and((a, a, - ia),(a, (a, - ia). 118 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Thus,the systemissatisfied by the above sixsolutions, and there are no other solutions. This result can be achieved in a shorter way if we use a relationship between the system under consideration and the roots of the cubic equation t3 - at2 + a2t - a3 = 0. (1) Namely, according to Vieta's formulas [see (2), page 101 the three roots tl = a,tz = ia,t3 = - is of equation (1) (taken in any order) form a solution of the system in question. Thus, we have already obtained six (i.e. 31)solutions.Let us show that the system has no other solutions.Indeed,let(x5,yr, z1) be asolution ofthe system. Consider the cubic equation (t -x1) (t - ya) (t -zi) = 0 (2) whose rootsarethe numbers xl, yl and zt.Removing the brackets in equa tion (2) and using the equalities xr + yI + zi = a, x1yl + yizi + xlz, =a2, xiyrzi = a3, we reveal that equations (2) and (1) coincide. Consequently, x5,yr and z, are the mots of equation (1) which is what we set outto prove. The same argu- ment can be used in solving the preceding problem. 68. Substituting x found from the first equation into the second one we get 3y'+z2=0. (1) By virtue of the third equation, it follows that 3y2 - xy = 0. (2) Therefore, we have either y=0 or x=3y. In the case y= 0 we see that according to (1) we have z = 0. By virtue of the first equation of the given system we also conclude that x=0. In the case y= -2z we substitute x expressed by the equality x = 3y into the second equation of the system and thus obtain 2y2+4yz=-0. (3) If now y=0, we arrive at the former case, and if y=-2z, then condition (I) implies that z=0, and, consequently, y=0 and x=0. The assertion has thus been proved. 69. From the identity (x+y+z)2=x2+y2+z2+2 (xy+xz+yz), (1) by virtue of the first and second equations of the system, we get xy+xz+yz=0. (2) Now let us consider theidentity obtained by cubing the trinomial x-{-y+z: (x+Y4 z)3=x3-1-y34-z3+3x2y+3x22+3xy2+6xyz+3xz2 -+-3y2z+3yz'-.(3) Its right-hand side can be represented in the form x3+y3+ z3+3x (xy+Xz+yz)+3y (xy+yz+xz)+3z2 (x+y). SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 119 Consequently, identity (3), by virtue of the equations of the system and equa- lity (2), implies that 3z2 (x+ y) = 0. (4) There can be the following two cases here: (1) If z=O, then, according to (2), we have xy=O. Taking Into account the first equation of the system, we get the two sets of values xi = a,y> =0,z1 =0 (5) and x2 = O,J2 = a,z2 = 0. (6) It can be easily seen that formulas (5) and (6) determine two solutions of the original system. (2) If x + y = O, then from the condition (2) we again get xy = O, and, hence, x=0 and y=0. From thefirstequation of the system it then follows that z=a, and we thus arrive at another solution of the original system: x3 = 0,Y3=01z3 = a. (7) Thus, if a ;6 0 the system has three different solutions, and if a=0 it possesses only a zero solution. 70. Let us consider the identity (x+y+Z)3=x3+y3+z3+3x2y+3x2z+3xy2+6xyz-f 3xz2+3y2z+3yz2.(1) Transform its right-hand member as follows: x3 + y3+z3+3x (xy+xz+yz)+3y (xy+xz+ yz)+3z (xy+xz+ yz)-3xyz. It follows that identity (1) can be rewritten as (x-i-y+z)a=x3+y3+z3+3(x±y-I-z) (xy+xz+yz)-3xyz.(2) From relation (2)itis seen that for determining the sum x3+y3+z3 itis sufficient to express xy+xz+yz and xyz from the original system. Squaring the first equation and subtracting the second one from the result we get xy+xz+yz= 2 (a2-b2). (3) Let us rewrite the third equation in the form xyz=c(xy+xz+yz). (4) Now taking into consideration (3) and (4) we finally find from (2) the expression x3+ya+z3=a3- 2 3 3 3a(a2-b2)+ 2 c(a2-b2)=a3 2 (a2-b2)(c--a). 71. Removing the brackets we rewrite the second equation in the form x2+ y2+z2+3xy+3xz+3yz- 1, which implies (x+y+z)2 -{-xy+xz+ yz = I. Now using the first equation of the system we derive xy+xz+ yz =-3. (1) The third equation of the system can be represented in the form x (xy+xz) +y (yz+xy) -f- z (xz + yz) _ -6 120 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and therefore, taking into account (1), we obtain which implies 1. e, x (3+yz)+y(3+xz)+z(3+xy) =6. x+y+z+xyz=2, xyz=0. We thus arrive at the following system: x+y+Z-2, xy+xz+yz=-3, (2) xyz = 0. From the last equation ofthis systemitfollows that at least one of the unknowns is equal to zero, Let x=0, then y+z=2,yz=-3, whence either y=3, z=-1 or y=-1, z=3. The cases y=0 and z=0 are treatedanalogously.Thus, we get the followingsixsolutions(x, y, z) of system (2): (03, - 1);(-1, 0, 3);(0, -1, 3); (3, -1, 0);(3, 0, -1);(-1, 3, 0). Itis readily checked that all these solutions satisfy the original system as well. Thus, the problem has six solutions. 72. Removing the bracketsinallthe equations we note that if the third equation is subtracted from the sum of the first two, then the following equation is obtained: (x-y+z)2=a-b+c. (1) Similarly, we deduce (x+y-z)2=a+b-c (2) and (y+z-x)2=b+c-a. (3) It can be easily shown that, conversely, the original systemisa consequence ofthe system ofequations(1),(2) and (3).Indeed, adding,for example, equations (2) and (3), we obtain the second equation of the original system and so on. Thus, the original system is equivalent to that obtained. Therefore, it is sufficient to find all solutions of the system of equations (1), (2) and (3). Let us put, for brevity, )lb+c-a= a1.JIa-b+c=b1._a+&-c= c1. Then the system of equations (1), (2),(3)is equivalent to the following eight linear systems x-y+z=+b1, x+y-Z=+c1, -x+y+z=±a1 (4) Taking the plus sign on the right-hand sidesofall equations we easily find the following unique solution of the corresponding system: x=b1 2 c1. Y=at 2 c1b1 +a1Z=2 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 121 Considering all the possible combinations of signs ofthe right-hand members, we find another seven solutions: 1-b1+cla1+cl-br+a,)b,-c1a1-c1br+al 2_2'2 C2' 2' 2 Cb,+ci-al+clb1-allC-bl-c1ar-c1D -bl+a1 22 2f 2 22J C-b1+c1-a,+cl-b1-all.(b1-c1-a1-c1b, -ai 222l 2 l 2 2 C-b1-c1-a1-c1 -b1-a,) 222 The eight solutions thus found obviously represent all the possible solutions of the system. 73. Rewrite the third equation of the system in the form z2+xy-Z (x±y) =2 (1) Substituting z2 found from the second equation and z (x+ y) expressed from the first one into (1) we get x2+y2+xy-47+xy=2, or(x+y)2=49. Whence we derive x-}- y= ±7. (2) Multiplying both sides of the first equation by 2 and adding the second equation to it we obtain (x±y)2+2z (x+y)=94+22. (3) There are two possible, cases here: (1) If in formula (2) the plus sign is chosen, then substituting x+ y expres- sed from the equation x+y=7 into (3) we get z2-14z+45=0. Denoting the roots ofthelatter equation byzil) and zwe find zll =9 and z'2')=5. For z=9 it follows from equation (1) that xy=-16. Combining this equation with x+ y=7 and solving them we find cn7+ Y113cu7- Y113 X1 =2y1 =2 and xa> =7- Y11321,=7+ V1133 2 y2 Finally, if z=5, then from (1) we determine xy= 12. Solving the system xy12, x+y=7, we obtain x31)=4,ys1,=3 and Al)=3, yal1=4. (2) In the case x+y=-7 we similarly obtain the equation z2+14z+45=0. Its roots arezit,=-9 and zs =-5. Solving then in succession the two systems of equations of form xy=-16, (4) x+y=-7. 122 and PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS xy=12, x{-y=-7,} we find from system (4) the roots X1-7 -YT-i3 i 2 and 2 -2 y(2)=-7+ 1113 2 (2)--7+ 1113(2)-7- V113 = and from system (5) the roots x(2)s = -4. and 292 Y3 =-3 (5) x?=-3,y4)=-4. Our argument implies that only the following eighttripletsof numbers x, y, z) can represent the solutions of the original system: C7+ I 1337- 2 1 33 9` ) . (7- 2 113 7+113 9/JJ /J 11 13-7 + 11 33 (4, 3, 5);(3. 4, 5); 7- 2 2, -9; C-71113 -7- 1113 2 2.9) ;(-4, -3, -5); (-3, -4, -5). Substituting these values into the system we check that they all are in fact solutions. 74. Let (x, y, z) be a real solution of the system. Consider the first equation of the system. By equality (1) on page 20, we have 2z 1 -E- z2 The first equation then implies that xEz. (1) Similarly, from the second and third equations of the system we obtain y<x (2) and z - y. (3) The system of inequalities (1)-(3) is satisfied only if x=y=z. (4) Substituting z=x into the first equation we find xi = 0,x2 = 1. From (4) we finally conclude that the system has two real solutions, namely (0, 0, 0) and (I,I,1). 75. Let xj, x2,., x be arealsolutionofthe system. The numbers xk (k= I,..., n) are obviously of the same sign. For definiteness,letus suppose SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 12.3 that they all are positive. Xk > 0 (if otherwise, we can change the signs in all equations of the system). Let us show that xk1/ 2(k = 1, 2,..., n). (1) Indeed, by inequality (1) on page 20, we have 1/2 Xk+Xk2 / Xk Xk=2 whence it follows, by virtue of the equation of the system, thatinequality (1) is fulfilled. Now adding together all the equations of the system we obtain xi+x2+...+x,,=2+2+...+?. (2) X1X2Xn According to condition (1) equality (2) is only possible if all the unknowns are equal to 1/'2. It can be easily verified that the numbers x1 =x2 = ... =X11= Y 2 satisfythe original system and thereforeithas a positive solution which is unique. Changing the signs of the values of the unknowns we get another real solution x1=x2=... =Xn=-Y2. Thus, the system has only two real solutions. 76.Let x,y,zbe asolutionof the system. Expressing x from the first equality and substituting it into the second and third ones we obtain (a-b)+(c-b) y+(d-b) z=0, (a2-b2)+(c2-b2) y+(d2-b2) z=0. Whence we find, after some simple transformations, the expressions (a-b) (a-d)(a-b) (a-c) Y (c-b) (c-d)'z(d-b) (d-c)' Substituting these values of y and z into the first equality we obtain (b-c) (b-d) Consequently, we can write the inequality xyz=(a-b)2 (a-c)2 (a-d)2> 0. (b-c)2 (c-d)2 (d-b)2 77. If a t 0, then x= a is not a root of the equation.Dividing both sides of the equation by 3V (al-X)2 we replace it by the equivalent equation Y Y la±x)2+4-5 Ya+x 3 Putting 1=a±x we find t1=4, 12=1. It follows that xi=63 a and x1=0. If a=0, the original equation has only one root x= O. 78. By substitution we verify that x= 1is not a root. Therefore, after both sides have been divided by '/(l -x)2 the equation turns into the equivalent equation (a-c) (a-d) (1±x)2-I_ Y1-X 124 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS ± XDenoting bytwe getthe equation t2-1 =t, i.e. 0-1-1 -0. Whence we find tt = 1 +z ITand t2=1-lYSince the second value is ne- gative,thenif m iseven,the value t2 should be discarded according to our convention concerning the roots of equations. Thus, for even m we have l+x l+Y5 V1-x -2' l-x' 2J and, consequently, ('2)'-I 2 X- 2 If m is odd, the equation has the roots, namely )M- fY51I 2 (I f1m+1 l2l 79. Making the substitution2=t>0 we obtain 1`t2+21+ 1 4 jy12+6t+9= 14. This implies t+1+f+3=14 and t=5. Solving the equation j/-2y-5 = 5, we find y=15. 80. Multiplying both sides of the equation by V x-}x we get x- j/= 2 y X. (1) Since x > 0 (for x=0 the right-hand side of the original equation makes no sense), equation (1) is equivalent to the equation 21 x-1=2Yx-l. Squaring bothsides of the latter equation we see that it has the unique root x=T-25which also satisfies the original equation. 81. Multiplying both sides ofthe equation by 1fx+11 and putting x2+ +8x=t we arrive at the equation Yt+Yt+7=7. This equation has a unique root: t=9. Solving then the equation x2+8x-9=0 we find x1=-9 and x2-1. The original equation, by virtue of the convention concerning the values of roots, is only satisfied by x= 1. 82. Cubing both sides of the equation we obtain x-1+3 V(x-1)2 x+1+3 x-1 (x } 1)2+x+1 =2x3. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 125 Whence we find 2x+3VVx-1{ 3 Vx{ l2x3. (1) On the basis of the original equation we thus can write 2x+3 Vx2- 1 x V 2= 2x3. (2) After some simple transformations we deduce xV;21 [3 V2-2 V Thus we findallthe numbers which can serve as the roots of the original equation. Indeed, we obviously have x1=0,x2=I,x3=-I. Solving then the equation 3 V2=2 V(x2 - 1)3, we find 27=4 (x2-1)2,(x2-1)2= 47 ,x2= 1 f3 2 Since we are only interested in real roots,it follows that x2=1+3r3 2 Consequently,x4=I//_1+ 2 3,x6 Itis readily checked by substitutionthatx1, x2 and x3 are roots of the original equation. But the direct substitution of the values x4 and x5 involves some difficulties. We proceed therefore as follows. Let us put a= Y x4-1, b= 3x4-)- I and 3 C= V 2x4, and show that a+b=ca (3) Since x4 satisfies equation (2), we have as + 3abc 4- b3 = c3, (4) andthus we must show that (4) implies (3). Note that if a±b is substituted for c into (4)thisresults in anidentity. Consequently, according to Bezout's theorem, the expression c3-3abc-a3-b3 regardedasapolynomial in c is divisible by the binomial c-(a+b) Performing the division we get c3-3abc-a3-b3 =fc-(a+b)1 {c2+c(a+b)+a2-ab+b2}. (5) By(4), the left-handside of(5)is equal to zero. Itis however readily seen thata > 0, b > 0, c > 0, which implies thatthe expression in the braces is positive. Thus, equality(3)has been proved. We then similarly prove that xr, is also a root of the original equation. 83. Transposing jIx totheleft-handside and squaring both members of the equation we getk. Vx- a+16=x-2a. 126 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Squaring then both sides of the resulting equation we find that x= 4 is the only root of the equation. Substituting it into the equation we obtaih }fall- l6a+64-2 ra2-8a-}- 19- Ya2, which implies, since the radicals are positive, the relation Ia-81=21 a-41-1 a1. (1) For a-8 equality (1) is fulfilled. Consequently, for a :8 the original equation z has a root x= 4.For 4<a < 8 condition (1)is not fulfilled because 8-a ¢ 2 (a-4)-a. For 0-a < 4 condition (1) takes the form 8-a=2 (4-a)-a andisonlyfulfilled for a =O. Finally, for a < 0 condition (1) turns into the identity 8-a=2(4-a)+a. Hence, for a:8 and a<0 the equation has the only root a2 X=-17- For 0 < a < 8 there are no roots at all. 84. Squaring both members of the first equation and substituting the expres- sionof x2+ y2 found from the second equation into the resulting equation we obtain 36xy-1=+ 64xy + 256 (xy)2. Again squaring both members of the equation we arrive at a quadratic equa. tion with respect to t=xy: 65012-85t+2=0. Solving this equation we find t1=10 and t2=s5' Now consider the following two systems of equations: x2 + y2 + 4xy = 5 I (1) xy=i0, ) xy= 65' (2) Obviously,allthesolutionsofthe original system are solutionsofthese systems. Solving system (1) we find (x+y)2=b-2xy=b -5=0. x2+y2+4xy= 2 Consequently, x+y=0, and thus we get two solutions of system (I): t t t tx1_y10 ,yr=- j/-10 ;x2=- y10 Iy2=17'10' SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 127 Transforming the first equation of system (2) to the form (x+y)2=65 we reduce the system to the following two systems: 3 3 x+Y y65 X-J-y=-1- '2 (2') 21 65 xy85,) xy=65 System (2') has two solutions, namely 2 1and 1 2 X3 _ V65 y3 =y65 x4 = V=65 ya = System (2\") also has two solutions: 2 1 1 2 xa = -ya = - Y65' and x6=-Y6 Y65 ' V65 As is readily verified, the original system is only satisfied by the first, second, third and sixth sets of numbers. Thus, the system has exactly four solutions. 85. Putting V 3x=u, V Y=v we can rewrite the given system in the form u3-v3 2 (u2v-uv2), u-v=3. The first equation is transformed to the form (u- 0)2+3uv= 2 uv, whence we find UV= 18. Combining the latter equation with the second equation of the system and solving them we find u1=6, v1=3 and u2=-3, v2=-6. Returning to the original system we get its two solutions: x,=216, yl=27 and x2=-27, y2=-216. 86. Making the substitution Vywe transform the first equation to the form212-31-2=0.

Consider now the following two systems of equations: y+l1, +l2,l Yx-y( (1) x-y x+xy+y=7,fx+xy+y=7 1 System (1) possesses two solutions: (-5, -3);(3,1).

Taking into account that 1x+y-xz - z x-YIx-yI and multiplying the first equation by x-y we obtain (2) x2 -y2-Yx2-.y2-12=0forx-y > 0 and x2-y2+ Vx2-y2-12=0forx-y < 0.

Put Yx2-12y+1 =t. Then the first equation can be written in the form t2-8t+16=0. It follows that t1. 2=4, and thus we obtain x2-12y=15. Noting that y -A 0, we multiply the second equation by to the form This implies 129 (1) transforms it 2yj2-2 (2y xj/ I 1} 3y -}-I 1-} F ) =0. FY -0. (2)1+3y Raising to the second power we arrive at the equation / 3( yl2-16(y)-12=0, wherefrom we find Cy/1 6,\\y/2-3 Itis obvious that the second value does not satisfy equation (2) and therefore we confine ourselves to the system x2-12y=15, X=6. y This system has two solutions (5, 6) and (-3, - 2 / which, as is readily seen, satisfy the originalsystem`as well. 90. Rationalizing the denominators of the first equation, we obtain 4x2-2y217 y2= T* Whence we find ( y)14 In the second equation we put and 1/x2+xy+4=t, (1) 5-323 130 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and rewrite it in the form t2+t-56=0. Hence, we obtain ti = 7 and 12=-8. Since in (1) we have t0, the second root must be discarded.As a result, we arrive at the following two systems of equations: 5 X = 4 y, (2) x2+xy-45=0 and 5 (3) x2+xy-45=0. The solutions of system(2)are (5, 4) and (-5, -4). The solutions of (3) are (15, -12) and (-15, 12). These four solutions satisfy the original system as well. 91. Expressing x from the second equation and substituting it into the first one we obtain a 2 412 2y+5 y3yy333+5. Putting here 1y 3y-1we arrive at the equation 12+31-18=0. Whence we find 1o = 3,12 = -6. Since, by the hypothesis, tis non-negative, we have only one equation 9y2-4y-28=0. Combining this equation with the second equation of the original system, we find their two solutions x,=3, y1=2 and 17 14 x2=27,Y2=-V- 92. Let us putyx2-6y+I =t _-0. Then the first equation is written in the form t2-8t+ 16=0. Whence we obtain t = 4, and thus x2-6y-15=0. (1) If now we put x2y = u in the second equation and take into account (1), we get the equ, tion 9u2 - 241u - 13 230 = 0, from which tae obtain ul'=54 and u2=-245 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 131 We thus arrive at the two systems of equations x2-6y-15=0,X2-6y- x2y =04, (2) x2245 j (3) y9 Eliminating x2 from system (2), we obtain the equation 2y2+5y-18=0, whose roots are y1=2 and y2=-4 2. The second root must be discarded be- cause, by virtue of the equation x2y=54, it leads to nonreal values of x. Hence, system (2) has two real solutions: System (3) is reduced to the equation 54y2 +135y + 245 = 0, which has no real solutions. Thus, the original system has two real solutions. 93. Put =u>0,Y y=v>0. (1) Then the system is rewritten in the following way. u (u2 ` v2) v = 2 (u2 + v2) u = 3v.1 System (2) has an obvious solution, namely u=0,v=0. (2) (3) Therefore, in what follows we suppose that u ? 0, and hence (by virtue of the equations) we also have v0. Multiplying the right-hand and left-hand sides of equations (2) we obtain u9-v°= 32' (4) Multiply then the first equation of system (2) by v, the second by u and adding them together we obtain the following equation: u4-0 -}-2u2v2= 2 uv. By virtue of (4), we have Whence we find 4(uv)2-7uv+3=0. (5) 3 (UV)1 = 1,(UV)2 = 4 Now consider the two systems of equations UV= 111(6) uu= (7) (u2+u2)u=3v, )) It is obvious that any solution of system (2) other than (3) is among the solu- tions of these systems. 5* 132 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Multiplying the second equation of system (6) by u we find, by virtue of the first equation, that u4=2. Whence, taking into account (1), we get u4/2, '=V28 . Analogously, we also find the solution of system (7) satisfying the condition (1): u=2,v=2. Itis easy to check that both solutions also satisfy system (2). Thus, system has three solutions: (0,0),(v2, 22(34 3 ,43 ) the original 94. Squaring both members of the first equation we obtain a Yxy-ya=x- c. (1) By virtue of the second equation, we have 3a2Yx2 }y2 =2 -x. (2) Now squaring both sides of the second equation of the original system we receive P-+-Y,Yxa-y2= a4 2-x2. Whence, by virtue of (1) and (2), we findl (302_X)2 -x2= Cx- 2 1 Removing the brackets we obtain x= 8 a2. After this we easily get from equa- tion (1) the two values of y '`yr=aa 8 yz=-az Y8 T The verification by substitution shows however that the original system has only \\ one solution (-a-5a2, alr3 V 8 ). 95. Let us put Yx=u:0 and Yy=v>0. (1) This reduces the system to the form u3-v3=a(u-v), u4 + uzv2 + v4 = b2 (2) It appears obvious that thelatter systemfallsinto two systems of the form u--e=0,1 u2+uv+v2=a, u4+u2v2+v4=b2, j (2')andu4+u2v2+v4=b2.

ALGEBRA 133 Passing to system (2\"), we transform both equations in the following way: u2'+ v2 = a- uv,(u2+ v2)2= bz+ u2v2 This yields the values of uv and u2+v2: a2 - b2 UV= 2a' a2+b3 u2+p2- 2aJ (4) It can easily be shown that the system of equations (4) is equivalent to system (2\"). From equations (4) we receive (a + v)2 _3a2-b2 2a (u -v)2601-al= 2a (5) It should be notedthat, by virtue of (1), the right-hand member of the first equation of system (4) must be non-negative; the right-hand member of the second equationof system (5) must also be non-negative. Thus, we must impose the condition a2 : b2 (6) because,ifotherwise, system(5), and,hence, system (2\")have no solutions satisfying condition (1). Solving system (5) we get _3a2-b2 31 -a2U02a,-v= f Y2a Finally we obtain '3a2_b21( 3b2- a2y 2 2a 2a _1 3a'2-623b2-a2 v2 2a 2a As is easily seen, by virtue of condition(6),bothpairs of values(u, v) are non-negative.

Algebraic Inequalities 96. For the quadratic trinomial ax2+bx+c(a 36 0) to be positive for all x itis necessary and sufficient that a > 0 and the discri- minant D of the trinomial be negative. In our case we have a=r2-1 > 0 (1) and D=4 (r- 1)2-4 (r2- 1)=-8 (r- 1) < 0. (2) Inequalities(1) and (2)are fulfilled simultaneously forr > 1.It should also be noted that for r = I the polynomial under consideration is identically equal to 1. Thus, all the sought-for values of r are determined by the inequality r>l. 97. If we put xy-- Y+X u and take into account thatxl +j2=u2-2, the givenexpressionisreadily transformed to the form yx 3u2-8u+4. (I) If x and y are of opposite signs, then u < 0 and trinomial (1) is positive. If x and y are of the same sign, itis easily seen that u:_::-2. The roots of quadratic trinomial (1) being equal to 3 and 2, the trinomial is non-negative for u .2. Thus, the trinomial is non-negative both for a < 0 and u-_:-2, and, consequently,the original expressionis non-negative for all real nonzero values of x and y. 98. Note that x2-x+1 > 0 forallvalues of x because the discriminant of the quadratic trinomial is equal to -3 < 0 and the coefficient in x2 is posi- tive.Therefore itis permissible to multiply bothinequalities by the denomi- nator. This results in -3x2+3x-3 < x2--ax-2, x2+ax-2 < 2x2-2x+2, that is 4x2+(a-3) x+ I > 0, x2-(a+2)x+4 > 0. The first inequality is fulfilled for all x if and only if the discriminant of the quadratic trinomial is negative,i. e.if (a-3)2- 16 < 0. Similarly, the second inequality is fulfilledif and only if (a+2)2-16 < 0. Now combining the two inequalities (a-3)2-16 < 0 and (a+2)5-16 < 0 and solving them as a system with respect to a we get -4<a-3<4, -1<a<7 and -4<a-f-2<4,-6<a<2. Hence, we finally obtain -1 < a < 2. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 135 99. By virtue of inequality (I) on page 20, we have a4 + b42a2b2, 0 + d42c2d2. Adding together these inequalities, we obtain a4+b4+c4+d42 (a2b2+c2d2). (1) According to inequality(3) on page 20, after putting u-a2&2 and v=c2d2, we receive a2b2 + c2d2 : 2 JIa2b2c2d2. (2) We always have (the sign > appearsif abcd < 0), and there- fore comparing (1) and (2) we arrive at the required proof. 100. The given system is equivalent to the system x2+(x+a)2+2x- 1,y=x+a. The inequality2x2+2(a+1)x+a2-1<0 has a unique solution with respect to x if and only if the discriminant of the trinomial is equal to zero: (a+1)2-2 (a2- 1)=0, a2-2a-3 =0. Solving the latter equation we find al = 3,a2 = -l. Finally, we consider the two possible cases: (I)If a=3, then z2+4x+4=0 and x=-2, y=1. (2) If a=-l, then x2=0 and x=0, y=-1. 101. Rewrite the given system of inequalities in the following way: 1 y+2 > 1x2-2x!, y<2-1x-11. Since we always have jx2-2xJ>0 and -Ix-l 1>0, we can write -2 <y < 2. The only integers y satisfying this inequality are 0 and 1. Consequently, the given system of inequalities consideredfor integral x and y can be consistent only for the values y=0 and y=]. Let us consider both cases. Case 1.If y=(), the system of inequalities takes the form x2-2xI< 2,Ix-l!<2. The second of these inequalities is satisfied only by the integral numbers 0, 1 and 2. It can easily be checked by substitution that 0 and 2 satisfy the first inequality as well, but itis not satisfied by 1. Thus, for the case y=O two solutions are found, namely x1=0, yl=.O and x2=2, ya=0. l3fi PROBLEMS IN 1IL1 M@NTARY MATHCMA1'ICS Case 2. If y= 1, the original system of inequalities reduces to !x2-2x]< 2,Ix-1I<1. The second inequality is satisfied by the only integral numberx=l which also satisfies the first inequality. Hence, in this case we have one more solution of the problem: X3=11 y3 =1. Thus, the system of inequalities is satisfied by three pairs of integers. 102. There are n summands on the left-hand side of the inequality, the first n-1 summands being greater than the last one. Therefore, n+l+n+2+\"'-} nnn 103. Let Sm denote the left member of theinequality to be proved.

(3)- Let us note that if a number k is greater than unity and less than n, formula (1), as it follows from (2), assumes the form of a strict inequality which obviously leads to a strict inequality in formula (3) as well. For n > 2 there exists such k.- Hence, in this case we have the strict inequality (n!)2 > nn. 106. It can easily be checked that for constructing a triangle with sides a,b and citis necessary and sufficient thatthe numbers a, b, c satisfythe three inequalities a+b-c > 0, a+c-b > 0, (I ) b+c-a > 0. Let us prove that this system of simultaneous inequalities is equivalent to the condition set in the problem. Let us put K Tpat + qb2 - pgc2 Since q -1-p, this expression can be rewritten in the form K == pat + (l - p) b2 - p (l - p) c2 = c2 p2 -}- (a2 -b2 -c2) p + b2, where a, b and c are constants, and p may assume arbitrary values. Thus, K is a quadratic trinomial in p. In the general case the trinomial K can take on values of different sign depending on p. The inequality indicated in the problem is equivalent to the condition that K > 0 forall p. As is known, for this to be so, itis necessary and sufficient that the discriminant D = (a2 - b2 - c2)2 - 4b2c2 of the trinomial be negative (here we take into consideration that the coefficient in p2 i$ equal to c2 > 0). The diseriminant can be represented in the following form: D=(a%-b2_C2)2---4b2c2=(a2-b2-c2--2bc) (a2-b2-c2+2bc) =[a2-(b±c)2] [a2-(b-c)2]=(a+b+c) (a-b-c) (a+b-c) (a-b+c)= _- (a+b+c) (a+b-c) (b+c-a) (c+a-b). If a triangle can be constructed,inequalities (I) are fulfilled,and, hence, D < 0. Thus, we have proved that the existence of such a triangle implies the inequality D < 0. Conversely, if D < 0 then (a+b-c) (b+c-a) (c+a-b) > 0. (2) Let us show that (2) implies inequalities (1). Indeed, suppose that only one ex- pression in the brackets on the left-hand side of (2) is positive and the other two are negative. For instance, let a+b-c < 0 and b+c-a < 0.Adding to- gether these inequalities we get 2b < 0 which is impossible. Thus, we have also proved that the condition D < 0 implies the existence of a triangle with given sides a, b and c. .107, Tragsform thg left member of the inequality in the following way: 4(x-f y)(x+z)X(x+y+z)+y2z2=4(C2+Xy+XZ+yz)(x2+Xy+XZ)+y2z2= =4 (X2.-[_.xy+xz)2+4yz (x2+xy+xz)+y2z2\"= [2 (X2+xy+xz)+yz]2. 138 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS The obtained expression is non-negative for any real x, y and z which is what we set out to prove. 108. Denoting the left member of the inequality by z we transform z in the following way: z=x2-1-2xy+3y2+2x+6y+4=(x+y+ l)2-f-2 (y+ 1)2+ 1. For real x and y the first two summands are non-negative, and, consequently, z > 1. 109. Since x= 124y, the inequality to be proved is equivalent to the ine- quality (14Y)sl+y2 20 which is readily transformed to the equivalent form l00y2-40y-{-4=(l0y-2)2 _:-0, the latter inequality being automatically fulfilled. 110. Since d > 0 and R : r > 0, we have d2+R2-r2 > 0and2dR > 0. Consequently, the given inequality is equivalent to the inequality d2+R2-r2 < 2dR. Reducing it to the form (d-R)2 <r2, we get I d-R I S r,i. e. -r <-d-R <r. Hence, R-r<d<R+r. Ill. Multiplying both members of the desired inequality by a+b+c, weget an equivalent inequality whose left member is equal to (a { b) c)Ca+a-I a}=3+(b(c +b)+( Q- a 9+( I/'by ) 2(YcYb>2+(Yac )2>9. 112. Note that the given expression turns into zero for b = c,c = a and a = b. Therefore, according to Bezout's theorem, itis divisible by the differences a-b, a-c and b-c. Arranging the summands indescending powers of the letter a and performing the division by a-b, we receive a3 (b2-c2)-I-a2 (c3-b3)+b3c2-c3b2=(a-b) 10(b2-0)+=2 (c-b)+bc2 (c-b)). Taking the factor (b-c) outside the square brackets and dividing the remaining polynomial by a-c, we obtain a3 (b2-c2)+ba (c2-a2)+c3 (a2-b2)=-(b-a) (c-b) (c-a) [ac+bc+abl. Since, by the hypothesis, a < b < c and a, b and c are of the same sign, the expression on the right-hand side is negative. 113. We have whence 1-2 Y ak+ak=(1-Yak)2_0, I+ak2 Y -ah .

We have a2 + b2 = (a + b)2 - 2ab = l -tab, a4 + b4 = (I- 2ab)' - 2a2bz. But if a+b=1, then 0<ab< 4,since b21ab6(a+ 24 (see formula (3) on page 20). Consequently,a4+b4l-2. 4-2.6 8 115.

(3)1; write the polynomial in the form x5 (x8- 1) + x (x- 1) + 1. The first two summands being non-negative, we also have in this case x8-x5+x2-x+ 1 > 0. 116. We have (1-}-x)n-i-(l-x)n=2(1-}-Cnx2+C,°1x4-}-...), (1) the last term of the sum in the brackets being equal to xn for even is and to nxn-, for odd n. By the hypothesis, we have - I < x < 1,whence it follows that Cnkx2k < C;k for all integral k. Therefore, (I+x)n+(I-x)n < An, where An is the value of polynomial (1) for x=± 1,i.e. An=2n. 117.

Then the equation takes the form l3(logx y+/ =10. logx y Putting here logs y=t we get the equation 3t2- 101+3=0, having the roots tl = 3 and t,= 3.In the first case logy=3, y = x3 and, by virtue of the second equation of the original system, we obtain x4=81. Since x > 0 and y > 0, here we have only one solution: x, = 3,yr = 27. Putting then log, y= 3we find one more solution x2 = 27,y2 = 3. 144. Let us pass in both equations of the system to logarithms to the b@se 2.

Taking antilogarithms we get xy=12,x+y=8, SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 149 whence it follows that xi = 6,y,=2 and x2=2,y2 = 6. 145. Converting the logarithms in each of the given equations to the base 2 we get xlog2y°y YH(1---log2x), 21og2x=3log2y. From the second equation of system (1) we find x2=y3, whence 3 x=y2 Using (2), we find from the first equation y= 4. Hence, 3 2 x=25,y=25 (1) (2) 146. Let us transform the system by passing to logarithms to the base 2 in thefirst equation, to the base 3 in the second and to the base 4 in the third.

Multiplying the equations of system (1) termwise we find (xyz)2 = 242. Since x > 0, y > 0, z > 0, we thus have xyz = 24. Squaring the first equation of system (1) and using (2) we gat _162x`24=_3 27 32 (1) (2) Analogously, we find y= 8and z= 3 .The verificationby substitution confirms that the three numbers thus found form a solution, 147. Passing over to logarithms to the base 2 in the first equation and then raising we get y2 -xy = 4.

Putting ax=u and oY=v we represent the system in the form u2+v2= 2b, uv=c. These two equations imply (u+v)2=2(b-I-c)and (u-v)2=2(b-c). Since the sought-for values of u and v must be positive, the first equation is reduced to the equation u+v=)/2 (b+c).

Multiplying the equations we get (xy)x + y = (xy)2\". Since x and y are positive, it follows that either xy=I of xy # 1, and then x+y=2n.

ALGEBRA 155 163. Since x > 0, the given inequality is equivalent to the inequality xtogax > a2. But a > 1, and therefore taking logarithms of both sides of the last inequality to the base a we get the equivalent inequality logax>2. From this we deduce the final result: either logs x > 1/7, and, consequently, x > aV-2 or logs x < - Y2 , and then 0 < x < a-v2 . 164. By the meaning of the problem we have x > 0 and therefore the given inequality is equivalent to the inequality loga x (x+ 1) < logo (2x+6). Since a > 1,it follows that x (x+ 1) < 2x+6, that is x2-x-6 < 0. Solving this quadratic inequality for x > 0 we get 0<x<3. 165. The inequality to be established is equivalent to 0 < x2-5x+6 < 1. Since x2-5x+6=(x-2) (x-3), the inequality 0 < x2-5x+6 holds true for x<2 and for x > 3. Solving then the inequality x2-5x+6 < 1, we find that it is satisfied for 5 - Y5 < x < 5 -I- Y5 2 2 Since r5-> 2, we have 5 2 < 2 and, consequently,5+2Y5> 3.The- refore, the original inequality holds true for 5 2 5 <x<2 and 3<x<2 166.Reducing the fractions on the left-hand side to a common denomina- tor, we find and, hence, -l log2x(log2x-1)< I I + loge x (Iog2 x-1) > 0.logz x (loge x-1) The numerator of the last expression is positive [indeed we have I + logx- - loge x= 1092 X_ 2 /+ 9 ,the inequality is reduced to the relation loge x (loge x-1) > 0, which is fulfilled for x > 2 and 0 < x < 1. 156 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 167.According to the meaning of the problem, we have x > 0 and, bence, the given inequality is equivalent to the inequality x3-Iog,2x-flog,x> 1. Taking logarithrps ofboth sidesof this inequality to the base 2 and putting y= loge x, we get an equivalent inequality of the form y (3-y' -2y) > 0, which, after the quadratic trinomial has been factorized, can be written in the form y (l - y) (3 +y) > 0. The latterinequalityisfulfilledif and only if either all the three factors are positive or one of them ispositive and the other two are negative. Accor- dingly, in the first case,i. e. when y>0,1-y>0,3+y>0, we obtain 0 < y < I and, hence, I <x<2. (1) The second case reduces to three subcases among which only one leads to a consistent system of inequalities. Namely, when y<0,1-y>0,3±y<0. We receive y < -3 and, hence, 0<x< 8. Thus, the original inequality holds if and only if either 0<x< 1 or (2) I <x<2. 168. Putting 1og2 x= y and noting that logx 2=11we rewrite the log., xy given inequality in the form y-F y +2 cos x'0. (1) The numbers z = y-} y and y have the same sign, andz 1:-:- 2 for all y (see (2), page 20). Therefore, if z > 0, then the inequality z-2cos. a is fulfilled only if z=2 (i.e., y=1) and cos a=--1 or, in other words, if in the original inequality x=2 and a=(2k+1)2r(k=0, ±1, ±2, ...). For these values the sign of equality appears. But if z < 0, i.e. y < 0, then z<-2, and inequality (1) is fulfilled for all a, whenceitfol ows that the originalinequality holds for 0 < x < 1 and all real values of a besides the values found above. 169.

Let km (m= 1, 2, .. .) be the number of partitions of the desired type when the number of elements equals 2m. Consider 2n elements. Since the order of the pairs is inessential a pair containing the first element can be regarded as the first pair. The pairs containing thefirst element can be formed in 2n-I ways. After a first pair has been selected, the restof 2(n-1) elements can be partitioned into pairsin kn_1 ways.Therefore, kn=(2n-1)kn_1.

Out of the total number n!_ of permutations we have to subtract the number of those in which the elements a and b are adjacent. To form a per- mutation in which the elements a and b are adjacent we can take one of the permutations [whose number is (n-2)!] containing the remaining n-2 elements and add the two elements a and b to it so that they are adjacent. This can be obviously done in 2 (n-1) ways (the factor 2 appears here because a and b can be interchanged). Thus, the number of permutations in which a and b are adjacent isequalto 2 (n-2)!

First solution. For convenience, let us think of the parallel lines as lying one above the other. Suppose that there are n points on the upper line, and m points on the lower one (Fig. 1).Let us break up the set of all joininline segments into the pencils of lines with fixed points on the lower line asvertices. (In Fig.I we see such a pencil of segments joining a point A with all the points on the upperline.) Evidently, the number of these pencils is equal to m, and SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 161 that the number of points of intersection of the segments belonging to two arbit- rary pencils is the same for any pair of pencils. If we denote this number by k, then the total number of points of intersection of all the segments is equal to the product of k by the number of combinations of the m pencils two at a time,i. e. to 2m(m-1)kCm=k2 To compute the number k let us group all the segments joining the n points on the upperlineto two points A and B on the lower line into the pairs of segments joining a fixed point on the upper line (for instance, C) to the points A and B. The number of these pairs is equal to n, and there exists exactly one point of intersection of the segments belonging to two pairs (for instance, such- is the point of intersection of the diagonals of n pointsthe trapezoid ABCD). Therefore, 2n(n-1) kn=C n=2 Consequently,thetotalnumber of points of intersection of all the segments joining n points on the upperline to m points on the lower line is equal to n(n-1)m(m-l) 22 , paints FIG.I Second solution. Each point of intersection of the segments can be obtained by selecting two points on the first line (which can be performed in C,2 ways) and two points on the second line (which can be performed in Cn ways). Com- bining all the possible pairs of points we get the total of Cm C2_m(m-1)n(n-1) 4 points of intersection. 187. Each parallelogramisspecifiedby choosing two straight lines of the firstfamily (which can be performed in Cn ways) and two lines of the second family (which can be performed in Cm ways). Thus, the total number of the parallelograms is equal to 22n(n-1)m(m-1) CnC5-4 188. Since in the given alphabet every separate character (a dot or a dash) and every pair of the characters denote a letter, the number of waysin which a continuous line consisting of x characters can be read is independent of the particular form of the line andisequal to the total number of all possible partitions of the characters forming the line into the groups of one or two adjacent characters. Let us denote this number by p,,. Let us now divide all the possible ways of reading the given line consisting of n characters- into two sets. Let the first set comprise the ways in which only the first character of the line is read as a separate letter. The number of ways belonging to the first set is equal to the number of ways in which the rest of the line consisting of n-I characters (remaining after the first character is discarded) can be read, that is to. Pn-t Let the second set comprise the ways in which the first two characters of the line are read as one letter. The number of ways belonging to the second set -ie 6 -323 162 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS equal to the number of ways in which the chain consisting of n-2 characters (remaining afterthefirsttwo characters are discarded) can be read, that is to pn-2. Since every way of reading the given line belongs either to the first or to the second set, the total number of ways is equal to the sum of ways belonging to the first and second sets,i. e. Pn=Pn-i+Pn-2 (1) This equality is a recurrent formula by which one can compute, in succession, Pr. p2...., pn for any n provided pl and p2 are known. But in the given problem p1= 1 (for a line consisting of one character there is only one way belonging to the first set) and P2=2 (for a line consisting of two characters there are two ways of reading one of which belongs to the first set and the other to the second set). Using formula (1), we find, in succession, P3=P2+Pi=2+1=3, P4=Ps+P2=3+2=5, Ps=P4+Pa=5+3=8 and so on. Finally, we get Pit = 233. 6. Problems in Forming Equations 189. Let x be the smaller of the factors. Then the statement of the problem directly implies that that is x (x+ 10)-40=39x+22, x2-29x-62=0, whence xr=31, x2=-2. Discarding the negative root we find the sought-for factors which are 31 and 41. 190. Before the first meeting the first cyclist covered s+a km and the second one s-a km where s is the distance between A and B. Consequently, before the second meeting they covered 2s-} k s and 2s-Is s km, respectively. But if two bodies move with constant speeds, the ratio of the speeds is equal to the ratioofthe distances covered by the bodies, provided the times taken are equal. Therefore, for finding s we have the equation 1 s+a-2)k s-a 2_ 1 T Hence t = 2ak km. 191. If two bodies move with constant speeds, then, for the same path, the ratio of their speeds is the reciprocal of the ratio of the times taken. Let v be the speed of the third car, andtthe time of motion of the second car by the moment it was overtaken by the third car. Therefore we have 40t-0550t+l Vt and V7 - +1 - 5 Dividing termwise the first equation by the second, we find t= 3 hours and then determine v=60 km/hr. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS ALGEBRA 163 192. Let the time period between the start and the meeting be x hours. The distance between the point of meeting and the point B took the cyclist x hours and the pedestrian x--t hours. Since, forequal distances, the times of motion are inversely proportional to the speeds, we can write x+t-k,x whence we find x= t k-1 193. Let x be the distance between A and B, and y be the distance between B and C. Then, taking into account that the time of motion is the same in all the cases mentioned in the statement of the problem, we obtain the system of equations Solving this system we be the length of the uphill portion. Then we can form the following system of equations: z11.5-(x+y)=2T9-0, 3+4+5 11.5-(x+y)xy_1 3+4+5-310 Adding together the equations, we find x=4. 195. Let us denote the distance between the points A and B by 1, and the speeds ofthe motorcyclists by yrand v2. During the time period t the first motorcyclist covered the distance p+1-q, and the second the distance q+1-p. Therefore, UI = V =21 (1) On the other hand,the ratioofthe speeds is equal to the ratio of the paths covered before the first meeting, i. e. vI1-P v2P Substituting ul and u2 expressed by (1) into the latter relation we get an equation for determining 1. Solving it, we find 1=3p-q. Substituting this value of 1 into formulas (1) we obtain 4p-2q2p vr=tv2= t 196. The difference between the delay times of theairplane in the first and second flights which is equal to 116012hours is due to the fact that the distance of d km was covered by the aircraft at different speeds, namely, during the first +-E=X+Y x+y-14x+y + 4375603.75 find x= 14 km and y= 16 km. 194.

Suppose that the first piece contained 100a % of copper, and the second 100b % of copper. Then the weight of copper contained in the first piece after its remainder has been alloyed with the cut-off piece of the other alloyisequalto a (m- x)+bx, and the amount of copper in the second piece after its remainder has been alloyed with the cut-off piece of the first alloy is equal to b(n-x)+ax. By the hypothesis, we have b(n-x)+ax mn Solving this equation and taking into account that ab we obtain mn x=m+n' 198. Let the ratio of the weights of the alloyed pieces be a:(i.

Let x be the distance between the bank the travellers started from and the place where C left the motor boat. Note that A caught the boat at the same distance from the opposite bank. Indeed, the only distinction between the ways in which A and C crossed the water obstacle is that C started out'fn the motor boat and then swam and A first swam and then took the motor boat. Since they swam at an equal speed v (v A v1) and the crossing took them equal times, the above distances should be equal. Taking this note into consideration, we easily set up the equation x+s-2 (s-x)s-x V1V its left member expressing the time of motion of the boat from the start to'the point where it meets A and its right member being equal to the time of motion of A from the start to that point.

During 6 hours preceding the halt caused by the snow drift the first 5 (s-6v) tt disrain covered 6v km and the remainingance of (s-6v) km took it 6v hours because the speed of the train on that part of the trip was equal to 5 v. The entire trip (including the two-hour wait) lasted 8+5 (s6v 60) hours which exceeds by one hour the interval of v hours indicated by the time-table.

Then the original volume of water in the vessels B and C is equal to 2x and 3xrespectively, and the total volume is equal to x+2x+3x=6x. After the water has been poured from A into B and from B into C for the first time, the water level in all three vessels becomes the same, and therefore the volumes of water in them are in the ratio equal to that of the areas of the bases which is 1:4:9. Therefore, after the first pouring the volumes of water in the vessels A, B and C are respectively equal to 6x3 6x12 1' 1.+4.+9= 7 x'4' 11.+4-+9=7x and 6x27 91 +4+9= 7 After the second pouring from C into B these volumes assume the values 312 7 x,x+128 4 and 27x-128 4 respectively. After the third pouring from B into A the volume of water in A becomes equal to x-100, and in B equal to 2 (x- 100). Adding together the volumes of water in all the vessels we obtain the fol- lowing linear equation with respect to x: (x-100)+2(x-100)+77x-128 7 =6x,.

Letthe desired number have the form xyzt where theletters x, y, z and t denote the digits in the corresponding decimal places. By the conditions of the problem, we obtain the following system of equations: x2-+2= 13, y2+z2=85, (1) xyzt - 1089 = tzyx. The rulesof subtraction of decimal numbers imply that in the third equa- ti on of the above system t is equal either to 9 or to (10+1)-9 =X, I.e. x = t +1. (2) But from the first equation of system (1) it follows that t < 4 and therefore (2) takes place. Then from the first equation of system (1) we get the equation for determining t: whence we find (t+ 1)2+12 = 13, t=2. From (2) it then follows that x=3, and the third equation of system (1) takes the form 3yz2 - 1089 = 2zy3. (3) Now letus note thatz < 9 because if z=9, then (3) implies that y=0 and thereforethe second equation of system (1) is not fulfilled. From (3) we find (z-1+ 10)-8=y, i. e. z=y-1.

Ti Y2 These losses are given: they are equal to B and C respectively. Consequently, we have Y _-BY _C TiP 'Y2P . Thus, the loss of weight of the alloy is P(P-x).A=x { P Hence, X==B-C For the problem to be solvable itisnecessary that B # C.

At the end of the second year the deposit was equal to lPa- Pa(1+100)-B=A(1+100)2-BI 1+(100 1-I)J and at the end of the third year it was Ps=Ak9-B (1+k+k3) where k = I + 100' Obviously, at the end of the nth year the deposited sum became equal to Pn = Akn-B (l +k+k2+ ... +kn-1), _Ap-1008pn100B PnP1+100) + P . To solve the problem we must find n such that P,,:_::-3A. Then n log (3Ap- 100B)-log (Ap- 100B) (1) log(1+ P 100) The meaning of the problem indicates thatthedeposited sum must increase, and therefore Ap > 100B. Furthermore, we have p > 0, A > 0 and B > 0 and hence the expression on the right-hand side of inequality (1) makes sense. 226.

Lastly, at the end of the nth year the amount of wood is equal to an-i(1+100)-x=an=aq. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 179 Now we can find x. Putting,forbrevity, 1+11 =k, we get from the last equation the expression x=kan_t-aq. Expressing an-1 from the foregoing equation we obtain x= k (kan-2-x)-aq =k2an_2-kx-aq. But an-2=kan-s--x. Hence, x=ksan-s-k2x-kx-aq. Proceeding in the same way, we finally express a2 in terms of a1 and obtain the following equation with respect to x: x=kna-x (kn-t +kn-2+ ... +k)-aq.

Solving the quadratic equation p2-3p-5=0 we obtain 3±J129 Pl,z =2 From the inequality 0 > p2-3p-5 we get P2 < p <p1. But P2<0 and p > 0, therefore 1/90<p<P1=3 22 It is readily seen that p, liesbetween 4 and 4.5. Consequently, it follows from the latterinequality that p as integer can assume only one of the four values p= 1, 2, 3, 4.

The numerator and denominator of this fraction are products similar to that in the foregoing problem.

We find namely a1= 2 and y1=(x1+x2)2-2x1x2=p2-2q, y2 = (xt +x2)3 - 3 (XI + xz) xlx2 = - p3 + 3pq. The coefficients of the quadratic equation y2+ry+s=O with roots yl and y2 are respectivgly equal to r=- (g1 +Y2) =p3-p2-3pq+2q and s = y1y2 = (p2 - 2q) (- p3 -f- 3pq) 240.

All the quantities involved being real, we thus have the three equalities a1 = ?b1,a2 = 1 b2,a3 = kb3, (I) (2) 184 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS where 7 = B .Besides, the condition bl+ba+ba 00 (3) should hold because, ifotherwise,allthethree numbers b1, b2 and b3 were equal to zero, and then the left member of (1) were independent of x. Let now, conversely, conditions (2) and (3) be fulfilled. Then (a1 + b1x)2 + (a2 + b3x)2 + (a3 + b3x)2 = =bi (X+x)2+bs (A+x)2'f b3 (X-+'-x)2= f box )2,_(a V bibab, +V J+e and, consequently, the sum indicated in the problem is a square of apolyno- mial of the first degree. Thus, conditions (2) and (3) are necessary and sufficient. 242. Let us denote the roots of the equation by x1 and x2. Then xi+x2=- p and x1x2=q. Ifx1andx2are negativethen,obviously, p > 0and q > Q.Butif x1=a-1-iP where a < 0 and P0, then x2=a-1p, and we see that P=-xl-x2=-2a > 0 and qxlx2 U,2 `02 > 0. Conversely, let it be known that p > 0 and q > 0. Then, if x1 and x2 are real, from the equality xlx2=q it follows that x1 and x2 are of the same sign, and the equality x1+x2=- p implies that the roots are negative. But if x1=a+iP, x2=a-i3 and P 96 0, then xl+x2=- p=2a, and, consequently, a is negative. 243. The roots of the equation x2±px+q=0 being positive, the discrimi- nant D of the equation satisfies the condition 0, (1) and the coefficients p and q satisfy the inequalities p=-xl-xy<0 (2) and q=xjx2 > 0.

(4) The discriminant of this equation is equal to Dx = 4r3g2 + p2 - 4q and, by virtue of (1), itis non-negative for all r. yl and y2 are real for all r. Taking into account (2) and (3), and applying Yleta's theorem we get, for r : 0, the inequality y1y2 -pr = q > 0, (5) and, hence, yl and y2 are of the same sign. Furthermore, we have 2r YI+Y2 =- q and, hence, yr and y2 are positive for0 which is what we set out to prove. It isobvious that the assertion remains true if we require that the irtequa lities 1-pr > 0and p-2rq < 0. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 188 hold simultaneously, that is Ir> P (7) and r> 2q (8) Thus, for negative r satisfying conditions (7) and (8) the roots y1 and y2 are positive. If these conditions are not observed, one (or both) roots of equation (4) is nonpositive. 244. Let us first suppose that p # 3. For the roots ofaquadratic equation with real coefficients to be real it is necessary and sufficient that thediscrimi nant b of this equation be non-negative. We have D=4p2-24p (p-3)=4p (18-5p) and therefore the condition D a 0 holds for op < 3.6, (1) The real roots x1 and x2 are positive if and only if their sum and product are positive,i.e. 'X1 -+-x9p > 0,x1x26 > 0.p-3 (2) The system of inequalities (1), (2) is satisfied for 3 < p3.6. It should also be noted that for p=3 the equation under consideration has the unique root x=3 > 0. Therefore, all the sought-for values are determined by the condition 3<p<3.6. 245. We shall prove the assertion by contradiction.Letus suppose that a0. Then' for the roots x1 and xz we have b ± If b2 -4a (c+)) x1,z- 24 Now there are two possible cases here: (1) Let a > 0. Then 7,is chosen so that the inequality X> b2 4a - C is fulfilled. In this case we obviously have b2-4a (c+%) < U and, hence, the given equation has nonreal roots. (2) Let a < 0. Then if ? >-c, we have -b+Yb2-4a(c+?,) > 0, and, hence, the root-b-{ Yb2a 4a (cis negative. Thus, both assump- tions lead to a contradiction, The assertion has thus been proved. 246.

Let us show that then a=0. Suppose the contrary. Then for the discriminant D of the quadratic equation (l) the following inequality D=4(a? -x-1)2-8a2R2>0 (2) holds for all X. However, the left member of Inequality (2) has the form -4a2X2+8? + 1 and is negative forallsufficientlylarge absolute values of X. For instance, if %=10,the left member of equation (1) is equal to -321. Thus we arrive at a a contradiction. 248. The equation in question takes the form x2-(p+q+2a2) x+pq+(p+q) a2=0 after reducing the fractions to a common denominator and discardingit. Com- puting the discriminant D of this quadratic equation we get D=(p+q+2a2)1-4 [pq+(p-i-q) all =(p-q)2+4a°. Since D>0 for all real a, p and q, the quadratic equation has real roots, and hence the same is true for the original equation. 249. Consider the discriminant of the given quadratic equation: D = (b2 +a2 -c2)2 - 4a2b2 = (b2 +a2-c2 - tab) (b2 +a2 - c2+ 2ab) = =[(a-b)2-c2] [(a+b)2-c21. Since a+b > c andI a-b l < c, we have (a+b)2 > c2 and (a-b)2 < c2. Conse- quently, D < 0. 250. By Vieta's formulas (see page 10) we have x1+x2+x3=2,x1x2-I-x2x3-J-x3x1= I,x1x2x9=- 1. Using these equalities we obtain yi+y2+ya=xix2-f-xzxs+xsxi = I, Yty2+yzYs+f1 Yi =xlx2x3 (x1 +xz+xa) =- 2, yly2y3 = (xrx2xa)2 = 1. Consequently, the new equation is y3-y2-2y-1=0. 251. On the basis of Vieta's formulas, we have x1+x2+x3=1. xlx2 -f -xzxs + xsxI = 0, xix2x3 = 1. By virtue of these equalities, we write yi+yz+ys=2 (xi+x2+x3)=2.

On the other hand, by Vieta's formulas, we have x1 + +x2+x3=-a whence we find 3p=-a and, hence, ax2=P=- 3 Substituting this root into the equation we obtain C-a )'+a(-3 )2+b (_ 3 )+c=0. which yields c = - 27 as -F 3 ab. 253. Let x1 > 0, x2 > 0 and x3 > 0 be the roots of the given equation. Fol- lowing the hint, we consider the expression (xl+x2-x3) (x2+x3-x1) (x3+x1-x2). (1) For the triangle with line segments of the lengths x1, x2, x3 as sides to exist, it is necessary and sufficient as was proved in the solution of Problem 106 that the condition (X1+x2-X3)(x2+x3-x1)(X3+X1-xs) > 0 (2) be fulfilled. To obtain the condition requiredinthe problemletus express the left member of (2)interms of p, q and r. For this purpose we make use of the relations X1 +X2+X3=-P,xix2-f- xlx3-f- x2x3=q, x1x2x3 = -r connecting the roots and coefficients of the equation. Condition (2) is now writ- ten in the form (-p-2x3) (-p-2x1) (-p-2x2) > 0; whence it follows that -Ps-2p2 (x1+x2+x3)-4p (x1x2+x1x3+x2X3)-8x1x2xS > 0 and, hence, p3-4pq±8r > 0. 254. Let x0 be a common root of the equations.Substituting x0 into both equations and subtracting one equation from the other we find xo=q2-ql 00. P1-P2 Let x2+ax+b be the quotient obtained by dividing the trinomial x3--p,x+g1 by x-xo. Then x3-I-p1x-4-q1=(x-xo) (x2+ax+b). 188 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Equating the coefficients in x2 and the constant terms in this identity we find a=xa and b=-9 , whenceitfollowsthat the other two roots of the first xo equation are determined by the formula -xo fxo +4q1 (1) xo X2.3 =2 and of the second equation by the formula -xo ± Y X2 + 4q2 t2 xnX23=2 255. It can easily be verifiedthatfor 7v=0 the equations have no roots in common. Let x0 be a common root of the equations for some7v0. Then we can write 7x0-xo-x0-(? } 1)= 0, 1 J} (1) Multiplying the second equality by x0 and subtracting it from the first we find xo =1. (2) Thus, if there is a common root,then it is connected with 7v by formula (2). It can now be readily verified that the fractionI in fact satisfies bothequa- tions (it is obviously sufficient to establishthis fact only for the second equa- tion).Thus, both equations(1)have a common rootfor all7v0, the root being determined by formula (2). 256. Firstsolution. Let x1, x2 and x3 be the roots of the polynomial P (x). According to Vieta's theorem, we have x1+x2 +x3 -0, xrx2+xrxa+x2x3= P, whence it readily follows that xl-{-x2+xe+ 2p^ 0. Since x1, x2 and x3 are real and different from zero (because q j6 0), we have xi {x2+4 > 0 and, hence, p < 0. Second solution. It is apparent that among the three roots of the polynomial P (x) there are two unequal ones. Indeed, if otherwise, we must have P (x) (x-xn)3 which is obviously not the case. Now let x1 and x2 be two unequal roots of the polynomial, and let x1 < x2. Suppose the contrary, that is p _0. Then x1 < x2 and px1 c px2. Then it fol- lows that P (x1) °xi+Px1+9 < x2) Px2q=0, because P (x2) =0. We arrive at a conclusion that P (x1) < 0 which contradicts the fact that x1 is a root of P (x). Consequently, p < 0 257. Let x1, x2 and x3 be therootsofthe given equation. By virtue of Vieta's formulas, we have xlx21 x1x3+x2x3=0, (1) x5x2x3 = b > 0. (2) SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 189 Let us first suppose that all the three toots are real. Then from condition (2) it follows that at least one of them is positive. If in this case we suppose that two roots are positive, then formula (2) implies that the third root is also po- sitive, which contradicts condition (1). Thus,if all the roots are real, the prob- lem has been solved. Let now xi be a nonreal root of the equation, then, as is known, theequa- tion also has the conjugate complex root x2 x'1. Since in this case x1x2 =x1x1 > 0, we conclude from equality (2) that = b >0x . 3x1x1 The assertion has thus been completely proved. 258. Let a, P and yl be the roots of the first equation and a,and y2 the roots of the second. By virtue of Vieta's formulas, we have a-I-P-1-yl=-a, (1) aj3y1=-18, (2) a-- P -y20, (3) (4) Now we obtain 71-T2=--a (5) from equations (1) and (3) and Atz3 (6) 722 from equations (2)and (4).Solving (5) and(6) as simultaneous equations we find y1=-3a,y2=-2a. (7) Thus, if for some a and b the equations have two common roots,their third roots are determined by formula (7). Substituting y1=-3a into the first equa- tion and y2=-2a into the second we obtain -18a3+ 18=0 and -8a3-2ab+12=0. Solving these equations we see thatthere can be only one pair of real values satisfying the condition of the problem, namely a= 1,b- 2. (8) Substituting these values Into the equations we readily find x3+x2+ 18=(x-{-3) (x2-2x+6) and x3+2x+ 12=(x-1-2) (x2-2x-6). Consequently, for the above values of a and b the equations have in fact two common roots. These roots are determined by the formula x1,2=-1 ± Y-5. 259. Let us denote the left-hand side of the equalityby A. We have As=20+14Y2+3/(20+1432)2 V20-1432+ +3V20+14Y2 V(20-1432)2-}-20-1432= =40+3V400-2x 142 A =40+6A. 190 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Thus, the left-hand side of the equality to be proved satisfies the cubic equation x3-6x-40=0, (1) It can be easily checked that equation(1) is satisfied by x=4. Dividing the left-hand side of equation (1) by x-4 we get the equation for finding the other two roots x2+4x+10=0. This equation has nonreal roots because its discriminant is negative: D=-24 < 0. Thus, equation (1) has only one real root x=4, and since A is a priori a real number, we have A=4 which is what we set out to prove. 240. As is easily seen, the expression in question vanishes if any two of the numbers a, b and c are equal.Then, by Bezout's theorem, it is divisible by each of the differences (b-c),(c-a)and(a-b). Therefore it seems n,itural to suppose that the given expression is the product of these factors. Indeed, we have a2 (c-b)+b2 (a-c)+c2 (b-a)=azc-alb+b2a-b2c+c2b-c2a= =a2 (c-b)-a (c2-b2)+bc (c-b)= (c-b) [a2-ac-ab+bc] = =(c-b) [a(a-c)-b(a-c)]=(c-b) (b-a) (c-a)(1) and thus the assumption turns out to be true. Since a, b and c are pairwise different, the assertion has been proved. 261. Note that for x = -y the given expressionturns into zero. Consequ- ently, by Bezout's theorem, it is divisible by x+y. To perform the division let us represent x+y+z in the form of a sum of two summands: (x+ y) and z. Cubing the sum, we get [(x+y)+Z713-x3-y3-Z3= =(x+y)3+3 (x+y)2 z+3 (x+y) z2-x3-y3= =3(x+y) [z2+z (x+y)+xyl The quadratic trinomial with respect to z in the square brackets on the right- hand side is readily factorized becauseitsroots are obviously -x and -y. Hence, we obtain (x+y+z)3-x3-y3-z3=3 (x+y) (z+x) (z+y). 262. Multiplying both members of the given equality by abc (a+b+c) we transform it to the form (ab+bc+ac) (a+b+c)-abc=0. Removing the brackets we get a2b + 2abc + a2c + ab2 +b2c+ bc2 + ac2 = 0. The left member of this equality is readily factorized: a2 (b+c)+ab (c+b)+ac(b+c)+bc (b+c)= =(b+c) (a2+ab+ac+bc)=(b+c) (a+b) (a+c) Since thelastproduct is equal to zero, we conclude that at least one of the factors is equal to zero which implies the desired assertion. 263. Let a and 0 be the roots of the quadratic trinomial x2-f. px+q. If the binomial x4-1 is divisible by this trinomial,then a and S are the roots of the binomial as well. It is easily seen, that the converse is also true: if a and are the roots of the binomial x4-1, then it is divisible by x2+px+q*. *If, in this argument, a=p, the number a must be a multiple root of the dividend as well. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. ALGEBRA 191 The binomial x4-I has the roots1, -1, i and -i and therefore we can write the factorization (x4-I)=(x-l)(x-I-1)(x-i)(x-l--i). (1) What was said above implies that the trinomials we areinterested in may only be products of two of the factors on the right-hand side of (1). Forming all possible permutations we find C4=6 trinomials: (x- 1)(x+l)=x2-1, (x-1) (x-i)=x2-(1 + i) x+i, (x- 1) (x-}-i)=x2-(1-i)x-i, (x--1)(x-i)=x2-4-(1-i)x-f, (x+l)(x+i) =x2+(1+i)x+i, (x-i) (x+l)=X2-}-1. These obviously are all the sought-for trinomials. 264. Representing the given polynomial in the form xn-l-ax(xn-2-I) we divide it by the difference (x-1) using the formula xk+l-1 x-1I+X+...+Xk. (1) * Performing the division we see that the quotient is the polynomial xn-,+Xn-2+ ... +x+ 1-ax (xn-s+xn-4+ ... +x+ 1). For the latter polynomial to be divisible by x-l, it is necessary and sufficient that (according to Bezout's theorem) the following equality be fulfilled: n-a(n-2)=0. Therefore, the polynomial given in the problem is divisible by (x-1)2 for any natural n > 2 and a= n 2 265. The conditions of the problem imply that p (a) = A, p (b) =B, (I) P (c) = C. Dividing the polynomial p (x) by (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) we representItin the formp (x) _ (x-a) (x-b) (x-c) q (x) -}- r (x). (2) It is obvious that r(x) is a polynomial of degree not higher than the second. Writing it in the form r(x)=1x2+mx+n, (3) we substitute, in succession, the values x=a, x=b and x=c into identity (2). By virtue of equality(1), we arrive atthe following system of equations for defining the coefficients 1, m and n of polynomial (3): 1a2+ma+n=A, 1b2+mb+n =B, (4) 1c2+me+n=C. * Formula (1) can be easily verified by division but itshould be noted that it simply coincides with the formula for the sum of k terms of a geometric progression with common ratio x. 192 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Solving this system we find (A-B) (b-c)-(B-C) (a-b) (a-b) (b-c) (a-c) m=(A-B)Lb2-c2)-(B-C)(a2---b2) h(a-b) (-c) (c-a) a2 (Bc-Cb)+a (Cb2-Bc2)+A (Bc2-Cbz) (a-b) (b-c) (c-a) Note. For x =a, x=b and x=c the sought-for polynomial r(x) takes on the values A, B and C, respectively. It can easily be verifiedthat the polynomial (of degree not higher than the second) given below is one possessing this pro- perty:A (x-b) (x-c+B (x-a)(x-cC (x-a)(x-b) (5)(a-b) (a-c)(b-a) (b-c)+(c-a) (c--b)' System (4) having only one solution, there exists only one polynomial possessing the above property. Consequently, r(x) coincides with polynomial (5). 266. The formula is obviously true for n=1. Let us suppose thatitis true foracertain n and prove that then it is true for n+I as well. Denoting the sum standing on the left-hand side of the formula to be proved by Sn, we can write Sn+1-Sn(n+l)(n-f-2)=(n+1)(n+2)(n+3) 2 6 (n+ 1) [(n+1)+11 j(n+l)+2] 6 Thus, it follows by induction that the formula is valid for any natural n. 267. Let Sn be the sum on the left-hand side of the formula. For n = I both sides of the formula coincide. Let us show that if the formula holds for some n, then itis also true for n+1. We have Sn+1=Sn+(n+1)2=n(n+1))(2n+1)+(n+1)2= (n+l)(2n2+7n+6) =(n+l)[2n (n+2)+3(n+2)] 6 6 (n+ 1)((n + 1)+ 1112 (n+ 1)+ 11 6 Consequently, the formula holds for any natural n. 268. The validityofthe assertion is readily established for n= I. Suppose that the formula be true for some n1. Let Sn be the sum on the left-hand side of the formula. We have - 1 n (n-F-3) 1Sn+1-Sn+(n+l)(n+2)(n+3)4 (n+ 1)(n+2)(n+l) (n+2)(n+3) It follows that Sn+1= n3+6n2+9n+4-(n+1)(n2+5n+4) 4 (n+l) (n+2) (n+3)4 (n-{-- 1) (n+2) (n+3) (n+l)-f(n+t)4-31 4 [(n+I)+I[((n+1) + 21 Hence, the formula is true for any natural n.

(1) To prove that the formula holds for n+1 let us multiply both members of (I) byy cos cp+i sin p.According to the rule for multiplying complex numbers we obtain (cos cp+i sin (p)n } 1= (cos ncp + i sin n(p) (cos p+i sin (p) - =(cos ncp cos cp-sin n(p sln (p)+i (cos np sin rp+sin np cos cp) =cos (n+1)q>+isin(n+1)(p. Consequently, the formula is true for any natural n. 270. Apparently, a+b= 1 and ab=-1. Using this, we can write aaa6 =an+1-abn+anb-bn+1an+1_bn+1 Jan-l-bn-1 that is an=an+1-an-1 which implies an+1 =an+an-1 Itfollows thatiffor some n the numbers an_1 and an are positive integers, then an+1isalsoapositive integer. Consequently, by induction, an+2. an+s etc. are also positive integers. But we have a1=1 and a2=1, and hence all an are positive integers for n > 2. 271. For n= 1the inequalityistrue.Letus supposethat itis true for some n. Multiplying both members by 1 -f an+1 > 0 we find (1+a1)(I+a2) ...

Letusfirstofallverifythatthe formula holds for n=1. Indeed, for n =I it takes the form (a+b)1=Ci (a)o (b)1+Ci (a)1 (b)0. (1) If now we use the definitionforthe generalized nth power of a number, It becomes evident that both members offormula (1)are equal to a+b and, consequently, the equality is in fact true. Now suppose that the formula is true for some n and prove that itis then true for n+1 as well. The definition of the generalized nth power implies that (a+b)n+1=(a+b)n (a+b-n)= [Con(a)o (b)n+Cn (a)1 (b)n-1+ ... +Cn (a)k (b)n-k+... +Cn (a)n (b)0] (a+b-n). Removing the square brackets, we transform each of the n+ 1 summands accord- ing to the formula Cn(a)k (b)n-k (a-+- b-n) = Cn (a)A, (b)n- k +(a-k)+(b - n+k)) _ = Cn (a)k (a-k) (b)n-k+Cn (a)k (b)n-k (b-n+k) = Cn (a)k+I (b)n-k+Cn (a)k (b)n-k+1(k=0,1, ..., n).

At the moment t the car isatadistance of 401 km from thepoint A, and the motorcycle at a distance of 2 12+9 km from that point. Consequently, thedistance between themis equalto the absolute value of the expression 1612+9-401. Denoting this distanceby y(t), we canplotthegraphofthe quadratic trinomial y(t) (See Fig. 4).

Draw the straight line 0,A, and another straight line parallel to 01A passing through the centre 02 of the second circle. This line intersects the second circle at points M arid A' FIG. 41 FIG. 42 (pig. 42). The straight line MA intersects the second circle at a point P,. The straight line 02Pintersects 01A at a point C1. The similarity of the triangles M02P1 and AC1A1 implies C1A =C1P1 Hence, the circle of radius C1A with centre at C, is the required one. A second solution is obtained with the aid of the point N injustthe same way as the first solution with the aid of the point M. If one of the straight lines MA or NA is tangent to the second circle, then only one solution remains while the second solutionyieldsthis tangentline (which canbe interpreted as a circle with centre lying at infinity). The latter case takes place if and only if the point A coincides with the point of tangency of one of the four common tangents to the given circles. 328, Let 0 be the centre of the given circle, and AB the given line (Fig 43). The problem is solved by analogy with the preceding one, In the general case 218 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS it has two solutions.There are three singular cases here: (1) The given line intersects the circle, and the given point A coincides with one of the points of intersection. Then there are no solutions. (2) The givenlineistangent to the circle, and the point A does not coincide with the point o1 tangency. In this case there is one solution. (3) The given line is tangent tothe circle, and the point A coincides with the point of tangency. In this case there is an infinitude of solutions. FIG. 43 FIG. 44 327. Through the centre 0 of the given circle draw a straight line perpen- diculartothe givenlineIand intersecting the circleatpoints M and N (Fig. 44). The straight line MA IntersectsIata point P1. C1 is the point of intersection of the perpendicular erected to I at the point P1 with the straight line OA. The similarity of the triangles AOM and AC1P1 implies that C,A =C1P1. Consequently, the circle of radius C1A with centre at C1is- the required one. Another solution is obtained with the aid of the point N in just the same way as the first solution withthe aidof the point M.If the straight line I does not pass throughone ofthepoints A, M and N, and the point A does not coincide with M or N, the problem always has two solutions. Suppose that A does not coincide with M or N. If I passes through M or N, the problem has one solution (the second circle coincides with the given one). But ifI passes through A, the problem has no solutions. Let A coincide with M;ifIdoes notpass through M or N, the problem has one solution (the second degenerates into a straight line coinciding with 1). IfI passes through N the given circle is the solution, and if I passes through M, the problem has an infinite number of solutions. 328.

Through the point P draw a straight line perpendicular to SO which intersects the circle at points B and C. The triangle ABC isthe required one,since AH _1._ BC, BS=SC and BP=PC.

The solutionisbased on the following property: if the altitudes hA and hp of the inscribed triangle ABC intersect the circle at points Al and B1, then the vertex C bisects the arc A,BI (Fig. 50).

Consequently, for determining h the given triangle ABC can be replaced by any othertriangle having the same base AC and the same alti- tude BH. It is most convenient to take a triangle with right base angle. Hence, we perform thefol- lowing construction.

We shall prove that L SEF thus obtained is the required triangle. For FIG. 55 FIG. 56 this purposeitissufficient to prove that AC=FE. It is easily seen that the perimeter of the triangle SEF is equal to 2SC. On the other hand, it is obviously equal to 2(SA+EL+LF). Thus, we have SC=SA+EL±LF,SA+AC=SA+EF,i.e. AC=EF, which is what we set out to prove. It is clear, that the problem has two solutions if the circles do not intersect, and only oneifthey are tangent. The problem has no solution if the circles intersect. Let a be the given angle, r and R the radii of the circles and a the given side ofthetriangle.

Let D be the point of intersection of the altitudes (the orthocentre), 0 be the centre of the circumscribed circle, E and F the midpoints of the sides BC and AC (Fig. 58).

Thus,the numerator of fraction (1) is less than thatoffraction(2).Furthermore, the denominatorb-} s offraction (1) is greater than the denominatora+ c of fraction (2) because I >Q.

The latter equality holds by virtue of the general formula sin 3a=3 sin a-4 sin3 a. FIG. 62 347. In any triangle,the greater angle is opposite the greater side. There- fore, if AC < 2BM, in AABC (Fig. 62) which is equivalent to the two inequalities AM<BM, MC<BM, then ABM < L BAM,L MBC < L BCM.

Let QQ' 11 AC and N be the point of intersection of AQ' and QC (Fig.63). The angles whose values are implied by the conditions of the problem are indicated in the figure by continuous arcs. Let us show that QP I AQ'. (1) Indeed, we have NC=AC; but AC=PC since ACP is an isosceles triangle. Therefore, NC=PC and, consequently, NCP is also an isosceles triangle and hence L CNP=L NPC=80°. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. PLANE GEOMETRY227 Now it readily follows that/ Q'NP= 180°-60°-80°=40°, and since L NQ'P = =40°, the triangles QQ'P and QNP are congruent which implies (1). Now it is clear that L Q'PQ=50° and, consequently, L QPA-180°-50°-50°=80° Second solution(see Fig. 64). It is easily seen that the angle P is equal to 80°ifand onlyif AABP is similar to A PCQ (the angles whose values are directly implied by the conditions of the problem are indicated in the figure B FIG. 63 FIG. 64 by continuous arcs).Let us prove that these triangles are in fact similar. The angles ABP and PCQ being equal, it is sufficient to establish the relation ABPB (I) cQ- CP Put AB=I; then from the isosceles triangle CQB we find CQ=1 2 cos 20° ' On the other hand, since PC=AC, we have PC=21 sin 100,and, besides,BP=1-21 sin 10°. Substituting these expressions into (1) we get the equivalent equality 4 sin 10°cos 20°= 1-2 sin 10°.

Indeed, AO=0A1 by construction. Furthermore, sine AOB1D is a parallelogram, we have AD=0191=0B.

PLANE GEOMETRY229 which is what we set out to prove. In the case of an obtuse triangle the product corresponding to the obtuse angle should be taken with the minus sign. 352. By the hypothesis, b-a=c-b, i.e. a+c=2b. To compute the product Rr let us use the formulas expressing the area S of a triangle in terms of the radii of its circumscribed or inscribed circle and its side. As is known, S=be sin A, and according to the law of sines we have sin A=2R which implies On the other hand, S=rp, where p=a+2+c. Equating both expressions we obtain rR=4p. (1) Under the conditions of the problem we have P=b.a+2+c= 2 Substituting this value in (1) we obtain 6rR = ac. 353. Let zbe the length of the bisector, and m and n the lengths of the line segments into which the base of the triangle is divided by the bisector FIG. 68 (Fig. 68). By the law of cosines we have a2=z2+m2-2mz cos a and b2 = z2 + n2 + 2nz cos a. Multiplying the first equality by n and the second one by in, and adding them, we obtain na2 +mb2-(m+n) (z2+mn). 0) 230 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS By virtue of the relation a= b , we have n na2+mb2=na mbno=ab(m+n). Substituting this expression into (1) we obtain the required equation ab=z2+rnn. If a=b and m=n, the equality thus proved expresses the Pythagorean theorem: a2=z2+m2. 354. By the hypothesis, BD=EC (Fig. 69). If M is the point of intersection of BC and DE, then for the triangles BDM and ECM we obtain BD_DMECME sin (p- sin B'sin cp- sin C' whence it follows that But in Q ABC we have Consequently, DM_ sin B ME- sin C sin BAC_ ABCA B DM AC ME _ AB 355. Let BD, BE and BF be, respectively, an altitude, bisector and median in Q ABC. Suppose that AB < BC. Then LA>LC, LCBD>LABD, which implies L CBD > 2 (L ABD+ L CBD) = 2 L B, i. e. L CBD > L CBE. Consequently,the bisector BE passes inside L CBD, and the point E lies between D and C. Furthermore, we have ECAE_ BC AB< I and AE < EC whence AE < 2 (AE+EC) = 2C, i. e. AE < AF. Hence,the point F lies between E and C. Thus, the point E lies between D and F which is what we set out to prove. 356. Consider a triangle ABC. Let BD be a bisector, BM a median and BN the straight line which is the reflection of BM through BD (Fig. 70).If SABN and SMBC are the areas of the corresponding triangles, then 2SABN= xhB = nc sin L ABN and 2SMBC= x+ y hB=ma sin L MEG, where ha is the altitude dropped from the vertex B onto AC.

The straightlines AP, BQ and CR divide the triangle ABC into six triangles: L AOR, A ROB, L BOP, Q POC, & COQ and Q QOA (Fig. 71) A FIG. 70 FIG. 71 Applying the law of sines to them we obtain ARAOAOAQ sin cpsin y' sin osin P' BOBRBPBO siysin -(T+ V) ' sin vsin a' CQCOCOCP sin (p+'1)sinsinasin p' Multiplying all these equalities termwise we find 358. Let K and 0 be,respectively,the centres of the circumscribed and inscribedcirclesofthe triangle ABC, and D the midpoint of the arc AC (see Fig.72). Each ofthe angles OAD and AOD is equal to half the sum of the vertex angles at A and B of the triangle ABC. It follows that OD=AD. By the theorem on chords intersecting inside a circle, we have MO-ON=BO-OD. Furthermore,if OE I AB and FD is a diameter, the triangles BOE and FDA are similar and therefore BO:OE=FD:AD which implies i. e. BO.OD = OE FD because AD = OD. Hence, M0.ON=OEFD. 232 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Substituting MO=R+1, ON-R-l, OE=r and FD=2R inthe above equality we arrive at the required result R2-12=2Rr. 359. Firstsolution.Let ABC be the given triangle, K, the inscribed circle of radiusrand K2 the circumscribed circle of radius R. Let us construct an auxiliarytriangle A1B1C1 so that its sides are parallel to the sides of A ABC and pass throughitsvertices (Fig.73). Draw tangent lines to the circle K2 parallel to the sides of A A1B1C1, applying the following rule: the tangent line A2B2 paralleltothe side A1B1 is tangent to K2 at a point belonging to the same arc AB on whichthevertex C lies and so on. The segments of these tangents form a triangle AsB.ZC$- FIG. 72 FIG. 73 Then, A A1B1C1 lies inside A A2B2C2, and the two triangles are similar. Therefore the radius R' of the inscribed circle of A A1B1C1 is not greater than the radius R of the inscribed circle K2 of A A2B2C2, i. e. R' < R. On the other hand, the radii of the inscribed circles of the similar triangles A1B1C1 and ABC areintheratio ofthe corresponding sides of these triangles,i. e.A1B 1 = 2. Thus, R'=2r. Comparing this equality with the inequality R' - R we finally obtain 2r < R.

Comparing two expressions for the area of a triangle, we get S= 2 (a-J-b+c) r= 2 hc, which implies rc (1) Since a+b > c we have ha+b+C' T < c+c=0.5. Furthermore, by virtue of the relationship c2= a2+b2, the inequality b2+b2}2ab is equivalent to the inequality 2c2(a-4-b)2, i.e. a+b c cJ1 2. Therefore, r>C= I=r_2- I > 0.4. hcy2+c 112+1 361. Let A, B and C be the angles of an acute triangle, and a, b and c be the sides opposite them. Put P=a+b+c. The required relationship follows from the equalitiesaka+bkb+ckc=Pr, (1) and (b+c)ka+(c-f-a)kb+(a+b)kc=PR(2) because, adding them together, we obtain ka+kb±kc=r+R Equality (1) holds because its left and right members are equal to the doubled area of the triangle. To prove (2) let us note that ka=R cos A,kb - RcosB,kc=R cos C, (3) and that b cos C-{- c cos B = a, c cos A + a cos C = b, a cos B + b cos A = c, whence, by termwise addition, we obtain the equality (b -}- c) cos A -}- (c+ a) cos B -- (a + b) cos C = P. Multiplying the latter relation by R and making use of (3) we obtain the result coinciding with (2). 362. Let A2B2, B2C2 and CZA2 be the midlines in Q ABC and A3, B3 and C3 the midpoints of the segments AA1, BB1, CC1 (Fig. 74). The points A3, Bs and C3 are on the midlines of Q ABC but not at their endpoints because, ifother- 234 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS wise, at least one of the points At, B3 and CI coincides with a vertex of A ABC. Since any straight line not passing through the vertices of thetriangle A3B2C2 does not intersect all its sides simultaneously, the points A3, B3 and C3 are not in a straight line. 8 FIG. 74 363.

Let B B, B Br A4B,P FIG. 78 FIG. 79 us prove that the point 0 is equidistant from A;, B; and C; where i=1, 2, 3. Since ON is the midline of the trapezoid MB1B2P, we have OB1=0B2. From the similarity of the triangles AMB and PA2B2 we conclude that BM=2PB2, and therefore B3M=PB2. From the parallelogram MB3PB2 we have OB3=0B2. But for OB3 as midline of the triangle PMB we have OB3= 2BP= 2 and, hence, 083 = 082 = 0B1= R 2 We then prove in just the same way that OA1=OA2=OA3=OC1=OC2=OC3_ R 366.

The triangles BATA and BC1C are similar as right triangles with a common acute angle ABC. Therefore, BA1BA BC1 - BC Hence, A AIBC1 is similar to A ABC andBA1C1= L BAC. In A AIBC1 the line segments A1S and C1M arealtitudes.Therefore,repeating the above argument we can assert that L BSM = L BAICI. Consequently, L BSM L BAC and SM 11 AC. We then similarly prove that PN 11 AB and RQ 11 BC. (2) To prove that the vertices of the hexagon MNPQRS lie in a circle it is sufficient to show that any four consecutive vertices of the hexagon are in a circle. This follows from the fact that through threepoints notina straight line it is possible to draw only one circle. The sets of four consecutive vertices of the hexagon can be classified into the following two types:thosein which the intermediate points are on different sides of 6 ABC (i.e. RSMN, MNPQ 236 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and PQRS) and those in which the intermediate points are on one side of A ABC (i.e. NPQR, QRSM and SMNP). Consider the quadruples RSMN and NPQR (which belong to different types). From the obvicus proportion BC1_BOBA, BR -BB1BN it follows that NR I{ A,C,. Therefore, L MNR T 4 BA,C, = L BAG =BSM, which means that LMNR+MSR=n and, consequent)the points R. S. M and N liein one circle.Furthermore, L PNR+L P( R=n-(L PNC+ + L BNR) +rr-L AQR=2n-(L ABC+ L BAC+ L ACB)=n,whenceit follows that the points N, P, Q and R also lie in a circle.The proof for the rest of the quadruples is carried out in a similar way. 367. Let A,, B, and C1 be the points oftangency ofthe inscribed circle and the sides of A ABC, and D the centreofthe inscribed circle (Fig. 80). The segments of the tangent lines drawn from one point to a circle being equal, we have Furthermore, Consequently, C'A,=CBI,BA,=BC1,AB,=AC1. DB,=CAI,B1C=AID.

Hence, L ABD = L CBF and L DBE= L ABE - L ABD = L CBE- L CBF = =L FBE, which is what we set out to prove. 369. The symmetry of ABC and A,B,C1 about the centre 0 of the inscribed circle implies that the corresponding points of A ABC and A A1B5C1 lie on a straight line passing through 0 and are equidistant from this point (Fig. 82). Inparticular, OC=0C1i OB=QB1 and BCB1C1 isa parallelogram;hence, BC=B1C1. Analogously, AC=A1C1, AB=A1B1 and A ABC=A A1B,C1.

From Fig. 83 we see that MA2-M02+A02-2M0 AO cos a and MC2 =M02+ CD2 + 2MO CO cos a. We have AO=CO, and therefore adding these equalities we get MA2+MC2=2M02+2A02. (1) Similarly, MB 2 + MD2 = 2MO2+2BO2. Consequently, the difference (MA2+ MC2) _(MB2+MD2) = 2 (A02-BO5) is independent of the position of point M. 371. Let 0 be the point of intersection of the straightlines AA, and CC1 (see Fig. 84). The problem reduces to proving that LAOB-fAQB1=180°. (1) 238 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Note that Q C1BC=Q ABA, because C,B=AB, BC=BA1 and L C5BC=60°+ + L ABC- L ABA,. Therefore L OC1B= L OAB, and OAC1B is an inscribed quadrilateral of a circle. Hence, L AOB= 120°. We then analogously show that BOC= 120°. But this implies that L AOC= 120°, anditfollows that AOCB1 is an inscribed quadrilateral of a circle. Hence it follows that L AOB,= L ACB1= =60°. Therefore equality (1) holds. Bf FIG. 84 372.

Let hB, hc and hD be respectively, the distances from the vertices B C and D of the parallelogram to the straight line AO (Fig. 86).Then the fol- lowing property takes place: the greatest of the three distances is equal to the sum of the other two. For instance, if AO intersects the side BC (asinFig.86),then,drawing BE II AO and CE±AO we coriclude,bythe congruence of the triangles BEC and AD'D, that hD = hB + hc. Analogously, if AO intersects the side CD, then hB=hc+hD andif AO does not intersect the sides BC and CD, then hc=hB+hD. From this Dproperty,forthe caseshown inFig. 86, we FIG. 86immediately receive the equality of the areas of the triangles: SAOC = SAOD - SAOB Generally, it is obvious, that we can write the formula SAOC = I SAOD ± SAOB SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS.

Then the vertex D coincides with C and the vertices Al and A occupy the positions M' and A', respectively. Furthermore, the points M, N and M' lie In a straight line and, besides, M'A' 11 MB and M'A'=MB. Therefore MBA'M' isa parallelogram, and A'B=M'M=2MN. By the hypothesis we have BC+AD=2MN, and therefore BC+CA'=A'B. Consequently, the point C lies on the line segment A'B because,ifotherwise, BC+CA' > A'B in the ,BCA'.Itfollows that BC II MN II AD, i.e. ABCD is a trapezoid. 378.

Let 0 be the pointof intersection of the diago- nals of a quadrilateral ABCD shown in Fig. 91, and L BOA -cc. Then SARCD =SAOB+SCOD+SAOD+SBOC = a+2I I =2 BD.AC.sina. This formula irttplies validity 6t the assertion to be proved. 8 FIG. 91 FIG. 92 379, Let M be an interior point ofa convex polygon, and AB its side whose distance from Alisthe least. We shall prove that the foot P of the perpendicular drawn from M to AB lies on AB but not on its extension (Fig. 92). Indeed, if P has On the extension of AB, then MP intersects a side I of the polygon at .a point Q, and, since the polygon isconvex, MQ < MP. But the distance DM from M to1 is less than MQ , and, eonsequetf'tly, less than MP which contradicts the choice of the side AB. 380. Let AAt, BBI, CC1 and DDI be the bisectors of the interior aides of a parallelogram ABCD, andlet PQ/ S he the quadrilateral formed by their intersection (Fig. 93). Obviously, BB1 II DDI and AA1 II CC1. Furthermore, APB=n-(L BAP+ L ABP)=.n - 2 (L BAD+ L ABC)-n -2 n=-T' n, which .means that PQRS isA rectangle. The triangles BAB1 and CDC, ar\" isosceles because the bisectors of their vertex angles are perpendicular to their bases. Therefore BP = PBI and D1R -RD, and hence PR II AD. Thus, PRDB1 is a parallelogram, and we have PR=BID=AD-AB1= AD-AB, SOLUTIONS ANb ANSWERS. PLANE GEOMEtRY241 381. Let 01, 02, 03 and, 04 be the Centres of the squares constructed on the Sides of a parallelogram ABCD (Fig.94) We have A 01BO2 A 03C02 since O1B=O3C, B02=CO2 and L 01802=MBN- 2 = L DCB+ 2 =L 03C03. Hence,0102 = 0302and000= = L 0102B + L BOIC - L 0302C = =LB02C=2 FIG. 94 We similarly prove that 0203=0304=0401 and 00000000'%L 23o4=L a4r=L 4122 Consequently, 010,0304 is a square. 382. Let AP, BQ, CR and 08 be the bisectors of the interior angles of the quadrilateral ABCD (Fig. 95). Let A, B, C and D be the magnitudes of these angles. Then L ASD-n-2A-2 D, L BQC=n- B- 2 C. FIG. 95 C FIG. 96 Adding together these equalities we obtain ASD+L BQC=2n- 2 (A+B+C+D)=2n- 2 21s=n. Hence, the points P, Q, R and S lie in a circle. 383. Let A and B be the points of tangency, M an arbitrary point of the circle, and MN J AB, MD J AC, ME 1 BC (seeFig. 96). Let us prove that 242 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS the triangles DMN and NME are similar. To this end we note that about the quadrilaterals ADMN and NMEB it is possible to circumscribe circles because LMNA+LADM= 2= an d LMEB+LBNM-2+2=n. Therefore, L MND= L MAD andL MEN= L MBN. But L MAD = = L MBN, because each ofthese anglesismeasured by halfthe arc AM. Thus, L MND= L MEN. We similarly establish the equality L NDM= L ENM. The similarity of the triangles DMN and NME implies the required rela- tionship DM_MN MN' ME ' 384. Let ABC be an inscribed triangle of a circle. Denote by D an arbitrary pointofthecircle, and by L, M and N the feet of theperpendiculars (Fig. 97). Join the point M to N and the point N to L. We shall prove that the angles ANM and LNC are equal. First note that L ANM = L ADM, (1) because about the quadrilateral MAND it ispossible to circumscribe a circle. By the same reason, On the other hand, we have L LNC = L LDC. (2) L ADC= L MDL. (3) Indeed, L ADC+ L B= 180° because the sum of these angles can be thought of as an angle inscribed in the circle subtended by the whole circumference of the circle. At the same time L MDL+L B=180° because about the quadrila- teral MBLD it is possible to circumscribe a circle.Consequently, equality (3) holds true. As is clear from the figure, in this case we have L LDC = L ADM, and then (I)and(2)imply the validity of the required equality L ANM= L LNC. D FIG. 97 FIG. 98 385. Let us prove that every two of the three line segments 01A1, O.A. and 03A3 shown in Fig. 98 intersectattheir midpoints. This will imply that all the three line segments intersectin one point.For example, we shall prove that the line segments 01A1 and 02A2 are bisected by the point B of their intersection.Sincethecirclesareequal, we concludethat 02A1030 and O1A2030 are rhombuses. It follows that the line segments OZAI, 003 and 01A2 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. PLANE GEOMETRY243 are parallel and equal. Therefore, 01A2A102 is a parallelogram and its diago- nals 01A, and 02A2 are bisected at the point of intersection. 386. Let 0 be the centreofthe smaller circle (Fig. 99). Then AK II OC since AK L BK, and 0C I BK. Furthermore, OA=OC. Hence, L KAC= L ACO= L CAO. FIG. 9S 387.

In the second and thirdcases,usingthe notationindicated in the figure, we find that c+ p ± y= 2 ,i.e. a ± y= 2whence it follows that p AOC is similar to p BDO and therefore AC_OB A0 -BD Consequently, 389. Let Al be the point ofintersectionof mutually perpendicular chords AB and CD (Fig. 102). Draw AK 11 CD, then BK is a diameter, AK < CD and BK2=AB2+AK2 < AB2+CD2.

Let r1 and r2 be the radiiof the semicircles inscribed in a given se- micircle of radius R shown in Fig. 106.Since R = ri + r2, the shaded areais expressed as SnR2- 24ri,,- 2 nra= 2 n I(ri + r2)2-ri- r2J =nrir2. But and, consequently, h2 = 2r1.2r2 = 4r1r2 S=4 nh2. FIG. 106 FIG. 107 394. If the straightlinejoining the points A and B (Fig. 107) does not intersectthe given circle, then the tangent lines AC and BD can bG drawn so that the point M of their intersectionlies on the line segments AC and BD. In / AMB we have AM+BM > AB > I AM-BM I, 246 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and, since AC > AM,BD > BM,MC = MD, we obtain AC+ BD > AB > I AC-BD . If the straight line AB does intersect the circle, thenthere are two possible cases, namely: (a) the chord cut off by the circle on the straight line AB lies on the line segment AB; (b) the chord is not on AB. In the case (a) shown in Fig. 108 we have AB > AE+BF > AC+BD, because the hypotenuses AE and BF in the right triangles AEC and BFD are greater than the legs AC and BD. A FIG. 108 FIG. 109 In the case (b) the line segment AB lies inside the angle CAC' (Fig. 109). Draw through B acircle concentric with the given one. Let it intersect AC and AC' at points E and E'. Then EC=BD and AE > AB. Hence, AB < AE=AC-EC=AC-BD. 395. Let us introduce the following notation (see Fig. 110): L PCM=QCN=a,L NML= L NKL=Y,L LCP=L QCK=§, QC=x,PC=y,AC=CB=a.

Denote by q) the angle formed by the line segments B1B3 and B2B4. Then But we have a2+a2H-a3+ a4 2 2a, + 2a2 + gas + 2a4 = 2n, and therefore n rP2' 397. Consider a closed polygonal line without self-intersection and take two points A and B onitin sucha way that the perimeteris divided into two equal parts. Let 0 be the midpoint of the line segment AB. Draw a circle of radius 4 with centre at 0 where p is the perimeter of the whole polygonal line. B If FIG. 113 We shallprove thatthis circleis a required one. Indeed, if otherwise, then there existsapoint M belonging to the polygonal line and lying outside this circle. The length of the portion of the polygonalline containing the point M is not less than AM+BM and hence, AM+BM' 2 .But at the same time AM+BM,2MO. Indeed, from the parallelogram AMBD (Fig. 112) we have DM-2M0 < BM+BD=AM-l- BM. Since MO > 4 ,it follows from the inequality AM+BM:2M0 that AM + + BM > 2 . Thus we arrive at a contradiction. 398. Through the vertex A of a given Q ABC draw a straight line AD parallel to one of the given straightlines x and y and not intersecting the triangle. Drop the perpendiculars BP and CQ to AD from the points B and C (Fig. 113). 248 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Suppose that the distances from the vertices of the triangle ABC to the straight lines x and y are expressed by integers. Then the lengths of the line segments AP, AQ, BP and CQ are also expressed by integers. It follows that tan L BAP=App andtan L are rational numbers, and, hence, the number BPCQ tan L BAC- tan L BAP-tan CCAQ=AP AQ 1+tan L BAPtanCAQBP CQ 1+ APAQ is also rational. Therefore, it is impossible that L BAC=60° because tan 60°' y3 is an irrational number. Consequently ABC is not an equilateral triangle. 399. Let the straight lines A1B and AB1 intersect at a point 0, and OD I AB (Fig. 114). Since Q AB.41 issimilar to Q DBO, and Q HAS, to [1 DAwe have OD_BDOD AD aAB'b _ AB' which yields Hence, the distance OD= ab a+b is independent of the positions of the points A and B (provided the distances a and b remain unchanged). a b D FIG. 114 FIG. 115 400. If K is the point of tangency of the line segment MN with the circle (Fig. 115), then BM=MK and KN=NC and consequently MN=BM+CN. (1) But MN < AM + AN. Therefore 2MN < BM+AM+CN+AN=AB+AC, whence it follows that OD 11_AD+BD_1.(a +T AB MN < AB±AC 2 On the other hand, MN > AN and MN > AM because MN is the hypotenuse inthe triangle AMN. Therefore, 2MN > AN+ AM and, by virtue of (1), SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS, PLANE GEOMETRY249 3MN > AN+NC+AM+MB=AB+AC. Hence, MN >AB+AC 3 401. Let ,4 &C be the giventriangle (see Fig. 116), AB = BC, BO II AC and 0 be the centre ofacircle tangent to AC. Denote by D and E the points of intersection of this circle with AB and .BC. Extend AB to intersect the circle a second time at a point F. Let us prove that FE I BO. Note that L OBF = = L OBE, since these angles are equaltothebase angles A and C in the triangle ABC. Furthermore, BF=BE. Indeed, if BF > BE, then laying off on BF theline segment BE'=BE we obtainthe congruent triangles OBE and OBE', and OE'=OE which is impossible because the p.oint B' lies inside the B FIG. 116 FIG. 117 circle of radius OE. It is similarly proved that the inequality BF < BE is also impossible. Hence, BO is the bisector of the vertex angle in the isosceles triangle FBE and thereforeitis the altitude to its base which implies that FE I_ BO. Therefore, L DF.[; 2 /_ ABC is in4epiolloat of the position of t11G pout 0 bn the straight line 80. Consequently, the magnitude of the arc DE subtending the inscribed angle DFE (whose measure is half the arc DE) remains constant as the circle rolls upon AC. 402. Using the notation introduced in the solution of Problem 324 we find nzbe+ad (ac {bd),mz-^.{acbd), i)ividing these inequalities termwise we get nab+cd 403. Let ABC be an equilateral triangle with side a. Denote by rr, r2 and r3 the distances from a point 114 on the circumscribed circle to the vertices of the triangle (Fig. 117). Note first that for the position of the point M indicated in Fig. 117 we have.- r1= rz-f- r3. Indeed, laying off DM=r2 we obtain an equilateral triangle BMD and hence itfollows that L ABD= / CBM which implies that Q ABD=/ CBM, and AD=rs. Now, applying the law of cosines to Q BMC we obtain a2 = r$+rs-2r,rs eos 120° = ri+rs + rzrs 250 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Consequently, ri +ra +rs = (r2 + r3)2+ra + re = 2 ( ra+ rs+ rzrs) = 2a2. 404. Let the side AB of aquadrilateral ABCD intersect a circle, and the sides BC, CD and DA be tangent to it at points E, F and G (Fig. 118). Since CE=CF and DF=DG, the inequality AB+CD > BC+DA is equivalent to the inequality AE > BE+AG, which was proved in Problem 394. DGA FIG. 118 FIG. 119 405. Let the side AD of aquadrilateral ABCD not intersect a circle, and the sides BC, CD and BA be tangent to it at points F, E, G (Fig. 119).

Putting R=1 in equality (1) we get 1X2+2X3+...n(n+1){...=1. 407. Let 0 be the centre of the billiards. Denote by B the first point of reflection and by C the secondpoint ofreflection.Let us provethatif L ABC 94- 0,then A ABC isisosceles (Fig. 121). Indeed, A BOC is isosceles and,hence,L OBC= L OCB. According to the law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection and therefore L OBC= L OBA and L OCB = L OCA.Consequently,I ABC= = L ACB. It follows that the centre 0 lies on the altitude AD drawn to the side BC. The position of the point B to which the ball should be directed so that it passes through the point A after it has been reflected at B and C, can be specified by the magnitude of the angle L BOD=a. We haveB OD = R cos a,BD = R sin a, - -BA- BDBD ncos 2acos2(2-a) FIG. 121 Since BO is the bisector of the angle B in A ABD, it follows that BD_OD BA-BA This implies -cos 2a= R cos a a 252 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS whence we obtain the equation cost a+2acos a -- 2 = 0. Finding cos a from this equation we obtain z1 cos a= - 4a+ Y(4a) + 2 . The second root is discarded since, by virtue of the inequality R > e,it gives a value of cos a less than -1. If now we suppose that L ABC=0, then a second solution of the problem appears in which the points B and C are the two extremities of the diameter passing through the point A. 408. Let S be the vertex of the given angle a, Al the first point of reflection of the ray, SB1 the side of the angle on which the point Al lies, and SBa its other side. We shall denote the consecutive points of reflection of the ray from the sidesofthe angle by A2, As,A s,... ,the path of the ray inside the angle being the polygonal line AA,A2A3... (Fig. 122).

Lay off the line segment SAl1=SAm, m=2, 3, 4,...(the points Ai and A'1 are coincident) on the side SBm. We shall pprove that the points A1, A$,... lie on a straight line1.To this end, it is sufikient to prove that every three consecutive points Am, A,,,+1 and(here we put m=0, 1, 2,. ..) are in a straight line. For this purpose, we note that Q A,,,SA,+1=Gs AmSAm+1, which implies L AmAm+1S= L AmAm+1S. Analogously,,Am+1SA,,,+z=A Am+1SA,,,+2,and, consequently, Z. SAm+1A, +8C L SAM+1Am+z But, accordingtothe law of reflection, the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection, and hence L SAm+1Am+z= L AmAm+1B Therefore, L AmAm+1S+ L SAm+1Am 12=/ AmAm+1S+ L AmAm+1B=n. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. PLANE GEOMETRY We seethatthe path ofthe ray, thatis the polygonal line AA1Aj ..., is thus developed on the straightline1. Since this straight line can intersect only a finite number of sides SBm, we conclude that the number ofreflections of the ray is finite. Itis clear thdt If SB is the last of the sides Intersected by 1, then na < and (A+1) a> P. Thus, the number of reflections is equal to an integer n such that the inequalitiesn<E,--n+1 are satisfied. To find out the conditions for the ray returning to the point A after it has been reflected several times let us construct a sequence of points C1, C,. so that the point C1 is the reflection of the point A through SB1, the point Cq is the reflectionof the point C1 through SB2, etc. (generally, the point C. is the reflection of the point Cm.t through SB ). It Is clear that the condition thatthe tay againpasses through the point A is equivalent to the condition that the Straight line I passes through one of the points C. (m = 1, 2, ...). Toformulatethisconditionanalytically,letusintroducetheangle y= L ASA0 and censider the following two possible cases: (a)if Ck is the point through which the straight line I passes, then k is an even number; (b) the point Ck corresponds to an odd number k. In the case (a) (whichis shown in trig. 122 for k=6) we have L ASCk ka. ,ASCk is isosceles and therefore LSACk=2-2 On the other hand, which yields In the case (b) we have LSACk is equal to y+tc-fl, and consequently aka k_2(3-2y-n a 253 (1) L ASCk=(k+1)a-2y and, as above, we come to the relationship n-(k-1)a-2=2aY+-P. whence k+ I (2) Reversing the argument we can easily show that if one of the relationships (1)or (2)isfulfilledfor an integer k, the straight line I passes through the point. Ck. Consequently, the ray passes through the point A once again if and only if one of the numbers (1) or (2) is an even integer. 254 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 4. Loci of Points 409. The required locus of points consists of two circular arcs: the arc BE with centre at the midpoint C of the arc AB of the given circle and the arc BF with centre at the midpoint of the second arc AB of the circle, EAF being the tangent line to the given circle atthe point A (Fig. 123). Proof. Let N be a point of the sought-for locus obtained with the aid of a point M on the lower arc AB. By the construction, the triangle NMB is isosce- les, and thus LBNA=2 LBMA=2 LBCA. FIG. 123 Consequently,the point N lies on the circle with centre at C passing through the points A and B.Fur- thermore, the point N must be inside L BAE, i.e.it lies on the arc BE of the circle with centre at the point C. Conversely, if N lies on this arc, then BNA=2LBCA=2 LBMA, whence it follows that L BNA= L NBM and Q NMB is isosceles. Hence, the point N isobtained by the above construction. When the point M is on the upper arc AB, the proof is carried out in an analogous way. 410. The desired locus of points consists of two straight lines I and k sym- metric with respect to the perpendicular BB' to the given parallel lines drawn through the point 0. The straight line I passes through the point C perpendi- cularly to OC, and B'C=OB (Fig. 124). FIG. 124 Proof. Let M and N be two points constructed with the aid of a secant AA'. We shall only carry out the proof for the point M (for N it is quite analogous). Let MP I B'C then the angles OAB and A' MP are equal as angles with per- pendicular sides.Therefore, the righttriangles OAB and A'MP with equal hypotenuses OA and A'M are congruent. Hence, A'P=OB=B'C. It follows thatif E isthe midpoint of OM, then the points M, A', C and 0 lie in a circle with centre at E and, consequently, MC 1 OC, i.e. the point M lies on the straight line 1. Conversely, if M is a point on the straight land the angle MA'O is right, then A'P=B'C=OB which implies the congruence of the triangles OAB and A'MP, and,finally,the equality OA=A'M. Consequently, the point M is obtained by the above construction. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. PLANE GEOMETRY255 411. In the case ofintersecting straight lines the required locus of points consists of fourline segments forming a rectangle ABCD whose two vertices are on the given straight lines I and m and the other two vertices are at the given distance a from them (Fig. 125). Proof. Let M be apoint such that MK L 1, ML 1 m and MK + ML = a where aisthe length of the given line segment. Through M draw a straight line AB so that OA =08 and MN 11 OB. Let I AP L OBand Q be the point of intersection of AP and MN. The equality AN=MN shows that MK = A Q and, hence, AP=AQ+QP=MK+ML=a. Consequently, the point Aisavertex of the above rectangle. The same is trueforthe point B, and hence the point M lies on a side of this rectangle. Conversely,if M lies on aFIG. 125 side of this rectangle, then reversing the argument we see that MK+ML=AP=a. Ifthe given straightlines I and m are parallel and the distance between them isequaltoh, then the desired locus of points exists only if a : h and isapair of straightlinesparallel to the given ones for a > h or the whole strip contained between I and m for a=h. 412. In the case of intersecting straightlines the required locus consists of eighthalf-lines which are the extensions of the sides of the rectangle ABCD indicated in the solution of Problem 411(Fig. 126). The proof is then analo- gous to the one given there. If the given linesIand inare parallel and the distance between them is equalto h, then the sought-for locus exists onlyif a<h and is a pair of straightlinesparallel to the given ones fora < h or the portion of the plane which is the exterior of the strip contained between I and m for a=h. FIG. 126 FIG. 127 413. If the line segment AB lies on 1, and CD on m, then the desired locus ofpointsconsists of fourline segments forming aparallelogram PQRS in which I and in are the diagonals and the positions of the vertices P and Q is determined by the relation hpCD=a2,hQAB=a2, (1) where hp and hQ are the distances from the points P and Q to the straight lines m and I (Fig. 127). Proof. Note that for fixed I and in the required locus of points is completely specified by the lengths of the given line segments AB and CD and the con- stant a and is independent of the position of these line segments on the straight lines I and in. Indeed, if this position is varied, the areas of the triangles AMB and CMD remain constant. Therefore it is sufficient to consider the particular case when the line segments AB and CD have a common endpoint coincident 256 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS withthe point of intersection of the straight lines f and m. In this case the segments AB and CD are two sides of a triangle whose third side lies in one of the four angles formed by the intersecting lines I and m. For example, in Fig. 127 the endpoints A and C are made to coincide, BD being the third side. Let M be a point of the required locus lying inside the angle BAD. Then the area of A BMD is equal to SBMD= I SAMB+SCMD-SABD I = J a2-SABD Itfollows that the distance between the point M and the straight line BD is independent of its position on the straight line PQ 11 BD. For the points P and Q relationships (1) are fulfilled. Conversely, let M be apoint on the straight line PQ with the points P and Q constructed according to (1). From the relation a2AP SAPDa2CQSCQB_ ABSABDSABD'SCDRSABD it follows that AP CQ AB-CD' i.e. PQ 11 BD. Therefore SAMB+ SCMD = SABD+ SBMD'^ SABD+ SBPD z SAPO - a2, Consequently, the point M belongs to the required locus. The other sides of the parallelogram PQRS are obtained analogously by making the other end- points of the line segments coincide, namely QR is obtained when B coincides with C, RS when B coincides with D and SP when A coincides with D. 4114. The required locusisa circle which is the U U A FIG. 128 reflectionof the given circle K through the given chord AB (Fig. 128). Proof. Construct a chord AD 1 AB in the circle K. Let A ABC be inscribed in K, and M be the point of intersection ofitsaltitudes(i.e. its orthocentre). As Is easily seen, AMCD is a parallelogram because DA and CM are parallel as perpendiculars to AB, and DC and AM are parallel as perpendiculars to 9C (DC 1 BC because BD is a diameter in K). Therefore, the point M lies on the circle K' obtained from K by shifting the latter by the distance AD in the direction of the chord DA. It is clear that K' is the reflection of K through AB. Conversely,let M be a, point on K', and MC 1 AB. Since MC=AD, the figure AMCD isa parallelogram,andtherefore AM t1 DC-But DC 1 BC because ABCD is inscribed in K and the angle BAD is right.

The similarity of the triangles OAC and 0MB implies that whence OB0M OC`OA' OB=OM-0C (2) OA By the construction, KC isan altitude in the right triangle OKM, and hence Substituting this expression in (2) we obtain the equality (I). Conversely, let M be a point on the straight line I perpendicular to OA and such that OB isdetermined by equality (1). Draw the tangent line MK and Z FIG. 129 FIG. 130 KG I OM. Let KC intersect the straight line OA at a point A'. Then, repeating the firstpart oftheproof, we conclude that OB isdetermined by formula (1) with OA replaced by ON. Hence, OA'=OA, thatisthe point A' coincides with A, and this means that the point M belongs to the sought-for locus. 416. Let AMP 1.-q > . Draw the bisectors MP and MQ of the two adjacent angles with vertex M and sides MA and MB (Fig. 130). Then, by the property of bisectors, we have BP q andBQ=q. (1) I t follows that the position of the points P and Q is independent of the posi- tion of the point M. Besides, L PMQ = 2 and therefore the point M lies on the circle K with diameter PQ. Conversely, let the points P and Q be con- structed according to(1), and K be a circle with diameter PQ. If a point M lies on this circle, then L PMQ = 2 .Through the point B draw RS 11 AM, then AMAQpAMAP_p (2) BR _ BQ- q'BBS S _ BPq' whence BR=BS and hence BM isamedian in Q RMS. Since L RMS is right, we have BM =BR, and, by virtue of (2), AM_p BMq' Therefore, the point M belongs to the locus in question. 9 -323 258 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS To express the diameter PQ in terms of the length a of the line segment AB we find from the relations PB=AB-AP=a-p PB q and the expressions and, hence, p+q p-q PQ=p 2a q qp If p = q, the requiredlocus is obviously the perpendicular to the line seg- ment AB drawn through its midpoint. 417. The sought-for locus ofpointsisthe perpendicularto the line seg- ment AB drawn through its midpoint E with the point E deleted. Proof. The triangle ADB is isosceles since L CAD= L CBD because these angles are subtended on equal arcs CD of two congruent circles (Fig. 131). There- fore, the point D ties on the perpendicular to the line segment AB drawn throughits midpoint E, and vice versa, if we take an arbitrary point D on this perpendicular which does not coincide with the point E, then the circles passing through the points A, C and D and through B, C and D are congruent. Indeed, for instance, this can be deduced from the equalities CDCD_R,=2sina _ -2sin _R2, where a=/ BAD and 0=/ CBD. FIG. 131 11 FIG. 132 418. The required locus of pointsisthe straight line drawn through two different positions of the last vertex. Proof. Let, for example, A1B1C1D1E1 and A2B2C2D2E2 be two different con- figurationsofthedeformedpolygon,theverticesA, B, C and D sliding, respectively, along straightlines'A, 1R, 1c and 1D (Fig. 132). Consider the straight line l passing through the positions El and E2 of thelast vertex. Let now the vertex on the line 1A occupy the position A, and on 1D the correspon- ding position D. The side parallelto A2E2 intersects I at a point E', and the side parallel to D2E2 at a point E\". BQ =AQ-AB= q BQ-a PB =aqandBQ=a4 SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS.

This means that the last vertex E lies on the line 1 at the point E' coincident with E\". The converseisobvious because the configuration of the deformed polygon can be reconstructed beginning with any point E on 1. 419. The required locusisacirclepassing through the endpoints of the chord AB and a point Al, obtained by the indicated construction. Proof. Let us introduce the necessary notation. There is one and only one posi- tion C1D, of the chord CD parallel to AB and such that on the given circle K it is possible to choose adirection v of describing K suchthat when the chord CD movesinthisdirectionstarting from the position C D, the endpoints of the chords AB and CD coincide,in suc- cession,at the points A, B, C1 and D1 (such adirection v may onlybecome indeterminate when AC and BD are paral- y FIG. 133 FIG. 134 lei). Let us denote by a the are AB of the given circle K to which the points C1 and D1 belong, and by P the other arc AB. Let y be the arc C1D, which does not contain the points A and B. Furthermore, let All be the point of intersection of the straightlines AC, and BD1. The point All liesinside K. Consider the circumscribed circle K1 of A ABM1 (Fig. 133). We shallprove that for any positionofthe chord CD other than C1D, the point of intersec- tion of AC and BD remains on K,. As long as both points C and D lie on the arc a, the point Al is inside K, and then [ AMB= 2 ( Y) (1) But if at least one of these points is on the arc P, the point M lies outside K. and then [ AMB = 2 (a-y). (2) In the former case M lies on the arc AM1B of the circle K, because according to (1), the angle AMB isindependent of the positionof CD, and, hence, is equal to [ AM1B. In the lattercase, since the sum of the right-hand mem- bers of (1) and (2) is equal to 2 (a+ P)= 2 . 2n=7r, the point M is on the arc AB of the circle K1 lying outside K. 9* 260 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Itis obvious that the converse is also true,i.e. any point M of the circle K1 can be obtained by the above construction for an appropriate choice of the position of the chord CD. 420. Let us designate the given circle by 0 and the given straight line by L (Fig. 134).Denote by M the second point of intersection of PQ and 0. Take any circle 0, passing through the points P and Q and intersecting the circle 0 for the second time at apoint R and the straignt line L at a point S.Let N be the second point of intersection of the line RS with the circle 0. We shallprove that MN 11 L. To this end,let us take advantage of the following well-known theorem provedin plane geometry: givena circle and a point A, then for any straight line passing through A and intersectingthis circle at points A, and Al the product of the line segments AA, and AA. is a constant independent of the choice of the straight line. Denote by A the point of the intersection of the straight lines PQ and RS. We first apply the above theorem to the circle 0, the point A and the straight lines AP and AR. Since AP intersects the circle 0 for the second time at the point M, and AR at the point N, we have AM-AP=AN-AR. (1) Now we apply this theorem to the circle 01, the point A and the same straight lines. Since AP intersects 01 for the second time atthe point Q, and AR at the point S, we can write AQ AP = AS AR. (2) From (1) and (2) we derive the equality AM_AQ- (3) ANAS Equality (3),by virtue ofthe converse of the theorem on proportionality of line segments cut off by parallel straight lines on the sides of an angle, implies that MN 11 QS which is what we set out to prove. Thus,for any circleofthe type 0 ,the point N can be specified as the second point of intersection of the straight line passing through M and parallel to L with the circle 0.This construction uniquely determines the point N irrespective of the choice of the circle 01. Consequently, all the possible straight lines RS obtained for various circles 0, intersectthe circle 0 at the point N. The singular cases in which (1) and (2) do not imply (3), namely, when the points R and P or Q and S coincide, or when PQ 11 RS, may be considered as limitingcases.For these cases the validityofthe above argument can be established on the basis of the continuity properties. 5. The Greatest and Least Values 421. If A is the vertex of the right angle in Q ABC, and C and B lie on the given parallel lines 11 and 12 (Fig. 135), then ABAa,AC= b singcosql Hence, the area of the triangle ABC is equal to SAC = 2 AB AC =sin It follows that SABC attains the least value (equal to ab) for (p= 4 .

Let a right triangle with vertex C and legs a1 and b1 be cut offfrom a rectangle ABCD with sides a and b.Consider the pentagon ABEFD thus obtained (Fig. 137).It is clear, that one of theN vertices(say C1) of the sought-forrectangle AB1C1D1 must lie on the line segment EF. The problem isthus reduced to finding the position of this vertex. To find thepoint C1 extend the sides AB a and AD of the rectangle to intersect the exten- sion of the line segment EF. This results in a z` c M triangle AMN. Let A, n,N AM -AN-mn and h ,- FIG. 137 B1C1= AD, =x.

Noting that expression (1) for S decreases when 12 -xl increases, i.e. when the point C1 moves from the point C tothe vertex M or F, we findthat there are three possible cases here, namely: (1) The point Co lies on the line segment EF; then the vertex C1 of the required rectangle coincides with Co. (2) The point Co lies on the line segment ME; then C, must coincide with E. (3) The point Co lies on the line segment FN; then C1 must coincide with F. We now must establisha criterion for distinguishing between these cases with the aid of the magnitudes of the quantities a, a1, b and b1 given in the formulation of the problem. Let usfirstfindthe quantity n. The similarity of the triangles ECF and NDF implies that n-bbl whence we find a-a1al n=b-1 a' _(a-al). (2) Now note that the point Co is within the line segment EF if the inequalities b-b1<x<b are fulfilled. Substituting x= 2with the known value of n into the above we obtain b-b5 < 2 + 2a(a-al) < b. 1 The latter inequalities are readily transformed to the form --I < a -b< (3) a1bl If the inequality -1 < a - b is violated, the point Co falls on the line seg- a1b1 ment ME, and if the inequality a- b-' < 1 does not hold, Co falls on FN.albl Thus, we arriveatthe followingfinalresults: iffor given a, b, a1 and b1 bothinequalities (3) arefulfilled, then the vertex C1 of the rectangle ofthe SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS.

Draw a circle passing through the points A and B and tangent to the other side of the angle (Fig. 138). The point of tangency is then the required point, since for any point C' on that side the angle AC'B is measured by half the difference between the arcs AB and A1B1, whereas L ACB is measured by half the arc AB. Furthermore, we have Consequently, the problem is reduced to the well-known construction ofthe geometric mean of the lengths of two given line segments (OA and OB). FIG. 138 FIG. 139 425. Consider the following three possible configurations of the line segment AB and the straight line 1. (a) AB 111. For any point M of the straight line I we have I AM-BM I > 0, and there exists apoint Mo for which I AM,-BM0 1=0. This point is the foot of the perpendicular dropped from the midpoint of AB onto 1. There is no point M forwhich the quantityJ AM-BM J attains the greatest value.This is implied by the inequalityI AM-BM I< AB in which the sign of equality only appears when A, B and M lie in a straight line (b) AB II.SinceI AM-BM I < AB, the quantityI AM - BM Iforthe point of intersection of the straight lines I and AB takes on the greatest value equaltothe lengthof AB.Thereisno point M for which the quantity AM-BM Iattains the least value.

The greatest value is attained by I AM-BM I when the point M is the point of intersection of AB with 1. 426.

But in Q BCM we have L CBM = L ACB- L CMB = L CMB, because the angle ACB is equal to the angle ADB and is measured by the arc AB, and LAMB is measured by half the arc AB. Hence, CM=CB and AD+DB > > AC+CB. 429. Let us designate the radii of the circumscribed circles of the triangles ACD and BCD by Rl and R2, respectively. Put L ADC=q>, AC=b and BC=a (Fig. 142).

Each of the cut-off circles must be tangent to two sides of Q ABC (see Fig. 143). Furthermore, the circles must be tangent to each other. Indeed, if otherwise, the radius can be increased.Therefore, the centres of the circles lie on two bisectors of interior angles, for example, OA and CO inhere 0 is the centre of the inscribed circle of Q ABC. If r is the radius of the inscribed circle of Q ABC and p the radius of the cut-off circles, then from Q AOC we have r-p_ r 2p -b ° whence we findpb -1- 2r r6+2rb+ 2r This formula shows that p assumes the greatest value when the longest side is taken as b. 266 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS B.

The sum of the interior angles in the regular polygon being equal to 1rn, the number of its sides is equal to n+2. Let PQ be the altitude of the pyramid a FIG. 160 (Fig. 159). Consider a lateral face of the pyramid, say Q QAB, and its projgction onto the base,i.e. A PAB. The conditions of the problem imply that SQPABI SQQABT The areas ofthe given triangles being in the ratio of their altitudes dropped onto the common base AB, for the cosine of the dihedral angle with edge AB we have PRI cos T= QR=k, whence it follows that the apothem of the base of the pyramid is equal to d=hcotcp=hI We then find the side of the base: a=2htan >ti Yka-1n-}-2 Since the area of the base is determined by the formula S= 2 (n+2) ad, we see that the volume of the pyramid is tanV=Sh = 3 (nka 2)1 3 3 n 2. f SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS.

The solidinquestionis an octahedron whose vertices are the centres of symmetry of the faces of the cube (Fig. 160) The volume of the octahedron is twice the volume of the regular quadrangular pyramid EABCD with altitude 2 , the area of the base ABCD being equal to 2 a2.Hence, the required vo- lume is equal to sIaI2X3X2X2a=6. 448. Itis obvious that the sectionistheisosceles trapezoid ABCD (see Fig.161).Let P be the midpoint of the side EF of the base of the pyramid. Consider L SPR containing the altitude SO of the pyramid. The line segment KO is apparently the altitude of the trapezoid ABCD. Since KO 11 SR, we have 1(02 h where his the slant height of the pyramid. It is also obvious that A B = 2a where a is the length of the side of the base of the pyramid. We also have DC=EF = 2 a and therefore, 1 ah5ah51Str= 2 2a-{ 2 .2- 8= C 2 ah) and, hence, the sought-for ratio is equal to5 S A R B FIG. 161 FIG. 162 449. Let A1BC1D be the given tetrahedron, ABCDA1B1C1D1 the parallelepiped obtained by the indicated construction (see Fig. 162). It is readily seen that the edges ofthe tetrahedron are the diagonals of the lateral faces of the parallele- piped. The tetrahedron can be obtained by cutting off and removing from the parallelepipedthefourcongruentpyramids ABDA1, BDCC1, A1B1C1B and A1DICID. The volume of each pyramid being equal to 6ofthe volume of the parallelepiped, the ratio of the volume of the parallelepiped to that of the tetrahedron is equal to VPVP =3. 278 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 450. One can easily seethat the vertices of the tetrahedrons not lying on the faces of the pyramid are the vertices of a square. To determine the length ofthe side of the square, draw, through the vertex S of the pyramid and one of those vertices, say A, of the tetrahedrons, a plane perpendicular to the base of the quadrangular pyramid (Fig. 163).This plane also passes through the foot 0 of the altitude of the pyramid, the foot Q of the altitude of the tetra- hedron and the midpoint M of the edge KL. Drop the perpendicular AB onto the base ofthe pyramid and consider the quadrilateral SOBA. Its side OB ishalfthe diagonal ofthe above square and is to be determined. However, it is easy to reveal that SOBA is a rectangle. Indeed, putting L OMS=a and L ASM = 0, we find 1 2ard, Coso:= --= S= 3 j73 and 2 a QS33 a_Y3 cos = SA -a3 Therefore SA and OB are parallel and, hence, OB = SA = a. Thus, the sought-for distance is equal to a r-2. C N FIG. 163 FIG. 164 451. Suppose that the cutting plane passes through a point of the diagonal HP of the given cube (Fig. 164). Let us first consider the sections which inter- sect the diagonal at points belonging to the line segment OP. Take the plane section QRS passing through three vertices of the cube. It obviously is one of the indicated sections. This section is an equilateraltriangle with side a y2. We can easily compute the distance from the centre of the cube to the chosen sectionwhichturnsouttobe equaltoa 6 3.Itisobvious,thatfor a 6 3the sections are equilateral triangles.

(1) But ifa 6 11-3> x0, then the sectionisa hexagon of the type ABCDEF. The sides AB, FE and CD of the hexagon are, respectively, parallel to the sides QR, QS and RS of the equilateral triangle QRS. Therefore, when exten- ded,these sides intersect and form angles of60°. Furthermore, taking into account that AF 11 CD and so on, we arrive at a conclusion that each angle of the hexagon is equal to 120°. It is also readily seen that AB=CD=EF and BC=DE=AF (it should be noted that the sides of the hexagon cut off isosceles triangles from the faces of the cube). L FIG. 166 To find the lengths of the sides of the hexagon let us extend itsside AB to intersect the extension of the edges PQ and PR at points MI and N1. It is apparent that the length of the line, segment MINI can be computed by for- mula (1). Knowing MINI, we find the line segment BNI: BNI=\\22 MINI-a)Y2=2 Y2-xY6. It follows that AB=MINI-2BNI=2 Y2+xY6. (2) The side BC can be determined in a similar way but it is clear that BC=BN1, and, hence, BC= 2y2-x /--6. (3) Note, that the section obtained by the cutting plane it passing through the point 0 is a regular hexagon (consider formulas (2) and (3) for x=0). The ver- tices of this hexagon are at the midpoints of the edges of the cube (Fig. 165). 280 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS It is obvious that if one of the two parts into which the cube is cut by the plane n is turned about the diagonal OP through an angle 60°,the hexagon goes into itself, and we thus obtain two polyhedrons symmetric with respect to the plane a. Consequently, the section intersecting the diagonal atapoint of the line segment HO whose distance from the point 0 is x can be obtained from one of the sections that have been already considered by turning through 60°. 452. The projectionis a regular hexagon with sidea 3 6. To verify this assertion it is convenient to consider the projections of all the plane sections of the cube investigated in Problem 451 (see Fig. 164). Allthese sections, when projected,do not change their sizes, and thus we obtain the figure shown in Fig. 166. Knowing thatthe side of the triangle RQS is equal to a Jr 2, we find from the triangle GOS the relation Gs .Y3-a112 22 which yields GS= a 3 6 The side oftheregularhexagon A1BIC1D1E1Fi (see Fig. 165) being equal to a 2 2, the sought-for ratio of the areas is equal to \" ' _ 22z 3 453.

The solidin question is made up of two pyramids with common base KMN (Fig. 168). We can easily find the altitude OR of the lower pyramid by dropping the perpendicular PD from the midpoint P of the side KN onto the base of the pyramid. The point D bisects the line segment QL. Taking advan- tage of this fact, we obtain, from QAPD, the relation PDDA5 RQ-QA-4' whence we find RQ= 5 PD and, hence, OR=5 PD= I52aI/ 3a 06 Here we have taken advantage of the factthatina regular tetrahedron with edge a the altitude is equal to a3 .

Considering Q SAC, we readily note that Q lies in the point ofintersection of the medians ofthis triangle. Therefore, MN_SQ_2 BD-SO-3' and, hence, MN= 3 b. Furthermore, from the right triangle SAC we find AK= 2 SC=ga+az. Since AK I MN, we have S..C2 AK MN= 6 V7-4.2. 456. Let NQN1Q1 and LML1M1 be the parallelsections ofthe prism (Fig. 170), a the length of the diagonal AC of the base and H the lengthof the line segment KKI. Then the area of the first section is S= 2 (a+-2-)= 4 Ha. The area of the other section is S1= 2 PT (A2C2+LM)+ 2 P,T (AzC2+L1M,). 282 But we have PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS A2C2=a,LM= 4-,L1M1= 4 a,PT= 4 H andP,T = 4 H, which is obviously implied by the similarity ofthe correspondingtriangles. Therefore we obtain S'=1IaH and, hence, S'-2 S.1 Note. This problem can also be solvedina simple way if we take into consideration the formula Spr = S COS [p, (I ) where S is the area of a polygon in a plane P, Spr is the area of the projection of this polygon on a plane Q and rp the angle between the planes P and Q. According to formula (1),theareas A0HC,of the parallel sectionsinthe problem are inthe ratio ofthe areas oftheir projections.

Let the face of area So be the base ABC of the given pyramid ABCD, DO the altitude of the pyramid, and DA1, DB1 and DC1 the altitudes of the lateral faces (Fig. 173). The line segments OC1, OAI and OB1 being,respectively,the projections of DC1, DA1 and DBI onto the base ABC, we have OC11 AB, O,4 J_ BCand OB1I AC, and therefore L DC1O, L DA1O and L DBIOare the plane angles of the corresponding dihedral angles and, by the hypothesis,are equal. It follows that the triangles DOC1, DOA1 and DOB1 are congruent. To facilitate thecom- putation, let us introduce the following notation: DO=H,DC1=DA1=DB1=h, OC1=OA1=OBl=r, SI+ S2+ S3 = S. Itis obvious that risthe radius of the inscribed circle of L ABC. The volume of the pyramid ABCD is V= 3 SoH. From the right triangle DOCI we obtain (1) H= 1/_h2:- r2.

We have the total of six lunes (according to the number of the edges) and four triangles (Fig. 194). Let us denote the area of each triangle by S1, and the area of each lune by S2. We then have 4S,+6S2=4nR2. (1) Let So be the sum of the areas of a triangle andthe three adjacent lunes. So is the area of a spherical segment cut off by the plane of the corresponding face of the tetrahedron. This area is equalto 2nRh where h is the altitude of the 298 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS segment. Since the altitude ofthe tetrahedron is divided by the centre of the sphere in the ratio 3:1 (see Problem 475), we have H=R- 3 R= 3 R, which yields Furthermore, we have h=2R- 3 R= 3 R.

Let R be the radius of the base of the cone, a the angle between the axis of the cone and its element, and r the radius of the inscribed sphere. The axial section of the cone shown in Fig. 195 is an isosceles triangleABC.

Substituting these expressions in the left-hand side of (1), we get 11+sina18 2 sin a cost a_5 We have cost a=1-sine a and therefore, cancelling out 1 + sin a, we receive 36 sine a-36 sin a+5=0, which gives us sin a1= 6 andsin a2= Hence, the sought-for vertex angle of the axial section of the coneis equal to 2 arc sin 6 ,thatisto 2 arc sin 6 .

Eliminating I from equalities (2) and (4) we find rr, = R2 With the aid of this equality, eliminating I Irom (2) and (3), we obtain r2+r2=R2 (2m-I).

From the right triangle A001 we find A02 = A02+002, thatis It follows that (r+ p)2 =(R-r)2+ (R -p)2. r'R which results in P=+ R 2sin 8+1 l/2-Y2+1 494.The inscribed spheres being congruent,their centres are equidistant from the centre 0 ofthe sphere S. Consequently, the centre of symmetry of the cube indicated inthe problem coincides with the centre 0 of the sphere S (Fig. 206). Let x be the sought-for radius of the spheres. Itis readily seen that the edge ofthe cubeisthen AB=2x, and half the diagonal of the cube is A0=C0-CA=R-x. On the other hand, we have AO= 7 2xry, 306 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS and therefore we get the equation R-x=x JrY, whence we find Rx-=y.3+I . 495, Let r be the radius of the base of each of the two inscribed cones whose common portion consists of two congruent frustums of the cones.

It can readily be proved thatthe centre A of the base of the cone is equidistantfromallthethree points of tangency of the spheres with the plane P. Based on this fact, we find AD=23'Ir 3R.

The centresofthefirstfour sphereslieat the vertices of a regular tetrahedron, since the distance between the centres of any two congruent spheres tangent to one another is equal to 2R. It is easy to show that the centres of FIG. 210 B FIG. 211 the fifth and sixth spheres coincide with the centre of gravity of the tetrahedron (Fig. 210)Let r be the radius of the fifth (larger) sphere, and p the radius of the sixth sphere. As is obvious, r=p+2R. (1) Since the distance from the centre of gravity and the vertex of the tetrahedron in question is equal to26 R, we obtain p+R=R.

The centres ofthe smaller spheresare equidistant from the centres of the cor- respondinglargerspheresand therefore they are projectedintothecentresof gravity 01 and 02 of the equilateraltri- angles ABC and BCD. Besides, the radii ofthesmallerspheresare equal, by the hypothesis,andthereforetheline segment joining their centresis parallel totheplaneunderconsiderationand is bisected by the point of tangency of the spheres.Therefore, theprojection of that point is on theline segmentBC.

Let P be the plane of the triangle ABC, Pr the plane of the triangle A1BIC1 and 1 the line of intersection of P and Pr (Fig. 217).Denote by QAB the plane passing through A, B and 0. The straight line A1B1 is in the plane FIG. 2i6 FIG. 217 QAB. The straightlines A1B1 and AB are nonparallel and, hence, they inter- sect at a point TAB This pointlies in the planes P and Pr and thus on the line r. We similarly prove that the straight lines BC and B1C1 intersect at a point TBC lying on 1, and the straight lines AC and A1C1 at a point TAC also belonging to 1. 507. Let 01 be the centre of gravity of the face ASC of a triangular pyramid SABC (see Fig. 218) and B01 one of the line segments considered in the prob- lem. Take another face,forinstance BSC.

Indeed, if M1 and M2 are the midpoints of the line segments AC and BC, then it is obvious that AB 11 M,M2; itis also clearthat 0102 M1M2, since the points 01 and 02 divide, respectively, the line segments1S and M2S in one and the same ratio. Therefore, AB 110102 andthe figure AB0201 is a trapezoid. Consequently, its diagonals BO1 and A02 intersectLet us denote the point of intersection of the diagonals by 0.

Hence, this point coincides with the point 0. Consequently, all the line seg- ments in question intersect at the point 0. Itis also evident that the point 0 divides each of them in the ratio 1:3 which is what we set out to prove. S If FIG 218 FIG. 219 508. We shall precede the proof with an auxiliaryargument. Let PPI and QQ1 he two skew lines and points A, B and C lie on QQ1, the point B being between the points A and C. Also let A1, B1 and C1 be the feet of the perpendi- culars dropped from the points A, B, C onto PPI.Denote, respectively, by hA, hE and hc the distances from the points A, B and C to the straight line PPI. We shallprove that/inisless than atleast one ofthe distances hA or hc. To this end,project the configuration shown inFig. 219 onto a plane n perpendicular to the straight line PPI. Then the straight line PP1 is projected into a point 0, and the line segments AA1, BBI and CCI, when projected, do not change their size because they all are parallel to the plane n. The point B' is then between the points A' and C'. Now taking thetriangle A'OC', we can assert that the inclined line OB' is shorter than one of the inclined lines OA' or OC'. Indeed, dropping from the point 0 the perpendicularto A'C' (which is not shown in Fig. 219), we see that the point B' is closer to the foot of that perpendicular than one of the other two points A' and C'.Itfollowsthat hB is shorter than hA or hc. Let now ABCD be an arbitrary triangular pyramid, and EFG a triangular section such that at least one of its vertices, say F, is not a vertex of the py- ramid. Let us prove that the area ofthetriangle EFG is then less than the area of one of the triangles AEG or DEG (Fig. 220) In fact, all the threetriangles have a common side EG, and, as has been proved, the distance from F to the straight line EG isless than the distance from A or D and this line.If SAEFG <SA AFG, thenthe assertion has been proved. If SAEFG < SADEG and, for instance, the point E is not a vertex of the pyramid, then we apply the above argument to A DEG and compare its 11-323 314 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS area with the areas of the triangles DGA and BDG. Ifnecessary, again apply- ing the same argument tothetriangle BDG we prove the assertion of the problem. Itis clear from this solutionthat if a sectionof the pyramid does not coincide with its face, then the area of the section is strictly less than the area of one of the faces. C FIG. 220 FIG. 221 509. Instead of comparing the sums of the face angles at the vertices S and S' we shall compare the sums of the base angles ofthe lateral faces of both pyramids adjacent to each of the three vertices of their common base. We shall prove that for the outer pyramid every sum of this kind is greater than the corresponding sum for the inner pyramid. For instance, we shall prove below that (see Fig. 221).L ACS+L SCB > L ACS'+L S'CB (1) From (1) and analogous inequalities for the vertices A and B we obtain the solution of the problem`., Indeed, adding together thesethreeinequalities we find out that the sum!of all the six base angles of the lateral faces of the outer pyramid is greater than the corresponding sum 2'' for the inner pyramid, that is we have the inequality (2) But the quantities we are interested in are, respectively, equal to the differen- ces 180°.3-=540°-l' and and, consequently, they satisfy t he opposite inequality. Thus, to solve the problem, we must only prove inequality (1). Extend the plane ACS' to intersect the outer pyramid. Considering the trf- hedral angle CS'S\"B, we conclude that L S'CS\"+ L S\"CB > L S'CB. (3) Adding L ACS' to both members of this inequality we obtain L ACS\"+ L S\"CB > L ACS'+ L S'CB. (4) But for the trihedral angle CASS\" we have L ACS+ ! SCS\" > L ACS\". (5) SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS SOLID GEOMETRY315 Based on (5), we substitute the larger quantity L ACS+ L SCS\" for L ACS\" in inequality (4) and thus obtain L ACS+(L SCS\"+ L S\"CB) > L ACS'+ L S'CB, i.e. inequality (1). 510. Let 01, 02, 03 and 04 be the centres of the given spheres and Pir the plane tangent to the spheres with centres 0; and 0k (i < k). Thus, we consider the six planes P12, P13, P23, P14, P24 and P34. Let us first prove that the planes P10, P13 and P23 have a common straight line. Indeed, each of the planes isperpendicularto the plane 010203 because itis perpendicular to the centre line ofthe corresponding spheres, this centre line lying in that plane. Besides,itisevident that the planes under consideration (Fig. 222) pass through the point Q4 of intersectionofthebisectorsof p 010203. Thus, the planes P1.., P13 and Pt3 in fact intersect along astraight line which,as we have incidentally proved,is perpendicular to the plane of the centres 010203 and passes through the centre ofthe inscribed circle ofthetriangle010203. Let us designate this line by L4. 0j 04 FIG. 222 We similarly prove that the planes P.3, P 4 and P34 have a common straight line L1 which is perpendicular to the plane of the triangle 020304 and passes through the centre of its inscribed circle and so on. Therefore we arrive at the following auxiliary problem (Fig. 223): a circle is inscribed in each face of the triangular pyramid 01020304, and the perpendicular is drawn through its centre to this face. It is necessary to prove that all four perpendiculars L1, L2, L3 and L4 have a point in common provided that the points of tangency of every two circles with the corresponding edge of the pyramid coincide. This factis almost apparent.Let 0 be the point of intersection ofthe straight lines L1 and L4; the latter intersectbecause they are in the plane P23 and are not parallel. Let us now prove that the straight lines L3 and L2 also pass through the point 0. Indeed, the point 0 lies on the line of intersection of the planes P12 and P24 because the straight line L. belongs to the plane P12, and the line L1 to the plane P24.But the line of intersectionof P12 and P24 is the straight line L3, and hence thelatter passes through the point 0. We analogously prove that the straight line L2 passes through the point 0. it* 316 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 511. If we are given three points A, B and C not lying in a straight line, then these points are the centres of three pairwise tangent spheres. Indeed, if P is D a FIG. 224 the point of intersection of the bisectors of the interior angles in Q ABC, and PI, P2 and P3 arethefeetofthe perpendiculars dropped from P tothe corresponding sides AB, BC and CA, then API = AP3,BPI = BP2,CP2 = CPa, and the spheres with the centresA, B and C whose radii are respectively equal to rA=API,rB=BP2,rC=CPa are pairwise tangent to one another. Let ABCD be the given pyramid (Fig. 224). Consider thethree spheres of radiirA, rB and rc with. centres at A, B and C which are pairwise tangent to one another.Let us denote the points at which the spheres inte- rsect the edges AD, BD and CD by AI, BI and C1. We shall prove that AID=BID= = CID. By the hypothesis indicated in the problem, we have AD+BC=BD+AC. By the above construction, we can write AD=rA+AID,BC=rR+rc, BD=rB+BID,AC=rA+rc, Substituting the last four expressions in the foregoing equality we obtain AID = BID. Similarly, using the equality BD+AC-=CD+AB, we deduce BID == CID. Consequently, the sphere with centre D and radius rD=A,D=BID=CID Is tangent to each of the first three spheres and, hence, the four constructed sphe- res are pairwise tangent to one another. 512. Let us denote by rI, r2 and r3 the radii ofthe spheres. We shall sup- pose that rIr2 : r3. Draw a tangent plane to the first two spheres. In addi- FIG. 225 tion, through the centres ofthese spheres draw a plane perpendicular to this tangent plane, and consider the circle ofradius r tangent to the two great circlesinthe section and totheir common tangent line (Fig. 225).Itis obvious that the third sphere can be tangent to the first two spheres and to their common tangent plane ifitis\"not too small\",namely,ifr3r. We have (see Fig. 225) VO102-OIC2 =AO+OB, that is (rl+r2)2-(rl-ra)2 = Y (ri +r)2-(rl-r)2 + Y(rs+r)2-(r2-r)2. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. SOLID GEOMETRY317 From this equation we find r= rrr2 (v'7 +Yi.,)2 ' Consequently, the radii of the spheres must satisfy the relation rlr2r(Yr1+ 1/-r2)2' 513. Let n be the number of lateral faces of the pyramid in questionJoin an arbitrary point 0 lyinginthe plane of thebaseto all the vertices. We thus obtain n triangular pyramids with common vertex at the point 0Itis obvious that the volume V ofthe given pyramid isequal to the sum of the volumes of the smaller triangular pyramids. We have V= I 3S(ri+r2+...-f-rn), where rr, r2,..., r are the distances from the point 0 to the lateral faces of the pyramid, and S is the area of its lateral face. Hence, theuantilrr 3V 9Y r+ s-I- ... +rn= S is a constant independent of the position of the point 0 in the plane of the base which is what we set outto prove. 514. Consider the configuration shown in Fig. 226 where we see two shaded planes and the triangle ADE inthe plane P passing through the vertices A. D, H and E of the given parallelepiped. The plane P intersectsthe plane of A BCD along the straightline KD whichpasses through the pointK of intersection of the diagonals of the parallelogram ABEC. Consequently, the line FIG. 226 C N segment KD is a median of A AED. Asisobvious, AO is alsoa median of A AED. Therefore, S is the point ofintersectionof the medians of A AED, and, hence, we arrive at the required result: AS= 3 A0= 3 AH. 515. Let us draw the plane indicatedinthe problem through the vertices B, D and F (Fig.227) and aplane parallel to itthrough the vertices C, E and G. These planes give in the sections two congruent equilateral triangles. Let a be the lengthofthe sides ofthese triangles.If now we draw a plane parallel to the above planes through the midpoint of one of the six edges jo4n- ing the vertices of the two triangles, for example, through the midpoint N of the edge BC, then the section of the parallelepiped by this plane is a hexagon 318 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS MNPQRS whose all sides are obviously equal to 2 . Furthermore, note that MN II DF and NP II BD. Therefore, MNP and BDF are supplementary angles and, consequently, L MNP= 120°. We similarly prove that the other angles of the hexagon are also equal to 120°. 516. Let SABC bethe giventetrahedron, P and Q the midpoints of the opposite edges AC and SB. Consider a section MPNQ ofthe tetrahedron con- )y FIG. 228 FIG. 229 taining the line segment PQ (Fig.228).Letustake the plane section SPB which obviously divides the tetrahedroninto two parts ofthe same volume. The solution of the problem reduces to proving thatthe volumes of the pyra- mids SPQN and MPQB are equal. Drop the perpendiculars from the points M and N onto the plane SPB, and designate their feet by K and L, respectively. The triangles PQB and SPQ S are of the same area, and therefore to solve the problemitis sufficientto show that LN=MK. We shallprove thisequality establishing the relation MO=N0. (t) For this purpose,letus consider a pair of parallel planes containing the skew lines SC and AB (Fig. 229). The fine segment PQ joining the midpoints of the segments AC and SB, we see that PQ isinthe plane parallel to the given planes and equidistant from them. Therefore, the line segments PQ and MN intersect,the point of intersection bisecting MN. 517. Let SABC be the given pyramid (Fig. 230). Draw the altitude SP from the a vertex S to the face ABC and also the alti- FIG. 230 tudes SD, SE and SF from the same vertex to the bases AC, AB and BC of the other three faces. Itis readily seen that the triangles SPD, SPE and SPF are equal because L SDPL SEP= L SFP (cf. Problem 458). Then we draw through the edges AB, BC and AC the planes bisecting the corresponding dihedral angles. These planes intersect at apoint 0 equidistant from all four faces of the pyramid. Therefore, 0 is the centre of the inscribed SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS SOLID GEOMETRY319 sphere of the pyramid.Itis evident that inthe case under consideration the point 0 is on the altitude SP ofthe pyramid because,as has been shown, the above triangles are congruent.Repeating this argument we establish that all the altitudes of the pyramid intersectat the point 0. Based on this fact, we can assert that, for instance, the triangles APS and SPE liein one plane, and, consequently, the line segments AP and PE are ina straight line. The- refore, in AABC, the straight line AE isabisector of theangle A and, si- multaneously, the altitude drawn to BC. Analogously,the otherbisectorsof A ABC are its altitudes. Hence, ABC is an equilateral triangle. Repeating this argument we establish that all the faces of the pyramid are equilateral triang- les which is what we set out to prove. 518. Let the line segment AB be in a plane Q (see Fig. 231) and the line segment CD in a plane P,theseplanes being parallel.Through the point A draw a straight line parallel to CD, and lay offthe line segment AA1 =CD. Construct a parallelogram ABBIA, on the sides AB and AA,. Make an analo- gous constructioninthe plane P. Joining A with C, B with C1, A, with D and B, with D, we obtain aparallelepiped ABBIAIDCCIDI. Consideringthe face ACB as the base of the pyramid DACB, we see that the volume of the pyramid is equal to6 of the volume of the parallelepiped. However, the vo- lume of the parallelepiped is retained when AB and CD are translated in their planes P and Q because the area of the base ABB1A1 and the altitude (which is the distance between the planes P and Q) remain unchanged. Therefore the volume of the pyramid is also retained. FIG 231 FIG. 232 519. Let P and Q be thepoints ofintersection of a given line with the faces CBA and DBA of a givendihedralangle (Fig.232). Draw through the edge AB the plane ABE bisecting the dihedral angle and then through the point 0 at which the straight line PQ intersects ABE draw the plane CIB1D1 perpendicular to the edge AB. Furthermore,let OM ,L B1D,, ON 1 B1C1, and SR be the projectionof PQ onto the plane D1B1C1 sothat QS J. B1D1 and PR J B1C1. If the points P and Q are equidistant from the edge, i.e. B1R = B1S, (1) then B1RS is an isosceles triangle, SO=R0 and, hence, QO=PO, I. e. the line segments QO and PO are congruent asinclinedlines with equalprojections. Also taking into account that, by the construction, we have MO = NO, (2) 320 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS we conclude that Q OMQ and A 01VP are right and congruent. It follows that L MQO= L NPO. (3) Thus, we have proved that condition (I) implies (3). Conversely, letit be given that condition (3) expressing the equality of the anglesisfulfilled.Then, byvirtueof(2) thetriangles QMO and PNO are congruent. It follows that QO=PO, and, hence, S0=OR which implies(1). 520. Join the point B with C and A with D (Fig. 233).Through the point A draw a straight line parallel to MN to intersect the line passing through B and N atapoint K. Note that AK=2MN, since MN is a midline in the r FIG. 233 triangle ABK. Furthermore, we have Q BNC=,L KND because BN=NK, CN = ND and L BNC = L KND. Therefore, DI(= BC. From the triangle ADK it follows that DKH- AD> AK=2MN. (itis essentialhere thatthe point D isnot in the straight line AK because, if otherwise, we must put the sign >). Thus, we obtain the required result: BC+ AD > 2MN. 521. Let A,8, C and D be arbitrary points lying on the edges of atet- rahedral angle with vertex E (Fig. 234). We shall prove, forinstance, that L CED < L CEA+ L AEB+ L BED. (1) Draw the plane CEB. By the property ofthe face angles of atrihedral angle, we haveL CED < L CEB+ L BED, (2) and, by the same reason, L CEB < L CEA± L AEB. (3) Inequalities (2) and (3) imply (1) and thedesiredinequality has thus been proved. ItIs evident that the above argument also holds true when the tetrahedral angle is not convex, i.e. when the edge ED is on the other side of the plane CEB. 522. Suppose that we are given a convex tetrahedral angle with vertex S (Fig. 235). The extensions of the planes BSC and ASD intersect along a straight line 11 and the extensions of the planes ASB and DSC intersect along a straight line12.Obviously,the straightlines11and12do not coincide because, if otherwise,the extended faces pass through one straightline.Let P be the plane containing the straight lines 11 and 12. Taking advantage ofthe conve- xity ofthe tetrahedralangle, we can easily show that the plane P and the given angle have only one point in common, namely the point of intersection S. SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. SOLID GEOMETRY321 Therefore, the whole angle lies on one side of the plane P (this fact is,howe- ver, almost obvious). Now let us show that every plane parallel to the plane P and intersecting the angle yields a parallelogram in the section. Indeed, by the above, aplane ofthis typeintersects all the edges of the tetrahedral angle. Denoting the points corresponding to intersection by A', B', C' and D' we see that A'D' 11 B'C' because each of these line segments is paral- lel to I,. Analogously, we have A'B' 11 D'C'. Hence, we obtain the required result: the quadrilateral A'B'C'D' is a paral- lelogram. 8 FIG 236 523. Consider the configuration in Fig. 236. Let DL and CM bethe altitu- des oftwo triangles ADB and ACB drawn totheir common base AB. The triangles are of the same area, andtherefore DL=CM. Furthermore,let KN be the common perpendicular to the skew lines AB and DC. Draw through the line segment KN a plane P perpendicular to the edge AB, and projectthe quadrilateral LMCD onto the plane P (Fig. 237). The seg- ments DL and CM being projected without changing their lengths (because they are parallel to the plane P), and the projection of the line segment LM being D FIG 237 the point K, we obtain in the plane P theisoscelestriangle KDIC1. By the construction, we have KN I DC and, consequently, KN 1 D1C1. Therefore KN is an altitudein Q KD1 1.Consequently, N is the midpoint of the segment D1CI and thus of the segment DC as well. We see that, under the assumptions of the problem,the common perpendi- cular KN tothe two skew lines AB and DC bisects the edges AB and DC. As is readily seen from Fig. 237, LK=KM because DD1=CC1. Therefore (see Fig. 236), AL=BM, and the congruence of the right triangles ALD and 8MC implies that AD=BC 322 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS We analogously prove that AC-BD and AB=DC. Consequently,all the faces are congruent as triangles with three equal corresponding sides. 3. Loci of Points 524. Let P be one of the planes passing througha given point A, and M the projection of another given point B on the plane P. Let C be the midpoint of the line segment AB (Fig. 238). The triangle ABM being right, we have CM= 2 AB. Thus, all the points M which can be thus constructed are at the same distanceAB from the po- int C and, consequently, are on the sphere of radiusAB with centre at the point C. Besides, itis apparent that every point of this sphere coincides with one of the projections of the point B. The required locus is thus a sphere of diameter AB. FIG. 238 FIG. 239 525. Let 0 bethe centre of the given sphere. Draw throughthe given straightline Ia plane P intersectingthe spherein a circle with centre at a point M (Fig. 239). As is known, OM IP. Then draw through thepoint 0 a plane P1 perpendicular to the straightline 1. Denote the point ofintersec- tion of the plane Pt andline Iby C. The planes P, and P being mutually perpendicular, the line segment OM is in the plane P,. Now consider the right triangle OMC. The point C is independent of the choice of the cutting plane P, and the hypotenuse OC of the righttriangle OMC isinvariab!e.If D is the midpoint of OC, then MD=02 . Consequently, ifI and the sphere have no points in common, the sought-for locusisa portion ofthe circumference of a circle of radius 2 contained inside the sphere (this are liesin the plane P1 and passes through the centre of the sphere).IfIis tangent to the sphere, then the sought-for locus is a circleof radius Z where R is the radius of the sphere. Finally,if 1 intersects the sphere at two points, the locus of points M is a circle of radius O2 526. The required locus isasurface of revolution obtained by rotating an are of a circleor an entire circle aboutits diameter OC (see the solution of the preceding problem). SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS. SOLID GEOMETRY323 527. We shallprove thatthe requiredlocusisa sphere of radius R 316 2 and that the centre of this sphere coincides with the centre of the given sphere. Let M be an arbitrary point of the required locus; the line segments MA, MB and MC (see Fig. 240) being the segments ofthe tangent lines drawn to the given sphere from a common point, their lengths are equal. Therefore, the right triangles AMC, CMB and AMB are congruent. Hence, ABC is an equilateral triangle. As is obviously seen,the line segment OM intersects A ABC atits centre ofgravity 01. Let AM=a, then AC=a r2 and AO,='1i.6.Substituting 3 these values in the equality (here we take advantage of the fact that OAM is a right triangle, and express its area in two different ways) we obtain =Ra. 3 0 It follows that FIG. 240 Thus,the point M lies on the above-mentioned sphere.Rotating the given sphere, together with the tangents AM, CM and BM, about the centre 0, wc' see that every point of the sphere belongs to the locus of points inquestion. 528. Let A be a given point in space, B the point of intersection of straight lines lying in a fixed plane, and C the foot of the perpendicular dropped from A on the plane. FIG. 241 FIG. 242 Furthermore, take an arbitrary straightline passing through the point B and draw the perpendicular AD to it (Fig. 241).Then, according to the well- known theorem, CD I BD. Consequently, thepoint D liesin the sphere whose diameteristheline segment BC. It can easilybe proved that, conversely, any point of theindi- cated circle is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the point A to a straight line belonging to the family in question. Therefore, the sought-for locusis the circleinthe given plane constructed ontheline segment BC as diameter. 324 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 529. There are two possible cases here which are considered below. (1) The straight line AB is not parallel to the plane P. Designate the cor- responding point of intersection of AB and P by D (Fig. 242).Let M be the point of tangency of the plane withone of spheres belonging to the family in question. Draw the plane through the straight lines AB and DM.It intersects the sphere along acircletangenttothe straightline DM at the point M. By the well-known property of a tangent and a secant drawn from one point to a circle, we have DM theconstant lengthindependent ofthe choice of the sphere, and, hence, all the points M lie in the circle of radius r=YDBDA with centre at the point D. Let us denote this circle by C. Let now, conversely, M be a point of the circle C. We shall prove that it belongs tothe locus of-pints under consideration. Draw an auxiliary circle through the point A, B and M and denote its centre by 01 (Fig. 243). According to the construction we have DMis tangent to this circle. Hence, O1M 1 DM. Now erect at the point M the perpendicular to the plane P, and at the point 01 the perpendiculartothe plane ofthe auxiliary circle. The two perpendi- culars lie in a plane perpendicular to DM at the point M and are not parallel to each other because, ifotherwise, thepoint 01, and the points A and B as well, are in the plane P. Therefore, these perpendiculars intersect at a point 0. Itis obvious that OA=0B=0M because the projections O1A, O1B, and OIM of these line segments are equal as radii of one circle.Therefore, the sphere with centre at the point 0 and radius OM is tangent to the plane P and passes through the points A and B.Thus, conversely, any point of the circle C be- longs to the locus. Hence, the sought-for locus of points is the circle C. (2) If the straightline AB isparallel to the plane, the required locus is a straight line which liesinthe plane P,isperpendicular to the projection of the line segment AB on the plane P and bisects this projection. S FIG. 243 FIG. 244 530. Case (a).Let D be the midpoint of the line segment AB (Fig. 244), C the movable vertex, Q the centre of gravityof Q ABC and Q' the centre of gravity of A ASB. Since the point Q dividestheline segment DC in the ratio 1:2, the locus of these points is obviously a ray parallel to the edge SE and passing throughthe point Q' whichisthe centre of gravity of Q ASB. Case (b).If the point B is also moved along the edge SG, thenthe centres of gravity Q' of the triangles ASB are in the ray parallel to the edge SG and passing through the point Q\" which divides the line segment AS into the parts AQ\" and Q'S which are in the ratio 2:1. The rays consideredin the case (a), SOLUTIONS AND ANSWERS SOLID GEOMETRY325 which correspond to every fixed position of the point B, cover the whole section of the trihedral angle by the plane passing through the point Q\" and parallel to the edges SG and SE. 4. The Greatest and Least Values 531. Without lossof generality, we may assume that the cutting plane intersects the edge CE of the cube shown in Fig. 245. It is evident that in the section we always obtaina parallelogram AMEN. The area S of the parallelogram can be found by the formula S= AB- MK, where MK isthe perpendicular drawn from the point M of the edge CE to the diagonal AB. Thus,the area S is the least when the lengthoftheline segment MK attains its minimal value. But, among the line segments joining the points of two skew lines CE and AB, the perpendicular common to these lines hasthe least length. It is readily seen that the common perpendiculartothe indicated straight lines is the line segment M'O joining the midpoints of the edge CE and of the dia- gonal AB. Indeed, AM'B is an isosceles tri- A FIG. 245 angle, and therefore M'O J AB. Since COE is also an isosceles triangle, we have M'O 1 CE. Thus, the sectionbisectingthe edge CE has the least area S= a2a2 }'_6 2= 2 This problem can also be solved by applying the following theorem: the square ofthe area of a plane polygon is equal to the sum of the squares of the areas ofitsprojections on three mutually Per- pendicular planes. The theorem is easily proved on the basis of the formula by A C (a) M D E (b) FIG. 246 FIG 247 which the area of the projection of a plane polygon on a plane is equal to the area of the polygon multiplied by the cosineofthe angle between the planes (see formula (1) in the solution of Problem 456). Considering this theorem proved, let us denote the lengthofthelineseg- ment CM by x (seeFig.245).The projectionsof the parallelogram we are interested in on the planes ACD, ECDB and BDN are shown in Fig.246, a, b, c. The areas of the projections are respectively equal to a2, ax and a-'-ax, and, by virtue ofthe above theorem, S2=(a2)2+(ax)24 (a2-ax)2--2a2 (x2 - -ax-j-a2).Rewritingthequadratictrinomialx2-ax--a2intheform 326 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS a X-24 aa, we find(cf.(1),page 43) that S2 takes on its least value for x= a and the minimum areais S2a2 3 as = a2 2 6 2 min = 4 2 532. Consider the configuration shown in Fig. 247. The quadrilateral MNKL in the section of the pyramid ABCD isa parallelogrambecause LK ++ CD and MN 11 CD. Hence, LK ++ MN and, analogously, LM 1+ KN.If[, LKN=a, then the area of the parallelogram is equal to sin a. The angle LKN being equal to that between the skew lines AB and CD, its sine is a constant quantityforalltheparallel sections under consideration. Thus, the section area only depends on the prod yet magnitude ofthe Let us denote the length of theline segment AN by x.Then, by the simila- rity of the triangles, we have KN_AD-xKLx ABAD'CD _AD' Let us multiply these equalities: KN KL= AB-CD AD3(AD-x)z. Since AAB D Disconstant, itfollows from the preceding formula that the 2 product attainsitsgreatestvalue when the product (AD-x)x is maximal. Regarding this product as the quadratic trinomial - x2+ ADx and repre- A nting itin the form - x-fl / -+-r `2D, we see that its greatest valuese is attained for x= 2D (cf. (1), page 43).

Applying the formula a3+b3=(a+b)(a2-ab+b2) =(a+b)[(a+b)2-3ab]. we obtain sin6 x+ cosh x= (sinz x-r cost x) [(sin2x+cos2 x)2-3 sine x cosy x] _ =1-3sin\" xcos2x=1- 4 sin-' 2x. 534. Denote the left member of the identity by S and, according to formu- la (14),page 73,substitute the sum cos(a-(-[3)+cos(a-S) for the product 2 cos acos 3. Then S can be written in the form S=cost a-cos ((X+ 0) cos (a Again applying formula (14), we find coscos 2 (cos-2a+ cos 20). If now we substituteI + 2s 2a for -cost a, then we obtain the required result 1-cos 20S_ 2 = sing 535. From the formula tan (a+ P) = 1-tan a. tan [i it follows that tan a+ tan A=tan (a+0) [1-tan a tan P], whence tan a+ tan Is-tan (a + 3)--tanatan (3 tan(a+P).

Formula (2) can also be deduced from formulas (7) and (8) on page 73. 537.

Transforming analogously two other factors on the right hand side of (1), we get the required result 540.Toprovetheassertion,we multiplybothsidesoftheequality cos (a+s)=0 by 2 sin (S and apply formula (15) on page 73. 541. The permissible values of the arguments are determined by the condition cos a cos (a+13)0. Note that the equality tan (a+13)=2 tan a (1) to be proved involves the arguments a+13 and a.Therefore, itis natural to introduce the same arguments into the original equality. We have 0=(o+13)-a, 2a+13=(a+13)+a. Substituting these expressions of13 and 2a+13 into the original equality 3 sin (3 = sin (2a+ 13) (2) and using the formulas for the sines of a sum and difference of angles, we trans- form (2) to the following form: sin (a+(3) cos a=2cos (a+(i) sin a. Dividing both members of (3) by we obtain (1). (3) 542. All values of a and 13are permissible here except thosefor which cos(a-{-S)=0 and cos0=A.

(1) Dividing both members of(1) by cos (a+ 0)0, we obtain tan (a+13) X Xcos 3-sins=A tan (a+ 13). Expressing tan (a+ 0) from the latter relation we arrive at the required equality.

Since relation (4) is fulfilled by the hypothesis ofthe problem, we conclude that(3) holds true which implies the validity of (2).

Therefore, from the conditions of the problem it follows that tan fi+tan y--tantan a=-I-tan 0 tan V-tan (0+V1= whence we find a=kn-f3-V, i.e. a+(i+V=kn. Second solutionIn Problem 544 we obtained a formula for the cosine of a sum of three angles. We can analogously derive the formula sin (ce+p+V)= cos a cos (3 cos V (tan a+tan P+tan V-tan a tan 0 tan V) assuming that cos a cos 0 cos y0.From this formula we find that under the conditions of the problem we have sin (a }fiV)=0,i.e.a+(irt V=kn. 548.

We have cos x cos (2x-a)= 2 [cos (3x-a)+cos(x-a)] and cos (x- a) cos 2x= 2 [cos (3x-a)+ Cos (x+a)], and therefore equation (1) turns into k [cos (x-a)-cos (x+a)] --cos (x-a)-cos (3x-a), that is k sin x sin a = sin (2x-a) sin x.

The given equation only makes sense for xkn.For these values of x it can be rewritten in the form cos3 x+ cos2 x- sin3 x-- sin 2 x. Transferring all terms to the left-hand side of the equation and factoring it we get (cos x- sin x) (s'n2 x+ cos2 x+ sin x cos x -)- sin x +cos x) =0.

But the expression in the brackets on the left-hand side isequal to sin x, and the one on the right-hand side is equal to cos x.Therefore, we arriveat the equation 2 sin x (cos 2x-cos2x) = -2 sin3 x= 0, whence x=kn. 340 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 578.

For the values of x satisfying this condition we have 3 sin x cos 2x = sin 3x. Transforming the last equation we obtain sin x (3-4 sine x-3 cos 2x) =0 and thus arrive at the equation 2 sin3 x=0, which is equivalent to the equation sin x=0.

If y=1,i.e.sinxcosx=l, then sin2x=2 which is impossible, andif y=-1, then sin2x=-2 which is also impossible. Thus, equation (2) has no roots. Consequently, the roots oftheoriginal equation coincide with the roots of equation(1),i.e. x= 4 -}-31n. 581. The right-hand sideofthe equation is not determined forx=kn and x= 2 -I-m3r,because for x=2131 the function cot 7 isnot defined, for x = = (21+ 1) n the function tan 2 is not defined and for x= 2 +m31 the denomi- nator of the right member vanishes.

Putting cos 2x=y, after some simple transformations we obtain the following biquadratic equation with respect to y: 24y4-IOy2-1=0. This equation has only two real roots: y1,2 = f 22 whence x= 8 (2k+1) where k=0, ±1, ±2, .... Hence, cos 2x = f 22 594. Using the identity obtainedin Problem 261 we rewrite the original equation in the form (sin x+ sin 2x) (sin 2x+sin 3x) (sin x+sin 3x)=0.

But if inequality (2) is not satisfied, the required solution does not exist. We see that the. problem is reduced to solving inequality (2). Getting rid of the denominator, we readily find 4-2 J12. 601. From the given system we immediately obtain x+y=kn,x-y=ln. It follows that k+lk-1X= 2 it,y = 2 A. By the condition of the problem, we have 0'k+12 and 0k-I2. These inequalities are satisfied by the following five pairs of values of k and 1: (1) k=0,1=0;(2) k= 1,1 =0; (3) k= 1,1=-I;(4) k = 1,1= 1; (5) k = 2,1=0.

Relations 1° and the second equation I x 1+I y I = 1ofthe system are only compatible if k=0; indeed, from 1° we derive the inequality Ixl+Iyl>2Ikln, which can hold, under the conditionI x I+l y I =1, only if k=0.

Comparing (1) and (2) we find sin22x=1,sin2x=+1, x= 4 (2n-}-1)(n=Qt ±1, ±2, ...). Multiplying the equations of the given system, we receive sin (y-3x) cos (y-3x)=4 sing x toss x, i.e. sin 2 (y-3x)= sin3 2x.

(3) Since cos 4 (m+n) and sin 4 (m+n) cannot vanish simultaneously, the above 71 system is equivalent to the equation sin- 4 (m-n)=0. Consequently, m-n=4k(k=0, ±1, ±2, ...). (4) Thus, the pairs of values of x and y expressed by formulas x=(2n-I-l),y= 4 (2n+1)+ 4 (2m+1) are solutions of the system if and only if the integers n and m are connected by relations (4). Hence, x= 4 (2n+1), Y=' (3(2n+l)+2(n+4k)+l]=n[2(n+k)+11. But here n+k is an arbitrary integer. Denoting it by p we finally write x= 4 (2n+1),y=n(2p+1)(n, p=0, ±1, ±2, ...). 618.

(1) tan x tan y=c. 362 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS Let us derive the conditions onthe numbers a, b and c which gu4rantee the existence of at least one solution of system (1). The given system has been replaced by system (1) which is not equivalent to it, and therefore we have to show thatboth systems are solvable when a, b and c satisfy the same condi- tions. Iffor some a, b and c the given system has a solution, then, obviously, for the same a, b and c, system (1) is also solvable. The converse is also true: if for some a, b and c system(1) has a solution, then for the same values of a, b and c the given system is also solvable. Indeed,letx1, yl be a solution of system (1); then there are four possible cases, namely: (1) sinx1-1-sin y1=2a,cosx1+cos y1=2b; (2) sin xl + sin y1 = -2a,cos x1 + cos yl = 2b; (3) sin x1+sin yl = -2a,cos x1+cos yl=-2b; (4) sin x1+siny1=2a,cosx,+cos y1=-2b. If the first case takes place, then x1, y1 is the solution of the given system; in the second case the given system has, for instance, the solution -x1, -yr; in the third case it has the solution n+x1, a+yl; in the forth case the solution is n-x1, n-y1. Consequently, the given system has at least one solution if and only if system (1) has at least one solution. Now let us find out the conditions for solvability of system (1). Adding and subtracting the first and second equations of system (1), we find: cos (x-y)=2 (a2+b2)- 1, cos 2x+cos 2y+2 cos (x+ y)=4 (b2-a2) or whence cos (x-y)=2(a2+b2)-1, cos (x+y) cos (x+ y) =2 (b2-a2), cos (x-y) =2 (a2 +b5)-.-1, (a2 + b2) cos(x + y) = b2 - at. Thus, we have the system cos (x-y)=2(a2+b2)-1, (a2+b'2) cos (x + y) =b2-a2, tan x tan y=c, which is equivalent to system (1). Ifa2-f b2=0, then the second equation is satisfied for any x and y. From the first equation we get x-y=n+2kn (k=O, ±1, f2, ...), the thud equa- tion yields tan (y+n+2kn) tan y=c, or tangy=c. The last equation has a solution for any0.

Let arc tan 3 =ai, arc tan1=a2, arc tan 7as and arc tanT'=a4. Obviously, 0 < ai < 4,i = 1, 2, 3, 4. Therefore, 0 < ar+a2+a3+a4 < n. To prove the identity itis sufficient to establish that tan (ax+a2+as+a4)= 1. Since tan 4 3 (a1-}- a2) = 7, and tan (ay+a4)=11, we have tan (a,+a2+as-+-a4)=tan (ar+a2)+tan (a3+a4)-I.1-tan (al+a2) tan (a9+(N) 622. Putting arc sinx=a and arc cosx=0, we obtain itx=sin a and x=cos P=sin0). By the definition of the principal values, we have - 2 6a< 2 and 0 C V5n. The last inequality implies the inequality itnn-2<2-(3< 2. Hence, a= -S, because the angles a and 2 -(3 lie between -and 2 , and the sines of these angles are equal. Thus the formula is proved. 623. Taking advantage of the relation arc sin x+ arc cos x=(see the solu- tion of problem 622) we transform the equation to the form 12nt2-6n2t+(I-8a)a3=0, (1) where t = are sin x. For a < 32 the discriminant of this equation satisfies the inequality D=36354-48n4 (1-8a) < 0. Consequently, the roots of equation (I) are nonreal, and therefore the original equation has no solutions for a < 32 624. Put arc cosx=a and arc sin (a) If 06xc1,then 0<a< 2 and 0<P< 2 (because 0<r1-x21). Thus, we must only verify that sin a=sin t.But, by virtue of the inequality 0 <a <we have in fact sin a=+1-x2. On the other hand, for all y (l y S 1) we have sin arc sin y= y; in particu- lar, sin g=sin arc sin Y1-x2=Y1-x2. Hence, for O<xE,1, the formula arc cos x=arc sin)/-1-x2 holds true.

Hence, the greatest value of y is equal to 3-{//,and the least to 3- Vfo. 653. If n is an integer satisfying the condition of the problem, we have for all x the relation n n x. (I) In particular, putting x=0, we conclude from (1) that n must satisfy the equa- tion sin15n=0. This equation is only satisfied by the integers which are the n divisors of the number 15,i.e. n=± 1, ±3, ±5, ± 15. (2) The directsubstitution shows thatfor each of these values the function n xis periodic with period 3n. Formula (2) exhausts all the requi- red values of n. 374 PROBLEMS IN ELEMENTARY MATHEMATICS 654.

Then we have a1 cos ((xl +x) + ... +an cos (an+x) _ (a1 COS al + ... +an cos Mn) cos x- - (a, sin al + ... +an sinsin x = 0, since, by virtue of (2) and (3), the sums in the brackets are equal to zero. 655. Suppose the contrary,i.e.assume that there exists T A 0 such that for all x> 0 we have ) / , X - (1) (the condition x:_:-0 must hold because the radical JI x is imaginary for x < 0). Let us first put x=0 in formula (1); then cos jr-T =cos0=1 (2) and, consequently, VT = 2ka. (3) Now we substitute the value x=T into (1). According to (1) and (2) we obvi- ously obtain cos2T = cos yT =1, whence 2T = 21n. By the hypothesis, we have T0, and therefore, dividing (4) by (3), we get Y2 = k where I and k are integers which is impossible. 656. First solution. Let us consider the sum S=(cos x+1 sin x)+(cos 2x+i sin 2x)+... +(cos nx+1 sin nx). Applying De Moivre's formula (cosx+i Sin x)' = cos ax + I sin ax we compute S as the sum of a geometric progression. We thus obtain S- (cos x+i sin x)n+1-(cos x+i sin x) cos x+i sin x-1 The sought-for sum sin x+sin 2x+... +sin nxisequalto the imaginary part of S. Second solution.
