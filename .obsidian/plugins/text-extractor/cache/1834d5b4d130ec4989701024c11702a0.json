There are not many high-tech theorems one needs to know for the USAMO, although that of course helps. Olympiad geometry tends to involve simple concepts applied in inventive ways. As with all other areas, getting good at geometry problems requires practice. However, this is especially true for geometry, as it is a subject which most people are uncomfortable with, and a subject where intuition is very important. This is the ﬁrst of at least three geometry lectures we’ll have at TJUSAMO, so this one starts with the basics you should be familiar with – circles, triangles, similarity. Once we have the basics out of the way, though, we’ll move to deeper waters for the later lectures, where we’ll focus transformations and weird things you can do the plane. 2 Circles Circles are simple to deﬁne, but in many ways are the essence of Euclidean geometry. In two dimensions, a circle is the set of points equidistant from the center of the circle. An open disk is the interior of the circle; a closed disk is the union of the circle and its interior. 2.1 Power of a Point The power of a point is a positive real number that reﬂects the relative distance of a given point from a given circle. The exact deﬁnition is that the power h = s 2 − r2, where s is the distance from the point P to the center of circle and r is the radius. Alternatively, given a circle ω and a point P , draw a line through P intersecting ω at A and B. Then the power of a point theorem states that the product P A · P B depends only on P and ω, not on the line. To prove this, draw another line through P meeting ω at C and D as below, and look for similar triangles. A B C D P 3 Triangles Three non-collinear points determine a triangle, a circle, and a plane. There is a speciﬁc set of terms associated with triangles that you need to be familiar with. Hopefully you’ve seen all of the following words before, but they’re easy to confuse sometimes so we’ve included a refresher. 1 • Cevian - any line segment in a triangle with one endpoint on a vertex of the triangle and the other endpoint on the opposite side. • Median - a line segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposing side. • Centroid - the intersection point of the three medians. Denoted by G. • Incenter - the center of the circle inscribed within a triangle, also the point of intersection of the three angle bisectors. • Circumcenter - the center of the circle circumscribed about the triangle, also the point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. Denoted by O. • Orthocenter - the point at which the three altitudes intersect. Denoted by H. • Excenter - the center of a circle escribed about a triangle (tangent to one side and the extensions of the two other sides). • Euler Line - the line connecting the circumcenter O, centroid G, and orthocenter H. 4 Similar Triangles △ABC and △DEF are called similar iﬀ they have proportional sides and equal angles. These two conditions, however, are equivalent. The basic idea is this: when you see parallel lines, look for similar triangles and use them to prove things about ratios. Then, use those ratios to ﬁnd more similar triangles. 5 Cyclic Quadrilaterals A polygon is cyclic if and only if there is a circle which passes each of its vertices. A set of points is called concyclic if the points are vertices of a cyclic polygon. Cyclic quadrilaterals pop up all the time in Olympiad geometry problems, and they become much easier to solve once cyclic quadrilaterals can be recognized immediately. Take note of the following statements in particular: Cyclic criteria. If ABCD is a convex quadrilateral, then the following are equivalent: • ABCD is cyclic. • ∠ABC + ∠CDA = π. • ∠ACB = ∠ADB. • The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC, CD are concurrent. • If AC intersects BD at E, then AE · CE = BE · DE. (This is one of the many special cases of the Power of a Point theorem.) 6 Geometry Problem Solving Tips 1. Draw a diagram. I repeat: draw a BIG, clean, somewhat-to-scale diagram. Use a full clean sheet of paper for a diagram (or more!). If there are multiple cases, draw multiple diagrams. More paper used is better than more clutter. If your diagram gets messy, draw a new one. Try to keep the mess down by using a compass/ruler (note: “ruler,” not “straightedge”) and avoiding needless constructions. 2 2. If problems contain generic triangles, try to make them as scalene as possible. Haitao recom- mends a 45◦ − 60◦ − 75◦ triangle. 3. Don’t just stare at the page. It’s diﬃcult to solve problems without writing things down. Write down all the givens in the problem in the simplest form you can ﬁnd. You will almost always need every single given in the problem, so be aware of ones you haven’t used yet. 4. Prove the converse of what you are trying to prove: take the result you want to prove and try to work back to your givens. Many times, you will ﬁnd that all your steps are directly reversible, or they can be reversed by an application of “phantom points.” 5. If a problem asks about a point satisfying a certain condition, ﬁnd a way to construct it. 6. If a problem asks about a line, it is often helpful to think of that line as a locus. 7. If two lines “look parallel” in your diagram, draw more diagrams to conﬁrm that these lines might always be parallel, and then try to prove it. (This technique is not limited to parallel lines: you might apply it to segments or angles which “look equal.”) 8. Don’t forget about trig, complex numbers, and coordinates. That said, try to avoid them unless absolutely necessary. 9. Try multiple ideas; don’t just get stuck with one idea for too long. If it’s clear you aren’t making progress with a construction, try something else. 7 Problems 1. Let △ABC be a triangle with orthocenter H and circumcenter O. Prove that ∠HAO = |∠B − ∠C|. 2. Let a, b, c, d satisfy the property that 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d are all less than a + b + c + d. Prove that there is a unique (up to congruence) cyclic quadrilateral ABCD with AB = a, BC = b, CD = c, DA = d. 3. Let ABC be a triangle, and let D be on BC such that AD bisects ∠BAC. Prove that AB BD = AC CD . 4. Let ABCD be a quadrilateral with an inscribed circle. Prove that AB + CD = AD + BC. Is the converse true? 5. Triangle ABC has orthocenter H and altitudes AD, BE, CF . Prove that HE·AC+HF ·AB = AH · BC. 8 More Problems 6. Let ABCD be a quadrilateral and let O be a point in the plane of the quadrilateral. HAB, HBC, HCD, HDA are the projections of O onto lines AB, BC, CD, DA respectively. HA, HB, HC, HD are the projections of O onto HDAHAB, HABHBC, HBCHCD, HCDHDA re- spectively. Suppose that HA, HB, HC, HD are concyclic. Prove that ABCD is cyclic. 3 7. Let AXY ZB be a convex pentagon inscribed in a semicircle of diameter AB. Denote by P , Q, R, S the feet of the perpendiculars from Y onto lines AX, BX, AZ, BZ, respectively. Prove that the acute angle formed by lines P Q and RS is half the size of ∠XOZ, where O is the midpoint of segment AB. 8. Let A, B, C, D be points occurring in that order on circle ω and let P be the point of in- tersection of AC and BD. Let EF be a chord of ω passing through P , Q be the point of intersection of BC and EF , and R be the point of intersection of DA and EF . Prove that P Q = P R. This is known as the Butterﬂy Theorem. 9. Let the incenter of triangle △ABC touch side BC at D, and let DT be a diameter of the circle. If line AT meets BC at X, prove that BD = CX. 10. Let ABCD be a cyclic quadrilateral. Let P , Q, R be the feet of the perpendiculars from D to the lines BC, CA, AB, respectively. Show that P Q = QR if and only if the bisectors of ∠ABC and ∠ADC are concurrent with AC. 11. Let P be a point interior to triangle ABC (with CA ̸= CB). The lines AP , BP and CP meet again its circumcircle Γ at K, L, respectively M . The tangent line at C to Γ meets the line AB at S.
