You can use often use invariants to simplify diﬃcult problems. Some examples of invariants are parity, divisibility, and symmetry. Example 1.1 Two diametrically opposite corners of a chess board are deleted. Is it possible to tile the remaining 62 squares with 31 dominos? Solution: No. Each domino covers one red square and one black square. But diametrically opposite corners are of the same color, so such a tiling is impossible. Example 1.2 The numbers 1, 2, . . . , 10 are written in a row. Show that no matter what choice of sign ± is put in between them, the sum will never be 0. Solution: The sum 1 + 2 + · · · + 10 = 55, an odd integer. Since parity is not aﬀected by the choice of sign, for any choice of sign ±1 ± 2 ± · · · ± 10 will never be even, so in particular it will never be 0. Example 1.3 All the dominos in a set are laid out in a chain according to the rules of the game. If one end of the chain is a 6, what is at the other end? Solution: At the other end there must also be a 6. Each number of spots must occur in a pair, so that we may put them end to end. Since there are eight 6’s, this last 6 pairs oﬀ with the one at the beginning of the chain. Example 1.4 Let a1, a2, . . . , an represent an arbitrary arrangement of the numbers 1, 2, 3, . . . , n. Prove that, if n is odd, then the product (a1 − 1)(a2 − 2)(a3 − 3) · · · (an − n) is even. Solution: Consider the sum of the terms: (a1 − 1) + (a2 − 2) + · · · (an − n) = (a1 + a2 + · · · an) − (1 + 2 + · · · + n) = (1 + 2 + · · · + n) − (1 + 2 + · · · + n) = 0. Thus, the sum of the terms is zero no matter what the arrangement. A sum of an odd number of integers which equals zero (an even number) must contain one even number, and any product that contains one even number is even. Summer 2008 3 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 1.5 (Gaussian Pairing) Find the sum of the ﬁrst 100 positive integers. Solution: S = 1 + 2 + 3 + · · · + 98 + 99 + 100 S = 100 + 99 + 98 + · · · + 3 + 2 + 1 2S = 100 · 101 Thus, S = 50 · 101 = 5050. Example 1.6 Let d(n) denote the number of divisors of a positive integer n. Show that d(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square. Solution: The symmetry here is that we can always pair a divisor d of n with n/d. For example, if n = 28, it is natural to pair the divisor 2 with the divisor 14. Thus, as we go through the list of divisors of n, each divisor will have a unique partner, unless n is a perfect square, in which case √n is paired with itself. For example, the divisors of 28 are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, 28, which can be arranged in the pairs (1, 28), (2, 14), (4, 7), so clearly d(28) is even. On the other hand, the divisors of the perfect square 36 are (1, 36), (2, 18), (3, 12), (4, 9), 6. Notice that 6 has no partner, so d(6) is odd. We conclude that d(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square. Example 1.7 Solve x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1 = 0. Solution: We can use the symmetry of the coeﬃcients to approach this problem. First, we divide by x2 to obtain: x2 + x + 1 + 1 x + 1 x2 = 0. Note that this produces additional symmetry, as we can collect “like” terms as fol- lows: x2 + 1 x2 + x + 1 x + 1 = 0. Next, we make the substitution u = x + 1 x . Then u2 = x2 + 2 + 1 x2 , so the equation becomes u2 − 2 + u + 1 = 0, or u2 + u − 1 = 0. Summer 2008 4 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Then u = −1 ± √5 2 , and x = u ± √u2 − 4 2 = −1 ± √5 ± i√2 √5 ± 10 4 . Example 1.8 At ﬁrst, a room is empty. Each minute, either one person enters or two people leave. After exactly 3 1999 minutes, could the room contain 3 1000 + 2 people? Solution: If there are n people in the room, after one minute, there will be either n + 1 or n − 2 people. The diﬀerence between these two possible outcomes is 3. After two minutes, there will be either n − 1, n + 2, or n − 4 people. These possible values diﬀer from one another by multiples of 3. Continuing for longer times, we see that at any ﬁxed time t, the possible values for the population of the room diﬀer from one another by multiples of 3. After 3 1999 minutes, one possible population is 3 1999 (this population occurs if one person entered each minute). This is a multiple of 3, so all the possible populations of the room at this time must also be a multiple of 3. Thus, 3 1000 + 2 is not a possible population after 3 1999 minutes. Example 1.9 A rectangle is tiled with smaller rectangles, each of which has at least one side of integral length. Prove that the tiled rectangle must also have at least one side of integral length. Solution: Note: there are at least fourteen diﬀerent solutions of this problem, several of which use invariants in diﬀerent ways. See Stan Wagon, Fourteen proofs of a result about tiling a rectangle, American Mathematical Monthly, 94:601–617, 1987 for an account of these solutions. For ease of discussion and notation, let’s call the property of having at least one integral side “good.” We must show that the large rectangle is “good.” Start by orienting the large rectangle so that the lower-left corner is a lattice point. A lattice point (m, n) on the plane is one having integer coordinates. Next, we make the following key observation: If the rectangle weren’t good, then it would have only one lattice point corner. But if the rectangle is good, then it will have either two lattice point corners (if one dimension is an integer), or four lattice point corners (if both length and width are integers). Thus, the rectangle is good if and only if the number of corner lattice points is even. We’ll count lattice point corners, and try to show that the number of lattice point corners of the big rectangle must be even. Consider the corners of a small rectangle. It may have zero lattice point corners, or two lattice point corners, or four lattice point corners, but it can not have just one Summer 2008 5 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. or three, because each small rectangle is good (i.e. has at least one integer-length side). Thus, if we count the number of corner lattice points on each small rectangle and add them up, the sum, which we call S, must be even. Note, however, that we have overcounted some of the lattice points–in particular, we have overcounted any lattice points that occur as the corner of more than one rectangle. We make the following observations: • We will only count a corner lattice point once, twice, or four times–never three times. • The only corner lattice points that are counted exactly once are the corners of the large rectangle. Let a denote the number of corner lattice points that we count exactly once (i.e. the corner lattice points of the large rectangle), let b denote the number of corner lattice points that we count exactly twice, and let c denote the number of corner lattice points that we count exactly four times. Then we have: S = a + 2b + 4c, so a = S − 2b − 4c. Since S, 2b, and 4c are all even, a is even as well. Thus, the large rectangle has an even number of corner lattice points, so it must have two or four corner lattice points. Thus, the large rectangle has at least one side of integral length.

The number of freshmen and sophomore contestants was the same. Which of the following must be true? (A) There are ﬁve times as many sophomores as freshmen. (B) There are twice as many sophomores as freshmen. (C) There are as many sophomores as freshmen. (D) There are twice as many freshmen as sophomores. (E) There are ﬁve times as many freshmen as sophomores. Solution: Let’s arbitrarily assume that there are 100 freshmen in the school. Then 40 freshmen and 40 sophomores took the exam. Thus, there are 50 sophomores in the school, so the answer is (D). Note: it was convenient to assign a speciﬁc value for the number of freshmen, but it is not necessary. We could let F denote the number of freshmen and conclude, using the same technique as above, that there are F/2 sophomores. We chose to use 100 for the number of freshmen because it simpliﬁes the situation. Example 2.2 (2004 AMC 10A #17 and 2004 AMC 12A #15) Brenda and Sally run in opposite directions on a circular track, starting at diametrically opposite points. Each girl runs at a constant speed. They ﬁrst meet after Brenda has run 100 meters. They next meet after Sally has run 150 meters past their ﬁrst meeting point. What is the length of the track in meters? (A) 250 (B) 300 (C) 350 (D) 400 (E) 500 Solution: The fundamental relationship involved in this problem is rate = distance time . First we must deﬁne some notation. Let • L be the length of the track. • RS be the rate at which Sally runs. • RB be the rate at which Brenda runs. • T1 be the time it takes them to ﬁrst meet. • T2 be the time after they ﬁrst meet until they meet again. Summer 2008 7 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution. They start at opposite sides of the track and run in opposite directions, so they ﬁrst meet when their combined distance run is L/2. We are told that Brenda has run 100 meters during this time T1, so 100 = T1 · RB. When they meet again they have together run the full length, L, of the track since their ﬁrst meeting. Since their speeds are constant and they ran together L/2 in time T1, we have T2 = 2T1. Sally has run 150 meters during the time T2, so L = T2 · RS + T2 · RB = 150 + 2T1 · RB = 150 + 2 · 100 = 350 meters. Example 2.3 (2002 AMC 10B #21 and 2002 AMC 12B #17) Andy’s lawn has twice as much area as Beth’s lawn and three times as much area as Carlos’ lawn. Carlos’ lawn mower cuts half as fast as Beth’s mower and one third as fast as Andy’s mower. They all start to mow their lawns at the same time. Who will ﬁnish ﬁrst? (A) Andy (B) Beth (C) Carlos (D) Andy and Carlos tie for ﬁrst. (E) They all tie. Solution. This is also a rate problem, so we begin with some notation. Let • Aa, Ra, Ta be the area, rate, and time for Andy. • Ab, Rb, Tb be the area, rate, and time for Beth. • Ac, Rc, Tc be the area, rate, and time for Carlos. Then Ab = Aa/2, Ac = Aa/3, Rb = 2Rc, and Ra = 3Rc. To solve the problem, we must express the times for each worker using a common base. Here, we will use the fraction Aa/Rc, but any combination of A/R is possible. We obtain: • Ta = 1 3 Aa Rc • Tb = 1 4 Aa Rc • Tc = 1 3 Aa Rc Thus, Beth ﬁnishes ﬁrst. Example 2.4 (1988 AHSME #8) If b a = 2 and c b = 3, what is the ratio of a + b to b + c? Summer 2008 8 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (A) 1 3 (B) 3 8 (C) 3 5 (D) 2 3 (E) 3 4 Solution. Assume that a = 3 and b = 6. Then c = 18, so a + b b + c = 9 24 = 3 8. Example 2.5 (1983 AHSME #7) Alice sells an item at $10 less than the list price and receives 10% of her selling price as her commission. Bob sells the same item at $20 less than the list price and receives 20% of his selling price as his commission. If they both get the same commission, then the list price is (A) $20 (B) $30 (C) $50 (D) $70 (E) $100 Solution. Let p denote the list price of the item (in dollars). Alice’s commission is 0.10 · (p − 10), and Bob’s commission is 0.20 · (p − 20). Thus, 0.10 · (p − 10) = 0.20 · (p − 20), so p = 30. Summer 2008 9 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 3 Algebraic Manipulation Example 3.1 If x + y = xy = 3, ﬁnd x3 + y3. Solution: One way to solve this problem would be to solve the system x + y = xy = 3 for x and y, and then substitute the resulting values into the expression x3 + y3. This technique would certainly work, but would be time-consuming, messy, and probably error-prone. Instead, we’ll use algebra to construct a more elegant solution. Since our goal is to ﬁnd x3 + y3, we’ll start by trying to ﬁnd x2 + y2. We have: 3 2 = (x + y) 2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 = x2 + y2 + 2 · 3 = x2 + y2 + 6. Thus, x2 + y2 = 3 2 − 6 = 3. Next, we obtain: 3 · 3 = (x + y)(x2 + y2) = x3 + y3 + x2y + xy2 + y3 = x3 + y3 + xy(x + y) = x3 + y3 + 3 · 3. Finally, we conclude that x3 + y3 = 3 · 3 − 3 · 3 = 0. Example 3.2 Find positive integers a and b with √5 + √24 = √a + √b. Solution: Observe that 5 + √24 = 3 + 2 √2 · 3 + 2 = (√2 + √3) 2. Thus, √5 + 2 √6 = √2 + √3. You should know (and actively use) the following factorization formulas: Summer 2008 10 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. • (x + y) 2 = x2 + 2xy + y2 • (x − y) 2 = x2 − 2xy + y2 • (x + y) 3 = x3 + 3x2y + 3xy2 + y3 = x3 + y3 + 3xy(x + y) • (x − y) 3 = x3 − 3x2y + 3xy2 − y3 = x3 − y3 − 3xy(x − y) • x2 − y2 = (x + y)(x − y) • xn − yn = (x − y)(xn−1 + xn−2y + xn−3y2 + · · · + xyn−2 + yn−1) for all positive integers n • xn + yn = (x + y)(xn−1 − xn−2y + xn−3y2 − · · · − xyn−2 + yn−1) for all positive odd integers n (the terms of the second factor alternate in sign) • (x + y + z) 2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2yz • (x + y + z + w) 2 = x2 + y2 + z2 + w2 + 2xy + 2xz + 2xw + 2yz + 2yw + 2zw • (x − y) 2 + 4xy = (x + y) 2 3.1 Single-variable Equations Example 3.3 Solve the equation |x − 3| (x2−8x+15)/(x−2) = 1. Solution: If ab = 1, the either a = 1 or b = 0. Note that 0 0 is undeﬁned, so we cannot have a = b = 0. Thus, we start by setting |x − 3| = 1. This implies x = 4 or x = 2. We discard x = 2 as the exponent is undeﬁned at x = 2. Next, we set x2−8x+15 = 0, which implies x = 5 or x = 3. We discard x = 3 since this would give 0 0. Thus, the only solutions are x = 4 and x = 5. Example 3.4 Solve 9 + x−4 = 10x−2. Solution: First, we rewrite the equation as x−4 − 10x−2 + 9 = 0. Observe that x−4 − 10x−2 + 9 = (x−2 − 9)(x−2 − 1). Thus the solutions are x = ±1 3, ± 1. Summer 2008 11 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 3.5 Solve (x − 5)(x − 7)(x + 6)(x + 4) = 504. Solution: Reorder the factors and multiply to obtain (x − 5)(x − 7)(x + 6)(x + 4) = (x − 5)(x + 4)(x − 7)(x + 6) = (x2 − x − 20)(x2 − x − 42). Set y = x2 − x. Then: (y − 20)(y − 42) = 504 y2 − 62y + 336 = (y − 6)(y − 56) = 0. Thus we obtain y = 6, 56, so x2 − x = 6 and x2 − x = 56. Solving both quadratics, we obtain x = −2, 4, −7, 8. Example 3.6 Solve 12x4 − 56x3 + 89x2 − 56x + 12 = 0. Solution: Reordering, we obtain: 12x4 + 12 − 56(x3 + x) + 89x2 = 0 x2 [ 12(x2 + 1 x2 ) − 56(x + 1 x ) + 89 ] = 0 12(x2 + 1 x2 ) − 56(x + 1 x ) + 89 = 0. Next, we set u = x + 1/x. Then u2 − 2 = x2 + 1/x 2, Using this, we obtain 12(u2 − 2) − 56u + 89 = 0, so u = 5/2, 13/6. Thus, x + 1 x = 5 2 and x + 1 x = 13 6 . Finally, solving both equations above, we conclude that x = 1/2, 2, 2/3, 3/2. Summer 2008 12 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 3.7 Find the real solutions to x2 − 5x + 2 √x2 − 5x + 3 = 12. Solution: Observe that we can rewrite the given equation as x2 − 5x + 3 + 2 √x2 − 5x + 3 − 15 = 0. Next, set u = x2 − 5x + 3. Then: u + 2u1/2 − 15 = 0 (u1/2 + 5)(u1/2 − 3) = 0. Thus u = 9, and x2 − 5x + 3 = 9. Finally, we conclude that x = −1, 6. Example 3.8 Solve 3√14 + x + 3√14 − x = 4. Solution: Let u = 3√14 + x and v = 3√14 − x. Then 64 = (u + v) 3 = u3 + v3 + 3uv(u + v) = 14 + x + 14 − x + 12(196 − x2) 1/3. Thus, 3 = (196 − x2) 1/3, which we solve to obtain x = ±13. Example 3.9 Solve 9 x − 3 x+1 − 4 = 0. Solution: Observe that 9 x − 3 x+1 − 4 = (3 x − 4)(3 x + 1). Since no real number x satisﬁes 3 x +1 = 0, we discard this factor. Thus, 3 x −4 = 0, and we obtain x = log3 4. Example 3.10 Find the exact value of cos 2π/5. Solution: Using the identity cos(u ± v) = cos u cos v ∓ sin u sin v twice, we obtain cos 2θ = 2 cos2 θ − 1 Summer 2008 13 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. and cos 3θ = 4 cos3 θ − 3 cos θ. Let x = cos 2π/5. Since cos 6π/5 = cos 4π/5, we see that x satisﬁes the equation 4x3 − 2x2 − 3x + 1 = 0, which we can rewrite as (x − 1)(4x2 + 2x − 1) = 0. Since x = cos 2π/5 ̸= 1, and cos 2π/5 > 0, x is the positive root of the quadratic equation 4x2 + 2x − 1 = 0. We conclude that x = cos 2π 5 = √5 − 1 4 . Example 3.11 Solve the equation 2 |x| = sin x2. Solution: Clearly x = 0 is not a solution. Since 2 y > 1 for y > 0, and 1 ≤ sin y ≤ 1 for all y, the equation does not have a solution. Example 3.12 How many real numbers x satisfy sin x = x 100? Solution: Clearly, x = 0 is a solution. Also, if x > 0 is a solution, so is −x < 0. So, we can restrict ourselves to positive solutions. If x is a solution then |x| = 100| sin x| ≤ 100. So we can further restrict x to the interval (0, 100]. Decompose (0, 100] into 2π-long intervals (the last interval is shorter): (0, 100] = (0, 2π] ∪ (2π, 4π] ∪ (4π, 6π] ∪ · · · ∪ (28π, 30π] ∪ (30π, 100]. From the graphs of y = sin x and y = x/100 we that the interval (0, 2π] contains only one solution. Each interval of the form (2πk, 2(k +1)π], k = 1, 2, . . . , 14 contains two solutions. Since 31π < 100, the interval ]30π; 100] contains a full wave, so it contains two solutions. Thus, there are 1 + 2 · 14 + 2 = 31 positive solutions, and hence, 31 negative solutions. Therefore, there is a total of 31 + 31 + 1 = 63 solutions. 3.2 Systems of Equations Example 3.13 Solve the system of equations x + y + u = 4, y + u + v = −5, u + v + x = 0, v + x + y = −8. Summer 2008 14 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Adding all the equations and dividing by 3, we obtain x + y + u + v = −3. This implies that 4 + v = −3, −5 + x = −3, 0 + y = −3, −8 + u = −3. Thus x = 2, y = −3, u = 5, v = −7. Example 3.14 Solve the system (x + y)(x + z) = 30, (y + z)(y + x) = 15, (z + x)(z + y) = 18. Solution: Set u = y + z, v = z + x, w = x + y. Then the system becomes vw = 30 wu = 15 uv = 18. Multiplying these equations we obtain u2v2w2 = 8100, which we solve to obtain uvw = ±90. Next, we solve for u, v, and w to obtain u = 3, v = 6, w = 5, or u = −3, v = −6, w = −5. Then we have: y + z = ±3 z + x = ±6 x + y = ±5. Thus we conclude that x = 4, y = 1, z = 2 or x = −4, y = −1, z = −2.

If the polynomial p(x) is divided by d(x) then there exist polynomials q(x), r(x) such that p(x) = d(x)q(x) + r(x) and 0 ≤ degree(r(x)) < degree(d(x)). We can ﬁnd the quotient q(x) and the remainder r(x) by performing ordinary long division with polynomials. For example, if x5 + x4 + 1 is divided by x2 + 1 we obtain x5 + x4 + 1 = (x3 + x2 − x − 1)(x2 + 1) + x + 2, so the quotient is q(x) = x3 + x2 − x − 1 and the remainder is r(x) = x + 2. Theorem 4.2 The Remainder Theorem for polynomials. If the polynomial p(x) is divided by x − a, then the remainder will be p(a). Proof. By the Division Algorithm for polynomials, we know that p(x) = (x − a)q(x) + r. Note that the remainder r(x) = r is a constant (degree 0) since the degree of x − a is equal to 1. Substituting x = a, we obtain p(a) = (a − a)q(a) + r = 0 + r = r. Theorem 4.3 The Factor Theorem for polynomials. The polynomial p(x) is di- visible by x − a if and only if p(a) = 0. Proof. The remainder r is equal to p(a), so p(x) is divisible by x − a if and only if p(a) = 0. Example 4.1 Find the remainder when (x + 3) 5 + (x + 2) 8 + (5x + 9) 1997 is divided by x + 2. Solution: Let p(x) be the polynomial (x+3) 5 +(x+2) 8 +(5x+9) 1997. The remainder upon dividing P (x) by x + 2 = x − (−2) is p(−2) = 0. Example 4.2 A polynomial p(x) leaves remainder −2 upon division by x − 1 and remainder −4 upon division by x + 2. Find the remainder when this polynomial is divided by x2 + x − 2. Solution: There exist polynomials q1(x) and q2(x) such that p(x) = q1(x)(x − 1) − 2 and p(x) = q2(x)(x + 2) − 4. Thus p(1) = −2 and p(−2) = −4.

Since x2 + x − 2 = (x − 1)(x + 2) is a polynomial of degree 2, the remainder r(x) upon dividing p(x) by x2 + x − 1 is of degree 1 or less, so r(x) = ax + b for some constants a and b which we must determine. By the Division Algorithm for polynomials, p(x) = q(x)(x2 + x − 1) + ax + b. Thus, we have −2 = p(1) = a + b and −4 = p(−2) = −2a + b. We solve this system to obtain a = 2/3 and b = −8/3. The desired remainder is thus r(x) = 2 3x − 8 3. Example 4.3 Let f (x) = x4 + x3 + x2 + x + 1. Find the remainder when f (x5) is divided by f (x). Solution: Observe that f (x)(x − 1) = x5 − 1 and f (x5) = x20 + x15 + x10 + x5 + 1 = (x20 − 1) + (x15 − 1) + (x10 − 1) + (x5 − 1) + 5. Each of the summands in parentheses is divisible by x5−1 and by f (x). The remainder is thus 5. Example 4.4 If p(x) is a cubic polynomial with p(1) = 1, p(2) = 2, p(3) = 3, p(4) = 5, ﬁnd p(6). Solution: Let g(x) = p(x) − x. Observe that g(x) is a polynomial of degree 3 and that g(1) = g(2) = g(3) = 0. Thus g(x) = c(x − 1)(x − 2)(x − 3) for some constant c that we must determine. Now, g(4) = c(4 − 1)(4 − 2)(4 − 3) = 6c and g(4) = p(4) − 4 = 1, Summer 2008 17 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. so c = 1/6. Finally, p(6) = g(6) + 6 = (6 − 1)(6 − 2)(6 − 3) 6 + 6 = 16. Theorem 4.4 The Rational Roots (Zeros) Test: Suppose that a0, a1, . . . , an are integers with an ̸= 0. If p/q is a rational root (zero) of p(x) = anxn + an−1xn−1 + · · · + a1x + a0, then p divides a0 and q divides a1. Next, we will consider the relationship between the zeros of a polynomial and the coeﬃcients of the polynomial. Quadratic polynomials. We’ll begin with the case of a quadratic (monic) polyno- mial. Suppose that the zeros of the quadratic polynomial x2 + a1x + a0 are r and s. Then we can write the polynomial as x2 + a1x + a0 = (x − r)(x − s) = x2 − (r + s)x + rs. Equating terms, we obtain a1 = −(r + s) and a0 = rs. Thus, we conclude the following: • a1 = −(sum of the zeros) • a0 = +(product of the zeros) Cubic Polynomials. Suppose that the zeros of the cubic polynomial x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 are q, r, s. Then we can factor the cubic polynomial as x3 + a2x2 + a1x + a0 = (x − q)(x − r)(x − s) = x3 − (q + r + s)x2 + (qr + qs + rs)x − qrs. Equating terms, we obtain a2 = −(q + r + s), a1 = qr + qs + rs, a0 = −qrs. Thus, we conclude the following: Summer 2008 18 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. • a2 = −(sum of the zeros) • a1 = +(sum of all products of two diﬀerent zeros) • a0 = −(product of the zeros) In general, we have the following. Suppose that r1, r2, . . . , rn are the roots of the monic degree-n polynomial xn + an−1xn−1 + an−2xn−2 + · · · + a1x + a0 = 0. Then, for k = 1, 2, . . . n, ak = (−1) n−k(sum of all products of n − k diﬀerent zeros). Example 4.5 (1983 AIME) What is the product of the real roots of the equation x2 + 18x + 30 = 2 √x2 + 18x + 45? Solution: The only obstacle to an immediate solution of this problem is the presence of the square root. Thus, a natural technique is to substitute y = √x2 + 18x + 45. Note that if x is real, then y must be non-negative (i.e. y ≥ 0). Then the equation becomes: y2 − 15 = 2y (y − 5)(y + 3) = 0. Thus, y = 5 or y = −3. We reject y = −3 since y ≥ 0. Substituting y = 5, we obtain x2 + 18x + 20 = 0. The product of the roots of this quadratic polynomial is 20. Example 4.6 (1984 USAMO) The product of two of the four zeros of the quartic equation x4 − 18x3 + kx2 + 200x − 1984 = 0 is −32. Find k. Summer 2008 19 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Let the zeros of the quartic be a, b, c, d. Then we have: a + b + c + d = 18 ab + ac + ad + bc + bd + cd = k abc + abd + acd + bcd = −200 abcd = −1994. Without loss of generality, let ab = −32. Substituting this into abcd = −1984, we obtain cd = 62. Then the equations become: a + b + c + d = 18 30 + ac + ad + bc + bd = k −32c − 32d + 62a + 62b = −200 Recall that we need to compute k, not the values a, b, c, d. Note that if we could compute ac + ad + bc + bd, then we could compute k. We see that ac + ad + bc + bd factors as ac + ad + bc + bd = a(c + d) + b(c + d) = (a + b)(c + d). Further, −32c − 32d + 62a + 62b = −32(c + d) + 62(a + b). Next, let u = a + b and v = c + d. Then we have: u + v = 18 62u − 32v = −200. Solving, we obtain u = 4 and v = 18, so k = 30 + 4 · 14 = 86.

Often, a binary operation in a mathematics competition problem will be expressed using some unusual symbol, such as ♥ or §. The result of the operation after it is applied to the numbers a and b would typically be written as ♥(a, b) or a♥b, or §(a, b) or a§b. Deﬁnition 5.2 A function f is a means of associating each element of one set, called the domain of f , with exactly one element of a second set, called the range of f . Deﬁnition 5.3 The ﬂoor function f (x) = ⌊x⌋ is deﬁned to be the greatest integer less than or equal to x. For example, ⌊3.7⌋ = 3, ⌊2⌋ = 2, ⌊−2.4⌋ = −3. Deﬁnition 5.4 The ceiling function f (x) = ⌈x⌉ is deﬁned to be the smallest integer greater than or equal to x. For example, ⌈3.1⌉ = 4, ⌈−1.2⌉ = −1. Example 5.1 (1993 AHSME #4) Deﬁne the operation ♥ by x♥y = 4x − 3y + xy for all real numbers x and y. For how many real numbers y does 12 = 3♥y? (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) more than 4 Solution: Summer 2008 21 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 12 = 3♥y = 4 · 3 − 3 · y + 3 · y = 12. Thus, the equation is true for any real number y. Example 5.2 (1996 AHSME #14) The function E(n) is deﬁned for each positive integer n to be the sum of the even digits of n. For example, E(5681) = 6 + 8 = 14. What is the value of E(1) + E(2) + · · · + E(100)? (A) 200 (B) 300 (C) 400 (D) 900 (E) 2250 Solution: Rater than determine the values of E(n) individually, observe that the numbers 00, 01, 02, . . . , 99 contain an equal number of each of the digits 0, 1, . . . , 9. There are a total of 2·100 = 200 of these digits, so there are 200/10 = 20 of each digit. Thus, E(0) + E(1) + E(2) + · · · + E(99) = 20(0 + 2 + 4 + 6 + 8) = 400. Since E(0) = 0 and E(100) = 0, the required sum is also 400. Example 5.3 (1981 AHSME #17) The function f has the property that, for all nonzero real numbers, f (x) + 2f ( 1 x ) = 3x. How many nonzero real number solutions are there to the equation f (x) = f (−x)? (A) 0 (B) 1 (C) 2 (D) All nonzero real num- bers (E) Inﬁnitely many, but not all, nonzero real numbers Solution: We need to determine some way to eliminate the term f (1/x) from the equation that describes f (x). Once we do this, we will be able to compare f (x) and f (−x). The ﬁrst technique to try is to substitute 1/x for x in the deﬁning equation for f (x). We obtain: f ( 1 x ) + 2f (x) = 3 · 1 x , Summer 2008 22 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. so f ( 1 x ) = 3 x − 2f (x). Substituting this expression for f (1/x) into the original equation produces f (x) + 2 ( 3 x − 2f (x) ) = 3x. Thus, −3f (x) + 6 x = 3x, and we conclude that f (x) = 2 − x2 x . Finally, setting f (x) = f (−x) for x ̸= 0, we obtain 2 − x2 x = 2 − (−x) 2 −x , so x = ± √2.

Suppose that an experiment E can be per- formed in k stages: E1 ﬁrst, E2 second, . . . , Ek last. Suppose moreover that Ei can be done in ni diﬀerent ways, and that the number of ways of performing Ei is not inﬂuenced by any predecessors E1, E2, . . . , Ei−1. Then E1 and E2 and . . . and Ek can occur simultaneously in n1n2 · · · nk ways. Example 6.1 In a group of 8 men and 9 women we can pick one man and one woman in 8 · 9 = 72 ways. Notice that we are choosing two persons. Example 6.2 A red die and a blue die are tossed. In how many ways can they land? Solution: If we view the outcomes as an ordered pair (r, b) then by the multiplication principle we have the 6 · 6 = 36 possible outcomes (1, 1) (1, 2) (1, 3) (1, 4) (1, 5) (1, 6) (2, 1) (2, 2) (2, 3) (2, 4) (2, 5) (2, 6) (3, 1) (3, 2) (3, 3) (3, 4) (3, 5) (3, 6) (4, 1) (4, 2) (4, 3) (4, 4) (4, 5) (4, 6) (5, 1) (5, 2) (5, 3) (5, 4) (5, 5) (5, 6) (6, 1) (6, 2) (6, 3) (6, 4) (6, 5) (6, 6) The red die can land in any of 6 ways, 6 and the blue die may land in any of 6 ways 6 6 . Example 6.3 A multiple-choice test consists of 20 questions, each one with 4 choices. There are 4 ways of answering the ﬁrst question, 4 ways of answering the second question, etc. Thus, there are 4 20 = 1099511627776 ways of answering the exam. Example 6.4 There are 9 · 10 · 10 = 900 positive 3-digit integers: 100, 101, 102, . . . , 998, 999. Since the leftmost integer cannot be 0, there are only 9 choices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for it, 9 . There are 10 choices for the second digit 9 10 , Summer 2008 24 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. and 10 choices for the last digit 9 10 10 . Example 6.5 There are 9 · 10 · 5 = 450 even positive 3-digit integers: 100, 102, 104, . . . , 996, 998. Since the leftmost integer cannot be 0, there are only 9 choices {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} for it, 9 . There are 10 choices for the second digit 9 10 . Since the integer must be even, the last digit must be one of the 5 choices {0, 2, 4, 6, 8} 9 10 5 . Deﬁnition 6.1 A palindromic integer or palindrome is a positive integer whose dec- imal expansion is symmetric and that is not divisible by 10. In other words, one reads the same integer backwards or forwards. Note: A palindrome in common parlance, is a word or phrase that reads the same backwards to forwards. The Philadelphia street name Camac is a palindrome. So are the phrases (if we ignore punctuation) (a) “A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!” (b) “Sit on a potato pan!, Otis.” (c) “Able was I ere I saw Elba.” This last one is attributed to Napoleon, though it is doubtful that he knew enough English to form it. Example 6.6 The following integers are all palindromes: 1, 8, 11, 99, 101, 131, 999, 1234321, 9987899. Example 6.7 How many palindromes are there of 5 digits? Solution: There are 9 ways of choosing the leftmost digit. 9 . Once the leftmost digit is chosen, the last digit must be identical to it, so we have 9 1 . There are 10 choices for the second digit from the left 9 10 1 . Summer 2008 25 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Once this digit is chosen, the second digit from the right must be identical to it, so we have only 1 choice for it, 9 10 1 1 . Finally, there are 10 choices for the third digit from the right, 9 10 10 1 1 , which give us 900 palindromes of 5-digits. Example 6.8 How many palindromes of 5 digits are even? Solution: A ﬁve digit even palindrome has the form ABCBA, where A belongs to {2, 4, 6, 8}, and B, C belong to {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Thus there are 4 choices for the ﬁrst digit, 10 for the second, and 10 for the third. Once these digits are chosen, the palindrome is completely determined. Therefore, there are 4 × 10 × 10 = 400 even palindromes of 5 digits. Example 6.9 How many positive divisors does 300 have? Solution: We have 300 = 3 · 2 25 2. Thus every factor of 300 is of the form 3 a2 b5 c, where 0 ≤ a ≤ 1, 0 ≤ b ≤ 2, and 0 ≤ c ≤ 2. Thus there are 2 choices for a, 3 for b and 3 for c. This gives 2 · 3 · 3 = 18 positive divisors. We now prove that if a set A has n elements, then it has 2 n subsets. To motivate the proof, consider the set {a, b, c}. To each element we attach a binary code of length 3. We write 0 if a particular element is not in the set and 1 if it is. We then have the following associations: ∅ ↔ 000, {a} ↔ 100, {b} ↔ 010, {c} ↔ 001, {a, b} ↔ 110, {a, c} ↔ 101, {b, c} ↔ 011, {a, b, c} ↔ 111. Thus there is a one-to-one correspondence between the subsets of a ﬁnite set of 3 elements and binary sequences of length 3. Theorem 6.2 Cardinality of the Power Set. Let A be a ﬁnite set with |A| card (A) = n. Then A has 2 n subsets. Proof. We attach a binary code to each element of the subset, 1 if the element is in the subset and 0 if the element is not in the subset. The total number of subsets is the total number of such binary codes, and there are 2 n in number. Summer 2008 26 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 6.2 The Sum Rule Theorem 6.3 The Sum Rule. Let E1, E2, . . . , Ek, be pairwise mutually exclusive events. If Ei can occur in ni ways, then either E1 or E2 or, . . . , or Ek can occur in n1 + n2 + · · · nk ways. Remark. Notice that the “or” here is exclusive. Example 6.10 In a group of 8 men and 9 women we can pick one man or one woman in 8 + 9 = 17 ways. Notice that we are choosing one person. Example 6.11 There are ﬁve Golden retrievers, six Irish setters, and eight Poodles at the pound. How many ways can two dogs be chosen if they are not the same kind? Solution: We choose: a Golden retriever and an Irish setter or a Golden retriever and a Poodle or an Irish setter and a Poodle. One Golden retriever and one Irish setter can be chosen in 5·6 = 30 ways; one Golden retriever and one Poodle can be chosen in 5 · 8 = 40 ways; one Irish setter and one Poodle can be chosen in 6·8 = 48 ways. By the sum rule, there are 30+40+48 = 118 combinations. Example 6.12 There were a total of 1890 digits used in writing all of the page numbers in a book. How many pages does the book have? Solution: A total of 1 · 9 + 2 · 90 = 189 digits are used to write pages 1 to 99, inclusive. We have of 1890 − 189 = 1701 digits left, which is enough for 1701/3 = 567 extra pages (starting from page 100). The book has 99 + 567 = 666 pages. Example 6.13 How many 4-digit integers can be formed with the set of digits {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} such that no digit is repeated and the resulting integer is a multi- ple of 3? Solution: The integers desired have the form D1D2D3D4 with D1 ̸= 0. Under the stipulated constraints, we must have D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 ∈ {6, 9, 12}. We thus consider three cases. Summer 2008 27 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Case I: D1+D2+D3+D4 = 6. Here we have {D1, D2, D3, D4} = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}, D1 ̸= 0. There are then 3 choices for D1. After D1 is chosen, D2 can be chosen in 3 ways, D3 in 2 ways, and D1 in 1 way. There are thus 3 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3 · 3! = 18 integers satisfying case I. Case II: D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 = 9. Here we have {D1, D2, D3, D4} = {0, 2, 3, 4}, D1 ̸= 0 or {D1, D2, D3, D4} = {0, 1, 3, 5}, D1 ̸= 0. Like before, there are 3 · 3! = 18 numbers in each possibility, thus we have 2 × 18 = 36 numbers in case II. Case III: D1+D2+D3+D4 = 12. Here we have {D1, D2, D3, D4} = {0, 3, 4, 5}, D1 ̸= 0 or {D1, D2, D3, D4} = {1, 2, 4, 5}. In the ﬁrst possibility there are 3·3! = 18 numbers, and in the second there are 4! = 24. Thus we have 18 + 24 = 42 numbers in case III. The desired number is thus 18 + 36 + 42 = 96. Summer 2008 28 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 7 Combinatorics: The Inclusion-Exclusion Principle In this section we investigate a tool for counting unions of events. It is known as The Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion or Sylvester-Poincar´e Principle. We use card (X) or |X| to denote the cardinality, or size, of the set X. We will use that fact that if X and Y are disjoint sets, then card (X ∪ Y ) = card (X) + card (Y ). Theorem 7.1 Two set Inclusion-Exclusion. card (A ∪ B) = card (A) + card (B) − card (A ∩ B) Proof 1. We have A ∪ B = (A \\ B) ∪ (B \\ A) ∪ (A ∩ B), and this last expression is a union of disjoint sets. Hence card (A ∪ B) = card (A \\ B) + card (B \\ A) + card (A ∩ B) . But A \\ B = A \\ (A ∩ B) =⇒ card (A \\ B) = card (A) − card (A ∩ B) , B \\ A = B \\ (A ∩ B) =⇒ card (B \\ A) = card (B) − card (A ∩ B) , which proves the result. Proof 2. Construct a Venn diagram, and mark by R1 the number of elements which are simultaneously in both sets (i.e., in A ∩ B), by R2 the number of elements which are in A but not in B (i.e., in A \\ B), and by R3 the number of elements which are B but not in A (i.e., in B \\ A). We have R2 + R3 − R1 = card (A ∪ B), which illustrates the theorem. Example 7.1 Of 40 people, 28 swim and 16 run. It is also known that 10 both swim and run. How many among the 40 neither swim nor run? Solution: Let A denote the set of swimmers and B the set of runners. Then card (A ∪ B) = card (A) + card (B) − card (A ∩ B) = 28 + 16 − 10 = 34, meaning that there are 34 people that either swim or run (or possibly both). There- fore the number of people that neither swim nor run is 40 − 34 = 6. Example 7.2 How many integers between 1 and 1000, inclusive, do not share a common factor with 1000? Summer 2008 29 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Observe that 1000 = 2 35 3, and thus from the 1000 integers we must weed out those that have a factor of 2 or of 5 in their prime factorization. If A2 denotes the set of those integers divisible by 2 in the interval [1, 1000] then clearly card (A2) = ⌊ 1000 2 ⌋ = 500. Similarly, if A5 denotes the set of those integers divisible by 5 then card (A5) = ⌊ 1000 5 ⌋ = 200. Also card (A2 ∩ A5) = ⌊ 1000 10 ⌋ = 100. This means that there are card (A2 ∪ A5) = 500 + 200 − 100 = 600 integers in the interval [1, 1000] sharing at least a factor with 1000, thus there are 1000 − 600 = 400 integers in [1, 1000] that do not share a factor prime factor with 1000. We now deduce a formula for counting the number of elements of a union of three events. Theorem 7.2 Three set Inclusion-Exclusion. Let A, B, C be events of the same sample space Ω. Then card (A ∪ B ∪ C) = card (A) + card (B) + card (C) − card (A ∩ B) − card (B ∩ C) − card (C ∩ A) + card (A ∩ B ∩ C) Proof 1. Using the associativity and distributivity of unions of sets, we see that card (A ∪ B ∪ C) = card (A ∪ (B ∪ C)) = card (A) + card (B ∪ C) − card (A ∩ (B ∪ C)) = card (A) + card (B ∪ C) − card ((A ∩ B) ∪ (A ∩ C)) = card (A) + card (B) + card (C) − card (B ∩ C) − card (A ∩ B) − card (A ∩ C) + card ((A ∩ B) ∩ (A ∩ C)) = card (A) + card (B) + card (C) − card (B ∩ C) − (card (A ∩ B) + card (A ∩ C) − card (A ∩ B ∩ C)) = card (A) + card (B) + card (C) − card (A ∩ B) − card (B ∩ C) − card (C ∩ A) + card (A ∩ B ∩ C) . This gives the Inclusion-Exclusion Formula for three sets. Proof 2. Construct a Venn Diagram. Example 7.3 How many integers between 1 and 600 inclusive are not divisible by 3, 5, or 7? Solution: Let Ak denote the set of integers between 1 and 600 which are divisible by k. Then Summer 2008 30 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. card (A3) = ⌊ 600 3 ⌋ = 200, card (A5) = ⌊ 600 5 ⌋ = 120, card (A7) = ⌊ 600 7 ⌋ = 85, card (A15) = ⌊ 600 15 ⌋ = 40 card (A21) = ⌊ 600 21 ⌋ = 28 card (A35) = ⌊ 600 35 ⌋ = 17 card (A105) = ⌊ 600 105⌋ = 5 By Inclusion-Exclusion there are 200 + 120 + 85 − 40 − 28 − 17 + 5 = 325 integers between 1 and 600 divisible by at least one of 3, 5, or 7. Those not divisible by these numbers are a total of 600 − 325 = 275. Example 7.4 In a group of 30 people, 8 speak English, 12 speak Spanish and 10 speak French. It is known that 5 speak English and Spanish, 5 Spanish and French, and 7 English and French. The number of people speaking all three languages is 3. How many do not speak any of these languages? Solution: Let A be the set of all English speakers, B the set of Spanish speakers and C the set of French speakers in our group. Construct a Venn diagram. In the intersection of all three we put 8. In the region common to A and B which is not ﬁlled up we put 5 − 2 = 3. In the region common to A and C which is not already ﬁlled up we put 5 − 3 = 2. In the region common to B and C which is not already ﬁlled up, we put 7 − 3 = 4. In the remaining part of A we put 8 − 2 − 3 − 2 = 1, in the remaining part of B we put 12 − 4 − 3 − 2 = 3, and in the remaining part of C we put 10 − 2 − 3 − 4 = 1. Each of the mutually disjoint regions comprise a total of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 16 persons. Those outside these three sets are then 30 − 16 = 14.

(factorial), as follows: 0! = 1, and for integers n ≥ 1, n! = 1 · 2 · 3 · · · n. n! is read n factorial. Example 8.1 We have 1! = 1, 2! = 1 · 2 = 2, 3! = 1 · 2 · 3 = 6, 4! = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 = 24, 5! = 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5 = 120. Example 8.2 We have 7! 4! = 7 · 6 · 5 · 4! 4! = 210, (n + 2)! n! = (n + 2)(n + 1)n! n! = (n + 2)(n + 1), (n − 2)! (n + 1)! = (n − 2)! (n + 1)(n)(n − 1)(n − 2)! = 1 (n + 1)(n)(n − 1). Deﬁnition 8.2 Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be n distinct objects. A permutation of these objects is simply a rearrangement of them. Example 8.3 There are 24 permutations of the letters in M AT H, namely M AT H M AHT M T AH M T HA M HT A M HAT AM T H AM HT AT M H AT HM AHT M AHM T T AM H T AHM T M AH T M HA T HM A T HAM HAT M HAM T HT AM HT M A HM T A HM AT Theorem 8.1 Permutations. Let x1, x2, . . . , xn be n distinct objects. Then there are n! permutations of them. Proof. The ﬁrst position can be chosen in n ways, the second object in n − 1 ways, the third in n − 2, etc. This gives n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · 2 · 1 = n!. Summer 2008 32 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 8.4 The number of permutations of the letters of the word RET ICU LA is 8! = 40320. Example 8.5 A bookshelf contains 5 German books, 7 Spanish books and 8 French books. Each book is diﬀerent from one another. (a) How many diﬀerent arrangements can be made of these books? (b) How many diﬀerent arrangements can be made of these books if books of each language must be next to each other? (c) How many diﬀerent arrangements can be made of these books if all the French books must be next to each other? (d) How many diﬀerent arrangements can be made of these books if no two French books can be next to each other? Solution: (a) We are permuting 5 + 7 + 8 = 20 objects. Thus the number of arrangements sought is 20! = 2432902008176640000. (b) “Glue” the books by language, this will assure that books of the same language are together. We permute the 3 languages in 3! ways. We permute the German books in 5! ways, the Spanish books in 7! ways and the French books in 8! ways. Hence the total number of ways is 3!5!7!8! = 146313216000. (c) Align the German books and the Spanish books ﬁrst. Putting these 5 + 7 = 12 books creates 12 + 1 = 13 spaces (we count the space before the ﬁrst book, the spaces between books and the space after the last book). To assure that all the French books are next each other, we “glue” them together and put them in one of these spaces. Now, the French books can be permuted in 8! ways and the non-French books can be permuted in 12! ways. Thus the total number of permutations is (13)8!12! = 251073478656000. (d) Align the German books and the Spanish books ﬁrst. Putting these 5 + 7 = 12 books creates 12 + 1 = 13 spaces (we count the space before the ﬁrst book, the spaces between books and the space after the last book). To assure that no two French books are next to each other, we put them into these spaces. The ﬁrst French book can be put into any of 13 spaces, the second into any of 12, etc., the eighth French book can be put into any 6 spaces. Now, the non-French books can be permuted in 12! ways. Thus the total number of permutations is (13)(12)(11)(10)(9)(8)(7)(6)12!, which is 24856274386944000. Summer 2008 33 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 8.2 Permutations with Repetitions We now consider permutations with repeated objects. Example 8.6 In how many ways may the letters of the word M ASSACHU SET T S be permuted? Solution: We put subscripts on the repeats forming M A1S1S2A2CHU S3ET1T2S4. There are now 13 distinguishable objects, which can be permuted in 13! diﬀerent ways. For each of these 13! permutations, A1A2 can be permuted in 2! ways, S1S2S3S4 can be permuted in 4! ways, and T1T2 can be permuted in 2! ways. Thus the over count 13! is corrected by the total actual count 13! 2!4!2! = 64864800. In general, we may prove the following theorem. Theorem 8.2 Permutations with Repetitions. Let there be k types of objects: n1 of type 1; n2 of type 2; etc. Then the number of ways in which these n1 + n2 + · · · + nk objects can be rearranged is (n1 + n2 + · · · + nk)! n1!n2! · · · nk! . Example 8.7 In how many ways may we permute the letters of the word M ASSACHU SET T S in such a way that M ASS is always together, in this order? Solution: The particle M ASS can be considered as one block and the 9 letters A, C, H, U, S, E, T, T, S. In A, C, H, U, S, E, T, T, S there are four S’s and two T ’s and so the total number of permutations sought is 10! 2!2! = 907200. Example 8.8 In how many ways may we write the number 9 as the sum of three positive integer summands? Here order counts, so, for example, 1 + 7 + 1 is to be regarded diﬀerent from 7 + 1 + 1. Solution: We ﬁrst look for answers with a + b + c = 9, 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ c ≤ 7 Summer 2008 34 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. and we ﬁnd the permutations of each triplet. We have (a, b, c) Number of permutations (1, 1, 7) 3! 2! = 3 (1, 2, 6) 3! = 6 (1, 3, 5) 3! = 6 (1, 4, 4) 3! 2! = 3 (2, 2, 5) 3! 2! = 3 (2, 3, 4) 3! = 6 (3, 3, 3) 3! 3! = 1 Thus the number desired is 3 + 6 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 6 + 1 = 28. Example 8.9 In how many ways can the letters of the word MURMUR be ar- ranged without letting two letters which are alike come together? Solution: If we started with, say , MU then the R could be arranged as follows: M U R R , M U R R , M U R R . In the ﬁrst case there are 2! = 2 ways of putting the remaining M and U. In the second case, there are 2! = 2 ways, and in the third case there is only 1! = 1 way. Thus, starting the word with MU gives 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 possible arrangements. In the general case, we can choose the ﬁrst letter of the word in 3 ways, and the second in 2 ways. Thus the number of arrangements sought is 3 · 2 · 5 = 30. 8.3 Combinations without Repetitions Deﬁnition 8.3 Let n, k be non-negative integers with 0 ≤ k ≤ n. The symbol (n k ) (read “n choose k”) is deﬁned and denoted by (n k ) = n! k!(n − k)! = n · (n − 1) · (n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) 1 · 2 · 3 · · · k . Remark. Observe that in the last fraction, there are k factors in both the numerator and denominator. Also, observe the boundary conditions (n 0 ) = (n n ) = 1, (n 1 ) = ( n n − 1 ) = n. Summer 2008 35 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 8.10 We have (6 3 ) = 6 · 5 · 4 1 · 2 · 3 = 20, (11 2 ) = 11 · 10 1 · 2 = 55, (12 7 ) = 12 · 11 · 10 · 9 · 8 · 7 · 6 1 · 2 · 3 · 4 · 5 · 6 · 7 = 792, (110 109 ) = 110, (110 0 ) = 1, (110 1 ) = 110. Remark. Since n − (n − k) = k, we have, for any integers n, k such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, the symmetry identity (n k ) = n! k!(n − k)! = n! (n − k)!(n − (n − k))! = ( n n − k ). This can be interpreted as follows: if there are n diﬀerent tickets in a hat, choosing k of them out of the hat is the same as choosing n − k of them to remain in the hat. Example 8.11 (11 9 ) = (11 2 ) = 55, (12 5 ) = (12 7 ) = 792. Deﬁnition 8.4 Suppose that we have n distinguishable objects. A k-combination is a selection of k, (0 ≤ k ≤ n) objects from the n made without regards to order. Example 8.12 The 2-combinations from the list {X, Y, Z, W } are XY, XZ, XW, Y Z, Y W, W Z. Example 8.13 The 3-combinations from the list {X, Y, Z, W } are XY Z, XY W, XZW, Y W Z. Theorem 8.3 Combinations. Let there be n distinguishable objects, and let k be an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n. Then the numbers of k-combinations of these n Summer 2008 36 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. objects is (n k ). Proof. Pick any of the k objects. This can be done in n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) ways, since there are n ways of choosing the ﬁrst, n − 1 ways of choosing the second, etc. This particular choice of k objects can be permuted in k! ways. Hence the total number of k-combinations is n(n − 1)(n − 2) · · · (n − k + 1) k! = (n k ). Example 8.14 From a group of 10 people, we can choose a committee of 4 in(10 4 ) = 210 ways. Example 8.15 In a group of 2 camels, 3 goats, and 10 sheep in how many ways can we choose a committee of 6 animals if (a) there are no constraints in species? (b) the two camels must be included? (c) the two camels must be excluded? (d) there must be at least 3 sheep? (e) there must be at most 2 sheep? (f) Joe Camel, Billy Goat and Samuel Sheep hate each other and they will not work in the same group. How many compatible committees are there? Solution: (a) There are 2 + 3 + 10 = 15 animals and we must choose 6. Thus, there are (15 6 ) = 5005 possible committees. (b) Since the 2 camels are included, we must choose 6 − 2 = 4 more animals from a list of 15 − 2 = 13 animals, so there are (13 4 ) = 715 possible committees. Summer 2008 37 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (c) Since the 2 camels must be excluded, we must choose 6 animals from a list of 15 − 2 = 13, so there are (13 6 ) = 1716 possible committees. (d) If k sheep are chosen from the 10 sheep, 6 − k animals must be chosen from the remaining 5 animals, so there are (10 3 )(5 3 ) + (10 4 )(5 2 ) + (10 5 )(5 1 ) + (10 6 )(5 0 ) = 4770 possible committees. (e) First observe that there cannot be 0 sheep, since that would mean choosing 6 other animals. Hence, there must be either 1 or 2 sheep, and so 3 or 4 of the other animals. The total number is thus (10 2 )(5 4 ) + (10 1 )(5 5 ) = 235. (f) A compatible group will either exclude all these three animals or include exactly one of them. This can be done in (12 6 ) + (3 1 )(12 5 ) = 3300 ways. Example 8.16 Consider the set of 5-digit positive integers written in decimal no- tation. (a) How many are there? (b) How many do not have a 9 in their decimal representation? (c) How many have at least one 9 in their decimal representation? (d) How many have exactly one 9? (e) How many have exactly two 9’s? (f) How many have exactly three 9’s? (g) How many have exactly four 9’s? (h) How many have exactly ﬁve 9’s? (i) How many have neither an 8 nor a 9 in their decimal representation? (j) How many have neither a 7, nor an 8, nor a 9 in their decimal representation? Summer 2008 38 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (k) How many have either a 7, an 8, or a 9 in their decimal representation? Solution: (a) There are 9 possible choices for the ﬁrst digit and 10 possible choices for the remaining digits. The number of choices is thus 9 · 10 4 = 90000. (b) There are 8 possible choices for the ﬁrst digit and 9 possible choices for the remaining digits. The number of choices is thus 8 · 9 4 = 52488. (c) The diﬀerence 90000 − 52488 = 37512. (d) We condition on the ﬁrst digit. If the ﬁrst digit is a 9 then the other four remaining digits must be diﬀerent from 9, giving 9 4 = 6561 such numbers. If the ﬁrst digit is not a 9, then there are 8 choices for this ﬁrst digit. Also, we have(4 1) = 4 ways of choosing were the 9 will be, and we have 9 3 ways of ﬁlling the 3 remaining spots. Thus in this case there are 8 · 4 · 9 3 = 23328 such numbers. In total there are 6561 + 23328 = 29889 ﬁve-digit positive integers with exactly one 9 in their decimal representation. (e) We condition on the ﬁrst digit. If the ﬁrst digit is a 9 then one of the remaining four must be a 9, and the choice of place can be accomplished in (4 1) = 4 ways. The other three remaining digits must be diﬀerent from 9, giving 4 · 9 3 = 2916 such numbers. If the ﬁrst digit is not a 9, then there are 8 choices for this ﬁrst digit. Also, we have (4 2) = 6 ways of choosing were the two 9’s will be, and we have 9 2 ways of ﬁlling the two remaining spots. Thus in this case there are 8·6·9 2 = 3888 such numbers. Altogether there are 2916+3888 = 6804 ﬁve-digit positive integers with exactly two 9’s in their decimal representation. (f) Again we condition on the ﬁrst digit. If the ﬁrst digit is a 9 then two of the remaining four must be 9’s, and the choice of place can be accomplished in(4 2) = 6 ways. The other two remaining digits must be diﬀerent from 9, giving 6 · 9 2 = 486 such numbers. If the ﬁrst digit is not a 9, then there are 8 choices for this ﬁrst digit. Also, we have (4 3) = 4 ways of choosing were the three 9’s will be, and we have 9 ways of ﬁlling the remaining spot. Thus in this case there are 8 · 4 · 9 = 288 such numbers. Altogether there are 486 + 288 = 774 ﬁve-digit positive integers with exactly three 9’s in their decimal representation. (g) If the ﬁrst digit is a 9 then three of the remaining four must be 9’s, and the choice of place can be accomplished in (4 3) = 4 ways. The other remaining digit must be diﬀerent from 9, giving 4 · 9 = 36 such numbers. If the ﬁrst digit is not a 9, then there are 8 choices for this ﬁrst digit. Also, we have (4 4) = 4 ways of choosing were the four 9’s will be, thus ﬁlling all the spots. Thus in this case there are 8 · 1 = 8 such numbers. Altogether there are 36 + 8 = 44 ﬁve-digit positive integers with exactly three 9’s in their decimal representation. (h) There is obviously only 1 such positive integer. Remark. Observe that 37512 = 29889 + 6804 + 774 + 44 + 1. Summer 2008 39 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (i) We have 7 choices for the ﬁrst digit and 8 choices for the remaining 4 digits, giving 7 · 8 4 = 28672 such integers. (j) We have 6 choices for the ﬁrst digit and 7 choices for the remaining 4 digits, giving 6 · 7 4 = 14406 such integers. (k) We use inclusion-exclusion. The desired number is 90000 − 85854 = 4146. 8.4 Combinations with Repetitions Theorem 8.4 Theorem (DeMoivre). Let n be a positive integer. The number of positive integer solutions to x1 + x2 + · · · + xr = n is (n − 1 r − 1 ). Proof. Write n as n = 1 + 1 + · · · + 1 + 1, where there are n 1’s and n − 1 plus signs. To decompose n in r summands we need to choose r − 1 plus signs from the n − 1, which proves the theorem. Example 8.17 In how many ways may we write the number 9 as the sum of three positive integer summands? Here order counts, so, for example, 1 + 7 + 1 is to be regarded diﬀerent from 7 + 1 + 1. Solution: We are seeking integral solutions to a + b + c = 9, a > 0, b > 0, c > 0. The number of solutions is thus (9 − 1 3 − 1 ) = (8 2 ) = 28. Example 8.18 In how many ways can 100 be written as the sum of four positive integer summands? Solution: We want the number of positive integer solutions to a + b + c + d = 100, which is (99 3 ) = 156849. Summer 2008 40 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Corollary 8.5 Let n be a positive integer. The number of non-negative integer solutions to y1 + y2 + · · · + yr = n is (n + r − 1 r − 1 ). Proof. Set xr − 1 = yr. Then xr ≥ 1. The equation x1 − 1 + x2 − 1 + · · · + xr − 1 = n is equivalent to x1 + x2 + · · · + xr = n + r, which has (n + r − 1 r − 1 ) solutions. Example 8.19 Find the number of quadruples (a, b, c, d) of integers satisfying a + b + c + d = 100, a ≥ 30, b > 21, c ≥ 1, d ≥ 1. Solution: Set a ′ + 29 = a, b ′ + 20 = b. Then we want the number of positive integer solutions to a′ + 29 + b′ + 21 + c + d = 100, or a ′ + b′ + c + d = 50. This number is (49 3 ) = 18424. Example 8.20 There are ﬁve people in a lift of a building having eight ﬂoors. In how many ways can they choose their ﬂoor for exiting the lift? Solution: Let xi be the number of people that ﬂoor i receives. We are looking for non-negative solutions of the equation x1 + x2 + · · · + x8 = 5. Setting yi = xi + 1, then x1 + x2 + · · · + x8 = 5 =⇒ (y1 − 1) + (y2 − 1) + · · · + (y8 − 1) = 5 =⇒ y1 + y2 + · · · + y8 = 13, Summer 2008 41 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. so the number sought is the number of positive solutions to y1 + y2 + · · · + y8 = 13, which is (12 7 ) = 792. Example 8.21 Find the number of quadruples (a, b, c, d) of non-negative integers which satisfy the inequality a + b + c + d ≤ 2001. Solution: The number of non-negative solutions to a + b + c + d ≤ 2001 is equal to the number of solutions to a + b + c + d + f = 2001 where f is a non-negative integer. This number is the same as the number of positive integer solutions to a1 − 1 + b1 − 1 + c1 − 1 + d1 − 1 + f1 − 1 = 2001, which is (2005 4 ). Example 8.22 How many integral solutions to the equation a + b + c + d = 100, are there given the following constraints: 1 ≤ a ≤ 10, b ≥ 0, c ≥ 2, 20 ≤ d ≤ 30? Solution: We use Inclusion-Exclusion. There are (80 3 ) = 82160 integral solutions to a + b + c + d = 100, a ≥ 1, b ≥ 0, c ≥ 2, d ≥ 20. Let A be the set of solutions with a ≥ 11, b ≥ 0, c ≥ 2, d ≥ 20 and B be the set of solutions with a ≥ 1, b ≥ 0, c ≥ 2, d ≥ 31. Then card (A) = (70 3 ), card (B) = (69 3 ), card (A ∩ B) = (59 3 ) and so card (A ∪ B) = (70 3 ) + (69 3 ) − (59 3 ) = 74625. Summer 2008 42 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. The total number of solutions to a + b + c + d = 100 with 1 ≤ a ≤ 10, b ≥ 0, c ≥ 2, 20 ≤ d ≤ 30 is thus (80 3 ) − (70 3 ) − (69 3 ) + (59 3 ) = 7535. Summer 2008 43 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 9 Combinatorics: The Binomial Theorem and Some Com- binatorial Identities We recall that the symbol (n k ) = n! (n − k)!k! counts the number of ways of selecting k diﬀerent objects from n diﬀerent objects. Example 9.1 Prove Newton’s Identity: (n i )(i j ) = (n j )(n − j j − i ), for integers 0 ≤ j ≤ i ≤ n. Solution #1: We have (n i )(i j ) = n!i! i!(n − i)!j!(i − j)! = n!(n − j)! (n − j)!j!(n − i)!(i − j)!, which is equal to (n j )(n − j i − j ). Solution #2: Let’s think about this identity from a combinatorial point of view. Consider a group of n people from which we want to form an i-member committee with j leaders. We can choose i people to be on a committee in (n i) ways, and then choose the j committee leaders in (i j) ways. Or, we can choose the j leaders ﬁrst in (n j) ways, and then choose the remaining j − i committee members from the remaining n − j people in (n−j j−i) ways. Since both methods will give us all of the committees, we have (n i )(i j ) = (n j )(n − j j − i ). Example 9.2 Prove Pascal’s Identity: (n k ) = (n − 1 k − 1 ) + (n − 1 k ), for integers 1 ≤ k ≤ n. Summer 2008 44 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution #1: We have (n − 1 k − 1 ) + (n − 1 k ) = (n − 1)! (k − 1)!(n − k)! + (n − 1)! k!(n − k − 1)! = (n − 1)! (n − k − 1)!(k − 1)! ( 1 n − k + 1 k ) = (n − 1)! (n − k − 1)!(k − 1)! n (n − k)k = n! (n − k)!k!. = (n k ) Solution #2: Let’s think about this identity from a combinatorial point of view. We know that the left-hand side, (n k ) is the number of ways that we can choose k objects from a set of n objects. Now, suppose we mark a particular object “X” in the set of n objects. Then, every time we choose k objects from the set of n objects, either “X” is in the set, or it is not. If object “X” is in the set, then we only need to choose k − 1 objects from the remaining n − 1 objects (since we already know that “X” has been chosen). This can be done in (n − 1 k − 1 ) ways. If “X” is not in the set, then we need to choose k objects from the remaining n − 1 objects. This can be done in (n − 1 k ) ways. Thus, we conclude that (n k ) = (n − 1 k − 1 ) + (n − 1 k ). Pascal’s Triangle. Using Pascal’s Identity, we obtain Pascal’s Triangle. Each number is equal to the sum of the two numbers above it (to the left and right). (0 0) (1 0) (1 1) (2 0) (2 1) (2 2) (3 0) (3 1) (3 2) (3 3) (4 0) (4 1) (4 2) (4 3) (4 4) (5 0) (5 1) (5 2) (5 3) (5 4) (5 5) Substituting the numerical values of the binomial coeﬃcients, we have: Summer 2008 45 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 We see from Pascal’s Triangle that the binomial coeﬃcients are symmetric. This symmetry is easily justiﬁed algebraically by the identity (n k ) = ( n n − k ). We also notice that the binomial coeﬃcients tend to increase until they reach the middle, and that they decrease symmetrically. We call this property the unimodality of the binomial coeﬃcients. For example, without ﬁnding the exact numerical values we can see that (200 17 ) < (200 69 ) and that (200 131 ) = (200 69 ) < (200 99 ). Next, we use Pascal’s Triangle in order to expand the binomial (a + b) n. Deﬁnition 9.1 Sigma Notation. The expression n∑ k=0 ak is the sum of all of the terms a0, a1, . . . , an: n∑ k=0 ak = a0 + a1 + a2 + · · · an. Example 9.3 5∑ k=0 3 k = 3 0 + 3 1 + 3 2 + 3 3 + 3 4 + 3 5. Example 9.4 4∑ j=1 j2 = 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 + 4 2. Theorem 9.1 Binomial Theorem, Part 1. For any n such that n ≥ 0, we have (1 + x) n = n∑ k=0 (n k )xk. Proof. Observe that expanding (1 + x)(1 + x) · · · (1 + x) | {z } n factors Summer 2008 46 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. consists of adding up all the terms obtained from multiplying either a 1 or a x from the ﬁrst set of parentheses times either a 1 or an x from the second set of parentheses etc. To get xk, x must be chosen from exactly k of the sets of parentheses. Thus the number of xk terms is (n k). It follows that (1 + x) n = (n 0 ) + (n 1 )x + (n 2 )x2 + · · · + (n n )xn = n∑ k=0 (n k )xk. Example 9.5 (1 + x) 2 = 2∑ k=0 (2 k )xk = (2 0 )x0 + (2 1 )x1 + (2 2 )x2 = 1 + 2x + x2 (1 + x) 3 = 3∑ k=0 (3 k )xk = (3 0 )x0 + (3 1 )x1 + (3 2 )x2 + (3 3 )x3 = 1 + 3x + 3x2 + x3 (1 + x) 4 = 4∑ k=0 (4 k )xk = (4 0 )x0 + (4 1 )x1 + (4 2 )x2 + (4 3 )x3 + (4 3 )x4 = 1 + 4x + 6x2 + 4x3 + x4 Theorem 9.2 Binomial Theorem, Part 2: More generally, for any n such that n ≥ 0 and for any a, b, we have (a + b) n = n∑ k=0 (n k )a kbn−k.

Example 9.6 (a + b) 2 = 2∑ k=0 (2 k )a kb2−k = (2 0 )a0b2 + (2 1 )a 1b1 + (2 2 )a 2b0 = b2 + 2ab + a 2 (a + b) 3 = 3∑ k=0 (3 k )a kb3−k = (3 0 )a0b3 + (3 1 )a 1b2 + (3 2 )a 2b1 + (3 3 )a 3b0 = b3 + 3ab2 + 3a 2b + a 3 Example 9.7 Prove that n∑ k=0 (n k ) = 2 n. Solution: This follows from letting x = 1 in the expansion (1 + x) n = n∑ k=0 (n k )xk. Can you give a combinatorial proof of this result? Example 9.8 Prove that for integer n ≥ 1, n∑ j=i (n j )(j i ) = (n i )2 n−i, i ≤ n. Solution: Recall that by Newton’s Identity (n j )(j i ) = (n i )(n − i j − i ). Thus n∑ j=0 (n j )(j i ) = (n i ) n∑ j=0 (n − i j − i ). Re-indexing the sum on the right, we obtain: n∑ j=0 (n − i j − i ) = n−i∑ j=0 (n − i j ) = 2 n−i, Summer 2008 48 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. by the preceding problem. Thus the assertion follows. Example 9.9 Simplify ∑ 0≤k≤50 (100 2k ). Solution: By the Binomial Theorem (1 + 1) 100 = (100 0 ) + (100 1 ) + (100 2 ) + . . . + (100 99 ) + (100 100 ) (1 − 1) 100 = (100 0 ) − (100 1 ) + (100 2 ) − . . . − (100 99 ) + (100 100 ), . Adding these two equations together, we obtain: 2 100 = 2 (100 0 ) + 2 (100 2 ) + . . . + 2 (100 100 ). Dividing by 2, the required sum is thus 2 99. Example 9.10 Simplify 10∑ k=1 2 k(11 k ). Solution: By the Binomial Theorem, the complete sum ∑11 k=0 (11 k )2 k = 3 11. The required sum lacks the zeroth term, (11 0 )2 0 = 1, and the eleventh term, (11 11)2 11 from this complete sum. The required sum is thus 3 11 − 2 11 − 1. Example 9.11 Which coeﬃcient of the expansion of ( 1 3 + 2 3x)10 has the greatest magnitude? Solution: By the Binomial Theorem, ( 1 3 + 2 3x)10 = 10∑ k=0 (10 k )(1/3) k(2x/3) 10−k = 10∑ k=0 akxk. We consider the ratios ak ak−1 , k = 1, 2, . . . n. This ratio is seen to be ak ak−1 = 2(10 − k + 1) k . Summer 2008 49 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. This will be < 1 if k < 22/3 < 8. Thus a0 < a1 < a2 < . . . < a7. If k > 22/3, the ratio above will be < 1. Thus a7 > a8 > a9 > a10. The largest term is that of k = 7, i.e. the eighth term. Example 9.12 At what positive integral value of x is the x4 term in the expansion of (2x + 9)10 greater than the adjacent terms? Solution: We want to ﬁnd integral x such that (10 4 )(2x) 4(9)6 ≥ (10 3 )(2x) 3(9)7, and (10 4 )(2x) 4(9)6 ≥ (10 5 )(2x) 5(9)5. After simplifying the factorials, the two inequalities sought are x ≥ 18/7 and 15/4 ≥ x. The only integral x that satisﬁes this is x = 3. Example 9.13 Prove that if m, n are nonnegative integers then ( n + 1 m + 1 ) = n∑ k=m ( k m ). Solution: Using Pascal’s Identity, we obtain: n∑ k=m ( k m ) = ( m m + 1 ) + (m m ) + (m + 1 m ) + · · · + ( n m ) = (m + 1 m + 1 ) + (m + 1 m ) + (m + 2 m ) + · · · + ( n m ) = (m + 2 m + 1 ) + (m + 2 m ) + (m + 3 m ) + · · · + ( n m ) ... = ( n m + 1 ) + ( n m ) = ( n + 1 m + 1 ).

Example 10.1 The probability of randomly drawing a face card from a deck of 52 ordinary playing cards is 12 52. Example 10.2 Find the probability that when two cards are randomly drawn, with- out replacing the ﬁrst card, at least one of the cards is a face card. Solution: We must consider the following three cases separately: • Case 1: The ﬁrst card is a face card and the second card is not a face card. This can happen in 12 · 40 diﬀerent ways. • Case 2: The ﬁrst card is a not a face card and the second card is a face card. This can happen in 40 · 12 diﬀerent ways. • Case 3: Both cards are face cards. This can happen in 12 · 11 diﬀerent ways. Thus, the total number of ways in which at least one of the cards can be a face card is 12 · 40 + 40 · 12 + 12 · 11 = 1092. The total number of ways to draw two cards (without replacing the ﬁrst) is 52 · 51. Thus, the probability that at least one of the cards is a face card is P = 1092 52 · 51 = 7 17. Theorem 10.1 We can obtain some basic results about probabilities directly from the deﬁnition. Let P (A) denote the probability that event A occurs. • 0 ≤ P (A) ≤ 1. • The probability that A does not occur is 1 − P (A). • P (A ∪ B) is the probability that event A OR event B occurs. P (A ∩ B) is the probability that event A AND event B both occur. If A and B are two events, then P (A ∪ B) = P (A) + P (B) − P (A ∩ B). • If A and B are two independent events (i.e. events which do not aﬀect each other’s outcomes), then P (A ∩ B) = P (A) · P (B). Summer 2008 51 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 10.3 Find the probability that a king or a heart is drawn when choosing one card from an ordinary deck of 52 cards. Solution: P (heart or king) = P (heart) + P (king) − P (heart and king) = 13 52 + 4 52 − 1 52 = 16 52 = 4 13. Example 10.4 (2003 AMC 10B #21) A bag contains two red beads and two green beads. Reach into the bag and pull out a bead, replacing it with a red bead regardless of the color. What is the probability that all the beads are red after three such replacements? (A) 1/8 (B) 5/32 (C) 9/32 (D) 3/8 (E) 7/16 Solution: For all the beads to be red after three replacements, two of the three beads chosen must have been green. Thus, the selections must have been one of the following: • Case 1: red, green, green. The probability of this case is 1 2 · 1 2 · 1 4 = 1 16. • Case 2: green, red, green. The probability of this case is 1 2 · 3 4 · 1 4 = 3 32. • Case 3: green, green, red. The probability of this case is 1 2 · 1 2 · 1 = 1 8. Thus, the desired probability is 1 16 + 3 32 + 1 8 = 9 32. Example 10.5 (2004 AMC 10A #10) Coin A is ﬂipped three times and coin B is ﬂipped four times. What is the probability that the number of heads obtained from ﬂipping the two fair coins is the same? Summer 2008 52 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (A) 19/128 (B) 23/128 (C) 1/4 (D) 35/128 (E) 1/2 Solution: The number of coins on both heads could be 0, 1, 2, or 3. The probability that we obtain 0 heads with both coins is ( 1 2 )3 · ( 1 2 )4 = ( 1 2 )7 . The probability that we obtain exactly 1 head with both coins is 3 ( 1 2 )3 · 4 ( 1 2 )4 = 12 ( 1 2 )7 . The probability that we obtain exactly 2 heads with both coins is 3 ( 1 2 )3 · 6 ( 1 2 )4 = 18 ( 1 2 )7 . The probability that we obtain exactly 3 head with both coins is ( 1 2 )3 · 4 ( 1 2 )4 = 4 ( 1 2 )7 . Thus, the desired probability is (1 + 12 + 18 + 4) ( 1 2 )7 = 35 128. Example 10.6 The Monty Hall Problem. Consider the following game. Three boxes are marked A, B, and C, and one of them contains $1,000,000. You choose box C. I’m going to help you out now. I tell you that box A does not contain the money. Now, you decide whether you want to change and choose box B, or keep box C. Solution: At ﬁrst glance, you might say that the money is equally likely to be in box B or C, so changing doesn’t help at all. However, consider the probability of winning this game. If you never change, the only way that you win is if you choose the right box ﬁrst, a 1/3 chance. If you change instead, you will always win if you pick a wrong box ﬁrst, because after I expose one wrong box, the other unchosen box is a winner. Since you have a 2/3 chance of picking the wrong box initially, you have a 2/3 chance of winning if you accept the oﬀer to switch boxes.

Deﬁnition 11.1 The (arithmetic) mean of a collection of n numbers a1, a2, . . . , an is mean = a1 + a2 + · · · + an n . Deﬁnition 11.2 Consider the collection of numbers {a1, a2, . . . , an}, with a1 ≤ a2 ≤ · · · ≤ an. The median of the collection is the middle term of the collection when n is odd and is the average of the two middle terms when n is even. Deﬁnition 11.3 The mode of a collection of n numbers a1, a2, . . . , an is the term(s) that occur most frequently. Deﬁnition 11.4 The range of a collection of n integers a1, a2, . . . , an is the diﬀer- ence between the largest and smallest integers. Example 11.1 (1991 AHSME #16) One hundred students at Century High School participated in the AMC 12 last year, and their mean score was 100. The number of non-seniors taking the AMC 12 was 50% more than the number of seniors, and the mean score of the seniors was 50% higher than that of non-seniors. What was the mean score of the seniors? (A) 100 (B) 112.5 (C) 120 (D) 125 (E) 150 Solution: Let S denote the number of seniors that participated in the contest. Then the number of non-seniors that participated in the contest is 1.5S, and S + 1.5S = 100, so S = 40. Thus there are 40 seniors and 60 non-seniors that participated in the contest. Let M be the mean of the seniors. Then the mean of the non-seniors is 2 3 M . The sum of the seniors’ scores is 40M and the sum of the non-seniors’ scores is 60 · 2 3 M = 40M . Thus, we obtain 100 = 40M + 40M 100 , so M = 125. Example 11.2 (2004 AMC 12A #10) The sum of 49 consecutive integers is 7 5. What is their median? Summer 2008 54 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (A) 7 (B) 7 2 (C) 7 3 (D) 7 4 (E) 75 Solution. Since the integers are consecutive, the mean and the median are the same with value median = mean = 7 5 49 = 7 5 72 = 7 3. Example 11.3 (2000 AMC 12 #9) Mrs. Walter gave an exam in a mathematics class of ﬁve students. She entered the scores in random order onto a spreadsheet, which recalculated the class average after each score was entered. Mrs. Walter noticed that after each score was entered, the average was always an integer. The scores (listed in ascending order) were 71, 76, 80, 82, and 91. What was the last score Mrs. Walter entered? (A) 71 (B) 76 (C) 80 (D) 82 (E) 91 Solution: Since the average of the ﬁrst two scores entered is an integer, the ﬁrst two scores entered must both be even or both be odd. If they were the two odd scores, then their sum would be 71 + 91 = 162. Since 162 is divisible by 3, the third score added would also have to be divisible by 3 so that the average of the ﬁrst three scores is an integer. However, none of the remaining scores (76, 80, and 82) is divisible by 3, so the ﬁrst two scores that she entered could not have been the odd scores. Thus, the ﬁrst two scores entered must have both been even. Since 76 + 80 = 156 and 80 + 82 = 162 are both divisible by 3, but none of 71, 91, and 82 is divisible by 3, the ﬁrst pair chosen could not have been 76 and 80 or 80 and 82. Thus, the ﬁrst two scores entered must have been 76 and 82. Since 76 + 82 = 158 has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, the third score entered must have a remainder of 1 when divided by 3. Of those remaining, only 91 has this property. So the ﬁrst three scores entered must have been 76, 82, and 91. Since the sum of 76, 82, and 91 is odd, the fourth score entered must also be odd. Thus, the fourth score entered was 71 and the last score entered was 80.

The number assigned by the sequence to the integer n is commonly denoted using a subscript, such as an. These numbers are called the terms of the sequence. You should think of a sequence as a list of numbers. Example 12.1 Consider the sequence of numbers 1, 4, 7, . . . . We have a1 = 1, a2 = 4, a3 = 7, and in general (assuming that the pattern continues), an = 3n − 2. There are two special types of sequences that arise frequently on the AMC competi- tions. Deﬁnition 12.2 An arithmetic sequence (also called an arithmetic progression) {an} is deﬁned by an = a + (n − 1)d for some constants a and d ̸= 0. The number a is the ﬁrst term of the sequence and the number d is the common diﬀerence between terms. Example 12.2 The sequence 1, 4, 7, . . . that we considered previously is an arithmetic sequence with ﬁrst term a = 1 and common diﬀerence d = 3. Theorem 12.1 If {an} is an arithmetic sequence with ﬁrst term a and common diﬀerence d, then a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an = n 2 (a1 + an). Deﬁnition 12.3 A geometric sequence {an} is deﬁned by an = a · rn−1 where a is a constant and r is a constant not equal to 0 or 1. The number a is the ﬁrst term of the sequence and the number r is the common ratio between terms. Example 12.3 The sequence 2, 6, 18, . . . is a geometric sequence with ﬁrst term a = 2 and common ratio r = 3. Summer 2008 56 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Theorem 12.2 If {an} is a geometric sequence with ﬁrst term a and common ratio r, then a1 + a2 + · · · + an = a 1 − rn 1 − r . Proof. Let Sn denote the sum of the ﬁrst n terms. Then: Sn = a1 + a2 + a3 + · · · + an = a + ar + ar2 + · · · + arn−1 rSn = ar + ar2 + ar3 + · · · + arn Sn − rSn = a − arn. Deﬁnition 12.4 A recursively-deﬁned sequence is one in which the n-th term an is deﬁned in terms of the previous terms a1, a2, . . . , an−1. Example 12.4 The Fibonacci sequence is an example of a recursively-deﬁned se- quence: fn = fn−1 + fn−2, f1 = 0, f2 = 1. The ﬁrst few terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,.... Example 12.5 (2002 AMC 12B #13) The sum of 18 consecutive positive integers is a perfect square. What is the smallest possible value of this sum? (A) 169 (B) 225 (C) 289 (D) 361 (E) 441 Solution: Let a denote the ﬁrst term of the sequence. The sequence is an arithmetic sequence with d = 1, and the sum is 18 2 a + (a + 17) = 9(2a + 17). For the sum to be a perfect square, the term 2a + 17 must be a perfect square. This ﬁrst occurs when a = 4, which gives the sum 225. Example 12.6 (1981 AHSME #14) In a geometric sequence of real numbers, the sum of the ﬁrst two terms is 7 and the sum of the ﬁrst six terms is 91. What is the sum of the ﬁrst four terms? (A) 28 (B) 32 (C) 35 (D) 49 (E) 84 Solution: Let a denote the ﬁrst term of the sequence and let r denote the common ratio. We have 7 = a + ar and 91 = 7(1 + r2 + r4). Summer 2008 57 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Thus r2 = 3 and the sum of the ﬁrst four terms is 28. Example 12.7 (2004 AMC 10A #24) Let a1, a2, . . . be a sequence with the following properties: • a1 = 1, and • a2n = n · an for any positive integer n. What is the value of a2100? (A) 1 (B) 2 99 (C) 2 100 (D) 2 4950 (E) 29999 Solution: Computing the ﬁrst few terms, we obtain: a2 = a2·1 = 1 · a1 = 1 = 2 0 a22 = a4 = a2·2 = 2 · a2 = 2 = 2 1 a23 = a8 = a2·4 = 4 · a4 = 8 = 2 1+2 a24 = a16 = a2·8 = 8 · a8 = 64 = 2 1+2+3 In general, we observe that a2n = 2 1+2+···+(n−1) = 2 (n−1)n/2. Thus, a2100 = 2 4950. Summer 2008 58 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 13 Prime Factorization Deﬁnition 13.1 A natural number greater than 1 is said to be prime if its only natural number divisors are 1 and itself. Natural numbers greater than 1 that are not prime are composite. Theorem 13.1 The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic. Every natural number, other than 1, can be factored into a product of primes in only one way, apart from the order of the factors. Example 13.1 Find positive integers x and y that satisfy both xy = 40 and 31 = 2x + 3y. Solution: Since 40 has the unique factorization 40 = 2 3 ·5, there are only 8 possibili- ties for the pair (x, y). These are (1, 40), (2, 20), (4, 10), (8, 5), (5, 8), (10, 4), (20, 2), (40, 1). Only (x, y) = (8, 5) additionally satisﬁes 31 = 2x + 3y. Example 13.2 (1998 AHSME #6) Suppose that 1998 is written as a product of two positive integers whose diﬀerence is as small as possible. What is this diﬀerence? (A) 8 (B) 15 (C) 17 (D) 47 (E) 93 Solution: The prime decomposition of 1998 is 1998 = 2 · 3 3 · 37. The factorization of 1998 into two positive integers whose diﬀerence is as small as possible is 1998 = 37·54 and the diﬀerence is 54 − 37 = 17. Example 13.3 (2005 AMC 10A #15) How many positive cubes divide 3! · 5! · 7!? (A) 2 (B) 3 (C) 4 (D) 5 (E) 6 Solution: We have 3! · 5! · 7! = 2 8 · 3 4 · 5 2 · 7. There are 6 distinct cubes that divide 3! · 5! · 7!. Example 13.4 (2001 AMC 12 #21) The product of four positive integers a, b, c, d is 8! and they satisfy the equations ab + a + b = 524 bc + b + c = 146 cd + c + d = 104. What is a − d? Summer 2008 59 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. (A) 4 (B) 6 (C) 8 (D) 10 (E) 12 Solution: We can rewrite the given equations as ab + a + b + 1 = 525 = (a + 1)(b + 1) = 3 · 5 2 · 7 bc + b + c + 1 = 147 = (b + 1)(c + 1) = 3 · 7 2 cd + c + d + 1 = 105 = (c + 1)(d + 1) = 3 · 5 · 7. Since (a + 1)(b + 1) has a factor of 5 2 = 25, but (b + 1)(c + 1) has no factor of 5, (a + 1) must be divisible by 25. Similarly, (d + 1) must be divisible by 5. Since (b + 1)(c + 1) = 3 · 7 2, either (b + 1) = 7 and (c + 1) = 3 · 7 or (b + 1) = 3 · 7 and (c + 1) = 7. If (b + 1) = 7, then (a + 1) = 3 · 25 = 75, but 8! is not divisible by 75. Thus, (b + 1) = 3 · 7 and (c + 1) = 7. Thus a = 24, b = 20, c = 6, and d = 14, so a − d = 10. Example 13.5 Find the smallest positive integer n such that n/2 is a perfect square, n/3 is a perfect cube, and n/5 is a perfect ﬁfth power. Solution: Since n is divisible by 2, 3, and 5, we may assume that it has the form n = 2 a3 b5 c. Then n/2 = 2 a−13 b5 c n/3 = 2 a3 b−15 c n/5 = 2 a3 b5 c−1. Since n/2 must be a perfect square, a − 1, b, and c must all be even. Since n/3 is a perfect cube, a, b − 1, and c must all be multiples of 3. Since n/5 is a perfect ﬁfth power, a, b, and c − 1 must all be multiples of 5. The smallest values that satisfy these conditions are a = 15, b = 10, and c = 6. Thus, n = 2 153 105 6 is the smallest such positive integer. Example 13.6 Show that log10 2 is irrational. Solution: If log10 2 is rational, then there exist integers r, s such that log10 2 = r s . Then 10 r/s = 2, so 10 r = 2 s, Summer 2008 60 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. or 5 r2 r = 2 s, which contradicts the FTA. Thus, log10 2 is irrational. Example 13.7 Find all positive integers n such that 2 8 +2 11 +2 n is a perfect square. Solution: Suppose that k is an integer such that k2 = 2 8 + 2 11 + 2 n = 2304 + 2 n = 48 2 + 2 n. Then k2 − 48 2 = (k − 48)(k + 48) = 2 n. By the FTA, k − 48 = 2 s and k + 48 = 2 t, where s + t = n. But then 2 t − 2 s = 48 − (−48) = 96 = 3 · 2 5, so 2 s(2 t−s − 1) = 3 · 2 5. By the FTA, s = 5 and t − s = 2, so s + t = n = 12. Thus, the only natural number n such that 2 8 + 2 11 + 2 n is a perfect square is n = 12. Summer 2008 61 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 14 Number Bases 14.1 The Decimal (Base-10) Scale. Any natural number n can be written in the form n = a010 k + a110 k−1 + a210 k−2 + · · · + ak−110 + ak where 1 ≤ a0 ≤ 9, 0 ≤ aj ≤ 9, j ≥ 1. This is the decimal, or base-10 representation of n. For example 65789 = 6 · 10 4 + 5 · 10 3 + 7 · 10 2 + 8 · 10 + 9. Example 14.1 Find a reduced fraction equivalent to the repeating decimal 0.123 = 0.123123123 . . . . Solution: Let N = 0.123123123 . . . . Then 1000N = 123.123123123 . . . . Hence 1000N − N = 123, so N = 123 999 = 41 333. Example 14.2 What are all the two-digit positive integers in which the diﬀerence between the integer and the product of its two digits is 12? Solution: Let such an integer be 10a+b, where a, b are digits. Solving 10a+b−ab = 12 for a, we obtain a = 12 − b 10 − b = 1 + 2 10 − b . Since a is an integer, 10 − b must be a positive integer that divides 2. This gives b = 8, a = 2 or b = 9, a = 3. Thus, 28 and 39 are the only such integers. Example 14.3 Find all the integers with initial digit 6 such that if this initial integer is suppressed, the resulting number is 1/25 of the original number. Solution: Let x be the integer sought. Then x = 6 · 10 n + y where y is a positive integer. The given condition stipulates that y = 1 25 (6 · 10 n + y) , that is, y = 10 n 4 = 25 · 10 n−2. This requires n ≥ 2, whence y = 25, 250, 2500, 25000, etc.. Therefore x = 625, 6250, 62500, 625000, etc.. Example 14.4 (1986 IMO) Find all natural numbers x such that the product of their digits (in decimal notation) equals x2 − 10x − 22. Summer 2008 62 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Let x have the form x = a0 + a110 + a210 2 + · · · + an10 n, ak ≤ 9, an ̸= 0. Let P (x) be the product of the digits of x, P (x) = x2 − 10x − 22. Now P (x) = a0a1 · · · an ≤ 9 nan < 10 nan ≤ x, where strict inequality occurs when x has more than one digit. This means that x2 − 10x − 22 ≤ x which implies that x < 13, so x has one digit or x = 10, 11 or 12. Since x2 − 10x − 22 = x has no integral solutions, x cannot have one digit. If x = 10, P (x) = 0, but x2 − 10x − 22 ̸= 0. If x = 11, P (x) = 1, but x2 − 10x − 22 ̸= 1. The only solution is thus x = 12. Example 14.5 (1987 AIME) An ordered pair (m, n) of non-negative integers is called simple if the addition m + n requires no carrying. Find the number of simple ordered pairs of non-negative integers that add to 1492. Solution: Observe that there are d + 1 solutions to x + y = d, where x, y are positive integers and d is a single-digit integer. These are (0 + d), (1 + d − 1), (2 + d − 2), . . . , (d + 0) Since there is no carrying, we search for the numbers of solutions of this form to x + y = 1, u + v = 4, s + t = 9, and a + b = 2. Since each separate solution may combine with any other, the total number of simple pairs is (1 + 1)(4 + 1)(9 + 1)(2 + 1) = 300. Example 14.6 (1992 AIME) For how many pairs of consecutive integers in {1000, 1001, . . . , 2000} is no carrying required when the two integers are added? Solution: Other than 2000, a number on this list has the form n = 1000 + 100a + 10b + c, where a, b, c are digits. If there is no carrying in adding n and n + 1 then n has the form 1999, 1000 + 100a + 10b + 9, 1000 + 100a + 99, 1000 + 100a + 10b + c with 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 4, i.e., ﬁve possible digits. There are 5 3 = 125 integers of the form 1000 + 100a + 10b + c, 0 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 4, 5 2 = 25 integers of the form 1000 + 100a + 10b + 9, 0 ≤ a, b ≤ 4, and 5 integers of the form 1000 + 100a + 99, 0 ≤ a ≤ 4. The total of integers sought is thus 125 + 25 + 5 + 1 = 156. Summer 2008 63 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 14.7 (1992 AIME) Let S be the set of all rational numbers r, 0 < r < 1, that have a repeating decimal expansion of the form 0.abcabcabc . . . = 0.abc, where the digits a, b, c are not necessarily distinct. To write the elements of S as fractions in lowest terms, how many diﬀerent numerators are required? Solution: Observe that 0.abcabcabc . . . = abc 999, and that 999 = 3 3 · 37. If abc is neither divisible by 3 nor by 37, the fraction is already in lowest terms. By Inclusion- Exclusion there are 999 − ( 999 3 + 999 37 ) + 999 3 · 37 = 648 such fractions. Also, fractions of the form s 37 where s is divisible by 3 but not by 37 are in S. There are 12 fractions of this kind (with s = 3, 6, 9, 12, . . . , 36). We do not consider fractions of the form l 3t , t ≤ 3 with l divisible by 37 but not by 3, because these fractions are > 1 and hence not in S. The total number of distinct numerators in the set of reduced fractions is thus 640 + 12 = 660. 14.2 Non-decimal Scales Given any positive integer r > 1, we can express any number x in base r. If n is a positive integer, and r > 1 is an integer, then n has the base-r representation n = a0 + a1r + a2r2 + · · · + akrk, 0 ≤ at ≤ r − 1, ak ̸= 0, rk ≤ n < rk+1. We use the convention that we shall refer to a decimal number (i.e. a base-10 number) without referring to its base, and to a base-r number by using the subindex r. Deﬁnition 14.1 We will refer to the base-2 representation of a number as the bi- nary form of the number. We will refer to the base-3 representation of a number as the ternary form of the number. Example 14.8 Express the decimal number 5213 in base-7. Solution: Observe that 5213 < 7 5. We thus want to ﬁnd 0 ≤ a0, . . . , a4 ≤ 6, a4 ̸= 0 such that 5213 = a47 4 + a37 3 + a27 2 + a17 + a0. Dividing by 74, we obtain 2+ proper fraction = a4+ proper fraction. This means that a4 = 2. Thus 5213 = 2 · 7 4 + a37 3 + a27 2 + a17 + a0 = 4802 + a37 3 + a27 2 + a17 + a0. Summer 2008 64 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Thus, 411 = a37 3 + a27 2 + a17 + a0. Dividing by 7 3, we obtain 1+ proper fraction = a3+ proper fraction, and so a3 = 1. Continuing in this way we ﬁnd that 5213 = 2 · 7 4 + 1 · 7 3 + 1 · 7 2 + 2 · 7 + 5 = 211257. Example 14.9 Rewrite the base-6 number 34256 in base 8. Solution: First, we rewrite the base-6 number 34256 in base-10 representation: 34256 = 3 · 6 3 + 4 · 6 2 + 2 · 6 + 5 = 809. Since 8 2 = 64 and 8 3 = 512, we obtain: 34256 = 809 = 1 · 8 3 + +4 · 8 2 + 5 · 8 + 3 = 14538. Example 14.10 Write 5627 in base-5. Solution: 5627 = 5 · 7 2 + 6 · 7 + 2 = in decimal scale, so the problem reduces to convert 289 to base-ﬁve: 289 = 2 · 5 3 + 1 · 5 2 + 2 · 5 + 4, so 5627 = 289 = 21245. Example 14.11 (1981 AHSME #16) The base-3 representation of x is 121122111222111122223. What is the ﬁrst digit (on the left) of the base-9 representation of x? (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5 Summer 2008 65 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Since 9 = 3 2, we will group the base-3 digits in pairs, starting from the right. Then x = (12)(11)(22)(11)(12)(22)(11)(11)(22)(22)3 = (1 · 3 + 2) · 3 18 + (1 · 3 + 1) · 3 16 + (2 · 3 + 2) · 3 14 + (1 · 3 + 1) · 3 12 +(1 · 3 + 2) · 3 10 + (2 · 3 + 2) · 3 8 + (1 · 3 + 1) · 3 6 + (1 · 3 + 1) · 3 4 +(2 · 3 + 2) · 3 2 + (2 · 3 + 2) = 5 · 9 8 + 4 · 9 7 + 8 · 9 6 + 4 · 9 5 + 5 · 9 4 + 4 · 9 3 + 4 · 9 2 + 8 · 9 1 + 8 = 54845844889. Example 14.12 (1986 AIME) The increasing sequence 1, 3, 4, 9, 10, 12, 13, . . . consists of all those positive integers which are powers of 3 or sums of distinct powers or 3. Find the hundredth term of the sequence. Solution: If the terms of the sequence are written in base-three, they comprise the positive integers which do not contain the digit 2. Thus the terms of the sequence in ascending order are 13, 103, 113, 1003, 1013, 1103, 1113, . . . In the binary scale these numbers are, of course, the ascending natural numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .. Therefore to obtain the 100th term of the sequence we write 100 in binary and then translate this into ternary: 100 = 11001002 and 11001003 = 3 6 + 3 5 + 3 2 = 981. Summer 2008 66 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 15 Modular Arithmetic Deﬁnition 15.1 Given a positive integer n, we say that the integer a is equal to the integer b modulo n, written a ≡ b mod n if n divides a − b. Equivalently, a ≡ b mod n if b is the remainder that results when a is divided by n. For example, 37 ≡ 2 mod 5 and 9 ≡ 1 mod 4. Note also that −11 ≡ 4 mod 3 since −11 − 4 = −15 is divisible by 3. Since n|(a − b) implies that there is an integer k such that nk = a − b, we deduce that a ≡ b mod n if and only if there is an integer k such that a = b + nk. Theorem 15.1 Let n ≥ 2 be an integer. If x ≡ y mod n and u ≡ v mod n then ax + bu ≡ ay + bv mod n. Proof. Since n|(x − y) and n|(u − v), there are integers s and t such that ns = x − y and nt = u − v. This implies that a(x − y) + b(u − v) = n(as + bt), which in turn implies that n|(ax + bu − ay − bv). Thus ax + bu ≡ ay + bv mod n. Corollary 15.2 Let n ≥ 2 be an integer. If x ≡ y mod n and u ≡ v mod n then xu ≡ yv mod n. Proof. Let a = u, b = y in Theorem 15.1. Summer 2008 67 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Corollary 15.3 Let n > 1 be an integer, x ≡ y mod n and j a positive integer. Then xj ≡ yj mod n. Proof. Use Corollary 15.2 repeatedly with u = x, v = y. Corollary 15.4 Let n > 1 be an integer, x ≡ y mod n. If f is a polynomial with integral coeﬃcients then f (x) ≡ f (y) mod n. Example 15.1 Find the units digit of 7 100. Solution: To ﬁnd the units digit of 7 100, we must ﬁnd 7 100 modulo 10. 7 2 ≡ −1 mod 10 7 3 ≡ 7 · 7 2 mod 10 ≡ −7 mod 10 7 4 ≡ (7 2) 2 mod 10 ≡ (−1) 2 mod 10 ≡ 1 mod 10 7 100 ≡ (7 4) 25 mod 10 ≡ 1 25 mod 10 ≡ 1 mod 10. Thus, the units digit of 7 100 is 1. Example 15.2 Find the remainder when 6 1987 is divided by 37. Solution: 6 2 ≡ −1 mod 37. Thus 6 1987 ≡ 6 · 6 1986 ≡ 6(6 2) 993 ≡ 6(−1) 993 ≡ −6 ≡ 31 mod 37 and the remainder sought is 31. Example 15.3 Find the remainder when 12233 · 455679 + 87653 3 is divided by 4. Solution:12233 = 12200 + 32 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4. Similarly, 455679 = 455600 + 76 + 3 ≡ 3, 87653 = 87600 + 52 + 1 ≡ 1 mod 4. Thus 12233 · 455679 + 87653 3 ≡ 1 · 3 + 1 3 ≡ 4 ≡ 0 mod 4. Summer 2008 68 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. This means that 12233 · 455679 + 87653 3 is divisible by 4. Example 15.4 Prove that 7 divides 32n+1 + 2 n+2 for all natural numbers n. Solution: Observe that 3 2n+1 ≡ 3 · 9 n ≡ 3 · 2 n mod 7 and 2 n+2 ≡ 4 · 2 n mod 7 . Hence 3 2n+1 + 2 n+2 ≡ 7 · 2 n ≡ 0 mod 7, for all natural numbers n. Example 15.5 Prove the following result of Euler: 641|(2 32 + 1). Solution: Observe that 641 = 2 7 · 5 + 1 = 2 4 + 54. Hence 27 · 5 ≡ −1 mod 641 and 5 4 ≡ −2 4 mod 641. Now, 2 7 · 5 ≡ −1 mod 641 yields 5 4 · 2 28 = (5 · 2 7) 4 ≡ (−1) 4 ≡ 1 mod 641. This last congruence and 5 4 ≡ −2 4 mod 641 yield −2 4 · 2 28 ≡ 1 mod 641, which means that 641|(2 32 + 1). Example 15.6 Prove that 7|(2222 5555 + 5555 2222). Solution: 2222 ≡ 3 mod 7, 5555 ≡ 4 mod 7 and 3 5 ≡ 5 mod 7. Now 2222 5555 + 5555 2222 ≡ 3 5555 + 4 2222 ≡ (3 5) 1111 + (4 2) 1111 ≡ 5 1111 − 5 1111 ≡ 0 mod 7. Example 15.7 Find the units digit of 7 77. Solution: We must ﬁnd 7 77 mod 10. Now, 7 2 ≡ −1 mod 10, and so 7 3 ≡ 7 2 · 7 ≡ −7 ≡ 3 mod 10 and 7 4 ≡ (7 2) 2 ≡ 1 mod 10. Also, 7 2 ≡ 1 mod 4 and so 7 7 ≡ (7 2) 3 · 7 ≡ 3 mod 4, which means that there is an integer t such that 7 7 = 3 + 4t. Upon assembling all this, 7 77 ≡ 7 4t+3 ≡ (7 4) t · 7 3 ≡ 1 t · 3 ≡ 3 mod 10. Thus the last digit is 3. Example 15.8 Find inﬁnitely many integers n such that 2 n + 27 is divisible by 7. Summer 2008 69 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Observe that 2 1 ≡ 2, 2 2 ≡ 4, 2 3 ≡ 1, 2 4 ≡ 2, 2 5 ≡ 4, 2 6 ≡ 1 mod 7 and so 2 3k ≡ 1 mod 3 for all positive integers k. Hence 2 3k + 27 ≡ 1 + 27 ≡ 0 mod 7 for all positive integers k. This produces the inﬁnitely many values sought. Example 15.9 Prove that 2 k − 5, k = 0, 1, 2, . . . never leaves remainder 1 when divided by 7. Solution: 2 1 ≡ 2, 2 2 ≡ 4, 2 3 ≡ 1 mod 7, and this cycle of three repeats. Thus 2 k − 5 can leave only remainders 3, 4, or 6 upon division by 7. Example 15.10 (1994 AIME) The increasing sequence 3, 15, 24, 48, . . . , consists of those positive multiples of 3 that are one less than a perfect square. What is the remainder when the 1994-th term of the sequence is divided by 1000? Solution: The sequence consists of numbers n2 − 1 such that 3|(n2 − 1) = (n − 1)(n + 1). Since 3 is prime, this implies that 3 | (n − 1) or 3 | (n + 1). Thus, n = 3k + 1 or n = 3k − 1, where k = 1, 2, 3, . . .. The sequence 3k + 1, k = 1, 2, . . . produces the terms n2 − 1 = (3k + 1)2 − 1 = 15, 48, . . . , which are the terms at even places of the sequence of 3, 15, 24, 48, . . .. The sequence 3k − 1, k = 1, 2, . . . produces the terms n2 − 1 = (3k − 1) 2 − 1 = 3, 24, . . . , which are the terms at odd places of the sequence 3, 15, 24, 48, . . .. We must ﬁnd the 997th term of the sequence 3k + 1, k = 1, 2, . . .. Thus, the term sought is (3(997) + 1) 2 − 1 ≡ (3(−3) + 1) 2 − 1 ≡ 8 2 − 1 ≡ 63 mod 1000. The remainder sought is thus 63. Example 15.11 Find the remainder when 3 2006 is divided by 8. Summer 2008 70 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Since 3 2 = 9, we have 3 2 ≡ 1 mod 8. This implies that 3 2006 ≡ (3 2)1003 mod 8 ≡ 1 1003 mod 8 ≡ 1 mod 8. Thus, the remainder is 1. Example 15.12 Find the remainder when 3 2006 is divided by 11. Solution: First, note that 3 5 = 243 ≡ 1 mod 11. Thus 3 2006 ≡ 3 2005 · 3 mod 11 ≡ (3 5)401 · 3 mod 11 ≡ 1 401 · 3 mod 11 ≡ 3 mod 11. Thus, the remainder is 3. Example 15.13 (1999 AHSME #25) There are unique integers a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7 such that 5 7 = a2 2! + a3 3! + a4 4! + a5 5! + a6 6! + a7 7! , where 0 ≤ ai ≤ i for i = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. What is a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7? (A) 8 (B) 9 (C) 10 (D) 11 (E) 12 Solution: First, multiply both sides of the equation by 7! to clear the denominators: 5 · 6! = a2(7 · 6 · 5 · 4 · 3) + a3(7 · 6 · 5 · 4) + a4(7 · 6 · 5) + a5(7 · 6) + a6 · +a7. Consider this equation modulo 7. We obtain a7 ≡ 5 · 6! mod 7 ≡ 2 mod 7. Since 0 ≤ a7 > 7, we conclude that a7 = 2. Next, consider the equation modulo 6. We obtain a6 = 4. Continuing, we obtain a5 = 0 and a4 = a3 = a2 = 1. Thus, a2 + a3 + a4 + a5 + a6 + a7 = 9. Example 15.14 Prove that a sum of two squares of integers leaves remainder 0, 1 or 2 when divided by 4. Summer 2008 71 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: An integer is either even (of the form 2k) or odd (of the form 2k + 1). We have (2k) 2 = 4(k2), (2k + 1)2 = 4(k2 + k) + 1. Thus squares leave remainder 0 or 1 when divided by 4 and hence their sum leave remainder 0, 1, or 2. Example 15.15 Prove that 2003 is not the sum of two squares by proving that the sum of any two squares cannot leave remainder 3 upon division by 4. Solution: 2003 leaves remainder 3 upon division by 4. But we know from example 15.14 that sums of squares do not leave remainder 3 upon division by 4, so it is impossible to write 2003 as the sum of squares. Summer 2008 72 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 16 Integer Division Results Using modular arithmetic, we obtain the following techniques for determining certain integer factors of numbers. Theorem 16.1 Theorem: Integer Division Results. Let n be a positive integer. Then: • n is divisible by 2 if and only if the units digit of n is even. • n is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. • n is divisible by 5 if and only if the units digit of n is a 0 or a 5. • n is divisible by 7 if and only if 7 divides the integer that results from ﬁrst truncating n by removing its units digit, and then subtracting twice the value of this digit from the truncated integer. • n is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. • n is divisible by 11 if and only if the alternating (by positive and negative signs) sum of its digits is divisible by 11. Proof. • The division results by 2 and 5 should be clear. • Let’s consider the situation of division by 3. Suppose that the positive integer n is written in its decimal expansion as n = ak · 10 k + ak−110 k−1 + · + a2 · 10 2 + a1 · 10 + a0. Since 10 ≡ 1 mod 3, for any positive integer j we have 10 j ≡ 1 j ≡ 1 mod 3. Thus, n ≡ (ak + ak−1 + · · · + a2 + a1 + a0) mod 3. So the remainder when n is divisible by 3 is the same as the remainder when the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. This remainder is 0 if and only if 3 divides n. • Since 10 ≡ 1 mod 9, and 10 j ≡ 1 j ≡ 1 mod 9, the proof for divisibility by 9 is analogous to the proof for divisibility by 3. • The divisibility by 11 result follows from the observation that 10 ≡ −1 mod 11, so for any positive integer j, we have 10 j ≡ (−1) j mod 11. Summer 2008 73 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. • Finally, we’ll consider the divisibility by 7 results. First, we can show that the result is always true provided that it is true for all integers with at most 6 digits, i.e. when n = a5 · 10 5 + a4 · 10 4 + a3 · 10 3 + a2 · 10 2 + a1 · 10 + a0. Then we note that since 10 ≡ 3 mod 7, we have 10 2 ≡ 2 mod 7, 10 3 ≡ 6 mod 7, 10 4 ≡ 4 mod 7, and 10 5 ≡ 5 mod 7. Now suppose that n ≡ b mod 7, where 0 ≤ b ≤ 6. Then n ≡ b ≡ (5a5 + 4a4 + 3a3 + 2a2 + 3a1 + a0) mod 7, so that a0 ≡ (b − (5a5 + 4a4 + 3a3 + 2a2 + 3a1)) mod 7. Now consider the reduced number, which has the form n1 = a5 · 10 4 + a4 · 10 3 + a3 · 10 2 + a2 · 10 + a1 − 2a0. To see that 7 also divides n1 if and only if b = 0, note that n1 ≡ (4a5 + 6a4 + 2a3 + 3a2 + a1) mod 7 ≡ (4a5 + 6a4 + 2a3 + 3a2 + a1 − 2b + 2(5a5 + 4a4 + 6a3 + 2a2 + 3a1) mod 7 ≡ 14a5 + 14a4 + 14a3 + 7a2 + 7a1 − 2b mod 7 ≡ −2b mod 7. Now, 7 divides n if and only if b = 0. But b = 0 if and only if −2b = 0, which implies that 7 divides n if and only if 7 divides n1. As an example of this result, consider the integer n = 2233. The reduced integer is n1 = 223 − 2 · 3 = 217, and the reduced integer for 217 is n2 = 21 − 2 · 7 = 7. Since 7 divides 7, 7 also divides 217, which implies that 7 also divides 2233.

If n + 1 objects (e.g. pigeons) are to be placed in n boxes (e.g. pigeonholes), then there must be at least one box that contains more than one of the objects. Note: This apparently trivial principle is very powerful. For example, it can be used to prove that in any group of 13 people, there are always two who have their birthday on the same month, and if the average human head has two million hairs, there are at least three people in NYC with the same number of hairs on their head. The Pigeonhole Principle is frequently useful for problems in which we need to determine a minimal number of objects to ensure that some integral number property is satisﬁed. Theorem 17.2 The Extended Pigeonhole Principle. If more than mk objects are to be placed in k boxes, then at least one of the boxes must contain at least m + 1 objects. Example 17.1 Suppose that we draw cards consecutively and without replacement from a 52 card deck. How many do we need to draw to ensure that there will be a pair? Solution: We can consider as boxes (the pigeonholes) the possible values of the cards (the pigeons). Then there are 13 boxes, 10 of which represent the cards numbered 1 (or Ace) through 10, and three additional boxes representing Jacks, Queens, and Kings. In order to guarantee that one box contains more than one card, we must draw 13 + 1 = 14 total cards. Example 17.2 Prove that among any set of 51 positive integers less than 100, there is a pair whose sum is 100. Solution: Let a1, a2, . . . , a51 denote these 51 positive integers. Let S1 = {1, 99}, S2 = {2, 98}, S3 = {3, 97}, . . . , Sk = {k, 100 − k}, . . . , S49 = {49, 51}, S50 = {50}. Let S1, S2, . . . , S50 be the pigeonholes, and a1, a2, . . . , a51 the pigeons. Since there are 51 pigeons and 50 pigeonholes, there must be at least one pigeonhole with more than one pigeon. Thus, there must be at least one Si with two numbers in it. Their sum is 100. Example 17.3 Show that amongst any seven distinct positive integers not exceeding 126, one can ﬁnd two of them, say a and b, which satisfy b < a ≤ 2b. Summer 2008 75 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Solution: Split the numbers {1, 2, 3, . . . , 126} into the six sets {1, 2}, {3, 4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, . . . , 13, 14}, {15, 16, . . . , 29, 30}, {31, 32, . . . , 61, 62} and {63, 64, . . . , 126}. By the Pigeonhole Principle, two of the seven numbers must lie in one of the six sets, and obviously, any such two will satisfy the stated inequality. Example 17.4 Show that amongst any 55 integers from {1, 2, . . . , 100}, two must diﬀer by 10. Solution: First observe that if we choose n + 1 integers from any string of 2n consecutive integers, there will always be some two that diﬀer by n. This is because we can pair the 2n consecutive integers {a + 1, a + 2, a + 3, . . . , a + 2n} into the n pairs {a + 1, a + n + 1}, {a + 2, a + n + 2}, . . . , {a + n, a + 2n}, and if n + 1 integers are chosen from this, there must be two that belong to the same group. So now group the one hundred integers as follows: {1, 2, . . . 20}, {21, 22, . . . , 40}, {41, 42, . . . , 60}, {61, 62, . . . , 80} and {81, 82, . . . , 100}. If we select ﬁfty ﬁve integers, we must perforce choose eleven from some group. From that group, by the above observation (let n = 10), there must be two that diﬀer by 10. Example 17.5 (1978 Putnam) Let A be any set of twenty integers chosen from the arithmetic progression 1, 4, . . . , 100. Prove that there must be two distinct integers in A whose sum is 104. Solution: We partition the thirty four elements of this progression into nineteen groups {1}, {52}, {4, 100}, {7, 97}, {10, 94}, . . . , {49, 55}. Since we are choosing twenty integers and we have nineteen sets, by the Pigeonhole Principle there must be two integers that belong to one of the pairs, which add to 104. Summer 2008 76 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 17.6 (1964 IMO) Seventeen people correspond by mail with one another— each one with all the rest. In their letters only three diﬀerent topics are discussed. Each pair of correspondents deals with only one of these topics. Prove that there at least three people who write to each other about the same topic. Solution: Choose a particular person of the group, say Charlie. He corresponds with sixteen others. By the Pigeonhole Principle, Charlie must write to at least six of the people of one topic, say topic I. If any pair of these six people corresponds on topic I, then Charlie and this pair do the trick, and we are done. Otherwise, these six correspond amongst themselves only on topics II or III. Choose a particular person from this group of six, say Eric. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there must be three of the ﬁve remaining that correspond with Eric in one of the topics, say topic II. If amongst these three there is a pair that corresponds with each other on topic II, then Eric and this pair correspond on topic II, and we are done. Otherwise, these three people only correspond with one another on topic III, and we are done again. Example 17.7 Given any set of ten natural numbers between 1 and 99 inclusive, prove that there are two disjoint nonempty subsets of the set with equal sums of their elements. Solution: There are 210−1 = 1023 non-empty subsets that one can form with a given 10-element set. To each of these subsets we associate the sum of its elements. The maximum value that any such sum can achieve is 90 + 91 + · · · + 99 = 945 < 1023. Therefore, there must be at least two diﬀerent subsets S, T that have the same element sum. Then S \\ (S ∩ T ) and T \\ (S ∩ T ) also have the same element sum. Example 17.8 Given any 9 integers whose prime factors lie in the set {3, 7, 11} prove that there must be two whose product is a square. Solution: For an integer to be a square, all the exponents of its prime factorization must be even. Any integer in the given set has a prime factorization of the form 3 a7 b11 c. Now each triplet (a, b, c) has one of the following 8 parity patterns: (even, even, even), (even, even, odd), (even, odd, even), (even, odd, odd), (odd, even, even), (odd, even, odd), (odd, odd, even), (odd, odd, odd). In a group of 9 such integers, there must be two with the same parity patterns in the exponents. Take these two. Their product is a square, since the sum of each corresponding exponent will be even. Deﬁnition 17.1 A lattice point (m, n) on the plane is one having integer coordinates. Deﬁnition 17.2 The midpoint of the line joining (x, y) to (x1, y1) is the point ( x + x1 2 , y + y1 2 ) . Summer 2008 77 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Example 17.9 Five lattice points are chosen at random. Prove that one can always ﬁnd two so that the midpoint of the line joining them is also a lattice point. Solution: There are four parity patterns: (even, even), (even, odd), (odd, odd), (odd, even). By the Pigeonhole Principle among ﬁve lattice points there must be two having the same parity pattern. Choose these two. It is clear that their midpoint is an integer. Example 17.10 Prove that among n + 1 integers, there are always two whose dif- ference is always divisible by n. Solution: There are n possible diﬀerent remainders when an integer is divided by n, so among n + 1 diﬀerent integers there must be two integers in the group leaving the same remainder, and their diﬀerence is divisible by n.

Solution: Assume that 6 − √35 ≥ 1 10. Then 6 − 1 10 ≥ √35 or 59 ≥ 10 √35. Squar- ing both sides we obtain 3481 ≥ 3500, which is clearly nonsense. Thus it must be the case that 6 − √35 < 1 10. In a proof by contradiction (or reductio ad absurdum), we assume, along with the hypotheses, the logical negation of the statement that we are trying to prove, and then reach some kind of contradiction. Upon reaching a contradiction, we conclude that the original assumption (i.e. the negation of the statement we are trying to prove) is false, and thus the statement that we are trying to prove must be true. Example 18.2 Prove that √2 is irrational. Solution #1: Assume that √2 is rational, i.e. that √2 = a b , with positive integers a, b. This yields 2b2 = a 2. Now both a 2 and b2 have an even number of prime factors. So 2b2 has an odd number of primes in its factorization and a 2 has an even number of primes in its factorization. This is a contradiction, as we have seen that every integer has a unique prime factorization. Thus, √2 is irrational. Solution #2: Assume that √2 is rational, i.e. that √2 = a b , where the fraction a b is in lowest terms. Then 2b2 = a 2, so a2 must be even. Thus, a must be even as well (if a were odd, then a 2 would also be odd). Thus, a must be equal to 2 times an integer, so we can write a = 2t for some positive integer t. Then 2b2 = a 2 = (2t) 2 = 4t 2, so b2 = 2t 2. Thus b2 is even, so b must be even as well. But this is a contradiction, since the fraction a b is in lowest terms. Thus, √2 is irrational. Example 18.3 Prove that there are no positive integer solutions to the equation x2 − y2 = 1. Solution: Assume that there is a solution (x, y) where x and y are positive integers. Then we can factor the left-hand side of the equation to obtain (x − y)(x + y) = 1. Since x and y are both positive integers, x − y and x + y are integers. Thus, x − y = 1 and x + y = 1 or x − y = −1 and x + y = −1. In the ﬁrst case, we add the two equations to obtain x = 1 and y = 0, which contradicts the assumption that x and y Summer 2008 79 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. are both positive. In the second case, we add the two equations to obtain x = −1 and y = 0, which is again a contradiction. Thus, there are no positive integer solutions to the equation x2 − y2 = 1. Example 18.4 Let a1, a2, . . . , an be an arbitrary permutation of the numbers 1, 2, . . . , n, where n is an odd number. Prove that the product (a1 − 1)(a2 − 2) · · · (an − n) is even. Solution: It is enough to prove that some diﬀerence ak − k is even. Assume that all the diﬀerences ak − k are odd. Clearly S = (a1 − 1) + (a2 − 2) + · · · + (an − n) = 0, since the ak’s are a reordering of 1, 2, . . . , n. S is an odd number of summands of odd integers adding to the even integer 0. This is impossible. Our initial assumption that all the ak − k are odd is wrong, so one of these is even and hence the product is even. Example 18.5 Let a, b be real numbers and assume that for all numbers ϵ > 0 the following inequality holds: a < b + ϵ. Prove that a ≤ b. Solution: Assume that a > b. Hence a − b 2 > 0. Since the inequality a < b + ϵ holds for every ϵ > 0 in particular it holds for ϵ = a − b 2 . This implies that a < b + a − b 2 , so a < b. This is a contradiction, so we conclude that a ≤ b. Example 18.6 (Euclid) Show that there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers. Solution: The following beautiful proof is attributed to Euclid. Assume that there are only ﬁnitely many (say, n) prime numbers. Then {p1, p2, . . . , pn} is a list that exhausts all the primes. Consider the number N = p1p2 · · · pn + 1. Summer 2008 80 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. This is a positive integer, clearly greater than 1. Observe that none of the primes on the list {p1, p2, . . . , pn} divides N , since division by any of these primes leaves a remainder of 1. Since N is larger than any of the primes on this list, it is either a prime or divisible by a prime outside this list. Thus we have shown that the assumption that any ﬁnite list of primes leads to the existence of a prime outside this list, so we have reached a contradiction. This implies that the number of primes is inﬁnite. Example 18.7 Let n > 1 be a composite integer. Prove that n has a prime factor p ≤ √n. Solution: Since n is composite, n can be written as n = ab where both a > 1, b > 1 are integers. Now, if both a > √n and b > √n then n = ab > √n√n = n, a contradiction. Thus one of these factors must be ≤ √n and it must have a prime factor ≤ √n. Example 18.8 If a, b, c are odd integers, prove that ax2 + bx + c = 0 does not have a rational number solution. Solution: Suppose p q is a rational solution to the equation. We may assume that p and q have no prime factors in common, so either p and q are both odd, or one is odd and the other even. Now a ( p q )2 + b ( p q ) + c = 0 =⇒ ap2 + bpq + cq2 = 0. If both p and p were odd, then ap2 + bpq + cq2 is also odd and hence ̸= 0. Similarly if one of them is even and the other odd then either ap2 + bpq or bpq + cq2 is even and ap2 + bpq + cq2 is odd. This contradiction proves that the equation cannot have a rational root.

For example, induction can be used to prove the following: • The sum of the interior angles of any n-gon is 180(n − 2) degrees. • The inequality n! > 2 n is true for all integers n ≥ 4. • 7 n − 1 is divisible by 6 for all integers n ≥ 1. Each assertion can be put in the form: P(n) is true for all integersn ≥ n0, where P (n) is a statement involving the integer n, and n0 is the starting point, or base case. For example, for the third assertion, P (n) is the statement 7 n − 1 is divisible by 6, and the base case is n0 = 1. Here’s how induction works: 1. First, establish the truth of P (n0). This is called the base case. 2. Next, assume that P (n) is true for some integer n. This is called the induc- tive hypothesis. Then, show that the inductive hypothesis implies that the statement P (n + 1) must also be true. Observe that these two steps are suﬃcient to prove that P (n) is true for all integers n ≥ n0, as P (n0) is true by step (1), and step (2) then implies that P (n0 + 1) is true, which implies that P (n0 + 2) is true, etc. You can think of induction in the following way. Suppose that you have arranged inﬁnitely many dominos in a line, corresponding to statements P (1), P (2), P (3), . . .. If you make the ﬁrst domino fall, then you can be sure that all of the dominos will fall, provided that whenever one domino falls, it will knock down its neighbor. Knocking the ﬁrst domino down is analogous to establishing the base case. Showing that each falling domino knocks down its neighbor is equivalent to showing that P (n) implies P (n + 1). Example 19.1 Prove that n! > 2 n for all integers n ≥ 4. Solution: P (n) is the statement n! > 2 n. The base case is n0 = 4. (i) Base case. 4! = 24 > 2 4 = 16, so the base case P (4) is true. (ii) Inductive hypothesis. Assume that n! > 2 n. We must use this assumption to prove that (n + 1)! > 2 n+1. The left-hand side of the inductive hypothesis is n!, and the left-hand side of the statement that we want to prove is (n + 1)! = (n + Summer 2008 82 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. 1)n!. Thus, it seems natural to multiply both sides of the inductive hypothesis by (n + 1). n! > 2 n (n + 1)n! > (n + 1)2 n (n + 1)! > (n + 1)2 n. Finally, note that (n + 1) > 2, so (n + 1)! > (n + 1)2 n > 2 · 2 n > 2 n+1, so we conclude that (n + 1)! > 2 n+1, as needed. Thus, n! > 2 n for all integers n ≥ 4. Example 19.2 Prove that the expression 3 3n+3 − 26n − 27 is a multiple of 169 for all natural numbers n. Solution: P (n) is the assertion 3 3n+3 − 26n − 27 is a multiple of 169, and the base case is n0 = 1. (i) Base case. Observe that 3 3(1)+3 − 26(1) − 27 = 676 = 4(169) so P (1) is true. (ii) Inductive hypothesis. Assume that P (n) is true, i.e. that is, that there is an integer M such that 3 3n+3 − 26n − 27 = 169M. We must prove that there is an integer K so that 3 3(n+1)+3 − 26(n + 1) − 27 = 169K. We have: 3 3(n+1)+3 − 26(n + 1) − 27 = 3 3n+3+3 − 26n − 26 − 27 = 27(3 3n+3) − 26n − 27 − 26 = 27(3 3n+3) − 26n − 26(26n) − 27 − 26(27) + 26(26n) + 26(27) − 26 = 27(3 3n+3 − 26n − 27) + 676n + 676 = 27(169M ) + 169 · 4n + 169 · 4 = 169(27M + 4n + 4). Summer 2008 83 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. Thus, 3 3n+3 − 26n − 27 is a multiple of 169 for all natural numbers n. Example 19.3 Prove that if k is odd, then 2 n+2 divides k2n − 1 for all natural numbers n. Solution: Let k be odd. P (n) is the statement that 2 n+2 is a divisor of k2n − 1, and the base case is n0 = 1. (i) Base case. k2 − 1 = (k − 1)(k + 1) is divisible by 8 for any odd natural number k since k−1 and k+1 are consecutive even integers. (ii) Inductive hypothesis. Assume that 2 n+2a = k2n − 1 for some integer a. Then k2n+1 − 1 = (k2n − 1)(k2n + 1) = 2 n+2a(k2n + 1). Since k is odd, k2n + 1 is even and so k2n + 1 = 2b for some integer b. This gives k2n+1 − 1 = 2 n+2a(k2n + 1) = 2 n+3ab, and so the assertion follows by induction. Example 19.4 The Fibonacci Numbers are given by f0 = 1, f1 = 1, fn+1 = fn + fn−1, n ≥ 1, that is every number after the second one is the sum of the preceding two. The ﬁrst several terms of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, . . . . Prove that for all integers n ≥ 1, fn−1fn+1 = f 2 n + (−1) n+1. Solution: P (n) is the statement that fn−1fn+1 = f 2 n + (−1) n+1 and the base case is n0 = 1. (i) Base case. If n = 1, then 2 = f0f2 = 1 2 + (−1) 2 = f 2 1 + (−1) 1+1. (ii) Inductive hypothesis. Assume that fn−1fn+1 = f 2 n + (−1) n+1. Then, using the fact that fn+2 = fn + fn+1, we have Summer 2008 84 paquin@math.stanford.edu Stanford University EPGY Math Olympiad. fnfn+2 = fn(fn + fn+1) = f 2 n + fnfn+1 = fn−1fn+1 − (−1) n+1 + fnfn+1 = fn+1(fn−1 + fn) + (−1) n+2 = f 2 n+1 + (−1) n+2, which establishes the assertion by induction. Example 19.5 Prove that n5 5 + n4 2 + n3 3 − n 30 is an integer for all integers n ≥ 0. Solution: P (n) is the statement that n5 5 + n4 2 + n3 3 − n 30 is an integer and the base case is n0 = 0. (i) Base case. Since 0 is an integer, the statement is clearly true when n = 0. (ii) Inductive hypothesis. Assume that n5 5 + n4 2 + n3 3 − n 30 is an integer. We must show that (n + 1)5 5 + (n + 1)4 2 + (n + 1)3 3 − n + 1 30 is also an integer. We have: (n+1)5 5 + (n+1)4 2 + (n+1)3 3 − n+1 30 = n5+5n4+10n3+10n2+5n+1 5 + n4+4n3+6n2+4n+1 2 + n3+3n2+3n+1 3 − n+1 30 [ n5 5 + n4 2 + n3 3 − n 30 ] + [n4 + 2n3 + 2n2 + n + 2n3 + 3n2 + 2n + n2 + n] , which is an integer by the inductive hypothesis and since the second grouping is a sum of integers.
