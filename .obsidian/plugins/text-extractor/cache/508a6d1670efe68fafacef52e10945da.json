Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle and let D be an interior point of the line segment BC. Let the circumcircle of triangle ACD intersect AB at E (E between A and B) and let the circumcircle of triangle ABD intersect AC at F (F between A and C). Let O be the circumcentre of triangle AEF . Prove that OD bisects ∠EDF . Solution: Observe that ACDE is a cyclic quadrilateral. Hence ∠BDE = ∠EAC = ∠A. Similarly, the cyclicity of ABDF gives ∠CDF = ∠F AB = ∠A. We also have ∠EDF = 180 ◦ − ∠BDE − ∠CDF = 180 ◦ − 2∠A. Since ∠A is acute, O and D lie on the opposite sides of EF . Hence ∠EOF = 2∠A. Therefore ∠EDF + ∠EOF = 180 ◦, so that EOF D is a cyclic quadrilateral. Since OE = OF , we have ∠OEF = ∠OF E. Finally, the cyclicity of EOF D gives ∠ODE = ∠OF E = ∠OEF = ∠ODF. This shows that OD bisects ∠EDF . 2. Find the set of all real values of a for which the real polynomial equation P (x) = x2 −2ax+b = 0 has real roots given that P (0)·P (1)·P (2) ̸= 0 and P (0), P (1), P (2) form a geometric progression. Solution: Since none of P (0), P (1), P (2) is zero, we have P (1) 2 = P (0)P (2). Observe that P (0) = b, P (1) = 1−2a+b and P (2) = 4−4a+b. Therefore we obtain (1−2a+b) 2 = b(4−4a+b). This simpliﬁes to (2a − 1)2 = 2b. Now P (x) = 0 has real roots if and only if 4a 2 ≥ 4b. Hence 2a 2 ≥ 2b = (2a − 1)2. This reduces to 2a 2 − 4a + 1 ≤ 0. Consider the quadratic equation 2X 2 − 4X + 1 = 0. This has two roots α = 2 + √2 2 , β = 2 − √2 2 . Hence 2a 2 − 4a + 1 ≤ 0 if and only if a lies in the interval [ 2−√2 2 , 2+ √2 2 ] . 3. Show that there are inﬁnitely many 4-tuples (a, b, c, d) of natural numbers such that a 3+b4+c 5 = d 7. Solution: Observe that lcm(3, 4, 5) = 60. We look for a solution in the form a 3 = b 4 = c 5 = l60k. We choose l, k such that the condition is satisﬁed. The given equation gives 3l60k = d 7. This suggests choosing l = 3 so that 360k+1 = d7. Now we take care of k by choosing k such that 7 divides 60k + 1. For example we can take k = 5 so that 301 = 7 × 43. Thus we get 3300 + 3300 + 3300 = 3 301. Choose a = 3 100, b = 3 75 , c = 3 60 and d = 3 43. Then we get a 3 + b 4 + c5 = d7. This gives one solution. This suggests choosing a = 3 100 · m 140, b = 3 75 · m105, c = 3 60 · m84 and d = 3 43 · m 60. We see that a 3 + b4 + c 5 = 3 300 · m420 + 3300 · m420 + 3300 · m420 = m 4203 301 = (3 43 · m 60) 7 = d7. We can give diﬀerent values for m and get inﬁnitely many solutions of the equation. 4. Suppose 100 points in the plane are coloured using two colours, red and white, such that each red point is the centre of a circle passing through at least three white points. What is the least possible number of white points? Solution: Let n be the number of white points. Then we can draw at most (n 3) circles. Thus the number of white and red points together is at most n + (n 3). We observe that 9 + (9 3 ) = 93, 10 + ( 10 3 ) = 130. Thus n ≥ 10. We show that n = 10 works. Take any 10 points such that no three are collinear and no four are concyclic. Then we get(10 3 ) = 120 points as centre of distinct circles. Among these, there may be some points from the original 10 points. Even if we leave out these 10 points, we have at least 110 points which are centres of circles formed by the ten points we have chosen. Choose any 90 points from them and colour them red and colour the original 10 points white. We get 100 points of which 10 are white and remaining 90 are red. Each of these 90 red points is the centre of a circle passing through some three white points. 5. n a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD with circumcentre O, the diagonals AC and BD intersect at X. Let the circumcircles of triangles AXD and BXC intersect at Y . Let the circumcircles of triangles AXB and CXD intersect at Z. If O lies inside ABCD and if the points O, X, Y , Z are all distinct, prove that O, X, Y , Z lie on a circle. Solution: Observe that ∠AY B = 360 ◦ − ∠AY X − ∠XY B = (180◦ − ∠AY X) + (180◦ − XY B) = ∠XDA + ∠XCB = 2∠ACB = ∠AOB. It follows that A, B, O, Y are concyclic. Similarly, ∠CZB = 360◦ − ∠CZX − ∠XZB = (180◦ − ∠CZX) + (180 − ∠XZB) = ∠CDX + ∠XAB = ∠COB, so that C, Z, O, B are concyclic. We have ∠XY O = 360 ◦ − ∠XY A − ∠AY O = (180 ◦ − ∠XY A) + (180◦ − ∠AY O) = ∠AOB 2 + (90 ◦ − ∠AOB 2 ) = 90 ◦. Similarly, we can show that ∠XZO = 90 ◦. It follows that X, Y, O, Z are concyclic. 2 6. Deﬁne a sequence ⟨an⟩n≥1 of real numbers by a1 = 2, an+1 = a 2 n + 1 2 , for n ≥ 1. Prove that N∑ j=1 1 aj + 1 < 1 for every natural number N . Solution: If N = 1, then the sum is just 1/(a1 + 1) = 1/3 < 1. Hence we may assume that N > 1. It is easy to see recursively (that is using induction) that aj > 1 for all j. We observe that aj+1 − aj = a 2 j + 1 2 − aj = (aj − 1) 2 2 ; aj+1 − 1 = a 2 j + 1 2 − 1 = a 2 j − 1 2 = (aj − 1)(aj + 1) 2 . Hence 1 aj + 1 = 1 2 ( aj − 1 aj+1 − 1 ) , for all j ≥ 1. Therefore N∑ j=1 1 aj + 1 = 1 2 N∑ j=1 aj − 1 aj+1 − 1 = 1 2 N∑ j=1 (aj − 1) 2 (aj+1 − 1)(aj − 1) = N∑ j=1 aj+1 − aj (aj+1 − 1)(aj − 1) = N∑ j=1 ( 1 aj − 1 − 1 aj+1 − 1 ) = 1 a1 − 1 − 1 aN +1 − 1 < 1 a1 − 1 = 1. ———-0———- 3","libVersion":"0.3.1","langs":""}
